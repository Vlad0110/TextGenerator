forward the foundation    by isaac asimov      part      eto demerzel         hari   said yugo amaryl   that your friend demerzel is in deep trouble .   he emphasized the word  friend  very lightly and with unmistakable air of distaste .   hari seldon detected the sour note and ignored it .  he looked up from his tricomputer and said   i tell you again  yugo  that that s nonsense .   and then with a trace of annoyance  just a trace he added   why are you taking up my time by insisting .     because i think it s important .   amaryl sat down defiantly .  it was a gesture that indicated he was not going to be moved easily .  here he was and here he would stay .   eight years before  he had been a heatsinker in the dahl sector as low on the social scale as it was possible to be .  he had been lifted out of that position by seldon made into a mathematician and an intellectual more than that  into a psychohistorian .   never for one minute did he forget what he had been and who he was now and to whom he owed the change .  that meant that if he had to speak harshly to hari seldon for seldon s own good no consideration of respect and love for the older man and no regard for his own career would stop him .  he owed such harshness and much more to seldon .    look  hari   he said  chopping at the air with his left hand   for some reason that is beyond my understanding  you think highly of this demerzel  but i don t .  no one whose opinion i respect except you thinks well of him .  i don t care what happens to him personally  hari  but as long as i think you do  i have no choice but to bring this to your attention .    seldon smiled  as much at the other s earnestness as at what he considered to be the uselessness of his concern .  he was fond of yugo amaryl more than fond .  yugo was one of the four people he had encountered during that short period of his life when he was in flight across the face of the planet trantor eto demerzel  dors venabili  yugo amaryl  and raych four  the likes of which he had not found since .   in a particular and  in each case  different way  these four were indispensable to him yugo amaryl  because of his quick understanding of the principles of psychohistory and of his imaginative probings into new areas .  it was comforting to know that if anything happened to seldon himself before the mathematics of the field could be completely worked out and how slowly it proceeded  and how mountainous the obstacles there would at least remain one good mind that would continue the research .   he said   i m sorry  yugo .  i don t mean to be impatient with you or to reject out of hand whatever it is you are so anxious to make me understand .  it s just this job of mine  it s this business of being a department head    amaryl found it his turn to smile and he repressed a slight chuckle .   i m sorry  hari  and i shouldn t laugh  but you have no natural aptitude for the position .     as well i know  but i ll have to learn .  i have to seem to be doing something harmless and there is nothing nothing more harmless than being the head of the mathematics department at streeling university .  i can fill my day with unimportant tasks  so that no one need know or ask about the course of our psychohistorical research  but the trouble is  i do fill my day with unimportant tasks and i have insufficient time to   his eyes glanced around his office at the material stored in computers to which only he and amaryl had the key and which  even if anyone else stumbled upon them  had been carefully phrased in an invented symbology that no one else would understand .   amaryl said   once you work your way further into your duties  you ll begin to delegate and then you ll have more time .     i hope so   said seldon dubiously .   but tell me  what is it about eto demerzel that is so important .     simply that eto demerzel  our great emperor s first minister  is busily creating an insurrection .    seldon frowned .   why would he want to do that .     i didn t say he wants to .  he s simply doing it whether he knows it or not and with considerable help from some of his political enemies .  that s all right with me  you understand .  i think that  under ideal conditions  it would be a good thing to have him out of the palace  off trantor  .   .   .  beyond the empire  for that matter .  but you think highly of him  as i ve said  and so i m warning you  because i suspect that you are not following the recent political course of events as closely as you should .     there are more important things to do   said seldon mildly .    like psychohistory .  i agree .  but how are we going to develop psychohistory with any hope of success if we remain ignorant of politics .    mean  present day politics .  now now is the time when the present is turning into the future .  we can t just study the past .  we know what happened in the past .  it s against the present and the near future that we can check our results .     it seems to me   said seldon   that i have heard this argument before .     and you ll hear it again .  it doesn t seem to do me any good to explain this to you .    seldon sighed  sat back in his chair  and regarded amaryl with a smile .  the younger man could be abrasive  but he took psychohistory seriously and that repaid all .   amaryl still had the mark of his early years as a heatsinker .  he had the broad shoulders and the muscular build of one who had been used to hard physical labor .  he had not allowed his body to turn flabby and that was a good thing  for it inspired seldon to resist the impulse to spend all of his time at the desk as well .  he did not have amaryl   s sheer physical strength  but he still had his own talents as a twister for all that he had just turned forty and could not keep it up forever .  but for now  he would continue .  thanks to his daily workouts  his waist was still trim  his legs and arms firm .   he said   this concern for demerzel cannot be purely a matter of his being a friend of mine .  you must have some other motive .     there s no puzzle to that .  as long as you re a friend of demerzel  your position here at the university is secure and you can continue to work on psychohistorical research .     there you are .  so i do have a reason to be friends with him .  it isn t beyond your understanding at all .     you have an interest in cultivating him .  that  i understand .  but as for friendship that  i don t understand .  however if demerzel lost lower  quite apart from the effect it might have on your position  then cleon himself would be running the empire and the rate of its decline would increase .  anarchy might then be upon us before we have worked out all the implications of psychohistory and made it possible for the science to save all humanity .     i see .   but  you know  i honestly don t think that we re going to work out psychohistory in time to prevent the fall of the empire .     even if we could not prevent the fall  we could cushion the effects  couldn t we .     perhaps .     there you are  then .  the longer we have to work in peace  the greater the chance we will have to prevent the fall or  at least  ameliorate the effects .  since that is the case  working backward  it may be necessary to save demerzel  whether we or  at least  i like it or not .     yet you just said that you would like to see him out of the palace and away from trantor and beyond the empire .     yes  under ideal conditions  i said .  but we are not living under ideal conditions and we need our first minister  even if he is an instrument of repression and despotism .     i see .  but why do you think the empire is so close to dissolution that the loss of a first minister will bring it about .     psychohistory .     are you using it for predictions .  we haven t even gotten the framework in place .  what predictions can you make .     there s intuition  hari .     there s always been intuition .  we want something more  don t we .  we want a mathematical treatment that will give us probabilities of specific future developments under this condition or that .  if intuition suffices to guide us  we don t need psychohistory at all .     it s not necessarily a matter of one or the other  hari .  i m talking about both  the combination  which may be better than either at least until psychohistory is perfected .     if ever   said seldon .   but tell me  where does this danger to demerzel arise .  what is it that is likely to harm him or overthrow him .  are we talking about demerzel s overthrow .     yes   said amaryl and a grim look settled on his face .    then tell me .  have pity on my ignorance .    amaryl flushed .   you re being condescending  hari .  surely you ve heard of jo jo joranum .     certainly .  he s a demagogue  wait  where s he from .  nishaya  right .  a very unimportant world .  goat herding  i think .  high quality cheeses .     that s it .  not just a demagogue  however .  he commands a strong following and it s getting stronger .  he aims  he says  for social justice and greater political involvement by the people .     yes   said seldon .   i ve heard that much .  his slogan is   government belongs to the people .      not quite  hari .  he says   government is the people .     seldon nodded .   well  you know  i rather sympathize with the thought .     so do i .  i m all for it if joranum meant it .  but he doesn t  except as a stepping stone .  it s a path  not a goal .  he wants to get rid of demerzel .  after that it will be easy to manipulate cleon .  then joranum will take the throne himself and he will be the people .  you ve told me yourself that there have been a number of episodes of this sort in imperial history and these days the empire is weaker and less stable than it used to be .  a blow which  in earlier centuries  merely staggered it might now shatter it .  the empire will welter in civil war and never recover and we won t have psychohistory in place to teach us what must be done .     yes  i see your point  but surely it s not going to be that easy to get rid of demerzel .     you don t know how strong joranum is growing .     it doesn t matter how strong he s growing .   a shadow of thought seemed to pass over seldon s brow .   i wonder that his parents came to name him jo jo .  there s something juvenile about that name .     his parents had nothing to do with it .  his real name is laskin  a very common name on nishaya .  he chose jo jo himself  presumably from the first syllable of his last name .     the more fool he  wouldn t you say .     no  i wouldn t .  his followers shout it jo  .   .   .  jo  .   .   .  jo  .   .   .  jo  over and over .  it s hypnotic .     well   said seldon  making a move to return to his tricomputer and adjust the multidimensional simulation it had created   we ll see what happens .     can you be that casual about it .  i m telling you the danger is imminent .     no  it isn t   said seldon  eyes steely  his voice suddenly hardening .   you don t have all the facts .     what facts don t i have .     we ll discuss that another time  yugo .  for now  continue with your work and let me worry about demerzel and the state of the empire .    amaryl s lips tightened  but the habit of obedience to seldon was strong .   yes  hari .    but not overwhelmingly strong .  he turned at the door and said   you re making a mistake  hari .    seldon smiled slightly .   i don t think so  but i have heard your warning and i will not forget .  still  all will be well .    and as amaryl left  seldon s smile faded .   would  indeed  all be well .      but seldon  while he did not forget amaryl s warning  did not think of it with any great degree of concentration .  his fortieth birthday came and went with the usual psychological blow .   forty .  he was not young any longer .  life no longer stretched before him as a vast uncharted field  its horizon lost in the distance .  he had been on trantor for eight years and the time had passed quickly .  another eight years and he would be nearly fifty .  old age would be looming .   and he had not even made a decent beginning in psychohistory .  yugo amaryl spoke brightly of laws and worked out his equations by making daring assumptions based on intuition .  but how could one possibly test those assumptions .  psychohistory was not yet an experimental science .  the complete study of psychohistory would require experiments that would involve worlds of people  centuries of time and a total lack of ethical responsibility .   it posed an impossible problem and he resented having to spend any time whatever on departmental tasks  so he walked home at the end of the day in a morose mood .   ordinarily he could always count on a walk through the campus to rouse his spirits .  streeling university was high domed and the campus gave the feeling of being out in the open without the necessity of enduring the kind of weather he had experienced on his one  and only  visit to the imperial palace .  there were trees  lawns  walks  almost as though he were on the campus of his old college on his home world of helicon .   the illusion of cloudiness had been arranged for the day with the sunlight  no sun  of course  just sunlight  appearing and disappearing at odd intervals .  and it was a little cool  just a little .   it seemed to seldon that the cool days came a little more frequently than they used to .  was trantor saving energy .  was it increasing inefficiency .  or  and he scowled inwardly as he thought it  was he getting old and was his blood getting thin .  he placed his hands in his jacket pockets and hunched up his shoulders .   usually he did not bother guiding himself consciously .  his body knew the way perfectly from his offices to his computer room and from there to his apartment and back .  generally he negotiated the path with his thoughts elsewhere  but today a sound penetrated his consciousness .  a sound without meaning .    jo  .   .   .  jo  .   .   .  jo  .   .   .  jo  .   .   .    it was rather soft and distant  but it brought back a memory .  yes  amaryl s warning .  the demagogue .  was he here on campus .   his legs swerved without seldon s making a conscious decision and brought him over the low rise to the university field  which was used for calisthenics  sports  and student oratory .   in the middle of the field was a moderate sized crowd of students who were chanting enthusiastically .  on a platform was someone he didn t recognize  someone with a loud voice and a swaying rhythm .   it wasn t this man  joranum  however .  he had seen joranum on holovision a number of times .  since amaryl s warning  seldon had paid close attention .  joranum was large and smiled with a kind of vicious camaraderie .  he had thick sandy hair and light blue eyes .   this speaker was small  if anything thin  wide mouthed  dark haired  and loud .  seldon wasn t listening to the words  though he did hear the phrase  power from the one to the many  and the many voiced shout in response .   fine  thought seldon  but just how does he intend to bring this about  and is he serious .   he was at the outskirts of the crowd now and looked around far someone he knew .  he spotted finangelos  a pret math undergraduate .  not a bad young man  dark and woolly haired .    finangelos   he called out .    professor seldon  said finangelos after a moment of staring as though unable to recognize seldon without a keyboard at his fingertips he trotted over .   did you come to listen to this guy .     i didn t come for any purpose but to find out what the noise was .  who is he .     his name is namarti  professor .  he s speaking for jo jo .     i hear that    said seldon as he listened to the chant again .  it began each time the speaker made a telling point  apparently .   but who is this namarti .  i don t recognize the name .  what department is he in .     he s not a member of the university  professor .  he s one of jo jo s men .     if he s not a member of the university  he has no right to speak here without a permit .  does he have one  do you suppose .     i wouldn t know  professor .     well then  let s find out .    seldon started into the crowd  but finangelos caught his sleeve .   don t start anything  professor .  he s got goons with him .    there were six young men behind the speaker  spaced rather widely  legs apart  arms folded  scowling .    goons .     for rough stuff  in case anyone tries anything funny .     then he s certainly not a member of the university and even a permit wouldn t cover what you call his  goons  .   finangelos  signal through to the university security officers .  they should have been here by now without a signal .     i guess they don t want trouble   muttered finangelos .   please  professor  don t try anything .  if you want me to get the security officers  i will  but you just wait till they come .     maybe i can break this up before they come .    he began pushing his way through .  it wasn t difficult .  some of those present recognized him and all could see the professorial shoulder patch .  he reached the platform  placed his hands on it  and vaulted up the three feet with a small grunt .  he thought  with chagrin  that he could have done it with one hand ten years before and without the grunt .   he straightened up .  the speaker had stopped talking and was looking at him with wary and ice hard eyes .   seldon said calmly   your permit to address the students  sir .     who are you .   said the speaker .  he said it loudly  his voice carrying .    i m a member of the faculty of this university   said seldon  equally loudly .   your permit  sir .     i deny your right to question me on the matter .   the young men behind the speaker had gathered closer .    if you have none  i would advise you to leave the university grounds immediately .     and if i don t .     well  for one thing  the university security officers are on their way .   he turned to the crowd .   students   he called out   we have the right of free speech and freedom of assembly on this campus  but it can be taken away from us if we allow outsiders  without permits  to make unauthorized    a heavy hand fell on his shoulder and he winced .  he turned around and found it was one of the men finangelos had referred to as  goons .    the man said  with a heavy accent whose provenance seldon could not immediately identify   get out of here fast .      what good will that do .   said seldon .   the security officers will be here any minute .     in that case   said namarti with a feral grin   there ll be a riot .  that doesn t scare us .     of course it wouldn t   said seldon .   you d like it  but there won t be a riot .  you ll all go quietly .   he turned again to the students and shrugged off the hand on his shoulder .   we ll see to that  won t we .    someone in the crowd shouted   that s professor seldon .  he s all right .  don t pound him .    seldon sensed ambivalence in the crowd .  there would be some  he knew  who would welcome a dust up with the university security officers  just on general principles .  on the other hand  there had to be some who liked him personally and still others who did not know him but who would not want to see violence against a member of the faculty .   a woman s voice rang out .   watch out  professor .    seldon sighed and regarded the large young men he faced .  he didn t know if he could do it  if his reflexes were quick enough  his muscles sturdy enough  even given his prowess at twisting .   one goon was approaching him  overconfidently of course .  not quickly  which gave seldon a little of the time his aging body would need .  the goon held out his arm confrontationally  which made it easier .   seldon seized the arm  whirled  and bent  arm up  and then down  with a grunt why did he have to grunt .    and the goon went flying through the air  propelled partly by his own momentum .  he landed with a thump on the outer edge of the platform  his right shoulder dislocated .   there was a wild cry from the audience at this totally unexpected development .  instantly an institutional pride erupted .    take them  prof .   a lone voice shouted .  others took up the cry .   seldon smoothed back his hair  trying not to puff .  with his foot he shoved the groaning fallen goon off the platform .    anyone else .   he asked pleasantly .   or will you leave quietly .    he faced namarti and his five henchmen and as they paused irresolutely  seldon said   i warn you .  the crowd is on my side now .  if you try to rush me  they ll take you apart .   okay  who s next .  let s go .  one at a time .    he had raised his voice with the last sentence and made small come hither motions with his fingers .  the crowd yelled its pleasure .   namarti stood there stolidly .  seldon leaped past him and caught his neck in the crook of his arm .  students were climbing onto the platform now  shouting  one at a time .  one at a time .   and getting between the bodyguards and seldon .   seldon increased the pressure on the other s windpipe and whispered in his ear   there s a way to do this  namarti  and i know how  i ve practiced it for years .  if you make a move and try to break away  i ll ruin your larynx so that you ll never talk above a whisper again .  if you value your voice  do as i say .  when i let up  you tell your bunch of bullies to leave .  if you say anything else  they ll be the last words you ll say normally .  and if you ever come back to this campus again  no more mr .  nice guy .  i ll finish the job .    he released the pressure momentarily .  namarti said huskily   all of you .  get out .   they retreated rapidly  helping their stricken comrade .   when the university security officers arrived a few moments later  seldon said   sorry  gentlemen .  false alarm .    he left the field and resumed his walk home with more than a little chagrin .  he had revealed a side of himself he did not want to reveal .  he was hari seldon  mathematician  not hari seldon  sadistic twister .   besides  he thought gloomily  dors would hear of this .  in fact  he d better tell her himself  lest she hear a version that made the incident seem worse than it really was .   she would not be pleased .      she wasn t .   dors was waiting for him at the door of their apartment in an easy stance  hand on one hip  looking very much as she had when he had first met her at this very university eight years before  slim  shapely  with curly reddish gold hair very beautiful in his eyes but not very beautiful in any objective sense  though he had never been able to assess her objectively after the first few days of their friendship .   dors venabili .  that s what he thought when he saw her calm face .  there were many worlds  even many sectors on trantor where it would have been common to call her dors seldon  but that  he always thought  would put the mark of ownership on her and he did not wish it  even though the custom was sanctioned by existence back into the vague mists of the pre imperial past .   dors said  softly and with a sad shake of her head that barely disturbed her loose curls   i ve heard  hari .  just what am i going to do with you .     a kiss would not be amiss .     well  perhaps  but only after we probe this a little .  come in .   the door closed behind them .   you know  dear  i have my course and my research .  i m still doing that dreadful history of the kingdom of trantor  which you tell me is essential to your own work .  shall i drop it all and take to wandering around with you  protecting you .  it s still my job  you know .  it s more than ever my job  now that you re making progress with psychohistory .     making progress .  i wish i were .  but you needn t protect me .     needn t i .  i sent raych out looking for you .  after all  you were late and i was concerned .  you usually tell me when you re going to be late .  i m sorry if that makes me sound as though i m your keeper  hari  but i am your keeper .     does it occur to you  keeper dors  that every once in a while i like to slip my leash .     and if something happens to you  what do i tell demerzel .     am i too late for dinner .  have we clicked for kitchen service .     no .  i was waiting for you .  and as long as you re here  you click it .  you re a great deal pickier than i am when it comes to food .  and don t change the subject .     didn t raych tell you that i was all right .  so what s there to talk about .     when he found you  you were in control of the situation and he got back here first  but not by much .  i didn t hear any details .  tell me what were you doing .    seldon shrugged .   there was an illegal gathering  dors  and i broke it up .  the university could have gotten a good deal of trouble it didn t need if i hadn t .     and it was up to you to prevent it .  hari .  you re not a twister anymore .  you re an    he put in hastily   an old man .     for a twister  yes .  you re forty .  how do you feel .     well  a little stiff .     i can well imagine .  and one of these days  when you try to pretend you re a young heliconian athlete  you ll break a rib .   now tell me about it .     well  i told you how amaryl warned me that demerzel was in trouble because of the demagoguery of jo jo joranum .     jo jo .  yes  i know that much .  what don t i know .  what happened today .     there was a rally at the field .  a jo jo partisan named namarti was addressing the crowd     namarti is gambol deen namarti  joranum s right hand man .     well  you know more about it than i do .  in any case  he was addressing a large crowd and he had no permit and i think he was hoping there would be some sort of riot .  they feed on these disorders and if he could close down the university even temporarily  he would charge demerzel with the destruction of academic freedom .  i gather they blame him for everything .  so i stopped them .   sent them off without a riot .     you sound proud .     why not .  not bad for a man of forty .     is that why you did it .  to test your status at forty .    seldon thoughtfully clicked the dinner menu .  then he said   no .  i really was concerned that the university would get into needless trouble .  and i was concerned about demerzel .  i m afraid that yugo s tales of danger had impressed me more than i realized .  that was stupid  dors  because i know that demerzel can take care of himself .  i couldn t explain that to yugo or to anyone but you .    he drew in a deep breath .   it s amazing what a pleasure it is that i can at least talk to you about it .  you know and i know and demerzel knows and no one else knows at least  that i know of that demerzel is untouchable .    dors touched a contact on a recessed wall panel and the dining section of their living quarters lit up with a soft peach colored glow .  together  she and hari walked to the table  which was already set with linen  crystal  and utensils .  as they sat  the dinner began to arrive there was never any long delay at this time of evening and seldon accepted it quite casually .  he had long since grown accustomed to the social position that made it unnecessary for them to patronize the faculty dinners .   seldon savored the seasonings they had learned to enjoy during their stay at mycogen the only thing about that strange  male dominated  religion permeated  living in the past sector they had not detested .   dors said softly   how do you mean   untouchable  .     come  dear  he can alter emotions .  you haven t forgotten that .  if joranum really became dangerous  he could be  he made a vague gesture with his hands   altered  made to change his mind .    dors looked uncomfortable and the meal proceeded in an unusual silence .  it wasn t until it was over and the remains dishes  cutlery  and all swirled down the disposal chute in the center of the table  which then smoothly covered itself over  that she said   i m not sure i want to talk about this  hari  but i can t let you be fooled by your own innocence .     innocence .   he frowned .    yes .  we ve never talked about this .  i never thought it would come up  but demerzel has shortcomings .  he is not untouchable  he may be harmed  and joranum is indeed a danger to him .     are you serious .     of course i am .  you don t understand robots certainly not one as complex as demerzel .  and i do .       there was a short silence again  but only because thoughts are silent .  seldon s were tumultuous enough .   yes  it was true .  his wife did seem to have an uncanny knowledge of robots .  hari had wondered about this so often over the years that he had finally given up  tucked it away in the back of his mind .  if it hadn t been for eto demerzel a robot hari would never have met dors .  for dors worked for demerzel  it was demerzel who  assigned  dors to hari s case eight years ago to protect him during his flight throughout the various sectors of trantor .  even though now she was his wife  his help meet  his   better half   hari still occasionally wondered about dors s strange connection with the robot demerzel .  it was the only area of dors s life where hari truly felt he did not belong nor welcome .  and that brought to mind the most painful question of all  was it out of obedience to demerzel that dors stayed with hari or was it out of love for him .  he wanted to believe the latter and yet  .   .   .   his life with dors venabili was a happy one  but it was so at a cost  at a condition .  the condition was all the more stringent  in that it had been settled not through discussion or agreement but by a mutual unspoken understanding .   seldon understood that he found in dors everything he would have wanted in a wife .  true  he had no children  but he had neither expected any  nor  to tell the truth  had greatly wanted any .  he had raych  who was as much a son of his emotionally as if he had inherited the entire seldonian genome perhaps more so .   the mere fact that dors was causing him to think about the matter was breaking the agreement that had kept them in peace and comfort all these years and he felt a faint but growing resentment at that .   but he pushed those thoughts  the questions  away again .  he had learned to accept her role as his protector and would continue to do so .  after all  it was he with whom she shared a home  a table  and a bed not eto demerzel .   dors s voice brought him out of his reverie .    i said  are you sulking  hari .    he started slightly  for there was the sound of repetition in her voice  and he realized he had been shrinking steadily deeper into his mind and away from her .    i m sorry  dear .  i m not sulking .   not deliberately sulking .  i m just wondering how i ought to respond to your statement .     about robots .   she seemed quite calm as she said the word .    you said i don t know as much about them as you do .  how do i respond to that .   he paused  then added quietly  knowing he was taking a chance    that is  without offense .     i didn t say you didn t know about robots .  if you re going to quote me  do so with precision .  i said you didn t understand about robots .  i m sure that you know a great deal  perhaps more than i do  but to know is not necessarily to understand .     now  dors  you re deliberately speaking in paradoxes to be annoying .  a paradox arises only out of an ambiguity that deceives either unwittingly or by design .  i don t like that in science and i don t like it in casual conversation  either  unless it is meant humorously  which i think is not the case now .    dors laughed in her particular way  softly  almost as though amusement were too precious to be shared in an overliberal manner .   apparently the paradox has annoyed you into pomposity and you are always humorous when you are pompous .  however  i ll explain .  it s not my intention to annoy you .   she reached over to pat his hand and it was to seldon s surprise  and slight embarrassment  that he found that he had clenched his hand into a fist .   dors said   you talk about psychohistory a great deal .  to me  at any rate .  you know that .    seldon cleared his throat .   i throw myself on your mercy as far as that s concerned .  the project is secret by its very nature .  psychohistory won t work unless the people it affects know nothing about it  so i can talk about it only to yugo and to you .  to yugo  it is all intuition .  he s brilliant  but he is so apt to leap wildly into darkness that i must play the role of caution  of forever pulling him back .  but i have my wild thoughts  too  and it helps me to be able to hear them aloud  even  and he smiled   when i have a pretty good notion that you don t understand a word i m saying .     i know i m your sounding board and i don t mind .   i really don t mind  hari  so don t begin making inner resolutions to change your behavior .  naturally i don t understand your mathematics .  i m just a historian and not even a historian of science .  the influence of economic change on political development is what is taking up my time now     yes  and i m your sounding board on that or hadn t you noticed .  i ll need it for psychohistory when the time comes  so i suspect you ll be an indispensable help to me .     good .  now that we ve settled why you stay with me i knew it couldn t be for my ethereal beauty let me go on to explain that occasionally  when your discussion veers away from the strictly mathematical aspects  it seems to me that i get your drift .  you have  on a number of occasions  explained what you call the necessity of minimalism .  i think i understand that .  by it  you mean     i know what i mean .    dors looked hurt .   less lofty  please  hari .  i m not trying to explain to you .  i want to explain it to myself .  you say you re my sounding board  so act like one .  turnabout is fair play  isn t it .     turnabout is fine  but if you re going to accuse me of loftiness when i say one little      enough .  shut up .   you have told me that minimalism is of the highest importance in applied psychohistory  in the art of attempting to change an undesired development into a desired one or  at any rate  a toss undesired one .  you have said that a change must be applied that is as minute  as minimal  as possible     yes   said seldon eagerly   that is because     no  hari .  i m trying to explain .  we both know that you understand it .  you must have minimalism because every change  any change  has a myriad of side effects that can t always be allowed for .  if the change is side effects too many  then it becomes certain that the outcome will be far removed from anything you ve planned and that it would be entirely unpredictable .     right   said seldon .   that s the essence of a chaotic  effect .  the problem is whether any change is small enough to make the consequence reasonably predictable or whether human history is inevitably and unalterably chaotic in every respect .  it was that which  at the start  made me think that psychohistory was not     i know  but you re not letting me make my point .  whether any change would be small enough is not the issue .  the point is that any change greater than the minimal is chaotic .  the required minimum may be zero  but if it is not zero  then it is still very small and it would be a major problem to find some change that is small enough and yet is significantly greater than zero .  now  that  i gather  is what you mean by the necessity of minimalism .     more or less   said seldon .   of course  as always  the matter is expressed more compactly and more rigorously in the language of mathematics .  see here     save me   said dors .   since you know this about psychohistory  hari  you ought to know it about demerzel  too .  you have the knowledge but not the understanding  because it apparently doesn t occur to you to apply the rules of psychohistory to the laws of robotics .    to which seldon replied faintly   now i don t see what you re getting at .    he requires minimality  too  doesn t he  hari .  by the first law of robotics  a robot can t harm a human being .  that is the prime rule for the usual robot  but demerzel is something quite unusual and for him  the zeroth law is a reality and it takes precedence even over the first law .  the zeroth law states that a robot can t harm humanity as a whole .  but that puts demerzel into the same bind in which you exist when you labor at psychohistory .  do you see .     i m beginning to .     i hope so .  if demerzel has the ability to change minds  he has to do so without bringing about side effects he does not wish and since he is the emperor s first minister  the side effects he must worry about are numerous  indeed .     and the application to the present case .     think about it .  you can t tell anyone except me  of course that demerzel is a robot  because he has adjusted you so that you can t .  but how much adjustment did that take .  do you want to tell people that he is a robot .  do you want to ruin his effectiveness when you depend on him for protection  for support of your grants  for influence quietly exerted on your behalf .  of course not .  the change he had to make then was a very tiny one  just enough to keep you from blurting it out in a moment of excitement or carelessness .  it is so small a change that there are no particular side effects .  that is how demerzel tries to run the empire generally .     and the case of joranum .     is obviously completely different from yours .  he is  for whatever motives  unalterably opposed to demerzel .  undoubtedly  demerzel could change that  but it would be at the price of introducing a considerable wrench in joranum s makeup that would bring about results demerzel could not predict .  rather than take the chance of harming joranum  of producing side effects that would harm others and  possibly  all of humanity  he must leave joranum alone until he can find some small change some small change that will save the situation without harm .  that is why yugo is right and why demerzel is vulnerable .    seldon had listened but did not respond .  he seemed lost in thought .  minutes passed before he said   if demerzel can do nothing in this matter  then i must .     if he can do nothing  what can you do .     the case is different .  i am not bound by the laws of robotics .  i need not concern myself obsessively with minimalism .   and to begin with  i must see demerzel .    dors looked faintly anxious .   must you .  surely it wouldn t be wise to advertise a connection between the two of you .     we have reached a time where we can t make a fetish of pretending there is no connection .  naturally i won t go to see him behind a flourish of trumpets and an announcement on holovision  but i must see him .       seldon found himself raging at the passage of time .  eight years ago  when he had first arrived on trantor  he could take instant action .  he had only a hotel room and its contents to forsake and he could range through the sectors of trantor at will .   now he found himself with department meetings  with decisions to make  with work to do .  it was not so easy to dash off at will to see demerzel and if he could  demerzel also had a   full schedule of his own .  to find a time when they both could meet would not be easy .   nor was it easy to have dors shake her head at him .   i don t know what you intend to do  hari .    and he answered impatiently   i don t know what i intend to do  either  dors .  i hope to find out when i see demerzel .     your first duty is to psychohistory .  he ll tell you so .     perhaps .  i ll find out .    and then  just as he had arranged a time for the meeting with the first minister  eight days hence  he received a message on his department office wall screen in slightly archaic lettering .  and to match that was the more than slightly archaic message  i crave an audience with professor hari seldon .   seldon stared at it with astonishment .  even the emperor was not addressed in quite that centuries old turn of phrase .   nor was the signature printed as it usually was for clarity .  it was scripted with a flourish that left it perfectly legible and yet gave it the aura of a careless work of art dashed off by a master .  the signature was  laskin joranum .   it was jo jo himself  craving an audience .   seldon found himself chuckling .  it was clear why the choice of words  and why the script .  it made what was a simple request a device for stimulating curiosity .  seldon had no great desire to meet the man or would have had none ordinarily .  but what was worth the archaism and the artistry .  he wanted to find out .   he had his secretary set the time and the place of the appointment .  it would be in his office  certainly not in his apartment .  a business conversation  nothing social .   and it would come before the projected meeting with demerzel .   dors said   it s no surprise to me  hari .  you hurt two of his people  one of them his chief aide  you spoiled a little rally he was holding  and you made him  in the person of his representatives  seem foolish .  he wants to take a look at you and i think i had better be with you .    seldon shook his head .   i ll take raych .  he knows all the tricks i know and he s a strong and active twenty year old .  although i m sure there ll be no need for protection .     how can you be sure .     joranum is coming to see me on the university grounds .  there will be any number of youngsters in the vicinity .  i m not exactly an unpopular figure with the student body and i suspect that joranum is the kind of man who does his homework and knows that i ll be safe on home territory .  i m sure that he will be perfectly polite completely friendly .     hmph   said dors with a light twist of one corner of her lip .    and quite deadly   seldon finished .      hari seldon kept his face expressionless and bent his head just sufficiently to allow a sense of reasonable courtesy .  he had taken the trouble to look up a variety of holographs of joranum  but  as is often the case  the real thing  unguarded  shifting constantly in response to changing conditions  is never quite the same as a holograph however carefully prepared .  perhaps  thought seldon  it is the response of the viewer to the  real thing  that makes it different .   joranum was a tall man as tall as seldon  at any rate but larger in other directions .  it was not due to a muscular physique  for he gave the impression of softness  without quite being fat .  a rounded face  a thick head of hair that was sandy rather than yellow  light blue eyes .  he wore a subdued coverall and his face bore a half smile that gave the illusion of friendliness  while making it clear  somehow  that it was only an illusion .    professor seldon  his voice was deep and under strict control  an orator s voice  i am delighted to meet you .  it is kind of you to permit this meeting .  i trust you are not offended that i have brought a companion  my right hand man  with me  although i have not cleared that with you in advance .  he is gambol deen namarti three names  you notice .  i believe you have met him .     yes  i have .  i remember the incident well .   seldon looked at namarti with a touch of the sardonic .  at the previous encounter  namarti had been speaking at the university field .  seldon viewed him carefully now under relaxed conditions .  namarti was of moderate height  with a thin face  sallow complexion  dark hair  and a wide mouth .  he did not have joranum s half smile or any noticeable expression except for a sense of cautious wariness .    my friend dr .  namarti his degree is in ancient literature has come at his own request   said joranum  his smile intensifying a bit   to apologize .    joranum glanced quickly at namarti and namarti  his lips tightening just at first  said in a colorless voice   i am sorry  professor  for what happened at the field .  i was not quite aware of the strict rules governing university rallies and i was a little carried away by my own enthusiasm .     understandably so   said joranum .   nor was he entirely aware of your identity .  i think we may all now forget the matter .     i assure you  gentlemen   said seldon   that i have no great desire to remember it .  this is my son  raych seldon  so you see i have a companion  too .    raych had grown a mustache  black and abundant the masculine mark of the dahlite .  he had had none when he first met seldon eight years before  when he was a street boy  ragged and hungry .  he was short but lithe and sinewy and his expression was the haughty one he had adopted in order to add a few spiritual inches to his physical height .    good morning  young man   said joranum .    good morning  sir   said raych .    please sit down  gentlemen   said seldon .   may i offer you something to eat or drink .    joranum held up his hands in polite refusal .   no  sir .  this is not a social call .   he seated himself in the place indicated .   though i hope there will be many such calls in the future .     if this is to be about business  then let s begin .     the news reached me  professor seldon  of the little incident that you have so kindly agreed to forget and i wondered why you took the chance of doing what you did .  it was a risk  you must admit .     i didn t think so  actually .     but i did .  so i took the liberty of finding out everything i could about you  professor seldon .  you re an interesting man .  from helicon  i discovered .     yes  that s where i was born .  the records are clear .     and you ve been here on trantor for eight years .     that is also a matter of public record .     and you made yourself quite famous at the start by delivering a mathematical paper on what do you call it .  psychohistory .    seldon shook his head very slightly .  how often he had regretted that indiscretion .  of course  he had had no idea at the time that it was an indiscretion .  he said   a youthful enthusiasm .  it came to nothing .     is that so .   joranum looked around him with an air of pleased surprise .   yet here you are  the head of the mathematics department at one of trantor s greatest universities  and only forty years old  i believe .   i m forty two  by the way  so i don t look upon you as very old at all .  you must be a very competent mathematician to be in this position .    seldon shrugged .   i wouldn t care to make a judgment in that matter .     or you must have powerful friends .     we would all like to have powerful friends  mr .  joranum  but i think you will find none here .  university professors rarely have powerful friends or  i sometimes think  friends of any kind .   he smiled .   and so did joranum .   wouldn t you consider the emperor a powerful friend  professor seldon .     i certainly would  but what has that to do with me .     i am under the impression that the emperor is a friend of yours .     i m sure the records will show  mr .  joranum  that i had an audience with his imperial majesty eight years ago .  it lasted perhaps an hour or less and i saw no signs of any great friendliness in him at the time .  nor have i spoken to him since  or even seen him except on holovision  of course .     but  professor  it is not necessary to see or speak to the emperor to have him as a powerful friend .  it is sufficient to see or speak to eto demerzel  the emperor s first minister .  demerzel is your protector and  since he is  we may as well say the emperor is .     do you find first minister demerzel s supposed protection of me anywhere in the records .  or anything at all in the records from which you can deduce that protection .     why search the records when it is well known that there is a connection between the two of you .  you know it and i know it .  let us take it then as given and continue .  and please  he raised his hands  do not take the trouble to give me any heartfelt denials .  it s a waste of time .     actually   said seldon   i was going to ask why you should think that he would want to protect me .  to what end .     professor .  are you trying to hurt me by pretending to think i am a monster of naivete .  i mentioned your psychohistory  which demerzel wants .     and i told you that it was a youthful indiscretion that came to nothing .     you may tell me a great many things  professor .  i am not compelled to accept what you tell me .  come  let me speak frankly .  i have read your original paper and have tried to understand it with the help of some mathematicians on my staff .  they tell me it is a wild dream and quite impossible     i quite agree with them   said seldon .    but i have the feeling that demerzel is waiting for it to be developed and put to use .  and if he can wait  so can i .  it would be more useful to you  professor seldon  to have me wait .     why so .     because demerzel will not endure in his position for much longer .  public opinion is turning against him steadily .  it may be that when the emperor wearies of an unpopular first minister who threatens to drag the throne down with him  he will find a replacement .  it may even be my poor self whom the emperor s fancy will seize upon .  and you will still need a protector  someone who can see to it that you can work in peace and with ample funds for whatever you need in the way of equipment and assistants .     and would you be that protector .     of course and for the same reason that demerzel is .  i want a successful psychohistoric technique so that i can rule the empire more efficiently .    seldon nodded thoughtfully  waited a moment  then said   but in that case  mr .  joranum  why must i concern myself in this .  i am a poor scholar  living a quiet life  engaged in out of the way mathematical and pedagogical activities .  you say that demerzel is my present protector and that you will be my future protector .  i can go quietly about my business  then .  you and the first minister may fight it out .  whoever prevails  i have a protector still or  at least  so you tell me .    joranum s fixed smile seemed to fade a bit .  namarti  at his side  turned his dour face toward joranum and made as though to say something  but joranum s hand moved slightly and namarti coughed and did not speak .   joranum said   dr .  seldon .  are you a patriot .     why  of course .  the empire has given humanity millennia of peace  mostly peace  at any rate and fostered steady advancement .     so it has but at a slower pace in the last century or two .    seldon shrugged .   i have not studied such matters .     you don t have to .  you know that  politically  the last century or two has been a time of turmoil .  imperial reigns have been short and sometimes have been shortened further by assassination     even mentioning that   put in seldon   is close to treason .  i d rather you didn t     well  there .   joranum threw himself back in his seat .   see how insecure you are .  the empire is decaying .  i m willing to say so openly .  those who follow me do so because they know only too well it is .  we need someone at the emperor s right hand who can control the empire  subdue the rebellious impulses that seem to be arising everywhere  give the armed forces the natural leadership they should have  lead the economy    seldon made an impatient stopping motion with his arm .   and you re the one to do it  are you .     i intend to be the one .  it won t be an easy job and i doubt there would be many volunteers for good reason .  certainly demerzel can t do it .  under him  the decline of the empire is accelerating to a total breakdown .     but you can stop it .     yes  dr .  seldon .  with your help .  with psychohistory .     perhaps demerzel could stop the breakdown with psychohistory if psychohistory existed .    joranum said calmly   it exists .  let us not pretend it does not .  but its existence does not help demerzel .  psychohistory is only a tool .  it needs a brain to understand it and an arm to wield it .     and you have those  i take it .     yes .  i know my own virtues .  i want psychohistory .    seldon shook his head .   you may want it all you please .  i don t have it .    you do have it .  i will not argue the point .   joranum leaned closer as though wishing to insinuate his voice into seldon s ear  rather than allowing the sound waves to carry it there .   you say you are a patriot .  i must replace demerzel to avoid imperial destruction .  however  the manner of replacement might itself weaken the empire desperately .  i do not wish that .  you can advise me how to achieve the end smoothly  subtly  without harm or damage for the sake of the empire .    seldon said   i cannot .  you accuse me of knowledge i do not possess .  i would like to be of assistance  but i cannot .    joranum stood up suddenly .   well  you know my mind and what it is i want of you .  think about it .  and i ask you to think about the empire .  you may feel you owe demerzel this despoiler of all the millions of planets of humanity your friendship .  be careful .  what you do may shake the very foundation of the empire .  i ask you to help me in the name of the quadrillions of human beings who fill the galaxy .  think of the empire .    his voice had dropped to a thrilling and powerful half whisper .  seldon felt himself almost trembling .   i will always think of the empire   he said .   joranum said   then that is all i ask right now .  thank you for consenting to see me .    seldon watched joranum and his companion leave as the office doors slid open noiselessly and the men strode out .   he frowned .  something was bothering him and he was not sure what it was .      namarti s dark eyes remained fixed on joranum as they sat in their carefully shielded office in the streeling sector .  it was not an elaborate headquarters  they were as yet weak in streeling  but they would grow stronger .   it was amazing how the movement was growing .  it had started from nothing three years back and now its tentacles stretched in some places more thickly than others  of course throughout trantor .  the outer worlds were as yet largely untouched .  demerzel had labored mightily to keep them content  but that was his mistake .  it was here on trantor that rebellions were dangerous .  elsewhere  they could be controlled .  here  demerzel could be toppled .  odd that he should not realize that  but joranum had always held to the theory that demerzel s reputation was overblown  that he would prove an empty shell if anyone dared oppose him  and that the emperor would destroy him quickly if his own security seemed at stake .   so far  at least  all of joranum s predictions had come to pass .  he had never once lost his way except in minor matters  such as that recent rally at streeling university in which this seldon fellow had interfered .   that might be why joranum had insisted on the interview with him .  even a minor toe stub must be taken care of .  joranum enjoyed the feeling of infallibility and namarti had to admit that the vision of a constant string of successes was the surest way of ensuring the continuation of success .  people tended to avoid the humiliation of failure by joining the obviously winning side even against their own opinions .   but had the interview with this seldon been a success or was it a second stub of the toe to be added to the first .  namarti had not enjoyed having been brought along in order to be made to humbly apologize and he didn t see that it had done any good .   now joranum sat there  silent  obviously lost in thought  gnawing at the edge of one thumb as though trying to draw some sort of mental nourishment from it .    jo jo   said namarti softly .  he was one of the very few people who could address joranum by the diminutive that the crowds shouted out endlessly in public .  joranum solicited the love of the mob in this way  among others  but he demanded respect from individuals in private  except for those special friends who had been with him from the start .    jo jo   he said again .   joranum looked up .   yes  g . d .   what is it .   he sounded a little testy .    what are we going to do about this seldon fellow  jo jo .     do .  nothing right now .  he may join us .     why wait .  we can put pressure on him .  we can pull a few strings at the university and make life miserable for him .     no no .  so far  demerzel has been letting us go our way .  the fool is overconfident .  the last thing we want to do  .  though  is to push him into action before we are quite ready .  and a heavy handed move against seldon may do it .  i suspect demerzel places enormous importance on seldon .     because of this psychohistory you two talked about .     indeed .     what is it .  i have never heard of it .     few people have .  it s a mathematical way of analyzing human society that ends by predicting the future .    namarti frowned and felt his body move slightly away from joranum .  was this a joke of joranum s .  was this intended to make him laugh .  namarti had never been able to work out when or why people expected him to laugh .  he had never had an urge to .   he said   predict the future .  how .     ah .  if i knew that  what need would i have of seldon .     frankly i don t believe it  jo jo .  how can you foretell the future .  it s fortune telling .     i know  but after this seldon broke up your little rally  i had him looked into .  all the way .  eight years ago  he came to trantor and presented a paper on psychohistory at a convention of mathematicians and then the whole thing died .  it was never referred to again by anyone .  not even by seldon .     it sounds as though there were nothing to it  then .     oh no  just the reverse .  if it had faded slowly  if it had been subjected to ridicule  i would have said there was nothing to it .  but to be cut off suddenly and completely means that the whole thing has been placed in the deepest of freezes .  that is why demerzel may have been doing nothing to stop us .  perhaps he is not being guided by a foolish overconfidence  perhaps he is being guided by psychohistory  which must be predicting something that demerzel plans to take advantage of at the right time .  if so  we might fail unless we can make use of psychohistory ourselves .     seldon claims it doesn t exist .     wouldn t you if you were he .     i still say we ought to put pressure on him .     it would be useless  g . d .  didn t you ever hear the story of the ax of venn .     no .     you would if you were from nishaya .  it s a famous folktale back home .  in brief  venn was a woodcutter who had a magic ax that  with a single light blow  could chop down any tree .  it was enormously valuable  but he never made any effort to hide it or preserve it and yet it was never stolen  because no one could lift or swing the ax but venn himself .    well  at the present moment  no one can handle psychohistory but seldon himself .  if he were on our side only because we had forced him  we could never be certain of his loyalty .  might he not urge a course of action that would seem to work in our favor but would be so subtly drawn that  after a while  we found ourselves quite suddenly destroyed .  no  he must come to our side voluntarily and labor for us because he wishes us to win .     but how can we bring him around .     there s seldon s son .  raych  i think he s called .  did you observe him .     not particularly .     g . d .   g . d .   you miss points if you don t observe everything .  that young man listened to me with his heart in his eyes .  he was impressed .  i could tell .  if there s one thing i can tell  it is just how i impress others .  i know when i have shaken a mind  when i have edged someone toward conversion .    joranum smiled .  it was not the pseudowarm ingratiating smile of his public demeanor .  it was a genuine smile this time cold  somehow  and menacing .    we ll see what we can do with raych   he said   and if  through him  we can reach seldon .       raych looked at hari seldon after the two politicians had gone and fingered his mustache .  it gave him satisfaction to stroke it .  here in the streeling sector  some men wore mustaches  but they were usually thin despicable things of uncertain color thin despicable things  even if dark .  most men did not wear them at all and suffered with naked upper lips .  seldon didn t  for instance  and that was just as well .  with his color of hair  a mustache would have been a travesty .   he watched seldon closely  waiting for him to cease being lost in thought  and then found he could wait no longer .    dad .   he said .   seldon looked up and said   what .   he sounded a little annoyed at having his thoughts interrupted  raych decided .   raych said   i don t think it was right for you to see those two guys .     oh .  why not .     well  the thin guy  whatever his name is  was the guy you made trouble for at the field .  he can t have liked it .     but he apologized .     he didn t mean it .  but the other guy  joranum he can be dangerous .  what if they had had weapons .     what .  here in the university .  in my office .  of course not .  this isn t billibotton .  besides  if they had tried anything  i could have handled both of them together .  easily .     i don t know  dad   said raych dubiously .   you re getting     don t say it  you ungrateful monster   said seldon  lifting an admonishing finger .   you ll sound just like your mother and i have enough of that from her .  i am not getting old or  at least  not that old .  besides  you were with me and you re almost as skilled a twister as i am .    raych s nose wrinkled .   twisting ain t much good .    it was no use .  raych heard himself speak and knew that  even eight years out of the morass of dahl  he still slipped into using the dahlite accent that marked him firmly as a member of the lower class .  and he was short  too  to the point where he sometimes felt stunted .   but he had his mustache and no one ever patronized him twice .    he said   what are you going to do about joranum .     for now  nothing .     well  look  dad  i saw joranum on trantorvision a couple of times .  i even made some holotapes of his speeches .   everyone is talking about him  so i thought i would see what he has to say .  and  you know  he makes some kind of sense .  i don t like him and i don t trust him  but he does make some kind of sense .  he wants all sectors to have equal rights and equal opportunities and there ain t nothing wrong with that  is there .     certainly not .  all civilized people feel that way .     so why don t we have that sort of stuff .  does the emperor feel that way .  does demerzel .     the emperor and the first minister have an entire empire to worry about .  they can t concentrate all their efforts on trantor itself .  it s easy for joranum to talk about equality .  he has no responsibilities .  if he were in the position to rule  he would find that his efforts would be greatly diluted by an empire of twenty five million planets .  not only that  but he would find himself stopped at every point by the sectors themselves .  each one wants a great deal of equality for itself but not much equality for others .  tell me  raych  are you of the opinion that joranum ought to have a chance to rule  just to show what he can do .    raych shrugged .   i don t know .  i wonder .   but if he had tried anything on you  i would have been at his throat before he could move two centimeters .     your loyalty to me  then  exceeds your concern for the empire .     sure .  you re my dad .    seldon looked at raych fondly  but behind that look he felt a trace of uncertainty .  how far could joranum s nearly hypnotic influence go .      hari seldon sat back in his chair  the vertical back giving as he did so and allowing him to assume a half reclining position .  his hands were behind his head and his eyes were unfocused .  his breathing was very soft  indeed .   dors venabili was at the other end of the room  with her viewer turned off and the microfilms back in place .  she had been through a rather concentrated period of revision of her opinions on the florina incident in early trantorian history and she found it rather restful to withdraw for a few moments and to speculate on what it was that seldon was considering .   it had to be psychohistory .  it would probably take him the rest of his life  tracking down the byways of this semichaotic technique  and he would end with it incomplete  leaving the task to others  to amaryl  if that young man had not also worn himself out on the matter  and breaking his heart at the need to do that .   yet it gave him a reason for living .  he would live longer with the problem filling him from end to end and that pleased her .  someday she would lose him  she knew  and she found that the thought afflicted her .  it had not seemed it would at the start  when her task had been the simple one of protecting him for the sake of what he knew .   when had it become a matter of personal need .  how could there be so personal a need .  what was there about the man that caused her to feel uneasy when he was not in her sight  even when she knew he was safe so that the deeply ingrained orders within her were not called into action .  his safety was all that she had been ordered to be concerned with .  how did the rest intrude itself .   she had spoken of it to demerzel long before  when the feeling had made itself unmistakable .   he had regarded her gravely and said    you are complex  dors  and there are no simple answers .  in my life there have been several individuals whose presence made it easier for me to think  pleasanter to make my responses .  i have tried to judge the ease of my responses in their presence and the unease of my responses in their final absence to see whether i was the net gainer or loser .  in the process  one thing became plain .  the pleasantness of their company outweighed the regret of their passing .  on the whole  then  it is better to experience what you experience now than not to .    she thought  hari will someday leave a void  and each day that someday is closer  and i must not think of it .   it was to rid herself of the thought that she finally interrupted him .   what are you thinking of  hari .     what .   seldon focused his eyes with an apparent effort .    psychohistory  i assume .  i imagine you ve traced another blind pathway .     well now .  that s not on my mind at all .   he laughed suddenly .   do you want to know what i m thinking of .   hair .     hair .  whose .     right now  yours .   he was looking at her fondly .    is there something wrong with it .  should i dye it another color .  or perhaps  after all these years  it should go gray .     come .  who needs or wants gray in your hair .   but it s led me to other things .  nishaya  for instance .     nishaya .  what s that .     it was never part of the pre imperial kingdom of trantor  so i m not surprised you haven t heard of it .  it s a world  a small one .  isolated .  unimportant .  overlooked .  i only know anything at all about it because i ve taken the trouble to look it up .  very few worlds out of twenty five million can really make much of a sustained splash  but i doubt that there s another one as insignificant as nishaya .  which is very significant  you see .    dors shoved her reference material to one side and said   what is this new penchant you have for paradox  which you always tell me you detest .  what is this significance of insignificance .     oh  i don t mind paradoxes when i perpetrate them .  you see  joranum comes from nishaya .     ah  it s joranum you re concerned with .     yes .  i ve been viewing some of his speeches at raych s insistence .  they don t make very much sense  but the total effect can be almost hypnotic .  raych is very impressed by him .     i imagine that anyone of dahlite origins would be  hari .  joranum s constant call for sector equality would naturally appeal to the downtrodden heatsinkers .  you remember when we were in dahl .     i remember it very well and of course i don t blame the lad .  it just bothers me that joranum comes from nishaya .    dors shrugged .   well  joranum has to come from somewhere and  conversely  nishaya  like any other world  must send its people out at times  even to trantor .     yes  but  as i ve said  i ve taken the trouble to investigate nishaya .  i ve even managed to make hyperspatial contact with some minor official which cost a considerable quantity of credits that i cannot  in good conscience  charge to the department .     and did you find anything that was worth the credits .     i rather think so .  you know  joranum is always telling little stories to make his points  stories that are legends on his home planet of nishaya .  that serves a good purpose for him here on trantor  since it makes him appear to be a man of the people  full of homespun philosophy .  those tales litter his speeches .  they make him appear to be from a small world  to have been brought up on an isolated farm surrounded by an untamed ecology .  people like it  especially trantorians  who would rather die than be trapped somewhere in an untamed ecology but who love to dream about one just the same .     but what of it all .     the odd point is that not one of the stories was familiar to the person i spoke to on nishaya .     that s not significant  hari .  it may be a small world  but it s a world .  what is current in joranum s birth section of the world may not be current in whatever place your official came from .     no no .  folktales  in one form or another  are usually worldwide .  but aside from that  i had considerable trouble in understanding the fellow .  he spoke galactic standard with a thick accent .  i spoke to a few others on the world  just to check  and they all had the same accent .     and what of that .     joranum doesn t have it .  he speaks a fairly good trantorian .  it s a lot better than mine  actually .  i have the heliconian stress on the letter  r .   he doesn t .  according to the records  he arrived on trantor when he was nineteen .  it is just impossible  in my opinion  to spend the first nineteen years of your life speaking that barbarous nishayan version of galactic standard and then come to trantor and lose it .  however long he s been here  some trace of the accent would have remained  look at raych and the way he lapses into his dahlite way of speaking on occasion .     what do you deduce from all this .     what i deduce what i ve been sitting here all evening  deducing like a deduction machine is that joranum didn t come from nishaya at all .  in fact  i think he picked nishaya as the place to pretend to come from  simply because it is so backwoodsy  so out of the way  that no one would think of checking it .  he must have made a thorough computer search to find the one world least likely to allow him to be caught in a lie .     but that s ridiculous  hari .  why should he want to pretend to be from a world he did not come from .  it would mean a great deal of falsification of records .     and that s precisely what he has probably done .  he probably has enough followers in the civil service to make that possible .  probably no one person has done as much in the way of revision and all of his followers are too fanatical to talk about it .     but still  why .     because i suspect joranum doesn t want people to know where he really comes from .     why not .  all worlds in the empire are equal  both by laws and by custom .     i don t know about that .  these high ideal theories are somehow never borne out in real life .     then where does he come from .  do you have any idea at all .     yes .  which brings us back to this matter of hair .     what about hair .     i sat there with joranum  staring at him and feeling uneasy  without knowing why i was feeling uneasy .  then finally i realized that it was his hair that made me uneasy .  there was something about it  a life  a gloss  .   .   .  a perfection to it that i ve never seen before .  and then i knew .  his hair is artificial and carefully grown on a scalp that ought to be innocent of such things .     ought to be .   dors s eyes narrowed .  it was clear that she suddenly understood .   do you mean     yes  i do mean .  he s from the past centered  mythology ridden mycogen sector of trantor .  that s what he s been laboring to hide .        dors venabili thought coolly about the matter .  it was her only mode of thought cool .  not for her the hot flashes of emotion .   she closed her eyes to concentrate .  it had been eight years since she and hari had visited mycogen and they hadn t been there long .  there had been little to admire there except the food .   the pictures arose .  the harsh  puritanical  male centered society  the emphasis on the past  the removal of all body hair  a painful process deliberately self imposed to make themselves different so that they would  know who they were   their legends  their memories  or fancies  of a time when they ruled the galaxy  when their lives were prolonged  when robots existed .   dors opened her eyes and said   why  hari .     why what  dear .     why should he pretend not to be from mycogen .    she didn t think he would remember mycogen in greater detail than she  in fact  she knew he wouldn t  but his mind was better than hers different  certainly .  hers was a mind that only remembered and drew the obvious inferences in the fashion of a mathematic line of deduction .  he had a mind that leaped unexpectedly .  seldon liked to pretend that intuition was solely the province of his assistant  yugo amaryl  but dors was not fooled by that .  seldon liked to pose as the unworldly mathematician who stared at the world out of perpetually wondering eyes  but she was not fooled by that  either .    why should he pretend not to be from mycogen .   she repeated as he sat there  his eyes lost in an inward look that dors always associated with his attempt to squeeze one more tiny drop of usefulness and validity out of the concepts of psycho history .   seldon said finally   it s a harsh society  a limiting society .  there are always those who chafe over its manner of dictating every action and every thought .  there are always those who find they cannot entirely be broken to the harness  who want the greater liberties available in the more secular world outside .  it s understandable .     so they force the growth of artificial hair .     no  not generally .  the average breakaway that s what the mycogenians call the deserters and they despise them  of course wears a wig .  it s much simpler but much less effective .  really serious breakaways grow false hair  i m told .  the process is difficult and expensive but is almost unnoticeable .  i ve never come across it before  though i ve heard of it .  i ve spent years studying all eight hundred sectors of trantor  trying to work out the basic rules and mathematics of psychohistory .  i have little enough to show for it  unfortunately  but i have learned a few things .     but why  then  do the breakaways have to hide the fact that they re from mycogen .  they re not persecuted that i know of .     no  they re not .  in fact  there s no general impression that mycogenians are inferior .  it s worse than that .  the mycogenians aren t taken seriously .  they re intelligent everyone admits that highly educated  dignified  cultured  wizards with food  almost frightening in their capacity to keep their sector prosperous but no one takes them seriously .  their beliefs strike people outside mycogen as ridiculous  humorous  unbelievably foolish .  and that view clings even to mycogenians who are breakaways .  a mycogenian attempt to seize power in the government would be crushed by laughter .  being feared is nothing .  being despised  even  can be lived with .  but being laughed at that s fatal .  joranum wants to be first minister  so he must have hair  and  to be comfortable  he must represent himself as having been brought up on some obscure world as far from mycogen as he can possibly manage .     surely there are some people who are naturally bald .     never as completely depilated as mycogenians force themselves to be .  on the outer worlds  it wouldn t matter much .  but mycogen is a distant whisper to the outer worlds .  the mycogenians keep themselves so much to themselves that it is a rare one  indeed  who has ever left trantor .  here on trantor  though  it s different .  people might be bald  but they usually have a fringe of hair that advertises them as nonmycogenian or they grow facial hair .  those very few who are completely hairless usually a pathological condition are out of luck .  i imagine they have to go around with a doctor s certificate to prove they are not mycogenians .    dors  frowning slightly  said   does this help us any .     i m not sure .     couldn t you let it be known that he is a mycegonian .     i m not sure that could be done easily .  he must have covered his tracks well and even if it could be done     yes .    seldon shrugged .   i don t want to invite an appeal to bigotry .  the social situation on trantor is bad enough without running the risk of loosing passions that neither i nor anyone else could then control .  if i do have to resort to the matter of mycogen  it will only be as a last resort .     then you want minimalism  too .     of course .     then what will you do .     i made an appointment with demerzel .  he may know what to do .    dors looked at him sharply .   hari  are you falling into the trap of expecting demerzel to solve every problem for you .     no  but perhaps he ll solve this one .     and if he doesn t .     then i ll have to think of something else  won t i .     like what .    a look of pain crossed seldon s face .   dors  i don t know .  don t expect me to solve every problem  either .        eto demerzel was not frequently seen  except by the emperor cleon .  it was his policy to remain in the background for a variety of reasons  one of which was that his appearance changed so little with time .   hari seldon had not seen him over a period of some years and had not spoken to him truly in private since the days of his early time on trantor .   in light of seldon s recent unsettling meeting with laskin joranum  both seldon and demerzel felt it would be best not to advertise their relationship .  a visit by hari seldon to the first minister s office at the imperial palace would not go unnoticed  and so for reasons of security they had decided to meet in a small yet luxuriously appointed suite at the dome s edge hotel  just outside the palace grounds .   seeing demerzel now brought back the old days achingly .  the mere fact that demerzel still looked exactly as he always had made the ache sharper .  his face still had its strong regular features .  he was still tall and sturdy looking  with the same dark hair with the hint of blond .  he was not handsome  but was gravely distinguished .  he looked like someone s ideal picture of what an imperial first minister ought to look like  not at all like any such official in history before his time ever had .  it was his appearance  seldon thought  that gave him half his power over the emperor  and therefore over the imperial court  and therefore over the empire .   demerzel advanced toward him  a gentle smile curving his lips without altering in any way the gravity of his countenance .    hart   he said .   it is pleasant to see you .  i was half afraid you would change your mind and cancel .     i was more than half afraid you would  first minister .     eto if you fear using my real name .     i couldn t .  it won t come out of me .  you know that .     it will to me .  say it .  i would rather like to hear it .    seldon hesitated  as though he couldn t believe his lips could frame the words or his vocal cords sound them .   daneel   he said at length .    r .  daneel olivaw   said demerzel .   yes .  you will dine with me  hari .  if i dine with you  i won t have to eat  which will be a relief .     gladly  though one way eating is not my idea of a convivial time .  surely a bite or two     to please you     just the same   said seldon   i can t help but wonder if it is wise to spend too much time together .     it is .  imperial orders .  his imperial majesty wants me to .     why  daneel .     in two more years the decennial convention will be meeting again .   you look surprised .  have you forgotten .     not really .  i just haven t thought about it .     were you not going to attend .  you were a hit at the last one .     yes .  with my psychohistory .  some hit .     you attracted the attention of the emperor .  no other mathematician did .     it was you who were initially attracted  not the emperor .  then i had to flee and stay out of the imperial notice until such time as i could assure you that i had made a start on my psychohistorical research  after which you allowed me to remain in safe obscurity .     being the head of a prestigious mathematics department is scarcely obscurity .     yes  it is  since it hides my psychohistory .     ah  the food is arriving .  for a while  let s talk about other things as befits friends .  how is dors .     wonderful .  a true wife .  hounds me to death with her worries over my safety .     that is her job .     so she reminds me frequently .  seriously  daneel  i can never be sufficiently grateful to you for bringing us together .     thank you  hari  but  to be truthful  i did not foresee married happiness for either of you  especially not dors     thank you for the gift just the same  however short of the actual consequences your expectations were .     i m delighted  but it is a gift  you will find  that may be of dubious further consequence as is my friendship .    to this  seldon could make no reply and so  at a gesture from demerzel  he turned to his meal .   after a while  he nodded at the morsel of fish on his fork and said   i don t actually recognize the organism  but this is mycogenian cooking .     yes  it is .  i know you are fond of it .     it s the mycogenians  excuse for existence .  their only excuse .  but they have special meaning to you .  i mustn t forget that .     the special meaning has come to an end .  their ancestors  long  long ago  inhabited the planet of aurora .  they lived three hundred years and more and were the lords of the fifty worlds of the galaxy .  it was an auroran who first designed and produced me .  i don t forget that  i remember it far more accurately and with less distortion than their mycogenian descendants do .  but then  long  long ago  i left them .  i made my choice as to what the good of humanity must be and i have followed it  as best i could  all this time .    seldon said with sudden alarm   can we be overheard .    demerzel seemed amused .   if you have only thought of that now  it is far too late .  but fear not  i have taken the necessary precautions .  nor have you been seen by too many eyes when you came .  nor will you be seen by too many when you leave .  and those who do see you will not be surprised .  i am well known to be an amateur mathematician of great pretensions but of little ability .  that is a source of amusement to those at the court who are not entirely my friends and it would not surprise anyone here that i should be concerned about laying the groundwork for the forthcoming decennial convention .  it is about the convention that i wish to consult you .     i don t know that i can help .  there is only one thing i could possibly talk about at the convention and i can t talk about it .  if i attend at all  it will only be as part of the audience .  i do not intend to present any papers .     i understand .  still  if you would like to hear something curious  his imperial majesty remembers you .     because you have kept me in his mind  i suppose .     no .  i have not labored to do so .  however  his imperial majesty occasionally surprises me .  he is aware of the forthcoming convention and he apparently remembers your talk at the earlier one .  he remains interested in the matter of psychohistory and more may come of it  i must warn you .  it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that he may ask to see you .  the court will surely consider it a great honor to receive the imperial call twice in a single lifetime .     you re joking .  what could be served by my seeing him .     in any case  if you are called to an audience  you can scarcely refuse .   how are your young proteg s  yugo and raych .     surely you know .  i imagine you keep a close eye on me .     yes  i do .  on your safety but not on every aspect of your life .  i am afraid my duties fill much of my time and i am not all seeing .     doesn t dors report .     she would in a crisis .  not otherwise .  she is reluctant to play the role of spy in nonessentials .   again the small smile .   seldon grunted .   my boys are doing well .  yugo is increasingly difficult to handle .  he s more of a psychohistorian than i am and i think he feels i hold him back .  as for raych  he s a lovable rascal always was .  he won me over when he was a dreadful street urchin and what s more surprising is that he won over dors .  i honestly believe  daneel  that if dors grew sick of me and wanted to leave me  she would stay on anyway for her love of raych .    demerzel nodded and seldon continued somberly .   if rashelle of wye hadn t found him lovable  i would not be here today .  i would have been shot down   he stirred uneasily .   i hate to think of that  daneel .  it was such an entirely accidental and unpredictable event .  how could psychohistory have helped in any way .     have you not told me that  at best  psychohistory can deal only in probabilities and with vast numbers  not with individuals .     but if the individual happens to be crucial     i suspect you will find that no individual is ever truly crucial .  not even i or you .     perhaps you re right .  i find that  no matter how i work away under these assumptions  i nevertheless think of myself as crucial  in a kind of supernormal egotism that transcends all sense .   and you are crucial  too  which is something i have come here to discuss with you as frankly as possible .  i must know .     know what .   the remains of the meal had been cleared away by a porter and the room s lighting dimmed somewhat so that the walls seemed to close in and give a feeling of great privacy .   seldon said   joranum .   he bit off the word  as though feeling the mention of the name alone should be sufficient .    ah yes .     you know about him .     of course .  how could i not know .     well  i want to know about him  too .     what do you want to know .     come  daneel  don t play with me .  is he dangerous .     of course he is dangerous .  do you have any doubt of that .     i mean  to you .  to your position as first minister .     that is exactly what i mean .  that is how he is dangerous .     and you allow it .    demerzel leaned forward  placing his left elbow on the table between them .   there are things that don t wait for my permission  hari .  let us be philosophical about it .  his imperial majesty  cleon  first of that name  has now been on the throne for eighteen years and for all that time i have been his chief of staff and then his first minister  having served in scarcely lesser capacities during the last years of the reign of his father .  it is a long time and first ministers rarely remain that long in power .     you are not the ordinary first minister  daneel  and you know it .  you must remain in power while psychohistory is being developed .  don t smile at me .  it s true .  when we first met  eight years ago  you told me the empire was in a state of decay and decline .  have you changed your mind about that .     no  of course not .     in fact  the decline is more marked now  isn t it .     yes  it is  though i labor to prevent that .     and without you  what would happen .  joranum is raising the empire against you .     trantor  hari .  trantor .  the outer worlds are solid and reasonably contented with my deeds so far  even in the midst of a declining economy and lessening trade .     but trantor is where it counts .  trantor the imperial world we re living on  the capital of the empire  the core  the administrative center  is what can overthrow you .  you cannot keep your post if trantor says no .    i agree .     and if you go  who will then take care of the outer worlds and what will keep the decline from being precipitate and the empire from degenerating rapidly into anarchy .     that is a possibility  certainly .     so you must be doing something about it .  yugo is convinced that you are in deadly danger and can t maintain your position .  his intuition tells him so .  dors says the same thing and explains it in terms of the three laws or four of of     robotics   put in demerzel .    young raych seems attracted to joranum s doctrines being of dahlite origin  you see .  and i i am uncertain  so i come to you for comfort  i suppose .  tell me that you have the situation well in hand .     i would do so if i could .  however  i have no comfort to offer .  i am in danger .     are you doing nothing .     no .  i m doing a great deal to contain discontent and blunt joranum s message .  if i had not done so  then perhaps i would be out of office already .  but what i m doing is not enough .    seldon hesitated .  finally he said   i believe that joranum is actually a mycogenian .     is that so .     it is my opinion .  i had thought we might use that against him  but i hesitate to unleash the forces of bigotry .     you are wise to hesitate .  there are many things that might be done that have side effects we do not want .  you see  hari  i don t fear leaving my post if some successor could be found who would continue those principles that i have been using to keep the decline as slow as possible .  on the other hand  if joranum himself were to succeed me  then that  in my opinion  would be fatal .     then anything we can do to stop him would be suitable .     not entirely .  the empire can grow anarchic  even if joranum is destroyed and i stay .  i must not  then  do something that will destroy joranum and allow me to stay if that very deed promotes the fall of the empire .  i have not yet been able to think of anything i might do that would surely destroy joranum and just as surely avoid anarchy .     minimalism     whispered seldon .    pardon me .     dors explained that you would be bound by minimalism .     and so i am .     then my visit with you is a failure  daneel .     you mean that you came for comfort and didn t get it .     i m afraid so .     but i saw you because i sought comfort as well .     from me .     from psychohistory  which should envision the route to safety that i cannot .    seldon sighed heavily .   daneel  psychohistory has not yet been developed to that point .    the first minister looked at him gravely .   you ve had eight years  hari .     it might be eight or eight hundred and it might not be developed to that point .  it is an intractable problem .    demerzel said   i do not expect the technique to have been perfected  but you may have some sketch  some skeleton  some principle that you can use as guidance .  imperfectly  perhaps  but better than mere guesswork .     no more than i had eight years ago   said seldon mournfully .   here s what it amounts to  then .  you must remain in power and joranum must be destroyed in such a way that imperial stability is maintained as long as possible so that i may have a reasonable chance to work out psychohistory .  this cannot be done  however  unless i work out psychohistory first .  is that it .     it would seem so  hari .     then we argue in a useless circle and the empire is destroyed .     unless something unforeseen happens .  unless you make something unforeseen happen .     i .  daneel  how can i do it without psychohistory .     i don t know  hari .    and seldon rose to go in despair .       for days thereafter hari seldon neglected his departmental duties to use his computer in its news gathering mode .   there were not many computers capable of handling the daily news from twenty five million worlds .  there were a number of them at imperial headquarters  where they were absolutely necessary .  some of the larger outer world capitals had them as well  though most were satisfied with hyperconnection to the central newspost on trantor .   a computer at an important mathematics department could  if it were sufficiently advanced  be modified as an independent news source and seldon had been careful to do that with his computer .  it was  after all  necessary for his work on psychohistory  though the computer s capabilities were carefully ascribed to other  exceedingly plausible reasons .   ideally the computer would report anything that was out of the ordinary on any world of the empire .  a coded and unobtrusive warning light would make itself evident and seldon could track it down easily .  such a light rarely showed  for the definition of  out of the ordinary  was tight and intense and dealt with large scale and rare upheavals .   what one did in its absence was to ring in various worlds at random  not all twenty five million  of course  but some dozens .  it was a depressing and even debilitating task  for there were no worlds that didn t have their daily relatively minor catastrophes .  a volcanic eruption here  a flood there  an economic collapse of one sort or another yonder  and  of course  riots .  there had not been a day in the last thousand years that there had not been riots over something or other on each of a hundred or more different worlds .   naturally such things had to be discounted .  one could scarcely worry about riots any more than one could about volcanic eruptions when both were constants on inhabited worlds .  rather  if a day should come in which not one riot was reported anywhere  that might be a sign of something so unusual as to warrant the gravest concern .   concern was what seldon could not make himself feel .  the outer worlds  with all their disorders and misfortunes  were like a great ocean on a peaceful day  with a gentle swell and minor heavings but no more .  he found no evidence of any overall situation that clearly showed a decline in the last eight years or even in the last eighty .  yet demerzel  in demerzel s absence  seldon could no longer think of him as daneel  said the decline was continuing and he had his finger on the empire s pulse from day to day in ways that seldon could not duplicate until such time as he would have the guiding power of psychohistory at his disposal .   it could be that the decline was so small that it was unnoticeable till some crucial point was reached like a domicile that slowly wears out and deteriorates  showing no signs of that deterioration until one night when the roof collapses .   when would the roof collapse .  that was the problem and seldon had no answer .   and on occasion  seldon would check on trantor itself .  there  the news was always considerably more substantial .  for one thing  trantor was the most highly populated of all the worlds  with its forty billion people .  for another  its eight hundred sectors formed a mini empire all its own .  for a third  there were the tedious rounds of governmental functions and the doings of the imperial family to follow .   what struck seldon s eyes  however  was in the dahl sector .  the elections for the dahl sector council had placed five joranumites into office .  this was the first time  according to the commentary  that joranumites had achieved sector office .   it was not surprising .  dahl was a joranumite stronghold if any sector was  but seldon found it a disturbing indication of the progress being made by the demagogue .  he ordered a microchip of the item and took it home with him that evening .   raych looked up from his computer as seldon entered and apparently felt the need to explain himself .   i m helping mom on some reference material she needs   he said .    what about your own work .     done  dad .  all done .     good .   look at this .   he showed raych the chip in his hand before slipping it into the microprojector .   raych glanced at the news item hanging in the air before his eyes and said   yes  i know .     you do .     sure .  i usually keep track of dahl .  you know  home sector and all .     and what do you think about it .     i m not surprised .  are you .  the rest of trantor treats dahl like dirt .  why shouldn t they go for joranum s views .     do you go for them also .     well   raych twisted his face thoughtfully .   i got to admit some things he says appeal to me .  he says he wants equality for all people .  what s wrong with that .     nothing at all if he means it .  if he s sincere .  if he isn t just using it as a ploy to get votes .     true enough  dad  but most dahlites probably figure  what s there to lose .  we don t have equality now  though the laws say we do .     it s a hard thing to legislate .     that s not something to cool you off when you re sweating to death .    seldon was thinking rapidly .  he had been thinking since he had come across this item .  he said   raych  you haven t been in dahl since your mother and i took you out of the sector  have you .     sure i was  when i went with you to dahl five years ago on your visit there .     yes yes  seldon waved a hand in dismissal  but that doesn t count .  we stayed at an intersector hotel  which was not dahlite in the least  and  as i recall  dors never once let you out on the streets alone .  after all  you were only fifteen .  how would you like to visit dahl now  alone  in charge of yourself now that you re fully twenty .    raych chuckled .   mom would never allow that .     i don t say that i enjoy the prospect of facing her with it  but i don t intend to ask her permission .  the question is  would you be willing to do this for me .     out of curiosity .  sure .  i d like to see what s happened to the old place .     can you spare the time from your studies .     sure .  i ll never miss a week or so .  besides  you can tape the lectures and i ll catch up when i get back .  i can get permission .  after all  my old man s on the faculty unless you ve been fired  dad .     not yet .  but i m not thinking of this as a fun vacation .     i d be surprised if you did .  i don t think you know what a fun vacation is  dad .  i m surprised you know the phrase .     don t be impertinent .  when you go there  i want you to meet with laskin joranum .    raych looked startled .   how do i do that .  i don t know where he s gonna be .     he s going to be in dahl .  he s been asked to speak to the dahl sector council with its new joranumite members .  we ll find out the exact day and you can go a few days earlier .     and how do i get to see him  dad .  i don t figure he keeps open house .     i don t  either  but i ll leave that up to you .  you would have known how to do it when you were twelve .  i hope your keen edge hasn t blunted too badly in the intervening years .    raych smiled .   i hope not .  but suppose i do see him .  what then .     well  find out what you can .  what s he s really planning .  what he s really thinking .     do you really think he s gonna tell me .     i wouldn t be surprised if he does .  you have the trick of inspiring confidence  you miserable youngster .  let s talk about it .    and so they did .  several times .   seldon s thoughts were painful .  he was not sure where all this was leading to  but he dared not consult yugo amaryl or demerzel or  most of all  dors .  they might stop him .  they might prove to him that his idea was a poor one and he didn t want that proof .  what he planned seemed the only gateway to salvation and he didn t want it blocked .   but did the gateway exist at all .  raych was the only one  it seemed to seldon  who could possibly manage to worm himself into joranum s confidence  but was raych the proper tool for the purpose .  he was a dahlite and sympathetic to joranum .  how far could seldon trust him .   horrible .  raych was his son and seldon had never had occasion to mistrust raych before .       if seldon doubted the efficacy of his notion  if he feared that it might explode matters prematurely or move them desperately in the wrong direction  if he was filled with an agonizing doubt as to whether raych could be entirely trusted to fulfill his part suitably  he nevertheless had no doubt no doubt whatever as to what dors s reaction would be when presented with the fait accompli .   and he was not disappointed if that was quite the word to express his emotion .   yet  in a manner  he was disappointed  for dors did not raise her voice in horror as he had somehow thought she would  as he had prepared himself to withstand .   but how was he to know .  she was not as other women were and he had never seen her truly angry .  perhaps it was not in her to be truly angry  or what he would consider to be truly angry .   she was merely cold eyed and spoke with low voiced bitter disapproval .   you sent him to dahl .  alone .   very softly .  questioningly .   for a moment seldon quailed at the quiet voice .  then he said firmly   i had to .  it was necessary .     let me understand .  you sent him to that den of thieves  that haunt of assassins  that conglomeration of all that is criminal .     dors .  you anger me when you speak like that .  i would expect only a bigot to use those stereotypes .     you deny that dahl is as i have described .     of course .  there are criminals and slums in dahl .  i know that very well .  we both know that .  but not all of dahl is like that .  and there are criminals and slums in every sector  even in the imperial sector and in streeling .     there are degrees  are there not .  one is not ten .  if all the worlds are crime ridden  if all the sectors are crime ridden  dahl is among the worst  is it not .  you have the computer .  check the statistics .     i don t have to .  dahl is the poorest sector on trantor and there is a positive correlation between poverty  misery  and crime .  i grant you that .     you grant me that .  and you sent him alone .  you might have gone with him  or asked me to go with him  or sent half a dozen of his schoolmates with him .  they would have welcomed a respite from their work  i m sure .     what i need him for requires that he be alone .     and what do you need him for .    but seldon was stubbornly silent about that .   dors said   has it come to this .  you don t trust me .     it s a gamble .  i alone dare take the risk .  i can t involve you or anyone else .     but it s not you taking the risk .  it s poor raych .     he s not taking any risk   said seldon impatiently .   he s twenty years old  young and vigorous and as sturdy as a tree and i don t mean the saplings we have here under glass on trantor .  i m talking about a good solid tree in the heliconian forests .  and he s a twister  which the dahlites aren t .     you and your twisting   said dors  her coldness not thawing one whit .   you think that s the answer to everything .  the dahlites carry knives .  every one of them .  blasters  too  i m sure .     i don t know about blasters .  the laws are pretty strict when it comes to blasters .  as for knives  i m positive raych carries one .  he even carries a knife on campus here  where it s strictly against the law .  do you think he won t have one in dahl .    dors remained silent .   seldon was also silent for a few minutes  then decided it might be time to placate her .  he said   look  i ll tell you this much .  i m hoping he ll see joranum  who will be visiting dahl .     oh .  and what do you expect raych to do .  fill him with bitter regrets over his wicked politics and send him back to mycogen .     come .  really .  if you re going to take this sardonic attitude  there s no use discussing it .   he looked away from her  out the window at the blue gray sky under the dome .   what i expect him to do  and his voice faltered for a moment  is save the empire .     to be sure .  that would be much easier .    seldon s voice firmed .   it s what i expect .  you have no solution .  demerzel himself has no solution .  he as much as said that the solution rests with me .  that s what i m striving for and that s what i need raych for in dahl .  after all  you know that ability of his to inspire affection .  it worked with us and i m convinced it will work with joranum .  if i am right  all may be well .    dors s eyes widened a trifle .   are you now going to tell me that you are being guided by psychohistory .     no .  i m not going to lie to you .  i have not reached the point where i can be guided in any way by psychohistory  but yugo is constantly talking about intuition and i have mine .     intuition .  what s that .  define it .     easily .  intuition is the art  peculiar to the human mind  of working out the correct answer from data that is  in itself  incomplete or even  perhaps  misleading .     and you ve done it .    and seldon said with firm conviction   yes  i have .    but to himself  he thought what he dared not share with dors .  what if raych s charm were gone .  or  worse  what if the consciousness of being a dahlite became too strong for him .       billibotton was billibotton dirty  sprawling  dark  sinuous billibotton exuding decay and yet full of a vitality that raych was convinced was to be found nowhere else on trantor .  perhaps it was to be found nowhere else in the empire  though raych knew nothing  firsthand  of any world but trantor .   he had last seen billibotton when he was not much more than twelve  but even the people seemed to be the same  still a mixture of the hangdog and the irreverent  filled with a synthetic pride and a grumbling resentment  the men marked by their dark rich mustaches and the women by their sacklike dresses that now looked tremendously slatternly to raych s older and more worldly wise eyes .   how could women with dresses like that attract men .   but it was a foolish question .  even when he was twelve  he had had a pretty clear idea of how easily and quickly they could be removed .   so he stood there  lost in thought and memory  passing along a street of store windows and trying to convince himself that he remembered this particular place or that and wondering if  among them all  there were people he did remember who were now eight years older .  those  perhaps  who had been his boyhood friends and he thought uneasily of the fact that  while he remembered some of the nicknames they had pinned on each other  he could not remember any real names .   in fact  the gaps in his memory were enormous .  it was not that eight years was such a long time  but it was two fifths of the lifetime of a twenty year old and his life since leaving billibotton had been so different that all before it had faded like a misty dream .   but the smells were there .  he stopped outside a bakery  low and dingy  and smelled the coconut icing that reeked through the air that he had never quite smelled elsewhere .  even when he had stopped to buy tarts with coconut icing  even when they were advertised as  dahl style   they had been faint imitations no more .   he felt strongly tempted .  well  why not .  he had the credits and dors was not there to wrinkle her nose and wonder aloud how clean or  more likely  not clean the place might be .  who worried about clean in the old days .   the shop was dim and it took a while for raych s eyes to acclimate .  there were a few low tables in the place  with a couple of rather insubstantial chairs at each  undoubtedly where people might have a light repast  the equivalent of moka and tarts .  a young man sat at one of the tables  an empty cup before him  wearing a once white t shirt that probably would have looked even dirtier in a better light .   the baker or  in any case  a server stepped out from a room in the rear and said in a rather surly fashion   what ll ya have .     a coke icer   said raych in just as surly a fashion  he would not be a billibottoner if he displayed courtesy   using the slang term he remembered well from the old days .   the term was still current  for the server handed him the correct item  using his bare fingers .  the boy  raych  would have taken that for granted  but now the man  raych  felt taken slightly aback .    you want a bag .     no   said raych   i ll eat it here .   he paid the server and took the coke icer from the other s hand and bit into its richness  his eyes half closing as he did so .  it had been a rare treat in his boyhood sometimes when he had scrounged the necessary credit to buy one with  sometimes when he had received a bite from a temporarily wealthy friend  most often when he had lifted one when nobody was watching .  now he could buy as many as he wished .    hey   said a voice .   raych opened his eyes .  it was the man at the table  scowling at him .   raych said gently   are you speaking to me  bub .     yeah .  what chuh join  .     eatin  a coke icer .  what s it to ya .   automatically he had assumed the billibotton way of talking .  it was no strain at all .    what chuh doin  in billibotton .     born here .  raised here .  in a bed .  not in a street  like you .   the insult came easily  as though he had never left home .    that so .  you dress pretty good for a billibottoner .  pretty fancy dancy .  got a perfume stink about ya .   and he held up a little finger to imply effeminacy .    i won t talk about your stink .  i went up in the world .     up in the world .  la dee da .    two other men stepped into the bakery .  raych frowned slightly  for he wasn t sure whether they had been summoned or not .  the man at the table said to the newcomers   this guy s gone up in the world .  says he s a billibottoner .    one of the two newcomers shambled a mock salute and grinned with no appearance of amiability .  his teeth were discolored .   ain t that nice .  it s always good to see a billibottoner go up in the world .  gives  em a chance to help their poor unfor chnit sector people .  like  credits .  you can always spare a credit or two for the poor  hey .     how many you got  mister .   said the other  the grin disappearing .    hey   said the man behind the counter .   all you guys get out of my store .  i don t want no trouble in here .     there ll be no trouble   said raych .   i m leaving .    he made to go  but the seated man put a leg in his way .   don t go  pal .  we d miss yer company .     the man behind the counter  clearly fearing the worst  disappeared into the rear .    raych smiled .  he said   one time when i was in billibotton  guys  i was with my old man and old lady and there were ten guys who stopped us .  ten .  i counted them .  we had to take care of them .     yeah .   said the one who had been speaking .   yer old man took care of ten .     my old man .  nah .  he wouldn t waste his time .  my old lady did .  and i can do it better than she can .  and there are only three of you .  so  if you don t mind  out of the way .     sure .  just leave all your credits .  some of your clothes  too .    the man at the table rose to his feet .  there was a knife in his hand .    there you are   said raych .   now you re going to waste my time .   he had finished his coke icer and he half turned .  then  as quickly as thought  he anchored himself to the table  while his right leg shot out and the point of his toe landed unerringly in the groin of the man with the knife .   down he went with a loud cry .  up went the table  driving the second man toward the wall and keeping him there  while raych s right arm flashed out  with the edge of the palm striking hard against the larynx of the third  who coughed and went down .   it had taken two seconds and raych now stood there with a knife in each hand and said   now which one of you wants to move .    they glared at him but remained frozen in place and raych said   in that case  i will now leave .    but the server  who had retreated to the back room  must have summoned help  for three more men had now entered the store  while the server screeched   troublemakers .  nothing but troublemakers .    the newcomers were dressed alike in what was obviously a uniform but one that raych had never seen .  trousers were tucked into boots  loose green t shirts were belted  and odd semispherical hats that looked vaguely comic were perched on top of their heads .  on the front of the left shoulder of each t shirt were the letters jc .   they had the dahlite look about them but not quite the dahlite mustache .  the mustaches were black and thick  but they were carefully trimmed at lip level and were kept from luxuriating too widely .  raych allowed himself an internal sneer .  they lacked the vigor of his own wild mustache  but he had to admit they looked neat and clean .   the leader of these three men said   i m corporal quinber .  what s been going on here .    the defeated billibottoners were scrambling to their feet  clearly the worse for wear .  one was still doubled over  one was rubbing his throat  and the third acted as though one of his shoulders had been wrenched .   the corporal stared at them with a philosophic eye  while his two men blocked the door .  he turned to raych the one man who seemed untouched .   are you a billibottoner  boy .     born and bred  but i ve lived elsewhere for eight years .   he let the billibotton accent recede  but it was still there  at least to the extent that it existed in the corporal s speech as well .  there were other parts of dahl aside from billibotton and some parts with considerable aspirations to gentility .   raych said   are you security officers .  i don t seem to recall the uniform you re     we re not security officers .  you won t find security officers in billibotton much .  we re the joranum guard and we keep the peace here .  we know these three and they ve been warned .  we ll take care of them .  you re our problem  buster .  name .  reference number .    raych told them .    and what happened here .    raych told them .    and your business here .    raych said   look here .  do you have the right to question me .  if you re not security officers     listen   said the corporal in a hard voice   don t you question rights .  we re all there is in billibotton and we have the right because we take the right .  you say you beat up these three men and i believe you .  but you won t beat us up .  we re not allowed to carry blasters   and with that  the corporal slowly pulled out a blaster .    now tell me your business here .    raych sighed .  if he had gone directly to a sector hall  as he should have done if he had not stopped to drown himself in nostalgia for billibotton and coke icers   he said   i have come on important business to see mr .  joranum  and since you seem to be part of his organi     to see the leader .     yes  corporal .     with two knives on you .     for self defense .  i wasn t going to have them on me when i saw mr .  joranum .     so you say .  we re taking you into custody  mister .  we ll get to the bottom of this .  it may take time  but we will .     but you don t have the right .  you re not the legally const     well  find someone to complain to .  till then  you re ours .    and the knives were confiscated and raych was taken into custody .       cleon was no longer quite the handsome young monarch that his holographs portrayed .  perhaps he still was in the holographs but his mirror told a different story .  his most recent birthday had been celebrated with the usual pomp and ritual  but it was his fortieth just the same .   the emperor could find nothing wrong with being forty .  his health was perfect .  he had gained a little weight but not much .  his face would perhaps look older  if it were not for the microadjustments that were made periodically and that gave him a slightly enameled look .   he had been on the throne for eighteen years already one of the longer reigns of the century and he felt there was nothing that might necessarily keep him from reigning another forty years and perhaps having the longest reign in imperial history as a result .   cleon looked at the mirror again and thought he looked a bit better if he did not actualize the third dimension .   now take demerzel faithful  reliable  necessary  unbearable demerzel .  no change in him .  he maintained his appearance and  as far as cleon knew  there had been no microadjustments  either .  of course  demerzel was so close mouthed about everything .  and he had never been young .  there had been no young look about him when he first served cleon s father and cleon had been the boyish prince imperial .  and there was no young look about him now .  was it better to have looked old at the start and to avoid change afterward .   change .   it reminded him that he had called demerzel in for a purpose and not just so that he might stand there while the emperor ruminated .  demerzel would take too much imperial rumination as a sign of old age .    demerzel   he said .    sire .     this fellow joranum .  i tire of hearing of him .     there is no reason you should hear of him  sire .  he is one of those phenomena that are thrown to the surface of the news for a while and then disappears .     but he doesn t disappear .     sometimes it takes a while  sire .     what do you think of him  demerzel .     he is dangerous but has a certain popularity .  it is the popularity that increases the danger .     if you find him dangerous and if i find him annoying  why must we wait .  can t he simply be imprisoned or executed or something .     the political situation on trantor  sire  is delicate     it is always delicate .  when have you told me that it is anything but delicate .     we live in delicate times  sire .  it would be useless to move strongly against him if that would but exacerbate the danger .     i don t like it .  i may not be widely read an emperor doesn t have the time to be widely read but i know my imperial history  at any rate .  there have been a number of cases of these populists  as they are called  that have seized power in the last couple of centuries .  in every case  they reduced the reigning emperor to a mere figurehead .  i do not wish to be a figurehead  demerzel .     it is unthinkable that you would be  sire .     it won t be unthinkable if you do nothing .     i am attempting to take measures  sire  but cautious ones .     there s one fellow  at least  who isn t cautious .  a month or so ago  a university professor a professor stopped a potential joranumite riot single handedly .  he stepped right in and put a stop to it .     so he did  sire .  how did you come to hear of it .     because he is a certain professor in whom i am interested .  how is it that you didn t speak to me of this .    demerzel said  almost obsequiously   would it be right for me to trouble you with every insignificant detail that crosses my desk .     insignificant .  this man who took action was hari seldon .     that was  indeed  his name .     and the name was a familiar one .  did he not present a paper  some years ago  at the last decennial convention that interested us .     yes  sire .    cleon looked pleased .   as you see  i do have a memory .  i need not depend on my staff for everything .  i interviewed this seldon fellow on the matter of his paper  did i not .     your memory is indeed flawless  sire .     what happened to his idea .  it was a fortune telling device .  my flawless memory does not bring to mind what he called it .     psychohistory  sire .  it was not precisely a fortune telling device but a theory as to ways of predicting general trends in future human history .     and what happened to it .     nothing  sire .  as i explained at the time  the idea turned out to be wholly impractical .  it was a colorful idea but a useless one .     yet he is capable of taking action to stop a potential riot .  would he have dared do this if he didn t know in advance he would succeed .  isn t that evidence that this what .  psychohistory is working .     it is merely evidence that hari seldon is foolhardy  sire .  even if the psychohistoric theory were practical  it would not have been able to yield results involving a single person or a single action .     you re not the mathematician  demerzel .  he is .  i think it is time i questioned him again .  after all  it is not long before the decennial convention is upon us once more .     it would be a useless     demerzel  i desire it .  see to it .     yes  sire .        raych was listening with an agonized impatience that he was trying not to show .  he was sitting in an improvised cell  deep in the warrens of billibotton  having been accompanied through alleys he no longer remembered .   he  who in the old days could have threaded those same alleys unerringly and lost any pursuer .    the man with him  clad in the green of the joranumite guard  was either a missionary  a brainwasher  or a kind of theologian manque .  at any rate  he had announced his name to be sander nee and he was delivering a long message in a thick dahlite accent that he had clearly learned by heart .    if the people of dahl want to enjoy equality  they must show themselves worthy of it .  good rule  quiet behavior  seemly pleasures are all requirements .  aggressiveness and the bearing of knives are the accusations others make against us to justify their intolerance .  we must be clean in word and    raych broke in .   i agree with you  guardsman nee  every word .  but i must see mr .  joranum .    slowly the guardsman shook his head .   you can t  less you got some appointment  some permission .     look  i m the son of an important professor at streeling university  a mathematics professor .     don t know no professor .   i thought you said you was from dahl .     of course i am .  can t you tell the way i talk .     and you got an old man who s a professor at a big university .  that don t sound likely .     well  he s my foster father .    the guardsman absorbed that and shook his head .   you know anyone in dahl .     there s mother rittah .  she ll know me .    she had been very old when she had known him .  she might be senile by now or dead .     never heard of her .     who else .  he had never known anyone likely to penetrate the dim consciousness of this man facing him .  his best friend had been another youngster named smoodgie or at least that was the only name he knew him by .  even in his desperation  raych could not see himself saying   do you know someone my age named smoodgie .     finally he said   there s yugo amaryl .    a dim spark seemed to light nee s eyes .   who .     yugo amaryl   said raych eagerly .   he works for my foster father at the university .     he a dahlite  too .  everyone at the university dahlites .     just he and i .  he was a heatsinker .     what s he doing at the university .     my father took him out of the heatsinks eight years ago .     well  i ll send someone .    raych had to wait .  even if he escaped  where would he go in the intricate alleyways of billibotton without being picked up instantly .   twenty minutes passed before nee returned with the corporal who had arrested raych in the first place .  raych felt a little hope  the corporal  at least  might conceivably have some brains .   the corporal said   who is this dahlite you know .     yugo amaryl  corporal  a heatsinker who my father found here in dahl eight years ago and took to streeling university with him .     why did he do that .     my father thought yugo could do more important things than heatsink  corporal .     like what .     mathematics .  he    the corporal held up his hand .   what heatsink did he work in .    raych thought for a moment .   i was only a kid then  but it was at c    i think .     close enough .  c   .     then you know about him  corporal .     not personally  but the story is famous in the heatsinks and i ve worked there  too .  and maybe that s how you ve heard of it .  have you any evidence that you really know yugo amaryl .     look .  let me tell you what i d like to do .  i m going to write down my name on a piece of paper and my father s name .  then i m going to write down one word .  get in touch any way you want with some official in mr .  joranum s group mr .  joranum will be here in dahl tomorrow and just read him my name  my father s name  and the one word .  if nothing happens  then i ll stay here till i rot  i suppose  but i don t think that will happen .  in fact  i m sure that they will get me out of here in three seconds and that you ll get a promotion for passing along the information .  if you refuse to do this  when they find out i am here and they will you will be in the deepest possible trouble .  after all  if you know that yugo amaryl went off with a big shot mathematician  just tell yourself that same big shot mathematician is my father .  his name is hari seldon .    the corporal s face showed clearly that the name was not unknown to him .   he said   what s the one word you re going to write down .     psychohistory .    the corporal frowned .   what s that .     that doesn t matter .  just pass it along and see what happens .    the corporal handed him a small sheet of paper  torn out of a notebook .   all right .  write it down and we ll see what happens .    raych realized that he was trembling .  he wanted very much to know what would happen .  it depended entirely on who it was that the corporal would talk to and what magic the word would carry with it .       hari seldon watched the raindrops form on the wraparound windows of the imperial ground car and a sense of nostalgia stabbed at him unbearably .   it was only the second time in his eight years on trantor that he had been ordered to visit the emperor in the only open land on the planet and both times the weather had been bad .  the first time  shortly after he had arrived on trantor  the bad weather had merely irritated him .  he had found no novelty in it .  his home world of helicon had its share of storms  after all  particularly in the area where he had been brought up .   but now he had lived for eight years in make believe weather  in which storms consisted of computerized cloudiness at random intervals  with regular light rains during the sleeping hours .  raging winds were replaced by zephyrs and there were no extremes of heat and cold merely little changes that made you unzip the front of your shirt once in a while or throw on a light jacket .  and he had heard complaints about even so mild a deviation .   but now hari was seeing real rain coming down drearily from a cold sky and he had not seen such a thing in years and he loved it  that was the thing .  it reminded him of helicon  of his youth  of relatively carefree days  and he wondered if he might persuade the driver to take the long way to the palace .   impossible .  the emperor wanted to see him and it was a long enough trip by ground car  even if one went in a straight line with no interfering traffic .  the emperor  of course  would not wait .   it was a different cleon from the one seldon had seen eight years before .  he had put on about ten pounds and there was a sulkiness about his face .  yet the skin around his eyes and cheeks looked pinched and hari recognized the results of one too many microadjustments .  in a way  seldon felt sorry for cleon for all his might and imperial sway  the emperor was powerless against the passage of time .   once again cleon met hari seldon alone in the same lavishly furnished room of their first encounter .  as was the custom  seldon waited to be addressed .   after briefly assessing seldon s appearance  the emperor said in an ordinary voice   glad to see you  professor .  let us dispense with formalities  as we did on the former occasion on which i met you .     yes  sire   said seldon stiffly .  it was not always safe to be informal  merely because the emperor ordered you to be so in an effusive moment .   cleon gestured imperceptibly and at once the room came alive with automation as the table set itself and dishes began to appear .  seldon  confused  could not follow the details .   the emperor said casually   you will dine with me  seldon .    it had the formal intonation of a question but the force  somehow  of an order .    i would be honored  sire   said seldon .  he looked around cautiously .  he knew very well that one did not  or  at any rate  should not  ask questions of the emperor  but he saw no way out of it .  he said  rather quietly  trying to make it not sound like a question   the first minister will not dine with us .     he will not   said cleon .   he has other tasks at this moment and i wish  in any case  to speak to you privately .    they ate quietly for a while  cleon gazing at him fixedly and seldon smiling tentatively .  cleon had no reputation for cruelty or even for irresponsibility  but he could  in theory  have seldon arrested on some vague charge and  if the emperor wished to exert his influence  the case might never come to trial .  it was always best to avoid notice and at the moment seldon couldn t manage it .   surely it had been worse eight years ago  when he had been brought to the palace under armed guard .   this fact did not make seldon feel relieved  however .   then cleon spoke .   seldon  he said .   the first minister is of great use to me  yet i feel that  at times  people may think i do not have a mind of my own .  do you think that .     never  sire   said seldon calmly .  no use protesting too much .    i don t believe you .  however  i do have a mind of my own and i recall that when you first came to trantor you had this psychohistory thing you were playing with .     i m sure you also remember  sire   said seldon softly   that i explained at the time it was a mathematical theory without practical application .     so you said .  do you still say so .     yes  sire .     have you been working on it since .     on occasion i toy with it  but it comes to nothing .  chaos unfortunately interferes and predictability is not    the emperor interrupted .   there is a specific problem i wish you to tackle .   do help yourself to the dessert  seldon .  it is very good .     what is the problem  sire .     this man joranum .  demerzel tells me oh  so politely that i cannot arrest this man and i cannot use armed force to crush his followers .  he says it will simply make the situation worse .     if the first minister says so  i presume it is so .     but i do not want this man joranum  .   .   .   .  at any rate  i will not be his puppet .  demerzel does nothing .     i am sure that he is doing what he can  sire .     if he is working to alleviate the problem  he certainly is not keeping me informed .     that may be  sire  out of a natural desire to keep you above the fray .  the first minister may feel that if joranum should if he should     take over   said cleon with a tone of infinite distaste .    yes  sire .  it would not be wise to have it appear that you were personally opposed to him .  you must remain untouched for the sake of the stability of the empire .     i would much rather assure the stability of the empire without joranum .  what do you suggest  seldon .     i  sire .     you  seldon   said cleon impatiently .   let me say that i don t believe you when you say that psychohistory is just a game .  demerzel stays friendly with you .  do you think i am such an idiot as not to know that .  he expects something from you .  he expects psychohistory from you and since i am no fool  i expect it  too .   seldon  are you for joranum .  the truth .     no  sire  i am not for him .  i consider him an utter danger to the empire .     very well  i believe you .  you stopped a potential joranumite riot at your university grounds single handedly  i understand .     it was pure impulse on my part  sire .     tell that to fools  not to me .  you had worked it out by psychohistory .     sire .     don t protest .  what are you doing about joranum .  you must be doing something if you are on the side of the empire .     sire   said seldon cautiously  uncertain as to how much the emperor knew .   i have sent my son to meet with joranum in the dahl sector .     why .     my son is a dahlite and shrewd .  he may discover something of use to us .     may .     only may  sire .     you ll keep me informed .     yes  sire .     and  seldon  do not tell me that psychohistory is just a game  that it does not exist .  i do not want to hear that .  i expect you to do something about joranum .  what it might be  i can t say  but you must do something .  i will not have it otherwise .  you may go .    seldon returned to streeling university in a far darker mood than when he had left .  cleon had sounded as though he would not accept failure .   it all depended on raych now .       raych sat in the anteroom of a public building in dahl into which he had never ventured never could have ventured as a ragamuffin youth .  he felt  in all truth  a little uneasy about it now  as though he were trespassing .   he tried to look calm  trustworthy  lovable .   dad had told him that this was a quality he carried around with him  but he had never been conscious of it .  if it came about naturally  he would probably spoil it by trying too hard to seem to be what he really was .   he tried relaxing while keeping an eye on the official who was manipulating a computer at the desk .  the official was not a dahlite .  he was  in fact  gambol deen namarti  who had been with joranum at the meeting with dad that raych had attended .   every once in a while  namarti would look up from his desk and glance at raych with a hostile glare .  this namarti wasn t buying raych s lovability .  raych could see that .   raych did not try to meet namarti s hostility with a friendly smile .  it would have seemed too artificial .  he simply waited .  he had gotten this far .  if joranum arrived  as he was expected to  raych would have a chance to speak to him .   joranum did arrive  sweeping in  smiling his public smile of warmth and confidence .  namarti s hand came up and joranum stopped .  they spoke together in low voices while raych watched intently and tried in vain to seem as if he wasn t .  it seemed plain to raych that namarti was arguing against the meeting and raych bridled a bit at that .   then joranum looked at raych  smiled  and pushed namarti to one side .  it occurred to raych that  while namarti was the brains of the team  it was joranum who clearly had the charisma .   joranum strode toward him and held out a plump  slightly moist hand .   well well .  professor seldon s young man .  how are you .     fine  thank you  sir .     you had some trouble getting here  i understand .     not too much  sir .     and you ve come with a message from your father  i trust .  i hope he is reconsidering his decision and has decided to join me in my great crusade .     i don t think so  sir .    joranum frowned slightly .   are you here without his knowledge .     no  sir .  he sent me .     i see .   are you hungry  lad .     not at the moment  sir .     then would you mind if i eat .  i don t get much time for the ordinary amenities of life   he said  smiling broadly .    it s all right with me  sir .    together  they moved to a table and sat down .  joranum unwrapped a sandwich and took a bite .  his voice slightly muffled  he said   and why did he send you  son .    raych shrugged .   i think he thought i might find out something about you that he could use against you .  he s heart and soul with first minister demerzel .     and you re not .     no  sir .  i m a dahlite .     i know you are  mr .  seldon  but what does that mean .     it means i m oppressed  so i m on your side and i want to help you .  of course  i wouldn t want my father to know .     there s no reason he should know .  how do you propose to help me .   he glanced quickly at namarti  who was leaning against his desk  listening  with his arms folded and his expression lowering .   do you know anything about psychohistory .     no  sir .  my father don t talk to me about that and if he did  i wouldn t get it .  i don t think he s getting anywhere with that stuff .     are you sure .     sure i m sure .  there s a guy there  yugo amaryl  also a dahlite  who talks about it sometimes .  i m sure nothing is happening .     ah .  and can i see yugo amaryl sometime  do you suppose .     i don t think so .  he ain t much for demerzel  but he s all for my father .  he wouldn t cross him .     but you would .    raych looked unhappy and he muttered stubbornly   i m a dahlite .    joranum cleared his throat .   then let me ask you again .  how do you propose to help me  young man .     i ve got something to tell you that maybe you won t believe .     indeed .  try me .  if i don t believe it  i will tell you so .     it s about first minister eto demerzel .     well .    raych looked around uneasily .   can anyone hear me .     just namarti and myself .     all right  then listen .  this guy demerzel ain t a guy .  he s a robot .     what .   exploded joranum .   raych felt moved to explain .   a robot is a mechanical man  sir .  he ain t human .  he s a machine .    namarti broke out passionately   jo jo  don t believe that .  it s ridiculous .    but joranum held up an admonitory hand .  his eyes were gleaming .   why do you say that .     my father was in mycogen once .  he told me all about it .  in mycogen they talk about robots a lot .     yes  i know .  at least  i have heard so .     the mycogenians believe that robots were once very common among their ancestors  but they were wiped out .    namarti s eyes narrowed .   but what makes you think that demerzel is a robot .  from what little i have heard of these fantasies  robots are made out of metal  aren t they .     that s so   said raych earnestly .   but what i heard is that there were a few robots that look just like human beings and they live forever    namarti shook his head violently .   legends .  ridiculous legends .  jojo  why are we listening    but joranum cut him off quickly .   no  g . d .  i want to listen .  i ve heard these legends  too .     but it s nonsense  jo jo .     don t be in such a rush to say  nonsense .   and even if it were  people live and die by nonsense .  it s not what is so much as what people think is .   tell me  young man  putting legends to one side  what makes you think demerzel is a robot .  let s suppose that robots exist .  what is it  then  about demerzel that makes you say he is a robot .  did he tell you so .     no  sir   said raych .    did your father tell you so .   asked joranum .    no  sir .  it s just my own idea  but i m sure of it .     why .  what makes you so sure .     it s just something about him .  he doesn t change .  he doesn t get older .  he doesn t show emotions .  something about him looks like he s made of metal .    joranum sat back in his chair and looked at raych for an extended time .  it was almost possible to hear his thoughts buzzing .   finally he said   suppose he is a robot  young man .  why should you care .  does it matter to you .     of course it matters to me   said raych .   i m a human being .  i don t want no robot in charge of running the empire .    joranum turned to namarti with a gesture of eager approval .   do you hear that  g . d .  .   i m a human being .  i don t want no robot in charge of running the empire .   put him on holovision and have him say it .  have him repeat it over and over till it s drummed into every person on trantor     hey   said raych  finally catching his breath .   i can t say that on holovision .  i can t let my father find out     no  of course not   said joranum quickly .   we couldn t allow that .  we ll just use the words .  we ll find some other dahlite .  someone from each of the sectors  each in his own dialect  but always the same message   i don t want no robot in charge of running the empire .     namarti said   and what happens when demerzel proves he s not a robot .     really   said joranum .   how will he do that .  it would be impossible for him to do so .  psychologically impossible .  what .  the great demerzel  the power behind the throne  the man who has twitched the strings attached to cleon i all these years and those attached to cleon   s father before him .  will he climb down now and whine to the public that he is  too  a human being .  that would be almost as destructive to him as being a robot .  g . d .   we have the villain in a no win situation and we owe it all to this fine young man here .    raych flushed .   joranum said   raych is your name  isn t it .  once our party is in a position to do so  we won t forget .  dahl will be treated well and you will have a good position with us .  you re going to be dahl s sector leader someday  raych  and you re not going to regret you ve done this .  are you  now .     not on your life   said raych fervently .    in that case  we ll see that you get back to your father .  you let him know that we intend him no harm  that we value him greatly .  you can tell him you found that out in any way you please .  and if you find anything else you think we might be able to use about psychohistory  in particular  you let us know .     you bet .  but do you mean it when you say you ll see to it that dahl gets some breaks .     absolutely .  equality of sectors  my boy .  equality of worlds .  we ll have a new empire with all the old villainies of privilege and inequality wiped out .    and raych nodded his head vigorously .   that s what i want .        cleon  emperor of the galaxy  was walking hurriedly through the arcade that led from his private quarters in the small palace to the offices of the rather tremendous staff that lived in the various annexes of the imperial palace  which served as the nerve center of the empire .   several of his personal attaches walked after him  with looks of the deepest concern on their faces .  the emperor did not walk to others .  he summoned them and they came to him .  if he did walk  he never showed signs of haste or emotional trauma .  how could he .  he was the emperor and  as such  far more a symbol of all the worlds than a human being .   yet now he seemed to be a human being .  he motioned everyone aside with an impatient wave of his right hand .  in his left hand he held a gleaming hologram .    the first minister   he said in an almost strangled voice  not at all like the carefully cultivated tones he had painstakingly assumed along with the throne .   where is he .    and all the high functionaries who were in his way fumbled and gasped and found it impossible to manage coherence .  he brushed past them angrily  making them all feel  undoubtedly  as though they were living through a waking nightmare .   finally he burst into demerzel s private office  panting slightly  and shouted literally shouted   demerzel .    demerzel looked up with a trace of surprise and rose smoothly to his feet  for one did not sit in the presence of the emperor unless specifically invited to .   sire .   he said .   and the emperor slammed the hologram down on demerzel s desk and said   what is this .  will you tell me that .    demerzel looked at what the emperor had given him .  it was a beautiful hologram  sharp and alive .  one could almost hear the little boy perhaps ten years old speaking the words that were included in the caption   i don t want no robot in charge of running the empire .    demerzel said quietly   sire  i have received this  too .     and who else has .     i am under the impression  sire  that it is a flier that is being widely spread over trantor .     yes  and do you see the person at whom that brat is looking .   he tapped his imperial forefinger at it .   isn t that you .     the resemblance is striking  sire .     am i wrong in supposing that the whole intent of this flier  as you call it  is to accuse you of being a robot .     that does seem to be its intention  sire .     and stop me if i m wrong  but aren t robots the legendary mechanical human beings one finds in in thrillers and children s stories .     the mycogenians have it as an article of faith  sire  that robots     i m not interested in the mycogenians and their articles of faith .  why are they accusing you of being a robot .     merely a metaphorical point  i m sure  sire .  they wish to portray me as a man of no heart  whose views are the conscienceless calculations of a machine .     that s too subtle  demerzel .  i m no fool .   he tapped the hologram again .   they re trying to make people believe you are really a robot .     we can scarcely prevent it  sire  if people choose to believe that .     we cannot afford it .  it detracts from the dignity of your office .  worse than that  it detracts from the dignity of the emperor  the implication is that i i would choose as my first minister a mechanical man .  that is impossible to endure .  see here  demerzel  aren t there laws that forbid the denigration of public officers of the empire .     yes  there are and quite severe ones  sire  dating back to the great law codes of aburamis .     and to denigrate the emperor himself is a capital offense  is it not .     death is the punishment  sire .  yes .     well  this not only denigrates you  it denigrates me and whoever did it should be executed forthwith .  it was this joranum  of course  who is behind it .     undoubtedly .  sire  but proving it might be rather difficult .     nonsense .  i have proof enough .  i want an execution .     the trouble is  sire  that the laws of denigration are virtually never enforced .  not in this century  certainly .     and that is why society is becoming so unstable and the empire is being shaken to its roots .  the laws are still in the books  so enforce them .    demerzel said   consider  sire  if that would be wise .  it would make you appear to be a tyrant and a despot .  your rule has been a most successful one through kindness and mildness     yes and see where that got me .  let s have them fear me for a change  rather than love me in this fashion .     i strongly recommend that you not do so  sire .  it may be the spark that will start a rebellion .     what would you do  then .  go before the people and say   look at me .  i am no robot .      no  sire  for as you say that would destroy my dignity and  worse yet  yours .     then .     i am not certain  sire .  i have not yet thought it through .     not yet thought it through .   get in touch with seldon .     sire .     what is so difficult to understand about my order .  get in touch with seldon .     you wish me to summon him to the palace  sire .     no  there s no time for that .  i presume you can set up a sealed communication line between us that cannot be tapped .     certainly  sire .     then do so .  now .        seldon lacked demerzel s self possession  being  as he was  only flesh and blood .  the summons to his office and the sudden faint glow and tingle of the scrambler field was indication enough that something unusual was taking place .  he had spoken by sealed lines before but never to the full extent of imperial security .   he expected some government official to clear the way for demerzel himself .  considering the slowly mounting tumult of the robot flier  he could expect nothing less .   but he did not expect anything more  either  and when the image of the emperor himself  with the faint glitter of the scramble field outlining him  stepped into his office  so to speak   seldon fell back in his seat  mouth wide open  and could make only ineffectual attempts to rise .   cleon motioned him impatiently to keep his seat .   you must know what s going on  seldon .     do you mean about the robot flier  sire .     that s exactly what i mean .  what s to be done .    seldon  despite the permission to remain seated  finally rose .   there s more  sire .  joranum is organizing rallies all over trantor on the robot issue .  at least  that s what i hear on the newscasts .     it hasn t reached me yet .  of course not .  why should the emperor know what is going on .     it is not for the emperor to be concerned  sire .  i m sure that the first minister     the first minister will do nothing  not even keep me informed .  i turn to you and your psychohistory .  tell me what to do .      sire .     i m not going to play your game  seldon .  you ve been working on psychohistory for eight years .  the first minister tells me i must not take legal action against joranum .  what  then  do i do .    seldon stuttered .   s sire .  nothing .     you have nothing to tell me .     no  sire .  that is not what i mean .  i mean you must do nothing .  nothing .  the first minister is quite right if he tells you that you must not take legal action .  it will make things worse .     very well .  what will make things better .     for you to do nothing .  for the first minister to do nothing .  for the government to allow joranum to do just as he pleases .     how will that help .    and seldon said  trying to suppress the note of desperation in his voice   that will soon be seen .    the emperor seemed to deflate suddenly  as though all the anger and indignation had been drawn out of him .  he said   ah .  i understand .  you have the situation well in hand .     sire .  i have not said that     you need not say .  i have heard enough .  you have the situation well in hand  but i want results .  i still have the imperial guard and the armed forces .  they will be loyal and  if it comes to actual disorders  i will not hesitate .  but i will give you your chance first .    his image flashed out and seldon sat there  simply staring at the empty space where the image had been .   ever since the first unhappy moment when he had mentioned psychohistory at the decennial convention eight years before  he had had to face the fact that he didn t have what he had incautiously talked about .   all he had was the wild ghost of some thoughts and what yugo amaryl called intuition .       in two days joranum had swept trantor  partly by himself  mostly through his lieutenants .  as hari muttered to dors  it was a campaign that had all the marks of military efficiency .   he was born to be a war admiral in the old days   he said .   he s wasted on politics .    and dors said   wasted .  at this rate  he s going to make himself first minister in a week and  if he wishes  emperor in two weeks .  there are reports that some of the military garrisons are cheering him .    seldon shook his head .   it will collapse  dors .     what .  joranum s party or the empire .     joranum s party .  the story of the robot has created an instant stir  especially with the effective use of that flier  but a little thought  a little coolness  and the public will see it for the ridiculous accusation it is .     but  hari   said dors tightly   you needn t pretend with me .  it is not a ridiculous story .  how could joranum possibly have found out that demerzel is a robot .     oh  that .   why  raych told him so .     raych .     that s right .  he did his job perfectly and got back safely with the promise of being made dahl s sector leader someday .  of course he was believed .  i knew he would be .     you mean you told raych that demerzel was a robot and had him pass on the news to joranum .   dors looked utterly horrified .    no  i couldn t do that .  you know i couldn t tell raych or anyone that demerzel was a robot .  i told raych as firmly as i could that demerzel was not a robot and even that much was difficult .  but i did ask him to tell joranum that he was .  he is under the firm impression that he lied to joranum .     but why  hari .  why .     it s not psychohistory  i ll tell you that .  don t you join the emperor in thinking i m a magician .  i just wanted joranum to believe that demerzel was a robot .  he s a mycogenian by birth  so he was filled from youth with his culture s tales of robots .  therefore  he was predisposed to believe and he was convinced that the public would believe with him .     well  won t they .     not really .  after the initial shock is over  they will realize that it s madcap fiction or they will think so .  i ve persuaded demerzel that he must give a talk on subetheric holovision to be broadcast to key portions of the empire and to every sector on trantor .  he is to talk about everything but the robot issue .  there are enough crises  we all know  to fill such a talk .  people will listen and will hear nothing about robots .  then  at the end  he will be asked about the flier and he need not answer a word .  he need only laugh .     laugh .  i ve never known demerzel to laugh .  he almost never smiles .     this time  dors  he ll laugh .  it is the one thing that no one ever visualizes a robot doing .  you ve seen robots in holographic fantasies  haven t you .  they re always pictured as literal minded  unemotional  inhuman  that s what people are sure to expect .  so demerzel need merely laugh .  and on top of that  do you remember sunmaster fourteen  the religious leader of mycogen .     of course i do .  literal minded  unemotional  inhuman .  he s never laughed  either .     and he won t this time .  i ve done a lot of work on this joranum matter since i had that little set to at the field .  i know joranum s real name .  i know where he was born  who his parents were  where he had his early training  and all of it  with documentary proof  has gone to sunmaster fourteen .  i don t think sunmaster likes breakaways .     but i thought you said you don t wish to spark off bigotry .     i don t .  if i had given the information to the holovision people  i would have  but i ve given it to sunmaster  where  after all  it belongs .     and he ll start off the bigotry .     of course he won t .  no one on trantor would pay any attention to sunmaster whatever he might say .     then what s the point .     well  that s what we ll see  dors .  i don t have a psychohistorical analysis of the situation .  i don t even know if one is possible .  i just hope that my judgment is right .        eto demerzel laughed .   it was not the first time .  he sat there  with hari seldon and dors venabili in a tap free room  and  every once in a while  at a signal from hari  he would laugh .  sometimes he leaned back and laughed uproariously  but seldon shook his head .   that would never sound convincing .    so demerzel smiled and then laughed with dignity and seldon made a face .   i m stumped   he said .   it s no use trying to tell you funny stories .  you get the point only intellectually .  you will simply have to memorize the sound .    dors said   use a holographic laughtrack .     no .  that would never be demerzel .  that s a bunch of idiots being paid to yak .  it s not what i want .  try again  demerzel .    demerzel tried again until seldon said   all right  then  memorize that sound and reproduce it when you re asked the question .  you ve got to look amused .  you can t make the sound of laughing  however proficient  with a grave face .  smile a little  just a little .  pull back the corner of your mouth .   slowly demerzel s mouth widened into a grin .   not bad .  can you make your eyes twinkle .     what do you mean   twinkle    said dors indignantly .   no one makes their eyes twinkle .  that s a metaphorical expression .     no  it s not   said seldon .   there s the hint of tears in the eye sadness  joy  surprise  whatever and the reflection of light from that hint of fluid is what does it .     well  do you seriously expect demerzel to produce tears .    and demerzel said  matter of factly   my eyes do produce tears for general cleansing never in excess .  perhaps  though  if i imagine my eyes to be slightly irritated     try it   said seldon .   it can t hurt .    and so it was that when the talk on subetheric holovision was over and the words were streaking out to millions of worlds at thousands of times the effective speed of light words that were grave  matter of fact  informative  and without rhetorical embellishment and that discussed everything but robots demerzel declared himself ready to answer questions .   he did not have to wait long .  the very first question was   mr .  first minister  are you a robot .    demerzel simply stared calmly and let the tension build .  then he smiled  his body shook slightly  and he laughed .  it was not a loud uproarious laugh  but it was a rich one  the laugh of someone enjoying a moment of fantasy .  it was infectious .  the audience tittered and then laughed along with him .   demerzel waited for the laughter to die down and then  eyes twinkling  said   must i really answer that .  is it necessary to do so .   he was still smiling as the screen darkened .        i m sure it worked   said seldon .   naturally we won t have a complete reversal instantly .  it takes time .  but things are moving in the right direction now .  i noticed that when i stopped namarti s talk at the university field .  the audience was with him until i faced him and showed spunk against odds .  the audience began to change sides at once .     do you think this is an analogous situation .   asked dors dubiously .    of course .  if i don t have psychohistory  i can use analogy and the brains i was born with  i suppose .  there was the first minister  beleaguered on all sides with the accusation  and he faced it down with a smile and a laugh  the most nonrobot thing he could have done  so that in itself was an answer to the question .  of course sympathy began to slide to his side .  nothing would stop that .  but that s only the beginning .  we have to wait for sunmaster fourteen and hear what he has to say .     are you confident there  too .     absolutely .        tennis was one of hari s favorite sports  but he preferred to play rather than watch others .  he watched with impatience  therefore  as the emperor cleon  dressed in sports fashion  loped across the court to return the ball .  it was imperial tennis  actually  so called because it was a favorite of emperors  a version of the game in which a computerized racket was used that could alter its angle slightly with appropriate pressures on the handle .  hari had tried to develop the technique on several occasions but found that mastering the computerized racket would take a great deal of practice and hari seldon s time was far too precious for what was clearly a trivial pursuit .   cleon placed the ball in a nonreturnable position and won the game .  he trotted off the court to the careful applause of the functionaries who were watching and seldon said to him   congratulations  sire .  you played a marvelous game .    cleon said indifferently   do you think so  seldon .  they re all so careful to let me win .  i get no pleasure out of it .     eldon said   in that case  sire  you might order your opponents to play harder .     it wouldn t help .  they d be careful to lose anyway .  and if they did win  i would get even less pleasure out of losing than out of winning meaninglessly .  being an emperor has its woes  seldon .  joranum would have found that out if he had ever succeeded in becoming one .    he disappeared into his private shower facility and emerged in due time  scrubbed and dried and dressed rather more formally .    and now  seldon  he said  waving all the others away   the tennis court is as private a place as we can find and the weather is glorious  so let us not go indoors .  i have read the mycogenian message of this sunmaster fourteen .  will it do .     entirely  sire .  as you have read  joranum was denounced as a mycogenian breakaway and is accused of blasphemy in the strongest terms .     and does that finish him .     it diminishes his importance fatally  sire .  there are few who accept the mad story of the first minister s robothood now .  furthermore  joranum is revealed as a liar and a poseur and  worse  one who was caught at it .     caught at it  yes   said cleon thoughtfully .   you mean that merely to be underhanded is to be sly and that may be admirable  while to be caught is to be stupid and that is never admirable .     you put it succinctly  sire .     then joranum is no longer a danger .     we can t be certain of that  sire .  he may recover  even now .  he still has an organization and some of his followers will remain loyal .  history yields examples of men and women who have come back after disasters as great as this one or greater .     in that case  let us execute him  seldon .    seldon shook his head .   that would be inadvisable  sire .  you would not want to create a martyr or to make yourself appear to be a despot .    cleon frowned .   now you sound like demerzel .  whenever i wish to take forceful action  he mutters the word  despot .   there have been emperors before me who have taken forceful action and who have been admired as a result and have been considered strong and decisive .     undoubtedly  sire  but we live in troubled times .  nor is execution necessary .  you can accomplish your purpose in a way that will make you seem enlightened and benevolent .     seem enlightened .     be enlightened  sire .  i misspoke .  to execute joranum would be to take revenge  which might be regarded as ignoble .  as emperor  however  you have a kindly even paternal attitude toward the beliefs of all your people .  you make no distinctions  for you are the emperor of all alike .     what is it you re saying .     i mean  sire  that joranum has offended the sensibilities of the mycogenians and you are horrified at his sacrilege  he having been born one of them .  what better can you do but hand joranum over to the mycogenians and allow them to take care of him .  you will be applauded for your proper imperial convern .     and the mycogenians will execute him  then .     they may  sire .  their laws against blasphemy are excessively severe .  at best  they will imprison him for life at hard labor .    cleon smiled .   very good .  i get the credit for humanity and tolerance and they do the dirty work .     they would  sire  if you actually handed joranum over to them .  that would  however  still create a martyr .     now you confuse me .  what would you have me do .     give joranum the choice .  say that your regard for the welfare of all the people in your empire urges you to hand him over to the mycogenians for trial but that your humanity fears the mycogenians may be too severe .  therefore  as an alternative  he may choose to be banished to nishaya  the small and secluded world from which he claimed to have come  to live the rest of his life in obscurity and peace .  you ll see to it that he s kept under guard  of course .     and that will take care of things .     certainly .  joranum would be committing virtual suicide if he chose to be returned to mycogen and he doesn t strike me as the suicidal type .  he will certainly choose nishaya  and though that is the sensible course of action  it is also an unheroic one .  as a refugee in nishaya  he can scarcely lead any movement designed to take over the empire .  his following is sure to disintegrate .  they could follow a martyr with holy zeal  but it would be difficult  indeed  to follow a coward .     astonishing .  how did you manage all this  seldon .   there was a distinct note of admiration in cleon s voice .   seldon said   well  it seemed reasonable to suppose     never mind   said cleon abruptly .   i don t suppose you ll tell me the truth or that i would understand you if you did  but i ll tell you this much .  demerzel is leaving office .  this last crisis has proved to be too much for him and i agree with him that it is time for him to retire .  but i can t do without a first minister and  from this moment onward  you are he .     sire .    exclaimed seldon in mingled astonishment and horror .    first minister hari seldon .   said cleon calmly .   the emperor wishes it .         don t be alarmed   said demerzel .   it was my suggestion .  i ve been here too long and the succession of crises has reached the point where the consideration of the three laws paralyzes me .  you are the logical successor .     i am not the logical successor   said seldon hotly .   what do i know about running an empire .  the emperor is foolish enough to believe that i solved this crisis by psychohistory .  of course i didn t .     that doesn t matter  hari .  if he believes you have the psychohistorical answer  he will follow you eagerly and that will make you a good first minister .     he may follow me straight into destruction .     i feel that your good sense or intuition will keep you on target  .   .   .  with or without psychohistory .     but what will i do without you daneel .     thank you for calling me that .  i am demerzel no more  only daneel .  as to what you will do without me  suppose you try to put into practice some of joranum s ideas of equality and social justice .  he may not have meant them he may have used them only as ways of capturing allegiance but they are not bad ideas in themselves .  and find ways of having raych help you in that .  he clung to you against his own attraction to joranum s ideas and he must feel torn and half a traitor .  show him he isn t .  in addition  you can work all the harder on psychohistory  for the emperor will be there with you  heart and soul .     but what will you do  daneel .     i have other things in the galaxy to which i must attend .  there is still the zeroth law and i must labor for the good of humanity  insofar as i can determine what that might be .  and  hari     yes  daneel .     you still  have dors .    seldon nodded .   yes  i still have dors .   he paused for a moment before grasping daneel s firm hand with his own .   good bye  daneel .     good bye  hari   daneel replied .   and with that  the robot turned  his heavy first minister s robe rustling as he walked away  head up  back ramrod straight  along the palace hallway .   seldon stood there for a few minutes after daneel had gone  lost in thought .  suddenly he began moving in the direction of the first minister s apartment .  seldon had one more thing to tell daneel the most important thing of all .   seldon hesitated in the softly lit hallway before entering .  but the room was empty .  the dark robe was draped over a chair .  the first minister s chambers echoed hari s last words to the robot   good bye  my friend .   eto demerzel was gone  r .  daneel olivaw had vanished .       part ii    cleon i      cleon i   .   .   .  though often receiving panegyrics for being the last emperor under whom the first galactic empire was reasonably united and reasonably prosperous  the quarter century reign of cleon i was one of continuous decline .  this cannot be viewed as his direct responsibility  for the decline of the empire was based on political and economic factors too strong for anyone to deal with at the time .  he was fortunate in his selection of first ministers eto demerzel and then hari seldon  in whose development of psychohistory the emperor never lost faith .  cleon and seldon  as the objects of the final joranumite conspiracy  with its bizarre climax   encyclopedia galactica       mandell gruber was a happy man .  he seemed so to hari seldon  certainly .  seldon stopped his morning constitutional to watch him .   gruber  perhaps in his late forties  a few years younger than seldon  was a bit gnarled from his continuing work in the imperial palace grounds  but he had a cheerful  smoothly shaven face  topped by a pink skull  not much of which was hidden by his thin sandy hair .  he whistled softly to himself as he inspected the leaves of the bushes for any signs of insect infestation .   he was not the chief gardener  of course .  the chief gardener of the imperial palace grounds was a high functionary who had a palatial office in one of the buildings of the enormous imperial complex  with an army of men and women under him .  the chances are he did not inspect the palace grounds more often than once or twice a year .   gruber was but one of that army .  his title  seldon knew  was gardener first class and it had been well earned  with thirty years of faithful service .   seldon called to him as he paused on the perfectly level crushed gravel walk   another marvelous day  gruber .    gruber looked up and his eyes twinkled .   yes  indeed  first minister  and it s sorry i am for those who be cooped up indoors .     you mean as i am about to be .     there s not much about you  first minister  for people to sorrow over  but if you re disappearing into those buildings on a day like this  it s a bit of sorrow that we fortunate few can feel for you .     i thank you for your sympathy  gruber  but you know we have forty billion trantorians under the dome .  are you sorry for all of them .     indeed  i am .  i am grateful i am not of trantorian extraction myself so that i could qualify as a gardener .  there be few of us on this world that work in the open  but here i be  one of the fortunate few .      the weather isn t always this ideal .     that is true .  and i have been out here in the sluicing rains and the whistling winds .  still  as long as you dress fittingly  .   .   .   .  look   and gruber spread his arms open  wide as his smile  as if to embrace the vast expanse of the palace grounds .   i have my friends the trees and the lawns and all the animal life forms to keep me company and growth to encourage in geometric form  even in the winter .  have you ever seen the geometry of the grounds  first minister .     i am looking at it right now  am i not .     i mean the plans spread out so you can really appreciate it all and marvelous it is  too .  it was planned by tapper savand  over a hundred years ago  and it has been little changed since .  tapper was a great horticulturist  the greatest and he came from my planet .     that was anacreon  wasn t it .     indeed .  a far off world near the edge of the galaxy  where there is still wilderness and life can be sweet .  i came here when i was still an earwet lad  when the present chief gardener took power under the old emperor .  of course  now they re talking of redesigning the grounds .   gruber sighed deeply and shook his head .   that would be a mistake .  they are just right as they are now properly proportioned  well balanced  pleasing to the eye and spirit .  but it is true that in history  the grounds have occasionally been redesigned .  emperors grow tired of the old and are always seeking the new  as if new is somehow always better .  our present emperor  may he live long  has been planning the redesign with the chief gardener .  at least  that is the word that runs from gardener to gardener .   this last he added quickly  as if abashed at spreading palace gossip .    it might not happen soon .     i hope not  first minister .  please  if you have the chance to take some time from all the heart stopping work you must be after doing  study the design of the grounds .  it is a rare beauty and  if i have my way  there should not be a leaf moved out of place  nor a flower  nor a rabbit  anywhere in all these hundreds of square kilometers .    seldon smiled .   you are a dedicated man  gruber .  i would not be surprised if someday you were chief gardener .     may fate protect me from that .  the chief gardener breathes no fresh air  sees no natural sights  and forgets all he has learned of nature .  he lives there  gruber pointed scornfully  and i think he no longer knows a bush from a stream unless one of his underlings leads him out and places his hand on one or dips it into the other .    for a moment it seemed as though gruber would expectorate his scorn  but he could not find any place on which he could bear to spit .   seldon laughed quietly .   gruber  it s good to talk to you .  when i am overcome with the duties of the day  it is pleasant to take a few moments to listen to your philosophy of life .     ah  first minister  it is no philosopher i am .  my schooling was very sketchy .     you don t need schooling to be a philosopher .  just an active mind and experience with life .  take care  gruber .  i just might have you promoted .     if you but leave me as i am  first minister  you will have my total gratitude .    seldon was smiling as he moved on  but the smile faded as his mind turned once more to his current problems .  ten years as first minister and if gruber knew how heartily sick seldon was of his position  his sympathy would rise to enormous heights .  could gruber grasp the fact that seldon s progress in the techniques of psychohistory showed the promise of facing him with an unbearable dilemma .      seldon s thoughtful stroll across the grounds was the epitome of peace .  it was hard to believe here  in the midst of the emperor s immediate domain  that he was on a world that  except for this area  was totally enclosed by a dome .  here  in this spot  he might be on his home world of helicon or on gruber s home world of anacreon .   of course  the sense of peace was an illusion .  the grounds were guarded thick with security .   once  a thousand years ago  the imperial palace grounds much less palatial  much less differentiated from a world only beginning to construct domes over individual regions had been open to all citizens and the emperor himself could walk along the paths  unguarded  nodding his head in greeting to his subjects .   no more .  now security was in place and no one from trantor itself could possibly invade the grounds .  that did not remove the danger  however  for that  when it came  came from discontented imperial functionaries and from corrupt and suborned soldiers .  it was within the grounds that the emperor and his staff were most in danger .  what would have happened if  on that occasion  nearly ten years before  seldon had not been accompanied by dors venabili .   it had been in his first year as first minister and it was only natural  he supposed  after the fact   that there would be jealous heart burning over his unexpected choice for the post .  many others  far better qualified in training in years of service and  most of all  in their own eyes could view the appointment with anger .  they did not know of psychohistory or of the importance the emperor attached to it and the easiest way to correct the situation was to corrupt one of the sworn protectors of the first minister .   dors must have been more suspicious than seldon himself was .  or else  with demerzel s disappearance from the scene  her instructions to guard seldon had been strengthened .  the truth was that  for the first few years of his first ministership  she was at his side more often than not .   and on the late afternoon of a warm sunny day  dors noted the glint of the westering sun a sun never seen under trantor s dome on the metal of a blaster .    down  hari .   she cried suddenly and her legs crushed the grass as she raced toward the sergeant .    give me that blaster  sergeant   she said tightly .   the would be assassin  momentarily immobilized by the unexpected sight of a woman running toward him  now reacted quickly  raising the drawn blaster .   but she was already at him  her hand enclosing his right wrist in a steely grip and lifting his arm high .   drop it   she said through clenched teeth .   the sergeant s face twisted as he attempted to yank his arm loose .    don t try  sergeant   said dors .   my knee is three inches from your groin and  if you so much as blink  your genitals will be history .  so just freeze .  that s right .  okay  now open your hand .  if you don t drop the blaster right now  i will shatter your arm .    a gardener came running up with a rake .  dors motioned him away .  the sergeant dropped the blaster to the ground .   seldon had arrived .   i ll take over  dors .     you will not .  get in among those trees and take the blaster with you .  others may be involved and ready to act .    dors had not loosened her grip on the sergeant .  she said   now  sergeant  i want the name of whoever it was who persuaded you to make an attempt on the first minister s life and the name of everyone else ho is in this with you .    the sergeant was silent .    don t be foolish   said dors .   speak .   she twisted his arm and he sank down to his knees .  she put her shoe on his neck .   if you think silence becomes you  i can crush your larynx and you will be silent forever .  and even before that  i am going to damage you badly t won t  cave one bone unbroken .  you had better talk .    the sergeant talked .   later seldon had said to her   how could you do that  dors .  i never believed you capable of such  .   .   .  violence .     dors said coolly   i did not actually hurt him much  hari .  the threat was sufficient .  in any case  your safety was paramount .     you should have let me take care of him .     why .  to salvage your masculine pride .  you wouldn t have been fast enough  for one thing .  secondly  no matter what you would have succeeded in doing  you are a man and it would have been expected .  i am a woman and women  in popular thought  are not considered as ferocious its men and most  in general  do not have the strength to do what i did .  the story will improve in the telling and everyone will be terrified of me .  no one will dare to try to harm you for fear of me .     for fear of you and for fear of execution .  the sergeant and his cohorts are to be killed  you know .    at this  an anguished look clouded dors s usually composed visage  as if she could not stand the thought of the traitorous sergeant being put to death  even though he would have cut down her beloved hari without a second thought .    but   she exclaimed   there is no need to execute the conspirators .  exile will do the job .     no  it won t   said seldon .   it s too late .  cleon will hear of nothing but executions .  i can quote him if you wish .     you mean he s already made up his mind .     at once .  i told him that exile or imprisonment would be all that was necessary  but he said no .  he said   every time i try to solve a problem by direct and forceful action  first demerzel and then you talk of  despotism  and  tyranny .   but this is my palace .  these are my grounds .  these are my guardsmen .  my safety depends on the security of this place and the loyalty of my people .  do you think that any deviation from absolute loyalty can be met with anything but instant death .  how else would you be safe .  how else would i be safe .     i said there would have to be a trial .   of course   he said   a short military trial and i don t expect a single vote for anything but execution .  i shall make that quite clear .      dors looked appalled .   you re taking this very quietly .  do you agree with the emperor .    reluctantly seldon nodded .   i do .     because there was an attempt on your life .  have you abandoned your principles for mere revenge .     now  dors  i m not a vengeful person .  however  it was not myself alone at risk or even the emperor .  if there is anything that the recent history of the empire shows us  it is that emperors come and go .  it is psychohistory that must be protected .  undoubtedly  even if something happens to me  psychohistory will someday be developed  but the empire is falling fast and we cannot wait and only i have advanced far enough to obtain the necessary techniques in time .     then you should teach what you know to others   said dors gravely .    i m doing so .  yugo amaryl is a reasonable successor and i have gathered a group of technicians who will someday be useful  but they won t be as   he paused .    they won t be as good as you as wise  as capable .  really .     i happen to think so   said seldon .   and i happen to be human .  psychohistory is mine and  if i can possibly manage it  i want the credit .     human   sighed dors  shaking her head almost sadly .   the executions went through .  no such purge had been seen in over a century .  two ministers  five officials of lower ranks  and four soldiers  including the hapless sergeant  met their deaths .  every guardsman who could not withstand the most rigorous investigation was relieved of duty and exiled to the remote outer worlds .   since then  there had been no whisper of disloyalty and so notorious had become the care with which the first minister was guarded  to say nothing of the terrifying woman called  the tiger woman  by many who watched over him  that it was no longer necessary for dors to accompany him everywhere .  her invisible presence was an adequate shield and the emperor cleon enjoyed nearly ten years of quiet and absolute security .   now  however  psychohistory was finally reaching the point where predictions  of a sort  could be made and  as seldon crossed the grounds in his passage from his office  first minister  to his laboratory  psychohistorian   he was uneasily aware of the likelihood that this era of peace might be coming to an end .      yet  even so  hari seldon could not repress the surge of satisfaction that he felt as he entered his laboratory .   how things had changed .   it had begun twenty years earlier with his own doodlings on his second rate heliconian computer .  it was then that the first hint of what was to become parachaotic math came to him in a cloudy fashion .   then there were the years at streeling university  when he and yugo amaryl  working together  attempted to renormalize the equations  get rid of the inconvenient infinities  and find a way around the worst of the chaotic effects .  they made very little progress  indeed .   but now  after ten years as first minister  he had a whole floor of the latest computers and a whole staff of people working on a large variety of problems .   of necessity  none of his staff except for yugo and himself  of course could really know much more than the immediate problem they were dealing with .  each of them worked with only a small ravine or outcropping on the gigantic mountain range of psychohistory that only seldon and amaryl could see as a mountain range and even they could see it only dimly  its peaks hidden in clouds  its slopes veiled by mist .   dors venabili was right  of course .  he would have to begin initiating his people into the entire mystery .  the technique was getting well beyond what only two men could handle .  and seldon was aging .  even if he could look forward to some additional decades  the years of his most fruitful breakthroughs were surely behind him .   even amaryl would be thirty nine within a month and  though that was still young  it was perhaps not overly young for a mathematician and he had been working on the problem almost as long as seldon himself .  his capacity for new and tangential thinking might be dwindling  too .   amaryl had seen him enter and was now approaching .  seldon watched him fondly .  amaryl was as much a dahlite as seldon s foster son  raych  was  and yet amaryl  despite his muscular physique and short stature  did not seem dahlite at all .  he lacked the mustache  he lacked the accent  he lacked  it would seem  dahlite consciousness of any kind .  he had even been impervious to the lure of jo jo joranum  who had appealed so thoroughly to the people of dahl .   it was as though amaryl recognized no sectoral patriotism  no planetary patriotism  not even imperial patriotism .  he belonged completely and entirely to psychohistory .   seldon felt a twinge of insufficiency .  he himself remained conscious of his first two decades on helicon and there was no way he could keep from thinking of himself as a heliconian .  he wondered if that consciousness was not sure to betray him by causing him to skew his thinking about psychohistory .  ideally  to use psychohistory properly  one should be above worlds and sectors and deal only with humanity in the faceless abstract and this was what amaryl did .   and seldon didn t  he admitted to himself  sighing silently .   amaryl said   we are making progress  hari  i suppose .     you suppose  yugo .  merely suppose .     i don t want to jump into outer space without a suit .   he said this quite seriously  he did not have much of a sense of humor  seldon knew  and they moved into their private office .  it was small  but it was also well shielded .   amaryl sat down and crossed his legs .  he said   your latest scheme for getting around chaos may be working in part at the cost of sharpness  of course .     of course .  what we gain in the straightaway  we lose in the roundabouts .  that s the way the universe works .  we ve just got to fool it somehow .     we ve fooled it a little bit .  it s like looking through frosted glass .     better than the years we spent trying to look through lead .    amaryl muttered something to himself  then said   we can catch glimmers of light and dark .     explain .     i can t  but i have the prime radiant  which i ve been working on like a a     try lamec .  that s an animal a beast of burden we have on helicon .  it doesn t exist on trantor .     if the lamec works hard  then that is what my work on the prime radiant has been like .    he pressed the security keypad on his desk and a drawer unsealed and slid open noiselessly .  he took out a dark opaque cube that seldon scrutinized with interest .  seldon himself had worked out the prime radiant   s circuitry  but amaryl had put it together a clever man with his hands was amaryl .   the room darkened and equations and relationships shimmered in the air .  numbers spread out beneath them  hovering just above the desk surface  as if suspended by invisible marionette strings .   seldon said   wonderful .  someday  if we live long enough  we ll have the prime radiant produce a river of mathematical symbolism that will chart past and future history .  in it we can find currents and rivulets and work out ways of changing them in order to make them follow other currents and rivulets that we would prefer .     yes   said amaryl dryly   if we can manage to live with the knowledge that the actions we take  which we will mean for the best  may turn out to be for the worst .     believe me  yugo  i never go to bed at night without that particular thought gnawing at me .  still  we haven t come to it yet .  all we have is this  which  as you say  is no more than seeing light and dark fuzzily through frosted glass .     true enough .     and what is it you think you see  yugo .   seldon watched amaryl closely  a little grimly .  he was gaining weight  getting just a bit pudgy .  he spent too much time bent over the computers  and now over the prime radiant  and not enough in physical activity .  and  though he saw a woman now and then  seldon knew  he had never married .  a mistake .  even a workaholic is forced to take time off to satisfy a mate  to take care of the needs of children .   seldon thought of his own still trim figure and of the manner in which dors strove to make him keep it that way .   amaryl said   what do i see .  the empire is in trouble .     the empire is always in trouble .     yes  but it s more specific .  there s a possibility that we may have trouble at the center .     at trantor .     i presume .  or at the periphery .  either there will be a bad situation here perhaps civil war or the outlying outer worlds will begin to break away .     surely it doesn t take psychohistory to point out these possibilities .     the interesting thing is that there seems a mutual exclusivity .  one or the other .  the likelihood of both together is very small .  here .  look .  it s your own mathematics .  observe .    they bent over the prime radiant display for a long time .   seldon said finally   i fail to see why the two should be mutually exclusive .     so do i  hari  but where s the value of psychohistory if it shows us only what we would see anyway .  this is showing us something we wouldn t see .  what it doesn t show us is  first  which alternative is better  and second  what to do to make the better come to pass and depress the possibility of the worse .    seldon pursed his lips  then said slowly   i can tell you which alternative is preferable .  let the periphery go and keep trantor .     really .     no question .  we must keep trantor stable  if for no other reason than that we re here .     surely our own comfort isn t the decisive point .     no  but psychohistory is .  what good will it do us to keep the periphery intact if conditions on trantor force us to stop work on psychohistory .  i don t say that we ll be killed  but we may be unable to work .  the development of psychohistory is on what our fate will depend .  as for the empire  if the periphery secedes it will only begin a disintegration that may take a long time to reach the core .     even if you re right  hari  what do we do to keep trantor stable .     to begin with  we have to think about it .    a silence fell between them and then seldon said   thinking doesn t make me happy .  what if the empire is altogether on the wrong track and has been for all its history .  i think of that every time i talk to gruber .     who s gruber .     mandell gruber .  a gardener .     oh .  the one who came running up with the rake to rescue you at the time of the assassination attempt .     yes .  i ve always been grateful to him for that .  he had only a rake against possibly other conspirators with blasters .  that s loyalty .  anyhow  talking to him is like a breath of fresh air .  i can t spend all my time talking to court officials and to psychohistorians .     thank you .     come .  you know what i mean .  gruber likes the open .  he wants the wind and the rain and the biting cold and everything else that raw weather can bring to him .  i miss it myself sometimes .     i don t .  i wouldn t care if i never go out there .     you were brought up under the dome but suppose the empire consisted of simple unindustrialized worlds  living by herding and farming  with thin populations and empty spaces .  wouldn t we all be better off .     it sounds horrible to me .     i found some spare time to check it as best i could .  it seems to me it s a case of unstable equilibrium .  a thinly populated world of the type i describe either grows moribund and impoverished  falling off into an uncultured near animal level or it industrializes .  it is standing on a narrow point and topples over in either direction and  as it just so happens  almost every world in the galaxy has fallen over into industrialization .     because that s better .     maybe .  but it can t continue forever .  we re watching the results of the overtoppling now .  the empire cannot exist for much longer because it has it has overheated .  i can t think of any other expression .  what will follow we don t know .  if  through psychohistory  we manage to prevent the fall or  more likely  force a recovery after the fall  is that merely to ensure another period of overheating .  is that the only future humanity has  to push the boulder  like sisyphus  up to the top of a hill  only to see it roll to the bottom again .     who s sisyphus .     a character in a primitive myth .  yugo  you must do more reading .    amaryl shrugged .   so i can learn about sisyphus .  not important .  perhaps psychohistory will show us a path to an entirely new society  one altogether different from anything we have seen  one that would be stable and desirable .     i hope so   sighed seldon .   i hope so  but there s no sign of it yet .  for the near future  we will just have to labor to let the periphery go .  that will mark the beginning of the fall of the galactic empire .        and so i said   said hari seldon .     that will mark the beginning of the fall of the galactic empire .   and so it will  dors .    dors listened  tight lipped .  she accepted seldon s first ministership as she accepted everything calmly .  her only mission was to protect him and his psychohistory  but that task  she well knew  was made harder by his position .  the best security was to go unnoticed and  as long as the spaceship and sun  the symbol of the empire  shone down upon seldon  all of the physical barriers in existence would be unsatisfactory .   the luxury in which they now lived the careful shielding from spy beams  as well as from physical interference  the advantages to her own historical research of being able to make use of nearly unlimited funds did not satisfy her .  she would gladly have exchanged it all for their old quarters at streeling university .  or  better yet  for a nameless apartment in a nameless sector where no one knew them .    that s all very well  hari dear   she said   but it s not enough .     what s not enough .     the information you re giving me .  you say we might lose the periphery .  how .  why .    seldon smiled briefly .   how nice it would be to know  dors  but psychohistory is not yet at the stage where it could tell us .     in your opinion  then .  is it the ambition of local faraway governors to declare themselves independent .     that s a factor  certainly .  it s happened in past history as you know far better than i but never for long .  maybe this time it will be permanent .     because the empire is weaker .     yes  because trade flows less freely than it once did  because communications are stiffer than they once were  because the governors in the periphery are  in actual fact  closer to independence than they have ever been .  if one of them arises with particular ambitions     can you tell which one it might be .     not in the least .  all we can force out of psychohistory at this stage is the definite knowledge that if a governor of unusual ability and ambition arises  he would find conditions more suitable for his purposes than he would have in the past .  it could be other things  too some great natural disaster or some sudden civil war between two distant outer world coalitions .  none of that can be precisely predicted as of now  but we can tell that anything of the sort that happens will have more serious consequences than it would have had a century ago .     but if you don t know a little more precisely what will happen in the periphery  how can you so guide actions as to make sure the periphery goes  rather than trantor .     by keeping a close eye on both and trying to stabilize trantor and not trying to stabilize the periphery .  we can t expect psychohistory to order events automatically without much greater knowledge of its workings  so we have to make use of constant manual controls  so to speak .  in days to come  the technique will be refined and the need for manual control will decrease .     but that   said dors   is in days to come .  right .     right .  and even that is only a hope .     and just what kind of instabilities threaten trantor if we hang on to the periphery .     the same possibilities economic and social factors  natural disasters  ambitious rivalries among high officials .  and something more .  i have described the empire to yugo as being overheated and trantor is the most overheated portion of all .  it seems to be breaking down .  the infrastructure water supply  heating  waste disposal  fuel lines  everything seems to be having unusual problems and that s something i ve been turning my attention to more and more lately .     what about the death of the emperor .    seldon spread his hands .   that happens inevitably  but cleon is in good health .  he s only my age  which i wish was younger  but he isn t too old .  his son is totally inadequate for the succession  but there will be enough claimants .  more than enough to cause trouble and make his death distressing  but it might not prove a total catastrophe in the historic sense .     let s say his assassination  then .    seldon looked up nervously .   don t say that .  even if we re shielded  don t use the word .     hari  don t be foolish .  it s an eventuality that must be reckoned with .  there was a time when the joranumites might have taken power and  if they had  the emperor  one way or another     probably not .  he would have been more useful as a figurehead .  and in any case  forget it .  joranum died last year on nishaya  a rather pathetic figure .     he had followers .     of course .  everyone has followers .  did you ever come across the globalist party on my native world of helicon in your studies of the early history of the kingdom of trantor and of the galactic empire .     no  i haven t .  i don t want to hurt your feelings  hari  but i don t recall coming across any piece of history in which helicon played a role .     i m not hurt  dors .  happy the world without a history  i always say .   in any case  about twenty four hundred years ago  there arose a group of people on helicon who were quite convinced that helicon was the only inhabited globe in the universe .  helicon was the universe and beyond it there was only a solid sphere of sky speckled with tiny stars .     how could they believe that .   said dors .   they were part of the empire  i presume .     yes  but globalists insisted that all evidence to the effect that the empire existed was either illusion or deliberate deceit  that imperial emissaries and officials were heliconians playing a part for some reason .  they were absolutely immune to reason .     and what happened .     i suppose it s always pleasant to think that your particular world is the world .  at their peak  the globalists may have persuaded    percent of the population of the planet to be part of the movement .  only    percent  but they were a vehement minority that drowned out the indifferent majority and threatened to take over .     but they didn t  did they .     no  they didn t .  what happened was that globalism caused a diminishing of imperial trade and the heliconian economy slid into the doldrums .  when the belief began to affect the pocketbooks of the population  it lost popularity rapidly .  the rise and fall puzzled many at the time  but psychohistory  i m sure  would have shown it to be inevitable and would have made it unnecessary to give it any thought .     i see .  but  hari  what is the point of this story .  i presume there s some connection with what we were discussing .     the connection is that such movements never completely die  no matter how ridiculous their tenets may seem to sane people .  right now  on helicon  right now there are still globalists .  not many  but every once in a while seventy or eighty of them get together in what they call a global congress and take enormous pleasure in talking to each other about globalism .   well  it is only ten years since the joranumite movement seemed such a terrible threat on this world and it would not be at all surprising if there weren t still some remnants left .  there may still be some remnants a thousand years from now .     isn t it possible that a remnant may be dangerous .     i doubt it .  it was jo jo s charisma that made the movement dangerous and he s dead .  he didn t even die a heroic death or one that was in any way remarkable  he just withered away and died in exile  a broken man .    dors stood up and walked the length of the room quickly  swinging her arms at her sides and clenching her fists .  she returned and stood before the seated seldon .    hari   she said   let me speak my mind .  if psychohistory points to the possibility of serious disturbances on trantor  then if there are joranumites still left  they may still be plotting the emperor s death .    seldon laughed nervously .   you jump at shadows  dors .  relax .    but he found that he could not dismiss what she had said quite that easily .      the wye sector had a tradition of opposition to the entun dynasty of cleon i that had been ruling the empire for over two centuries .  the opposition dated back to a time when the line of mayors of wye had contributed members who had served as emperor .  the wyan dynasty had neither lasted long nor had it been conspicuously successful  but the people and rulers of wye found it difficult to forget that they had once been however imperfectly and temporarily supreme .  the brief period when rashelle  as the self appointed mayor of wye  had challenged the empire  eighteen years earlier  had added both to wye s pride and to its frustration .   all this made it reasonable that the small band of leading conspirators should feel as safe in wye as they would feel anywhere on trantor .   five of them sat around a table in a room in a run down portion of the sector .  the room was poorly furnished but well shielded .   in a chair which  by its marginal superiority in quality to the others  sat the man who might well be judged to be the leader .  he had a thin face  a sallow complexion  and a wide mouth with lips so pale as to be nearly invisible .  there was a touch of gray in his hair  but his eyes burned with an inextinguishable anger .   he was staring at the man seated exactly opposite him distinctly older and softer  his hair almost white  his plump cheeks tending to quiver when he spoke .   the leader said sharply   well .  it is quite apparent that you have done nothing .  explain that .    the older man said   i am an old joranumite  namarti .  why do i have to explain my actions .    gambol deen namarti  once the right hand man of laskin  jo jo  joranum  said   there are many old joranumites .  some are incompetent  some are soft  some have forgotten .  being an old joranumite may mean no more than that one is an old fool .    the older man sat back in his chair .   are you calling me an old fool .  me .  kaspal kaspalov .  i was with jo jo when you had not yet joined the party  when you were a ragged nothing in search of a cause .     i am not calling you a fool   said namarti sharply .   i say simply that some old joranumites are fools .  you have a chance now to show me that you are not one of them .     my association with jo jo     forget that .  he s dead .     i should think his spirit lives on .     if that thought will help us in our fight  then his spirit lives on .  but to others not to us .  we know he made mistakes .     i deny that .     don t insist on making a hero out of a mere man who made mistakes .  he thought he could move the empire by the strength of oratory alone  by words     history shows that words have moved mountains in the past .     not joranum s words  obviously  because he made mistakes .  he hid his mycogenian origins far too clumsily .  worse  he let himself be tricked into accusing first minister eto demerzel of being a robot .  i warned him against that accusation  but he wouldn t listen and it destroyed him .  now let s start fresh  shall we .  whatever use we make of joranum s memory for outsiders  let us not ourselves be transfixed by it .    kaspalov sat silent .  the other three transferred their gaze from namarti to kaspalov and back  content to let namarti carry the weight of the discussion .    with joranum s exile to nishaya  the joranumite movement fell apart and seemed to vanish   said namarti harshly .   it would  indeed  have vanished but for me .  bit by bit and rubble by rubble  i rebuilt it into a network that extends over all of trantor .  you know this  i take it .     i know it  chief   mumbled kaspalov .  the use of the title made it plain that kaspalov was seeking reconciliation .   namarti smiled tightly .  he did not insist on the title  but he always enjoyed hearing it used .  he said   you re part of this network and you have your duties .    kaspalov stirred .  he was clearly debating with himself internally and finally he said slowly   you tell me  chief  that you warned joranum against accusing the old first minister of being a robot .  you say he didn t listen  but at least you had your say .  may i have the same privilege of pointing out what i think is a mistake and have you listen to me as joranum listened to you  even if  like him  you don t take the advice given you .     of course you can speak your piece  kaspalov .  you are here in order that you might do so .  what is your point .     these new tactics of ours  chief  are a mistake .  they create disruption and do damage .     of course .  they are designed to do that .   namarti stirred in his seat  controlling his anger with an effort .   joranum tried persuasion .  it didn t work .  we will bring trantor down by action .     for how long .  and at what cost .     for as long as it takes and at very little cost  actually .  a power stoppage here  a water break there  a sewage backup  an air conditioning halt .  inconvenience and discomfort that s all it means .    kaspalov shook his head .   these things are cumulative .     of course  kaspalov  and we want public dismay and resentment to be cumulative  too .  listen  kaspalov .  the empire is decaying .  everyone knows that .  everyone capable of intelligent thought knows that .  the technology will fail here and there  even if we do nothing .  we re just helping it along a little .     it s dangerous  chief .  trantor s infrastructure is incredibly complicated .  a careless push may bring it down in ruins .  pull the wrong string and trantor may topple like a house of cards .     it hasn t so far .     it may in the future .  and what if the people find out that we are behind it .  they would tear us apart .  there would be no need to call in the security establishment or the armed forces .  mobs would destroy us .     how would they ever learn enough to blame us .  the natural target for the people s resentment will be the government the emperor s advisers .  they will never look beyond that .     and how do we live with ourselves  knowing what we have done .    this last was asked in a whisper  the old man clearly moved by strong emotion .  kaspalov looked pleadingly across the table at his leader  the man to whom he had sworn allegiance .  he had done so in the belief that namarti would truly continue to bear the standard of freedom passed on by jo jo joranum  now kaspalov wondered if this is how jo jo would have wanted his dream to come to pass .   namarti clucked his tongue  much as a reproving parent does when confronting an errant child .    kaspalov  you can t seriously be turning sentimental on us  are you .  once we are in power  we will pick up the pieces and rebuild .  we will gather in the people with all of joranum s old talk of popular participation in government  with greater representation  and when we are firmly in power we will establish a more efficient and forceful government .  we will then have a better trantor and a stronger empire .  we will set up some sort of discussion system whereby representatives of other worlds can talk themselves into a daze but we will do the governing .    kaspalov sat there  irresolute .   namarti smiled joylessly .   you are not certain .  we can t lose .  it s been working perfectly and it will continue working perfectly .  the emperor doesn t know what s going on .  he hasn t the faintest notion .  and his first minister is a mathematician .  he ruined joranum  true  but since then he has done nothing .     he has something called called     forget it .  joranum attached a great deal of importance to it  but it was a part of his being mycogenian  like his robot mania .  this mathematician has nothing     historical psychoanalysis or something like that .  i heard joranum once say     forget it .  just do your part .  you handle the ventilation in the anemoria sector  don t you .  very well  then .  have it misfunction in a manner of your choosing .  it either shuts down so that the humidity rises or it produces a peculiar odor or something else .  none of this will kill anyone  so don t get yourself into a fever of virtuous guilt .  you will simply make people uncomfortable and raise the general level of discomfort and annoyance .  can we depend on you .     but what would only be discomfort and annoyance to the young and healthy may be more than that to infants  the aged  and the sick  .   .   .   .     are you going to insist that no one at all must be hurt .    kaspalov mumbled something .   namarti said   it s impossible to do anything with a guarantee that no one at all will be hurt .  you just do your job .  do it in such a way that you hurt as few as possible if your conscience insists upon it but do it .    kaspalov said   look .  i have one thing more to say  chief .     then say it   said namarti wearily .    we can spend years poking at the infrastructure .  the time must come when you take advantage of gathering dissatisfaction to seize the government .  how do you intend to do that .     you want to know exactly how we ll do it .     yes .  the faster we strike  the more limited the damage  the more efficiently the surgery is performed .    namarti said slowly   i have not yet decided on the nature of this  surgical strike .   but it will come .  until then  will you do your part .    kaspalov nodded his head in resignation .   yes  chief .     well then  go   said namarti with a sharp gesture of dismissal .   kaspalov rose  turned  and left .  namarti watched him go .  he said to the man at his right   kaspalov is not to be trusted .  he has sold out and it s only so that he can betray us that he wants to know my plans for the future .  take care of him .    the other nodded and all three left  leaving namarti alone in the room .  he switched off the glowing wall panels  leaving only a lonely square in the ceiling to provide the light that would keep him from being entirely in the darkness .   he thought  every chain has weak links that must be eliminated .  we have had to do this in the past and the result is that we have an organization that is untouchable .   and in the dimness  he smiled  twisting his face into a kind of feral joy .  after all  the network extended even into the palace itself not quite firmly  not quite reliably  but it was there .  and it would be strengthened .      the weather was holding up over the undomed area of the imperial palace grounds warm and sunny .   it didn t often happen .  hari remembered dors telling him once how this particular area with its cold winters and frequent rains had been chosen as the site .    it wasn t actually chosen    she said .   it was a family estate of the morovian family in the early days of the kingdom of trantor .  when the kingdom became an empire  there were numerous sites where the emperor could live summer resorts  winter places  sports lodges  beach properties .  and  as the planet was slowly domed  one reigning emperor  living here  liked it so much that it remained undomed .  and  just because it was the only area left undomed  it became special a place apart and that uniqueness appealed to the next emperor  .   .   .  and the next  .   .   .  and the next .   .   .   .  and so  a tradition was born .    and as always  when hearing something like that  seldon would think  and how would psychohistory handle this .  would it predict that one area would remain undomed but be absolutely unable to say which area .  could it go even so far .  could it predict that several areas would remain undomed or none and be wrong .  how could it account for the personal likes and dislikes of an emperor who happened to be on the throne at the crucial time and who made a decision in a moment of whimsy and nothing more .  that way lay chaos and madness .   cleon i was clearly enjoying the good weather .    i m getting old  seldon   he said .   i don t have to tell you that .  we re the same age  you and i .  surely it s a sign of age when i don t have the impulse to play tennis or go fishing  even though they ve newly restocked the lake  but am willing to walk gently over the pathways .    he was eating nuts as he spoke  which resembled what on seldon s native world of helicon would have been called pumpkin seeds  but which were larger and a little less delicate in taste .  cleon cracked them gently between his teeth  peeled the thin shells and popped the kernels into his mouth .   seldon did not like the taste particularly but  of course  when he was offered some by the emperor  he accepted them and ate a few .   the emperor had a number of shells in his hand and looked vaguely around for a receptacle of some sort that he could use for disposal .  he saw none  but he did notice a gardener standing not far away  his body at attention  as it should be in the imperial presence  and his head respectfully bowed .   cleon said   gardener .    the gardener approached quickly .   sire .     get rid of these for me   he said  tapping the shells into the gardener s hand .    yes  sire .    seldon said   i have a few  too  gruber .    gruber held out his hand and said  almost shyly   yes  first minister .    he hurried away and the emperor looked after him curiously .   do you know the fellow  seldon .     yes  indeed  sire .  an old friend .     the gardener is an old friend .  what is he .  a mathematical colleague fallen on hard times .     no  sire .  perhaps you remember the story .  it was the time when  he cleared his throat  searching for the most tactful way to recall the incident  the sergeant threatened my life shortly after i was appointed to my present post through your kindness .     the assassination attempt .   cleon looked up to heaven  as though seeking patience .   i don t know why everyone is so afraid of that word .     perhaps   said seldon smoothly  slightly despising himself for the ease with which he had become able to flatter   the rest of us are more perturbed at the possibility of something untoward happening to our emperor than you yourself are .    cleon smiled ironically .   i dare say .  and what has this to do with gruber .  is that his name .     yes  sire .  mandell gruber .  i m sure you will recall  if you cast your mind back  that there was a gardener who came rushing up with a rake to defend me against the armed sergeant .     ah yes .  was that fellow the gardener who did that .     he was the man  sire .  i ve considered him a friend ever since and i meet him almost every time i am on the grounds .  i think he watches for me  feels proprietary toward me .  and  of course  i feel kindly toward him .     i don t blame you .   and while we re on the subject  how is your formidable lady  dr .  venabili .  i don t see her often .     she s a historian  sire .  lost in the past .     she doesn t frighten you .  she d frighten me .  i ve been told how she treated that sergeant .  one could almost be sorry for him .     she grows savage on my behalf  sire  but has not had occasion to do so lately .  it s been very quiet .    the emperor looked after the disappearing gardener .   have we ever rewarded that man .     i have done so  sire .  he has a wife and two daughters and i have arranged that each daughter will have a sum of money put aside for the education of any children she may have .     very good .  but he needs a promotion  i think .   is he a good gardener .     excellent  sire .     the chief gardener  malcomber i m not quite sure i remember his name is getting on and is  perhaps  not up to the job anymore .  he is well into his late seventies .  do you think this gruber might be able to take over .     i m certain he can  sire  but he likes his present job .  it keeps him out in the open in all kinds of weather .     a peculiar recommendation for a job .  i m sure he can get used to administration and i do need someone for some sort of renewal of the grounds .  hmmm .  i must think upon this .  your friend gruber may be just the man i need .   by the way  seldon  what did you mean by saying it s been very quiet .     i merely meant  sire  that there has been no sign of discord at the imperial court .  the unavoidable tendency to intrigue seems to be as near a minimum as it is ever likely to get .     you wouldn t say that if you were emperor  seldon  and had to contend with all these officials and their complaints .  how can you tell me things are quiet when reports seem to reach me every other week of some serious breakdown here and there on trantor .     these things are bound to happen .     i don t recall such things happening so frequently in previous years .     perhaps that was because they didn t  sire .  the infrastructure grows older with time .  to make the necessary repairs properly would take time  labor  and enormous expense .  this is not a time when a rise in taxes will be looked on favorably .     there s never any such time .  i gather that the people are experiencing serious dissatisfaction over these breakdowns .  it must stop and you must see to it  seldon .  what does psychohistory say .     it says what common sense says  that everything is growing older .     well  all this is quite spoiling the pleasant day for me .  i leave it in your hands  seldon .     yes  sire   said seldon quietly .   the emperor strode off and seldon thought that it was all spoiling the pleasant day for him  too .  this breakdown at the center was the alternative he didn t want .  but how was he to prevent it and switch the crisis to the periphery .   psychohistory didn t say .      raych seldon felt extraordinarily contented  for it was the first dinner en famille that he had had in some months with the two people he thought of as his father and mother .  he knew perfectly well that they were not his parents in any biological sense  but it didn t matter .  he merely smiled at them with complete love .   the surroundings were not as warm as they had been at streeling in the old days  when their home had been small and intimate  a virtual gem in the larger setting of the university .  now  unfortunately  nothing could hide the grandeur of the first minister s palace suite .   raych sometimes stared at himself in the mirror and wondered how it could be .  he was not tall  only     centimeters in height  distinctly shorter than either parent .  he was rather stocky but muscular and not fat  with black hair and the distinctive dahlite mustache that he kept as dark and as thick as possible .   in the mirror he could still see the street urchin he had once been before the chanciest of great chances had dictated his meeting with hari and dors .  seldon had been much younger then and his appearance now made it plain that raych himself was almost as old now as seldon had been when they met .  amazingly  dors had hardly changed at all .  she was as sleek and fit as the day raych had first showed hari and dors the way to mother rittah s in billibotton .  and he  raych  born to poverty and misery  was now a member of the civil service  a small cog in the ministry of population .   seldon said   how are things going at the ministry  raych .  any progress .     some  dad .  the laws are passed .  the court decisions are made .  speeches are pronounced .  still  it s difficult to move people .  you can preach brotherhood all you want  but no one feels like a brother .  what gets me is that the dahlites are as bad as any of the others .  they want to be treated as equals  they say  and so they do  but  given a chance  they have no desire to treat others as equals .    dors said   it s all but impossible to change people s minds and hearts  raych .  it s enough to try and perhaps eliminate the worst of the injustices .     the trouble is   said seldon   that through most of history  no one s been working on this problem .  human beings have been allowed to fester in the delightful game of i m better than you and cleaning up that mess isn t easy .  if we allow things to follow their own bent and grow worse for a thousand years  we can t complain if it takes  say  a hundred years to work an improvement .     sometimes  dad   said raych   i think you gave me this job to punish me .    seldon s eyebrows raised .   what motivation could i have had to punish you .     for feeling attracted to joranum s program of sector equality and for greater popular representation in government .     i don t blame you for that .  these are attractive suggestions  but you know that joranum and his gang were using it only as a device to gain power .  afterward     but you had me entrap him  despite my attraction to his views .    seldon said   it wasn t easy for me to ask you to do that .     and now you keep me working at the implementation of joranum s program  just to show me how hard the task is in reality .    seldon said to dors   how do you like that  dors .  the boy attributes to me a kind of sneaky underhandedness that simply isn t part of my character .     surely   said dors with the ghost of a smile playing at her lips   you are attributing no such thing to your father .     not really .  in the ordinary course of life  there s no one straighter than you  dad .  but if you have to  you know you can stack the cards .  isn t that what you hope to do with psychohistory .    seldon said sadly   so far  i ve done very little with psychohistory .     too bad .  i keep thinking that there is some sort of psychohistorical solution to the problem of human bigotry .     maybe there is  but  if so  i haven t found it .    when dinner was over  seldon said   you and i  raych  are going to have a little talk now .     indeed .   said dors .   i take it i m not invited .     ministerial business  dors .     ministerial nonsense  hari .  you re going to ask the poor boy to do something i wouldn t want him to do .    seldon said firmly   i m certainly not going to ask him to do anything he doesn t want to do .    raych said   it s all right  mom .  let dad and me have our talk .  i promise i ll tell you all about it afterward .    dors s eyes rolled upward .   you two will plead  state secrets .   i know   as a matter of fact   said seldon firmly   that s exactly what i must discuss .  and of the first magnitude .  i m serious  dors .    dors rose  her lips tightening .  she left the room with one final injunction .   don t throw the boy to the wolves  hari .    and after she was gone  seldon said quietly   i m afraid that throwing you to the wolves is exactly what i ll have to do  raych .       they faced each other in seldon s private office  his  thinking place   as he called it .  there  he had spent uncounted hours trying to think his way past and through the complexities of imperial and trantorian government .   he said   have you read much about the recent breakdowns we ve been having in planetary services  raych .     yes   said raych   but you know  dad  we ve got an old planet here .  what we gotta do is get everyone off it  dig the whole thing up  replace everything  add the latest computerizations  and then bring everyone back or at least half of everyone .  trantor would be much better off with only twenty billion people .     which twenty billion .   asked seldon smiling .    i wish i knew   said raych darkly .   the trouble is  we can t redo the planet  so we just gotta keep patching .     i m afraid so  raych  but there are some peculiar things about it .  now i want you to check me out .  i have some thoughts about this .    he brought a small sphere out of his pocket .    what s that .   asked raych .    it s a map of trantor  carefully programmed .  do me a favor  raych  and clear off this tabletop .    seldon placed the sphere more or less in the middle of the table and placed his hand on a keypad in the arm of his desk chair .  he used his thumb to close a contact and the light in the room went out while the tabletop glowed with a soft ivory light that seemed about a centimeter deep .  the sphere had flattened and expanded to the edges of the table .   the light slowly darkened in spots and took on a pattern .  after some thirty seconds  raych said in surprise   it is a map of trantor .     of course .  i told you it was .  you can t buy anything like this at a sector mall  though .  this is one of those gadgets the armed forces play with .  it could present trantor as a sphere  but a planar projection would more clearly show what i want to show .     and what is it you want to show  dad .     well  in the last year or two  there have been breakdowns .  as you say  it s an old planet and we ve got to expect breakdowns  but they ve been coming more frequently and they would seem  almost uniformly  to be the result of human error .     isn t that reasonable .     yes  of course .  within limits .  this is true  even where earthquakes are involved .     earthquakes .  on trantor .     i admit trantor is a fairly nonseismic planet and a good thing  too  because enclosing a world in a dome when the world is going to shake itself badly several times a year and smash a section of that dome would be highly impractical .  your mother says that one of the reasons trantor  rather than some other world  became the imperial capital is that it was geologically moribund that s her unflattering expression .  still  it might be moribund  but it s not dead .  there are occasional minor earthquakes  three of them in the last two years .     i wasn t aware of that  dad .     hardly anyone is .  the dome isn t a single object .  it exists in hundreds of sections  each one of which can be lifted and set ajar to relieve tensions and compressions in case of an earthquake .  since an earthquake  when one does occur  lasts for only ten seconds to a minute  the opening endures only briefly .  it comes and goes so rapidly that the trantorians beneath are not even aware of it .  they are much more aware of a mild tremor and a faint rattling of crockery than of the opening and closing of the dome overhead and the slight intrusion of the outside weather whatever it is .     that s good  isn t it .     it should be .  it s computerized  of course .  the onset of an earthquake anywhere sets off the key controls for the opening and closing of that section of the dome so that it opens just before the vibration becomes strong enough to do damage .     still good .     but in the case of the three minor earthquakes over the last two years  the dome controls failed in each case .  the dome never opened and  in each case  repairs were required .  it took some time  it took some money  and the weather controls were less than optimum for a considerable period of time .  now  what  raych  are the chances that the equipment would have failed in all three cases .     not high .     not high at all .  less than one in a hundred .  one can suppose that someone had gimmicked the controls in advance of an earthquake .  now  about once a century  we have a magma leak  which is far more difficult to control and i d hate to think of the results if it went unnoticed until it was too late .  fortunately that hasn t happened and isn t likely to  but consider  here on this map you will find the location of the breakdowns that have plagued us over the past two years and that seem to be attributable to human error  though we haven t once been able to tell to whom each might be attributed .     that s because everyone is busy protecting his back .     i m afraid you re right .  that s a characteristic of any bureaucracy and trantor s is the largest in history .   but what do you think of the locations .    the map had lit up with bright little red markings that looked like small pustules covering the land surface of trantor .    well   said raych cautiously   they seem to be evenly spread .     exactly  and that s what s interesting .  one would expect that the older sections of trantor  the longest domed sections  would have the most decayed infrastructure and would be more liable to events requiring quick human decision and laying the groundwork for possible human error .   i ll superimpose the older sections of trantor on the map in a bluish color and you ll notice that the breakdowns don t seem to be taking place any oftener on the blue areas .     and .     and what i think it means  raych  is that the breakdowns are not of natural origin but are deliberately caused and spread out in this fashion to affect as many people as possible  thus creating a dissatisfaction that is as widespread as possible .     it don t seem likely .     no .  then let s look at the breakdowns as spread through time rather than through space .    the blue areas and the red spots disappeared and  for a time  the map of trantor was blank and then the markings began to appear and disappear one at a time  here and there .    notice   said seldon   that they don t appear in clumps in time  either .  one appears  then another  then another  and so on  almost like the steady ticking of a metronome .     do ya think that s on purpose  too .     it must be .  whoever is bringing this about wants to cause as much disruption with as little effort as possible  so there s no use doing two at once  where one will partially cancel the other in the news and in the public consciousness .  each incident must stand out in full irritation .    the map went out and the lights went on .  seldon returned the sphere  shrunken back to its original size  to his pocket .   raych said   who would be doing all this .    seldon said thoughtfully   a few days ago i received a report of a murder in wye sector .     that s not unusual   said raych .   even though wye isn t one of your really lawless sectors  there must be lots of murders there every day .     hundreds   said seldon  shaking his head .   we ve had bad days when the number of deaths by violence on trantor as a whole approaches the million a day mark .  generally there s not much chance of finding every culprit  every murderer .  the dead just enter the books as statistics .  this one  however  was unusual .  the man had been knifed but unskillfully .  he was still alive when found  just barely .  he had time to gasp out one word before he died and that word was  chief .     that roused a certain curiosity and he was actually identified .  he works in anemoria and we don t know what he was doing in wye .  but some worthy officer managed to dig up the fact that he was an old joranumite .  his name was kaspal kaspalov and he is well known to have been one of the intimates of laskin joranum .  and now he s deadknifed .    raych frowned .   do you suspect another joranumite conspiracy  dad .  there aren t any joranumites around anymore .     it wasn t long ago that your mother asked me if i thought that the joranumites were still active and i told her that any odd belief always retained a certain cadre  sometimes for centuries .  they re usually not very important  just splinter groups that simply don t count .  still  what if the joranumites have kept up an organization  what if they have retained a certain strength  what if they are capable of killing someone they consider a traitor in their ranks  and what if they are producing these breakdowns as a preliminary to seizing control .     that s an awful lot of  what if  s   dad .     i know that .  and i might be totally wrong .  the murder happened in wye and  as it so happens  there have been no infrastructure breakdowns in wye .     what does that prove .     it might prove that the center of the conspiracy is in wye and that the conspirators don t want to make themselves uncomfortable  only the rest of trantor .  it also might mean that it s not the joranumites at all but members of the old wyan family who still dream of ruling the empire once again .     oh boy  dad .  you re building all this on very little .     i know .  now suppose it is another joranumite conspiracy .  joranum had  as his right hand man  gambol deen namarti .  we have no record of namarti s death  no record of his having left trantor  no record of his life over the last decade or so .  that s not terribly surprising .  after all  it s easy to lose one person among forty billion .  there was a time in my life when i tried to do just that .  of course  namarti may be dead .  that would be the easiest explanation  but he may not be .     what do we do about it .    seldon sighed .   the logical thing would be to turn to the security establishment  but i can t .  i don t have demerzel s presence .  he could cow people  i can t .  he had a powerful personality  i m just a mathematician .  i shouldn t be first minister at all  i m not cut out for it .  and i wouldn t be if the emperor weren t fixated on psychohistory to a far greater extent than it deserves .     you re kinda whipping yourself  ain t you  dad .     yes .  i suppose i am  but i have a picture of myself going to the security establishment  for instance  with what i have just shown you on the map  he pointed to the now empty tabletop  and arguing that we were in great danger of some conspiracy of unknown consequence and nature .  they would listen solemnly and  after i had left  they would laugh among themselves about  the crazy mathematician  and then do nothing .     then what do we do about it .   said raych  returning to the point .    it s what you will do about it  raych .  i need more evidence and i want you to find it for me .  i would send your mother  but she won t leave me under any circumstances .  i myself can t leave the palace grounds at this time .  next to dors and myself  i trust you .  more than dors and myself  in fact .  you re still quite young  you re strong  you re a better heliconian twister than i ever was  and you re smart .    mind you  now  i don t want you to risk your life .  no heroism  no derring do .  i couldn t face your mother if anything happened to you .  just find out what you can .  perhaps you ll find that namarti is alive and operating or dead .  perhaps you ll find out that the joranumites are an active group or moribund .  perhaps you ll find out that the wyan ruling family is active or not .  any of that would be interesting but not vital .  what i want you to find out is whether the infrastructure breakdowns are of human manufacture  as i think they are  and  far more important still  if they are deliberately caused  what else the conspirators plan to do .  it seems to me they must have plans for some major coup and  if so  i must know what that will be .    raych said cautiously   do you have some kinda plan to get me started .     yes indeed  raych .  i want you to go down to the area of wye where kaspalov was killed .  find out if you can if he was an active joranumite and see if you can t join a joranumite cell yourself .     maybe that s possible .  i can always pretend to be an old joranumite .  it s true that i was pretty young when jo jo was sounding off  but i was very impressed by his ideas .  it s even sorta true .     well yes  but there s one important catch .  you might be recognized .  after all  you re the son of the first minister .  you have appeared on holovision now and then and you have been interviewed concerning your views on sector equality .     sure  but     no buts  raych .  you ll wear elevated shoes to add three centimeters to your height and we ll have someone show you how to change the shape of your eyebrows and make your face fuller and change the timbre of your voice .    raych shrugged .   a lotta trouble for nothing .     and   said seldon with a distinct quaver   you will shave off your mustache .    raych s eyes widened and for a moment he sat there in appalled silence .  finally he said in a hoarse whisper   shave my mustache .     clean as a whistle .  no one would recognize you without it .     but it can t be done .  like cutting off your  like castration .    seldon shook his head .   it s just a cultural curiosity .  yugo amaryl is as dahlite as you are and he wears no mustache .     yugo is a nut .  i don t think he s alive at all  except for his mathematics .     he s a great mathematician and the absence of a mustache does not alter that fact .  besides  it s not castration .  your mustache will grow back in two weeks .     two weeks .  it ll take two years to reach this this    he put his hand up  as though to cover and protect it .   seldon said inexorably   raych  you have to do it .  it s a sacrifice you must make .  if you act as my spy with your mustache  you may come to harm .  i can t take that chance .     i d rather die   said raych violently .    don t be melodramatic   said seldon severely .   you would not rather die and this is something you must do .  however  and here he hesitated  don t say anything about it to your mother .  i will take care of that .    raych stared at his father in frustration and then said in a low and despairing tone   all right  dad .    seldon said   i will get someone to supervise your disguise and then you will go to wye by air jet .   buck up  raych  it s not the end of the world .    raych smiled wanly and seldon watched him leave  a deeply troubled look on his face .  a mustache could easily be regrown  but a son could not .  seldon knew perfectly well that he was sending raych into danger .      we all have our small illusions and cleon emperor of the galaxy  king of trantor  and a wide collection of other titles that on rare occasions could be called out in a long sonorous roll was convinced that he was a person of democratic spirit .   it always angered him when he was warned off a course of action by demerzel  or  later  by seldon  on the grounds that such action would be looked on as  tyrannical  or  despotic .    cleon was not a tyrant or despot by disposition  he was certain  he only wanted to take firm and decisive action .   he spoke many times with nostalgic approval of the days when emperors could mingle freely with their subjects  but now  of course  when the history of coups and assassinations actual or attempted had become a dreary fact of life  the emperor had  of necessity  been shut off from the world .   it is doubtful that cleon  who had never in his life met with people except under the most constricted of conditions  would really have felt at home in offhand encounters with strangers  but he always imagined he would enjoy it .  he was excited  therefore  for the rare chance of talking to one of the underlings on the grounds  to smile and to doff the trappings of imperial rule for a few minutes .  it made him feet democratic .   there was this gardener whom seldon had spoken of  for instance .  it would be fitting  even a pleasure  to reward him belatedly for his loyalty and bravery and to do so himself  rather than leaving it to some functionary .   he therefore arranged to meet the fellow in the spacious rose garden  which was in full bloom .  that would be appropriate  cleon thought  but  of course  they would have to bring the gardener there first .  it was unthinkable for the emperor to be made to wait .  it is one thing to be democratic  quite another to be inconvenienced .   the gardener was waiting for him among the roses  his eyes wide  his lips trembling .  it occurred to cleon that it was possible that no one had told the man the exact reason for the meeting .  well  he would reassure him in kindly fashion except that  now he came to think of it  he could not remember the fellow s name .   he turned to one of the officials at his side and said   what is the gardener s name .     sire  it is mandell gruber .  he has been a gardener here for thirty years .    the emperor nodded and said   ah  gruber .  how glad i am to meet a worthy and hardworking gardener .     sire   mumbled gruber  his teeth chattering .   i am not a man of many talents  but it is always my best i try to do on behalf of your gracious self .     of course  of course   said the emperor  wondering if the gardener suspected him of sarcasm .  these men of the lower class lacked the finer feelings that came with refinement and manners  which always made any attempt at democratic display difficult .   cleon said   i have heard from my first minister of the loyalty with which you once came to his aid and of your skill in taking care of the grounds .  the first minister tells me that he and you are quite friendly .     sire  the first minister is most gracious to me  but i know my place .  i never speak to him unless he speaks first .     quite  gruber .  that shows good manners on your part  but the first minister  like myself  is a man of democratic impulses and i trust his judgment of people .    gruber bowed low .   the emperor said   as you know  gruber  chief gardener malcomber is quite old and longs to retire .  the responsibilities are becoming greater than even he can bear .     sire  the chief gardener is much respected by all the gardeners .  may he be spared for many years so that we can all come to him for the benefit of his wisdom and judgment .     well said  gruber   said the emperor carelessly   but you very well know that that is just mumbo jumbo .  he is not going to be spared  at least not with the strength and wit necessary for the position .  he himself requests retirement within the year and i have granted him that .  it remains to find a replacement .     oh  sire  there are fifty men and women in this grand place who could be chief gardener .     i dare say   said the emperor   but my choice has fallen upon you .   the emperor smiled graciously .  this was the moment he had been waiting for .  gruber would now  he expected  fall to his knees in an ecstasy of gratitude .   he did not and the emperor frowned .   gruber said   sire  it is an honor that is too great for me entirely .     nonsense   said cleon  offended that his judgment should be called into question .   it is about time that your virtues are recognized .  you will no longer have to be exposed to weather of all kinds at all times of the year .  you will have the chief gardener s office  a fine place  which i will have redecorated for you  and where you can bring your family .   you do have a family  don t you  gruber .     yes  sire .  a wife and two daughters .  and a son in law .     very good .  you will be very comfortable and you will enjoy your new life  gruber .  you will be indoors  gruber  and out of the weather  like a true trantorian .     sire  consider that i am an anacreonian by upbringing     i have considered  gruber .  all worlds are alike to the emperor .  it is done .  the new job is what you deserved .    he nodded his head and stalked off .  cleon was satisfied with this latest show of his benevolence .  of course  he could have used a little more gratitude from the fellow  a little more appreciation  but at least the task was done .   and it was much easier to have this done than to settle the matter of the failing infrastructure .   cleon had  in a moment of testiness  declared that whenever a breakdown could be attributed to human error  the human being in question should forthwith be executed .    just a few executions   he said   and it will be remarkable how careful everyone will become .     i m afraid  sire   seldon had said   that this type of despotic behavior would not accomplish what you wish .  it would probably force the workers to go on strike and if you try to force them back to work  there would then be an insurrection and if you try to replace them with soldiers  you will find they do not know how to control the machinery  so that breakdowns will begin to take place much more frequently .    it was no wonder that cleon turned to the matter of appointing a chief gardener with relief .   as for gruber  he gazed after the departing emperor with the chill of sheer horror .  he was going to be taken from the freedom of the open air and condemned to the constriction of four walls .   yet how could one refuse the emperor .       raych looked in the mirror of his wye hotel room somberly  it was a pretty run down hotel room  but raych was not supposed to have too many credits  .  he did not like what he saw .  his mustache was gone  his sideburns were shortened  his hair was clipped at the sides and back .   he looked plucked .   worse than that .  as a result of the change in his facial contours  he looked baby faced .   it was disgusting .   nor was he making any headway .  seldon had given him the security reports on kaspal kaspalov s death  which he had studied .  there wasn t much there .  just that kaspalov had been murdered and that the local security officers had come up with nothing of importance in connection with that murder .  it seemed quite clear that the security officers attached little or no importance to it  anyway .   that was not surprising .  in the last century  the crime rate had risen markedly in most worlds  certainly in the grandly complex world of trantor  and nowhere were the local security officers up to the job of doing anything useful about it .  in fact  the security establishment had declined in numbers and efficiency everywhere and  while this was hard to prove  had become more corrupt .  it was inevitable this should be so  with pay refusing to keep pace with the cost of living .  one must pay civil officials to keep them honest .  failing that  they would surely make up for their inadequate salaries in other ways .   seldon had been preaching this doctrine for some years now  but it did no good .  there was no way to increase wages without increasing taxes and the populace would not sit still for increased taxes .  it seemed they would rather lose ten times the credits in graft .   it was all part  seldon had said  of the general deterioration of imperial society over the previous two centuries .   well  what was raych to do .  he was here at the hotel where kaspalov had lived during the days immediately before his murder .  somewhere in the hotel there might be someone who had something to do with that or who knew someone who had .   it seemed to raych that he must make himself conspicuous .  he must show an interest in kaspalov s death and then someone would get interested in him and pick him up .  it was dangerous  but if he could make himself sound harmless enough  they might not attack him immediately .   well   raych looked at his timeband .  there would be people enjoying their predinner aperitifs in the bar .  he might as well join them and see what would happen if anything .       in some respects  wye could be quite puritanical .   this was true of all the sectors  though the rigidity of one sector might be completely different from the rigidity of another .   here  the drinks were not alcoholic but were synthetically designed to stimulate in other ways .  raych did not like the taste  finding himself utterly unused to it  but it meant that he could sip his drink slowly and look around .   he caught the eye of a young woman several tables away and had difficulty in looking away .  she was attractive and it was clear that wye s ways were not puritanical in every fashion .   after a few moments  the young woman smiled slightly and rose .  she drifted toward raych s table  while raych watched her speculatively .  he could scarcely  he thought with marked regret  afford a side adventure just now .   she stopped for a moment when she reached raych and then let herself slide smoothly into an adjacent chair .    hello   she said .   you don t look like a regular here .    raych smiled .   i m not .  do you know all the regulars .     just about   she said  unembarrassed .   my name is manella .  what s yours .    raych was more regretful than ever .  she was quite tall  taller than he himself was without his heels something he always found attractive had a milky complexion  and long  softly wavy hair that had distinct glints of dark red in it .  her clothing was not too garish and she might  if she had tried a little harder  have passed as a respectable woman of the not too hardworking class .   raych said   my name doesn t matter .  i don t have many credits .     oh .  too bad .   manella made a face .   can t you get a few .     i d like to .  i need a job .  do you know of any .     what kind of job .    raych shrugged .   i don t have any experience in anything fancy  but i ain t proud .    manella looked at him thoughtfully .   i ll tell you what  mr .  nameless .  sometimes it doesn t take any credits at all .    raych froze at once .  he had been successful enough with women  but with his mustache his mustache .  what could she see in his baby face .   he said   tell you what .  i had a friend living here a couple of weeks ago and i can t find him .  since you know all the regulars  maybe you know him .  his name is kaspalov .   he raised his voice slightly .   kaspal kaspalov .    manella stared at him blankly and shook her head .   i don t know anybody by that name .     too bad .  he was a joranumite and so am l  again  a blank look .   do you know what a joranumite is .    she shook her head .   n no .  i ve heard the word  but i don t know what it means .  is it some kind of job .    raych felt disappointed .   he said   it would take too long to explain .    it sounded like a dismissal and  after a moment of uncertainty  manella rose and drifted away .  she did not smile and raych was a little surprised that she had remained as long as she did .    well  seldon had always insisted that raych had the capacity to inspire affection but surely not in a businesswoman of this sort .  for them  payment was the thing .    his eyes followed manella automatically as she stopped at another table  where a man was seated by himself .  he was of early middle age  with butter yellow hair  slicked back .  he was very smooth shaven  but it seemed to raych that he could have used a beard  his chin being too prominent and a bit asymmetric .   apparently manella had no better luck with this beardless one .  a few words were exchanged and she moved on .  too bad  but surely it was impossible for her to fail often .  she was unquestionably desirable .   raych found himself thinking  quite involuntarily  of what the upshot would be if he  after all  could  and then raych realized that he had been joined by someone else .  it was a man this time .  it was  in fact  the man to whom manella had just spoken .  he was astonished that his own preoccupation had allowed him to be thus approached and  in effect  caught by surprise .  he couldn t very well afford this sort of thing .   the man looked at him with a glint of curiosity in his eyes .   you were just talking to a friend of mine .    raych could not help smiling broadly .   she s a friendly person .     yes  she is .  and a good friend of mine .  i couldn t help overhearing what you said to her .     wasn t nothing wrong  i think .     not at all  but you called yourself a joranumite .    raych s heart jumped .  his remark to manella had hit dead center after all .  it had meant nothing to her  but it seemed to mean something to her  friend .    did that mean he was on the road now .  or merely in trouble .       raych did his best to size up his new companion  without allowing his own face to lose its smooth naivete .  the man had sharp greenish eyes and his right hand clenched almost threateningly into a fist as it rested on the table .   raych looked owlishly at the other and waited .   again  the man said   i understand you call yourself a joranumite .    raych did his best to look uneasy .  it was not difficult .  he said   why do you ask  mister .     because i don t think you re old enough .     i m old enough .  i used to watch jo jo joranum s speeches on holovision .     can you quote them .    raych shrugged .   no  but i got the idea .     you re a brave young man to talk openly about being a joranumite .  some people don t like that .     i m told there are lots of joranumites in wye .     that may be .  is that why you came here .     i m looking for a job .  maybe another joranumite would help me .     there are joranumites in dahl  too .  where are you from .    there was no question that he recognized raych s accent .  that could not be disguised .   he said   i was born in millimaru  but i lived mostly in dahl when i was growing up .     doing what .     nothing much .  going to school some .     and why are you a joranumite .    raych let himself heat up a bit .  he couldn t have lived in downtrodden  discriminated against dahl without having obvious reasons for being a joranumite .  he said   because i think there should be more representative government in the empire  more participation by the people  and more equality among the sectors and the worlds .  doesn t anyone with brains and a heart think that .     and you want to see the emperorship abolished .    raych paused .  one could get away with a great deal in the way of subversive statements  but anything overtly anti emperor was stepping outside the bounds .  he said   i ain t saying that .  i believe in the emperor  but ruling a whole empire is too much for one man .     it isn t one man .  there s a whole imperial bureaucracy .  what do you think of hari seldon  the first minister .     don t think nothing about him .  don t know about him .     all you know is that people should be more represented in the affairs of government .  is that right .    raych allowed himself to look confused .   that s what jo jo joranum used to say .  i don t know what you call it .  i heard someone once call it  democracy   but i don t know what that means .     democracy is something that some worlds have tried .  some still do .  i don t know that those worlds are run better than other worlds .  so you re a democrat .     is that what you call it .   raych let his head sink  as if in deep thought .   i feel more at home as a joranumite .     of course  as a dahlite     i just lived there awhile .      you re all for people s equalities and such things .  the dahlites  being an oppressed group  would naturally think in that fashion .     i hear that wye is pretty strong in joranumite thinking .  they re not oppressed .     different reason .  the old wye mayors always wanted to be emperors .  did you know that .    raych shook his head .    eighteen years ago   said the man   mayor rashelle nearly carried through a coup in that direction .  so the wyans are rebels  not so much joranumite as anti cleon .    raych said   i don t know nothing about that .  i ain t against the emperor .     but you are for popular representation  aren t you .  do you think that some sort of elected assembly could run the galactic empire without bogging down in politics and partisan bickering .  without paralysis .    raych said   huh .  i don t understand .     do you think a great many people could come to some decision quickly in times of emergency .  or would they just sit around and argue .     i don t know  but it doesn t seem right that just a few people should have all the say over all the worlds .     are you willing to fight for your beliefs .  or do you just like to talk about them .     no one asked me to do any fighting   said raych .    suppose someone did .  how important do you think your beliefs about democracy or joranumite philosophy are .     i d fight for them if i thought it would do any good .     there s a brave lad .  so you came to wye to fight for your beliefs .     no   said raych uncomfortably   i can t say i did .  i came to look for a job  sir .  it ain t easy to find no jobs these days and i ain t got no credits .  a guy s gotta live .     i agree .  what s your name .    the question shot out without warning  but raych was ready for it .   planchet  sir .     first or last name .     only name  as far as i know .     you have no credits and  i gather  very little education .     afraid so .     and no experience at any specialized job .     i ain t worked much  but i m willing .     all right .  i ll tell you what  planchet .   he took a small white triangle out of his pocket and pressed it in such a way as to produce a printed message on it .  then he rubbed his thumb across it  freezing it .   i ll tell you where to go .  you take this with you and it may get you a job .    raych took the card and glanced at it .  the signals seemed to fluoresce  but raych could not read them .  he looked at the other man warily .   what if they think i stole it .     it can t be stolen .  it has my sign on it and now it has your name .     what if they ask me who you are .     they won t .   you say you want a job .  there s your chance .  i don t guarantee it  but there s your chance .   he gave him another card .   this is where to go .   raych could read this one .    thank you   he mumbled .   the man made little dismissing gestures with his hand .   raych rose and left and wondered what he was getting into .       up and down .  up and down .  up and down .   gleb andorin watched gambol deen namarti trudging up and down .  namarti was obviously unable to sit still under the driving force of the violence of his passion .   andorin thought  he s not the brightest man in the empire or even in the movement  not the shrewdest  certainly not the most capable of rational thought .  he has to be held back constantly but he s driven as none of the rest of us are .  we would give up  let go  but he won t .  push  pull  prod  kick .   well  maybe we need someone like that .  we must have someone like that or nothing will ever happen .   namarti stopped  as though he felt andorin s eyes boring into his back .  he turned around and said   if you re going to lecture me again on kaspalov  don t bother .    andorin shrugged lightly .   why bother lecturing you .  the deed is done .  the harm if any has been done .     what harm  andorin .  what harm .  if i had not done it  then we would have been harmed .  the man was on the edge of being a traitor .  within a month  he would have gone running     i know .  i was there .  i heard what he said .     then you understand there was no choice .  no choice .  you don t think i liked to have an old comrade killed  do you .  i had no choice .     very well .  you had no choice .    namarti resumed his tramping  then turned again .   andorin  do you believe in gods .    andorin stared   in what .     in gods .     i never heard the word .  what is it .    namarti said   it s not galactic standard .  supernatural influences .  how s that .     oh  supernatural influences .  why didn t you say so .  no  i don t believe in that sort of thing .  by definition  something is supernatural if it exists outside the laws of nature and nothing exists outside the laws of nature .  are you turning into a mystic .   andorin asked it as though he were joking  but his eyes narrowed with sudden concern .   namarti stared him down .  those blazing eyes of his could stare anyone down .   don t be a fool .  i ve been reading about it .  trillions of people believe in supernatural influences .     i know   said andorin .   they always have .     they ve done so since before the beginning of history .  the word  gods  is of unknown origin .  it is  apparently  a hangover from some primeval language of which no trace any longer exists  except that word .   do you know how many different varieties of beliefs there are in various kinds of gods .     approximately as many as the varieties of fools among the galactic population  i should say .    namarti ignored that .   some people think the word dates back to the time when all humanity existed on but a single world .     itself a mythological concept .  that s just as lunatic as the notion of supernatural influences .  there never was one original human world .     there would have to be  andorin   said namarti  annoyed .   human beings can t have evolved on different worlds and ended as a single species .     even so  there s no effective human world .  it can t be located  it can t he defined  so it can t be spoken of sensibly  so it effectively doesn t exist .     these gods   said namarti  continuing to follow his own line of thought   are supposed to protect humanity and keep it safe or at least to care for those portions of humanity that know how to make use of the gods .  at a time when there was only one human world  it makes sense to suppose they would be particularly interested in caring for that one tiny world with a few people .  they would care for such a world as though they were big brothers or parents .     very nice of them .  i d like to see them try to handle the entire empire .     what if they could .  what if they were infinite .     what if the sun were frozen .  what s the use of  what if .     i m just speculating .  just thinking .  haven t you ever let your mind wander freely .  do you always keep everything on a leash .     i should imagine that s the safest way  keeping it on a leash .  what does your wandering mind tell you  chief .    namarti s eyes flashed at the other  as though he suspected sarcasm  but andorin s face remained good natured and blank .   namarti said   what my mind is telling me is this  if there are gods  they must be on our side .     wonderful if true .  where s the evidence .     evidence .  without the gods  it would just be a coincidence  i suppose  but a very useful one .   suddenly namarti yawned and sat down  looking exhausted .   good  thought andorin .  his galloping mind has finally wound itself down and he may talk sense now .    this matter of internal breakdown of the infrastructure   said namarti  his voice distinctly lower .   andorin interrupted .   you know  chief  kaspalov was not entirely wrong about this .  the longer we keep it up  the greater the chance that imperial forces will discover the cause .  the whole program must  sooner or later  explode in our faces .     not yet .  so far  everything is exploding in the imperial face .  the unrest on trantor is something i can feel .   he raised his hands  rubbing his fingers together .   i can feel it .  and we are almost through .  we are ready for the next step .    andorin smiled humorlessly .   i m not asking for details  chief .  kaspalov did and look where that got him .  i am not kaspalov .     it s precisely because you re not kaspalov that i can tell you .  and because i know something now i didn t then .     i presume   said andorin  only half believing what he was saying   that you intend a strike on the imperial palace grounds .    namarti looked up .   of course .  what else is there to do .  the problem  however  is how to penetrate the grounds effectively .  i have my sources of information there  but they are only spies .  i ll need men of action on the spot .     to get men of action into the most heavily guarded region in all the galaxy will not be easy .     of course not .  that s what has been giving me an unbearable headache till now and then the gods intervened .    andorin said gently  it was taking all his self restraint to keep from showing his disgust    i don t think we need a metaphysical discussion .  what has happened leaving the gods to one side .     my information is that his gracious and ever to be beloved emperor cleon i has decided to appoint a new chief gardener .  this is the first new appointee in nearly a quarter of a century .     and if so .     do you see no significance .    andorin thought for a moment .   i am not a favorite of your gods .  i don t see any significance .     if you have a new chief gardener  andorin  the situation is the same as having a new administrator of any other type the same as if you had a new first minister or a new emperor .  the new chief gardener will certainly want his own staff .  he will force into retirement what he considers dead wood and will hire younger gardeners by the hundreds .     that s possible .     it s more than possible .  it s certain .  exactly that happened when the present chief gardener was appointed and the same when his predecessor was appointed and so on .  hundreds of strangers from the outer worlds     why from the outer worlds .     use your brains if you have any  andorin .  what do trantorians know about gardening when they ve lived under domes all their lives  tending potted plants  zoos  and carefully arranged crops of grains and fruit trees .  what do they know about life in the wild .     ahhh .  now i understand .     so there will be these strangers flooding the grounds .  they will be carefully checked  i presume  but they won t be as tightly screened as they would be if they were trantorians .  and that means  surely  that we should be able to supply just a few of our own people  with false identifications  and get them inside .  even if some are screened out  a few might make it a few must make it .  our people will enter  despite the supertight security established since the failed coup in the early days of first minister seldon .    he virtually spat out the name  as he always did .    we ll finally have our chance .    now it was andorin who felt dizzy  as if he d fallen into a spinning vortex .   it seems odd for me to say so  chief  but there is something to this  gods  business after all  because i have been waiting to tell you something that i now see fits in perfectly .    namarti stared at the other suspiciously and looked around the room  as though he suddenly feared for security .  but such fear was groundless .  the room was located deep in an old fashioned residential complex and was well shielded .  no one could overhear and no one  even with detailed directions  could find it easily nor get through the layers of protection provided by loyal members of the organization .   namarti said   what are you talking about .     i ve found a man for you .  a young man very naive .  a quite likable fellow  the kind you feel you can trust as soon as you see him .  he s got an open face  wide open eyes  he s lived in dahl  he s an enthusiast for equality  he thinks joranum was the greatest thing since dahlite cokeicers  and i m sure we can easily talk him into doing anything for the cause .     for the cause .   said namarti  whose suspicions were not in the least alleviated .   is he one of us .     actually  he s not one of anything .  he s got some vague notions in his head that joranum wanted sector equality .     that was his lure .  sure .     it s ours  too  but the kid believes it .  he talks about equality and popular participation in government .  he even mentioned democracy .    namarti snickered .   in twenty thousand years  democracy has never been used for very long without falling apart .     yes  but that s not our concern .  it s what drives the young man and i tell you  chief  i knew we had our tool just about the moment i saw him  but i didn t know how we could possibly use him .  now i know .  we can get him onto the imperial palace grounds as a gardener .     how .  does he know anything about gardening .     no .  i m sure he doesn t .  he s never worked at anything but unskilled labor .  he s operating a hauler right now and i think that he had to be taught how to do that .  still  if we can get him in as a gardener s helper  if he just knows how to hold a pair of shears  then we ve got it .     got what .     got someone who can approach anyone we wish and do so without raising the flutter of a suspicion and get close enough to strike .  i m telling you he simply exudes a kind of honorable stupidity  a kind of foolish virtue that inspires confidence .     and he ll do what we tell him to do .     absolutely .     how did you meet this person .     it wasn t i .  it was manella who really spotted him .     who .     manella .  manella dubanqua .     oh .  that friend of yours .   namarti s face twisted into a look of prissy disapproval .    she s the friend of many people   said andorin tolerantly .   that s one of the things that makes her so useful .  she can weigh a man quickly and with very little to go on .  she talked to this fellow because she was attracted to him at sight and i assure you that manella is not one who is usually attracted by anything but the bottom line so  you see  this man is rather unusual .  she talked to this fellow his name is planchet  by the way and then told me   i have a live one for you  gleb .   i ll trust her on the matter of live ones any day of the week .    namarti said slyly   and what do you think this wonderful tool of yours would do once he had the run of the grounds  eh  andorin .    andorin took a deep breath .   what else .  if we do everything right  he will dispose of our dear emperor cleon  first of that name  for us .    namarti s face blazed into anger .   what .  are you mad .  why should we want to kill cleon .  he s our hold on the government .  he s the facade behind which we can rule .  he s our passport to legitimacy .  where are your brains .  we need him as a figurehead .  he won t interfere with us and we ll be stronger for his existence .    andorin s fair face turned blotchy red and his good humor finally exploded .   what do you have in mind  then .  what are you planning .  i m getting tired of always having to second guess .    namarti raised his hand .   all right .  all right .  calm down .  i meant no harm .  but think a bit  will you .  who destroyed joranum .  who destroyed our hopes ten years ago .  it was that mathematician .  and it is he who rules the empire now with his idiotic talk about psychohistory .  cleon is nothing .  it is hari seldon we must destroy .  it is hari seldon whom i ve been turning into an object of ridicule with these constant breakdowns .  the miseries they entail are placed at his doorstep .  it is all being interpreted as his inefficiency  his incapacity .   there was a trace of spittle in the corners of namarti s mouth .   when he s cut down  there will be a cheer from the empire that will drown out every holovision report for hours .  it won t even matter if they know who did it .   he raised his hand and let it drop  as if he were plunging a knife into someone s heart .   we will be looked upon as heroes of the empire  as saviors .   eh .  eh .  do you think your youngster can cut down hari seldon .    andorin had recovered his sense of equanimity at least outwardly .    i m sure he would   he said with forced lightness .   for cleon  he might have some respect  the emperor has a mystical aura about him  as you know .    he stressed the  you  faintly and namarti scowled .    he would have no such feelings about seldon .    inwardly  however  andorin was furious .  this was not what he wanted .  he was being betrayed .       manella brushed the hair out of her eyes and smiled up at raych .   i told you it wouldn t cost you any credits .    raych blinked and scratched at his bare shoulder .   but are you going to ask me for some now .    she shrugged and smiled rather impishly .   why should i .     why shouldn t you .     because i m allowed to take my own pleasure sometimes .     with me .     there s no one else here .    there was a long pause and then manella said soothingly   besides  you don t have that many credits anyway .  how s the job .    raych said   ain t much but better than nothing .  lots better .  did you tell that guy to get me one .    manella shook her head slowly .   you mean gleb andorin .  i didn t tell him to do anything .  i just said he might be interested in you .     is he going to be annoyed because you and i     why should he .  none of his business .  and none of yours  either .     what s he do .  i mean  what does he work at .     i don t think he works at anything .  he s rich .  he s a relative of the old mayors .     of wye .     right .  he doesn t like the imperial government .  none of those old mayor people do .  he says cleon should    she stopped suddenly and said   i m talking too much .  don t you go repeating anything i say .     me .  i ain t heard you say nothing at all .  and i ain t going to .     all right .     but what about andorin .  is he high up in joranumite business .  is tae an important guy there .     i wouldn t know .     don t he ever talk about that kind of stuff .     not to me .     oh   said raych  trying not to sound annoyed .   manella looked at him shrewdly .   why are you so interested .     i want to get in with them .  i figure i ll get higher up that way .  better job .  more credits .  you know .     maybe andorin will help you .  he likes you .  i know that much .     could you make him like me more .     i can try .  i don t know why he shouldn t .  i like you .  i like you more than i like him .     thank you  manella .  i like you  too .   a lot .   he ran his hand down the side of her body and wished ardently that he could concentrate more on her and less on his assignment .        gleb andorin   said hari seldon wearily  rubbing his eyes .    and who is he .   asked dors venabili  her mood as cold as it had teen every day since raych had left .    until a few days ago i never heard of him   said seldon .   that s the trouble with trying to run a world of forty billion people .  you never hear of anyone  except for the few who obtrude themselves on your notice .  with all the computerized information in the world  trantor remains a planet of anonymities .  we can drag up people with their reference numbers and their statistics  but whom do we drag up .  add twenty five million outer worlds and the wonder is that the galactic empire has remained a working phenomenon for all these millennia .  frankly i think it has existed only because it very largely runs itself .  and now it is finally running down .     so much for philosophizing  hari   said dors .   who is this andorin .     someone i admit i ought to have known about .  i managed to cajole the security establishment into calling up some files on him .  he s a member of the wyan mayoralty family the most prominent member  in fact  so the security people have kept tabs on him .  they think he has ambitions but is too much of a playboy to do anything about them .     and is he involved with the joranumites .    seldon made an uncertain gesture .   i m under the impression that the security establishment knows nothing about the joranumites .  that may mean that the joranumites no longer exist or that  if they do  they are of no importance .  it may also mean that the security establishment just isn t interested .  nor is there any way in which i can force it to be interested .  i m only thankful the officers give me any information at all .  and i am the first minister .     is it possible that you re not a very good first minister .   said dors  dryly .    that s more than possible .  it s probably been generations since there s been an appointee less suited to the job than myself .  but that has nothing to do with the security establishment .  it s a totally independent arm of the government .  i doubt that cleon himself knows much about it  though  in theory  the security officers are supposed to report to him through their director .  believe me  if we only knew more about the security establishment  we d be trying to stick its actions into our psychohistorical equations  such as they are .     are the security officers on our side  at least .     i believe so  but i can t swear to it .     and why are you interested in this what s his name .     gleb andorin .  because i received a roundabout message from raych .    dors s eyes flashed .   why didn t you tell me .  is he all right .     as far as i know  but i hope he doesn t try any further messages .  if he s caught communicating  he won t be all right .  in any case  he has made contact with andorin .     and the joranumites  too .     i don t think so .  it would sound unlikely  for the connection is not something that would make sense .  the joranumite movement is predominantly lower class a proletarian movement  so to speak .  and andorin is an aristocrat of aristocrats .  what would he be doing with the joranumites .     if he s of the wyan mayoralty family  he might aspire to the imperial throne  might he not .     they ve been aspiring for generations .  you remember rashelle  i trust .  she was andorin s aunt .     then he might be using the joranumites as a stepping stone  don t you think .     if they exist .  and if they do and if a stepping stone is what andorin wants i think he d find himself playing a dangerous game .  the joranumites if they exist would have their own plans and a man like andorin may find he s simply riding a greti     what s a greti .     some extinct animal of a ferocious type  i think .  it s just a proverbial phrase back on helicon .  if you ride a greti  you find you can t get off  for then it will eat you .    seldon paused .   one more thing .  raych seems to be involved with a woman who knows andorin and through whom  he thinks  he may get important information .  i m telling you this now so that you won t accuse me afterward of keeping anything from you .    dors frowned .   a woman .     one  i gather  who knows a great many men who will talk to her unwisely  sometimes  under intimate circumstances .     one of those .   her frown deepened .   i don t like the thought of raych     come  come .  raych is thirty years old and undoubtedly has much experience .  you can leave this woman or any woman  i think safely to raych s good sense .   he turned toward dors with a look so worn  so weary  and said   do you think i like this .  do you think i like any of this .    and dors could find nothing to say .       gambol deen namarti was not  at even the best of times  noted for his politeness and suavity and the approaching climax of a decade of planning had left his disposition sour .   he rose from his chair with some agitation and said   you ve taken your time getting here  andorin .    andorin shrugged .   but i m here .     and this young man of yours this remarkable tool that you re touting .  where is he .     he ll be here eventually .     why not now .    andorin s rather handsome head seemed to sink a bit  as though he were lost in thought or coming to a decision  and then he said abruptly   i don t want to bring him until i know where i stand .     what does that mean .     simple words in galactic standard .  how long has it been your aim to get rid of hari seldon .     always .  always .  is that so hard to understand .  we deserve revenge for what he did to jo jo .  even if he hadn t done that  since he s the first minister  we d have to put him out of the way .     but it s cleon cleon who must be brought down .  if not only he  then at least he  in addition to seldon .     why does a figurehead concern you .     you weren t born yesterday .  i ve never had to explain my part in this because you re not so ignorant a fool as not to know .  what can i possibly care about your plans if they don t include a replacement on the throne .    namarti laughed .   of course .  i ve known for a long time that you look upon me as your footstool  your way of climbing up to the imperial throne .     would you expect anything else .     not at all .  i will do the planning  take the chances  and then  when all is quite done  you gather in the reward .  it makes sense  doesn t it .     yes  it does make sense  for the reward will be yours  too .  won t you become the first minister .  won t you be able to count on the full support of a new emperor  one who is filled with gratitude .  won t i be    and his face twisted with irony as he spat out the words  the new figurehead .     is that what you plan to be .  a figurehead .     i plan to be the emperor .  i supplied advances of credit when you had none .  i supplied the cadre when you had none .  i supplied the respectability you needed to build a large organization here in wye .  i can still withdraw everything i ve brought in .     i don t think so .     do you want to risk it .  don t think you can treat me the way you treated kaspalov  either .  if anything happens to me  wye will become uninhabitable for you and yours and you will find that no other sector will supply you with what you need .    namarti sighed .   then you insist on having the emperor killed .     i didn t say  killed .   i said  brought down .   the details i leave to you .   this last statement was accompanied with an almost dismissive wave of the hand  a flick of the wrist  as if andorin were already sitting on the imperial throne .    and then you ll be emperor .     yes .     no  you won t .  you ll be dead and not at my hands  either .  andorin  let me teach you some of the facts of life .  if cleon is killed  then the matter of the succession comes up and  to avoid civil war  the imperial guard will at once kill every member of the wyan mayoral family they can find you first of all .  on the other hand  if only the first minister is killed  you will be safe .     why .     a first minister is only a first minister .  they come and go .  it is possible that cleon himself may have grown tired of him and arranged the murder .  certainly we would see to it that rumors of this sort are spread .  the imperial guard would hesitate and would give us a chance to put the new government into place .  indeed  it is quite possible that they themselves would be grateful for the end of seldon .     and with the new government in place  what am i to do .  keep on waiting .  forever .     no .  once i m first minister  there will be ways of dealing with cleon .  i may even be able to do something with the imperial guard and even with the security establishment and use them all as my instruments .  i will then manage to find some safe way of getting rid of cleon and replacing him with you .    andorin burst out   why should you .    namarti said   what do you mean  why should i .     you have a personal grudge against seldon .  once he is gone  why should you run unnecessary risks at the highest level .  you will make your peace with cleon and i will have to retire to my crumbling estate and my impossible dreams .  and perhaps  to play it safe  you will have me killed .    namarti said   no .  cleon was born to the throne .  he comes from several generations of emperors the proud entun dynasty .  he would he very difficult to handle  a plague .  you  on the other hand  would come to the throne as a member of a new dynasty  without any strong ties to tradition  for the previous wyan emperors were  you will admit  totally undistinguished .  you will be seated on a shaky throne and will need someone to support you me .  and i will need someone who is dependent upon me and whom i can therefore handle you .   come  andorin  ours is not a marriage of love  which fades in a year  it is a marriage of convenience  which can last as long as we both live .  let us trust each other .     you swear i will be emperor .     what good would swearing do if you couldn t trust my word .  let us say i would find you an extraordinarily useful emperor and i would want you to replace cleon as soon as that can safely be managed .  now introduce me to this man you think will be the perfect tool for your purposes .     very well .  and remember what makes him different .  i have studied him .  he s a not very bright idealist .  he will do what he s told  unconcerned by danger  unconcerned by second thoughts .  and he exudes a kind of trustworthiness so that his victim will trust him  even if he has a blaster in his hand .     i find that impossible to believe .     wait till you meet him   said andorin .       raych kept his eyes down .  he had taken a quick look at namarti and it was all he needed .  he had met the man ten years before  when raych had been sent to lure jo jo joranum to his destruction  and one look was more than enough .   namarti had changed little in ten years .  anger and hatred were still the dominant characteristics one could see in him or that raych could see in him  at any rate  for he realized he was not an impartial witness and those seemed to have marinated him into leathery permanence .  his face was a trifle more gaunt  his hair was flecked with gray  but his thin lipped mouth was set in the same harsh line and his dark eyes were as brilliantly dangerous as ever .   that was enough and raych kept his eyes averted .  namarti  he felt  was not the type of person who would take to someone who could stare lm straight in the face .   namarti seemed to devour raych with his own eyes  but the slight sneer his face always seemed to wear remained .   he turned to andorin  who stood uneasily to one side  and said  quite  is though the subject of conversation were not present   this is the man  then .    andorin nodded and his lips moved in a soundless  yes  chief .    namarti said to raych abruptly   your name .     planchet  sir .     you believe in our cause .     yes  sir .   he spoke carefully  in accordance with andorin s instructions .   i am a democrat and want greater participation of the people in the governmental process .    namarti s eyes flicked in andorin s direction .   a speechmaker .    he looked back at raych .   are you willing to undertake risks for the cause .     any risk  sir .     you will do as you are told .  no questions .  no hanging back .     i will follow orders .     do you know anything about gardening .    raych hesitated .   no  sir .     you re a trantorian  then .  born under the dome .     i was born in millimaru  sir  and i was brought up in dahl .     very well   said namarti .  then to andorin   take him out and deliver him temporarily to the men waiting there .  they will take good care of him .  then come back  andorin .  i want to speak to you .    when andorin returned  a profound change had come over namarti .  ibis eyes were glittering and his mouth was twisted into a feral grin .    andorin   he said   the gods we spoke of the other day are with us to an extent i couldn t have imagined .     i told you the man was suitable for our purposes .     far more suitable than you think .  you know  of course  the tale of how hari seldon our revered first minister  sent his son or foster son  rather to see joranum and to set the trap into which joranum  against my advice  fell .     yes   said andorin  nodding wearily   i know the story .   he said it with the air of one who knew the story entirely too well .    i saw that boy only that once  but his image burned into my brain .  do you suppose that ten years  passage and false heels and a shaved mustache could fool me .  that planchet of yours is raych  the foster son of hari seldon .    andorin paled and held his breath for a moment .  he said   are you sure of that  chief .     as sure as i am that you re standing here in front of me and that you have introduced an enemy into our midst .     i had no idea     don t get nervous   said namarti .   i consider it the best thing you have ever done in your idle aristocratic life .  you have played the role that the gods have marked out for you .  if i had not known who he was  he might have fulfilled the function for which he was undoubtedly intended  to be a spy in our midst and an informant of our most secret plans .  but since i know who he is  it won t work that way .  instead  we now have everything .    namarti rubbed his hands together in delight and  haltingly  as if he realized how far out of character it was for him  he smiled and laughed .       manella said thoughtfully   i guess i won t be seeing you anymore  planchet .    raych was drying himself after his shower .   why not .     gleb andorin doesn t want me to .     why not .    manella shrugged her smooth shoulders .   he says you have important work to do and no more time to fool around .  maybe he means you ll get a better job .    raych stiffened .   what kind of work .  did he mention anything in particular .     no  but he said he would be going to the imperial sector .     did he .  does he often tell you things like that .     you know how it is  planchet .  when a fellow s in bed with you  he talks a lot .     i know   said raych  who was always careful not to .   what else does he say .     why do you ask .   she frowned a bit .   he always asks about you  too .  i noticed that about men .  they re curious about each other .  why is that  do you suppose .     what do you tell him about me .     not much .  just that you re a very decent sort of guy .  naturally i don t tell him that i like you better than i like him .  that would hurt his feelings and it might hurt me  too .    raych was getting dressed .   so it s good bye  then .     for a while  i suppose .  gleb may change his mind .  of course  i d like to go to the imperial sector if he d take me .  i ve never been there .    raych almost slipped  but he managed to cough  then said   i ve never been there  either .     it s got the biggest buildings and the nicest places and the fanciest restaurants and that s where the rich people live .  i d like to meet some rich people besides gleb  i mean .    raych said   i suppose there s not much you can get out of a person like me .     you re all right .  you can t think of credits all the time  but you ve got to think of them some of the time .  especially since i think gleb is getting tired of me .    raych felt compelled to say   no one could get tired of you   and then found  a little to his own confusion  that he meant it .   manella said   that s what men always say  but you d be surprised .  anyway  it s been good  you and i  planchet .  take care of yourself and  who knows  we may see each other again .    raych nodded and found himself at a loss for words .  there was no way in which he could say or do anything to express his feelings .   he turned his mind in other directions .  he had to find out what the namarti people were planning .  if they were separating him from manella  the crisis must be rapidly approaching .  all he had to go on was that odd question about gardening .   nor could he get any further information back to seldon .  he had been kept under close scrutiny since his meeting with namarti and all avenues of communication were cut off surely another indication of an approaching crisis .   but if he were to find out what was going on only after it was done and if he could communicate the news only after it was no longer news he would have failed .       hari seldon was not having a good day .  he had not heard from raych since his first communique  he had no idea what was happening .   aside from his natural concern for raych s safety  surely he would hear if something really bad had happened   there was his uneasiness over what might be planned .   it would have to be subtle .  a direct attack on the palace itself was totally out of the question .  security there was far too tight .  but if so  what else could be planned that would be sufficiently effective .   the whole thing was keeping him awake at night and distracted by day .   the signal light flashed .    first minister .  your two o clock appointment  sir     what two o clock appointment is this .     mandell gruber  the gardener .  he has the necessary certification .    seldon remembered .   yes .  send him in .    this was no time to see gruber  but he had agreed to it in a moment of weakness the man had seemed distraught .  a first minister should not have such moments of weakness  but seldon had been seldon long before he had become first  minister .    come in  gruber   he said kindly .   gruber stood before him  head ducking mechanically  eyes darting this way and that .  seldon was quite certain the gardener had never been in any room as magnificent as this one and he had the bitter urge to say   do you like it .  please take it .  i don t want it .    but he only said   what is it  gruber .  why are you so unhappy   there was no immediate answer  gruber merely smiled vacantly .   seldon said   sit down  man .  right there in that chair .     oh no  first minister .  it would not be fitting .  i ll get it dirty .     if you do  it will be easy to clean .  do as i say .   good .  now just sit there a minute or two and gather your thoughts .  then  when you are ready  tell me what s the matter .    gruber sat silent for a moment  then the words came out in a panting rush .   first minister .  it is chief gardener i am to be .  the blessed emperor himself told me so .     yes  i have heard of that  but that surely isn t what is troubling you .  your new post is a matter of congratulations and i do congratulate you .  i may even have contributed to it  gruber .  i have never forgotten your bravery at the time i was nearly killed and you can be sure i mentioned it to his imperial majesty .  it is a suitable reward  gruber  and you would deserve the promotion in any case  for it is quite clear from your record that you are fully qualified for the post .  so  now that that s out of the way  tell me what is troubling you .     first minister  it is the very post and promotion that s troubling me .  it is something i cannot manage  for i am not qualified .     we are convinced you are .    gruber grew agitated .   and is it in an office i will have to sit .  i can t sit in an office .  i could not go out in the open air and work with the plants and animals .  i would be in prison  first minister .    seldon s eyes opened wide .   no such thing  gruber .  you needn t stay in the office longer than you have to .  you could wander around the grounds freely  supervising everything .  you will have all the outdoors you want and you will merely spare yourself the hard work .     i want the hard work  first minister  and it s no chance at all they will let me come out of the office .  i have watched the present chief gardener .  he couldn t leave his office  though he wanted to  ever so .  there is too much administration  too much bookkeeping .  sure  if he wants to know what is going on  we must go to his office to tell him .  he watches things on holovision   he said with infinite contempt  as though you can tell anything about growing  living things from pictures .  it is not for me  first minister .     come  gruber  be a man .  it s not all that bad .  you ll get used to it .  you ll work your way in slowly .    gruber shook his head .   first off at the very first i will have to deal with all the new gardeners .  i ll be buried .   then  with sudden energy   it is a job i do not want and must not have  first minister .     right now  gruber  perhaps you don t want the job  but you are not alone .  i ll tell you that right now i wish i were not first minister .  this job is too much for me .  i even have a notion that there are times when the emperor himself is tired of his imperial robes .  we re all in this galaxy to do our work and the work isn t always pleasant .     i understand that  first minister  but the emperor must be emperor  for he was born to that .  and you must be first minister  for there is no one else who can do the job .  but in my case  it is just chief gardener we are ruminating upon .  there are fifty gardeners in the place who could do it as well as i could and who wouldn t mind the office .  you say that you spoke to the emperor about how i tried to help you .  can t you speak to him again and explain that if he wants to reward me for what i did  he can leave me as i am .    seldon leaned back in his chair and said solemnly   gruber  i would do that for you if i could  but i must explain something to you and i can only hope that you will understand it .  the emperor  in theory  is absolute ruler of the empire .  in actual fact  there is very little he can do .  i run the empire right now much more than he does and there is very little i can do  too .  there are millions and billions of people at all levels of government  all making decisions  all making mistakes  some acting wisely and heroically  some acting foolishly and thievishly .  there s no controlling them .  do you understand me  gruber .     i do  but what has this to do with my case .     because there is only one place where the emperor is really absolute ruler and that is over the imperial grounds .  here  his word is law and the layers of officials beneath him are few enough for him to handle .  for him to be asked to rescind a decision he has made in connection with the imperial palace grounds would be to invade the only area that he would consider inviolate .  if i were to say   take back your decision on gruber  your imperial majesty   he would be much more likely to relieve me of my duties than to take back his decision .  that might be a good thing for me  but it wouldn t help you any .    gruber said   does that mean there s no way things can be changed .     that s exactly what it means .  but don t worry  gruber  i ll help you all i can .  i m sorry .  but now i have really spent all the time with you that i am able to spare .    gruber rose to his feet .  in his hands he twisted his green gardening cap .  there was more than a suspicion of tears in his eyes .   thank you  first minister .  i know you would like to help .  you re you re a good man  first minister .    he turned and left  sorrowing .   seldon looked after him thoughtfully and shook his head .  multiply gruber s woes by a quadrillion and you would have the woes of all the people of the twenty five million worlds of the empire and how was he  seldon  to work out salvation for all of them  when he was helpless to solve the problem of one single man who had come to him for help .   psychohistory could not save one man .  could it save a quadrillion .   he shook his head again  checked the nature and time of his next appointment  and then suddenly stiffened .  he shouted into his communications wire in sudden wild abandon  quite unlike his usually strict control .   get that gardener back .  get him back here right now .         what s this about new gardeners .   exclaimed seldon .  this time he did not ask gruber to sit down .   gruber s eyes blinked rapidly .  he was in a panic at having been recalled so unexpectedly .   n new g gardeners .   he stammered .    you said  all the new gardeners .   those were your words .  what new gardeners .    gruber was astonished .   sure  if there is a new chief gardener  there will be new gardeners .  it is the custom .     i have never heard of this .     the last time we had a change of chief gardeners  you were not first minister .  it is likely you were not even on trantor .     but what s it all about .     well  gardeners are never discharged .  some die .  some grow too old and are pensioned off and replaced .  still  by the time a new chief gardener is ready for his duties  at least half the staff is aged and beyond their best years .  they are all pensioned off generously and new gardeners are brought in .     for youth .     partly and partly because by that time there are usually new plans for the gardens and it is new ideas and new schemes we must have .  there are almost five hundred square kilometers in the gardens and parklands and it usually takes some years to reorganize it and it is myself who will have to supervise it all .  please  first minister .   gruber was gasping .   surely a clever man like your own self can find a way to change the blessed emperor s mind .    seldon paid no attention .  his forehead was creased in concentration .   where do the new gardeners come from .     there are examinations on all the worlds there are always people waiting to serve as replacements .  they ll be coming in by the hundreds in a dozen batches .  it will take me a year  at the least     from where do they come .  from where .     from any of a million worlds .  we want a variety of horticultural knowledge .  any citizen of the empire can qualify .     from trantor  too .     no  not from trantor .  there is no one from trantor in the gardens .   his voice grew contemptuous .   you can t get a gardener out of trantor .  the parks they have here under the dome aren t gardens .  they are potted plants and the animals are in cages .  trantorians  poor specimens that they are  know nothing about open air  free water  and the true balance of nature .     all right  gruber .  i will now give you a job .  it will be up to you to get me the names of every new gardener scheduled to arrive over the coming weeks .  everything about them .  name .  world .  reference number .  education .  experience .  everything .  i want it all here on my desk just as quickly as possible .  i m going to send people to help you .  people with machines .  what kind of a computer do you use .     only a simple one for keeping track of plantings and species and things like that .     all right .  the people i send will be able to do anything you can t do .  i can t tell you how important this is .     if i should do this     gruber  this is not the time to make bargains .  fail me and you will not be chief gardener .  instead  you will be discharged without a pension .    alone again  seldon barked into his communication wire   cancel all appointments for the rest of the afternoon .    he then let his body flop in his chair  feeling every bit of his fifty years and feeling his headache worsen .  for years  for decades  security had been built up around the imperial palace grounds  thicker  more solid  more impenetrable  as each new layer and each new device was added .    and every once in a while  hordes of strangers were let into the grounds .  no questions asked  probably  but one   can you garden .    the stupidity involved was too colossal to grasp .   and he had barely caught it in time .  or had he .  was he  even now  too late .       gleb andorin gazed at namarti through half closed eyes .  he never liked the man  but there were times when he liked him less than he usually did and this was one of those times .  why should andorin  a wyan of royal birth  that s what it amounted to  after all  have to work with this parvenu  this near psychotic paranoid .   andorin knew why and he had to endure  even when namarti was once again in the process of telling the story of how he had built up the movement during a period of ten years to its present pitch of perfection .  did he tell this to everyone  over and over .  or was it just andorin who was his chosen vessel .   namarti s face seemed to shine with malignant glee as he said  in an odd singsong  as though it were a matter of rote   year after year .  i worked on those lines  even through hopelessness and uselessness  building an organization  chipping away at confidence in the government  creating and intensifying dissatisfaction .  when there was the banking crisis and the week of the moratorium  i    he paused suddenly .   i ve told you this many times and you re sick of hearing it  aren t you .    andorin s lips twitched in a brief dry smile .  namarti was not such an idiot as not to know what a bore he was  he just couldn t help it .  andorin said   you ve told me this many times .   he allowed the remainder of the question to hang in the air  unanswered .  the answer  after all  was an obvious affirmative .  there was no need to face him with it .   a slight flush crossed namarti s sallow face .  he said   but it could have gone on forever the building  the chipping  without ever coming to a point if i hadn t had the proper tool in my hands .  and without any effort on my part  the tool came to me .     the gods brought you planchet   said andorin neutrally .    you re right .  there will be a group of gardeners entering the imperial palace grounds soon .   he paused and seemed to savor the thought .    men and women .  enough to serve as a mask for the handful of our operatives who will accompany them .  among them will be you and planchet .  and what will make you and planchet unusual is that you will be carrying blasters .     surely   said andorin with deliberate malice behind a polite expression   we ll be stopped at the gates and held for questioning .  bringing an illicit blaster onto the palace grounds     you won t be stopped   said namarti  missing the malice .   you won t be searched .  that s been arranged .  you will all be greeted as a matter of course by some palace official .  i don t know who would ordinarily be in charge of that task the third assistant chamberlain in charge of grass and leaves  for all i know but in this case  it will be seldon himself .  the great mathematician will hurry out to greet the new gardeners and welcome them to the grounds .     you re sure of that  i suppose .     of course  i am .  it s all been arranged .  he will learn  at more or less the last minute  that his foster son is among those listed as new gardeners and it will be impossible for him to refrain from coming out to see him .  and when seldon appears  planchet will raise his blaster .  our people will raise the cry of  treason .   in the confusion and hurly burly  planchet will kill seldon and then you will kill planchet .  you will then drop your blaster and leave .  there are those who will help you leave .  it s been arranged .     is it absolutely necessary to kill planchet .    namarti frowned .   why .  do you object to one killing and not to another .  when planchet recovers  do you wish him to tell the authorities all he knows about us .  besides  this is a family feud we are arranging .  don t forget that planchet is  in actual fact  raych seldon .  it will look as though the two had fired simultaneously or as though seldon had given orders that if his son made any hostile move  he was to be shot down .  we will see to it that the family angle will be given full publicity .  it will be reminiscent of the bad old days of the bloody emperor manowell .  the people of trantor will surely be repelled by the sheer wickedness of the deed .  that  piled on top of all the inefficiencies and breakdowns they ve been witnessing and living through  will raise the cry for a new government and no one will be able to refuse them  least of all the emperor .  and then we ll step in .     just like that .     no  not just like that .  i don t live in a dream world .  there is likely to be some interim government  but it will fail .  we ll see to it that it fails and we ll come out in the open and revive the old joranumite arguments that the trantorians have never forgotten .  and in time in not too much time i will be first minister .     and i .     will eventually be the emperor .    andorin said   the chance of all this working is small .   this is arranged .  that is arranged .  the other thing is arranged .  all of it has to come together and mesh perfectly or it will fail .  somewhere  someone is bound to mess up .  it s an unacceptable risk .     unacceptable .  for whom .  for you .     certainly .  you expect me to make certain that planchet will kill his father and you expect me to then kill planchet .  why me .  aren t there tools worth less than i who might more easily be risked .     yes  but to choose anyone else would make failure certain .  who but you has so much riding on this mission that there is no chance you will turn back in a fit of vapors at the last minute .     the risk is enormous .     isn t it worth it to you .  you re playing for the imperial throne .     and what risk are you taking  chief .  you will remain here  quite comfortable  and wait to hear the news .    namarti s lip curled .   what a fool you are  andorin .  what an emperor you will make .  do you suppose i take no risk because i will be here .  if the gambit fails  if the plot miscarries  if some of our people are taken  do you think they won t tell everything they know .  if you were somehow caught  would you face the tender treatment of the imperial guard without ever telling them about me .    and with a failed assassination attempt at hand  do you suppose they won t comb trantor to find me .  do you suppose that in the end they will fail to find me .  and when they do find me  what do you suppose i will have to face at their hands .   risk .  i run a worse risk than any of you  just sitting here doing nothing .  it boils down to this  andorin .  do you or do you not wish to be emperor .    andorin said in a low voice   i wish to be emperor .   and so things were set in motion .       raych had no trouble seeing that he was being treated with special care .  the whole group of would be gardeners was now quartered in one of the hotels in the imperial sector  although not one of the prime hotels  of course .   the gardeners were an odd lot  from fifty different worlds  but raych had little chance to speak to any of them .  andorin  without being too obvious about it  had managed to keep him apart from the others .   raych wondered why .  it depressed him .  in fact  he had been feeling somewhat depressed since he had left wye .  it interfered with his thinking process and he fought it but not with entire success .   andorin was himself wearing rough clothes and was attempting to look like a workman .  he would be playing the part of a gardener as a way of running the  show  whatever the  show  might be .   raych felt ashamed that he had not been able to penetrate the nature of that  show .   they had closed in on him and prevented all communication  so he hadn t even had the chance to warn his father .  they might be doing this for every trantorian who had been pushed into the group  for all he knew  just as an extreme precaution .  raych estimated that there might be a dozen trantorians among them  all of them namarti s people  of course  men and women both .   what puzzled him was that andorin treated him with what was almost affection .  he monopolized him  insisted on having all his meals with him  treated him quite differently from the way in which he treated anyone else .   could it be because they had shared manella .  raych did not know enough about the mores of the wye sector to be able to tell whether there might not be a polyandrous touch to their society .  if two men shared a woman  did that make them  in a way  fraternal .  did it create a bond .   raych had never heard of such a thing  but he knew better than to suppose he had a grasp of even a tiny fraction of the infinite subtleties of galactic societies even of trantorian societies .   but now that his mind had brought him back to manella  he dwelled on her for a while .  he missed her terribly and it occurred to him that missing her might be the cause of his depression  though  to tell the truth  what he was feeling now  as he was finishing lunch with andorin  was almost despair though he could think of no cause for it .   manella .   she had said she wanted to visit the imperial sector and presumably she could wheedle andorin to her liking .  he was desperate enough to ask a foolish question .   mr .  andorin  i keep wondering if maybe you brought miss dubanqua along with you .  here  to the imperial sector .    andorin looked utterly astonished .  then he laughed gently .   manella .  do you see her doing any gardening .  or even pretending she could .  no no  manella is one of those women invented for our quiet moments .  she has no function at all  otherwise .   then  why do you ask  planchet .    raych shrugged .   i don t know .  it s sort of dull around here .  i sort of thought   his voice trailed away .   andorin watched him carefully .  finally he said   surely you re not of the opinion that it matters much which woman you are involved with .  i assure you it doesn t matter to her which man she s involved with .  once this is over  there will be other women .  plenty of them .     when will this be over .     soon .  and you re going to be part of it in a very important way .   andorin watched raych narrowly .   raych said   how important .  aren t i gonna be just a gardener .   his voice sounded hollow and he found himself unable to put a spark in it .    you ll be more than that  planchet .  you ll be going in with a blaster .     with a what .     a blaster .     i never held a blaster .  not in my whole life .     there s nothing to it .  you lift it .  you point it .  you close the contact and someone dies .     i can t kill anyone .     i thought you were one of us  that you would do anything for the cause .     i didn t mean kill .   raych couldn t seem to collect his thoughts .  why must he kill .  what did they really have in mind for him .  and how would he be able to alert the imperial guard before the killing would be carried out .   andorin s face hardened suddenly  an instant conversion from friendly interest to stern decision .  he said   you must kill .    raych gathered all his strength .   no .  i ain t gonna kill nobody .  that s final .    andorin said   planchet  you will do as you are told .     not murder .     even murder .     how you gonna make me .     i shall simply tell you to .    raych felt dizzy .  what made andorin so confident .   he shook his head .   no .    andorin said   we ve been feeding you  planchet  ever since you left wye .  i made sure you ate with me .  i supervised your diet .  especially the meal you just ate .    raych felt the horror rise within him .  he suddenly understood .   desperance .     exactly   said andorin .   you re a sharp devil  planchet .     it s illegal .     yes  of course .  so s murder .    raych knew about desperance .  it was a chemical modification of a perfectly harmless tranquilizer .  the modified form  however  did not produce tranquillity but despair .  it had been outlawed because of its use in mind control  though there were persistent rumors that the imperial guard used it .   andorin said  as though it were not hard to read raych s mind   it s called desperance because that s an old word meaning  hopelessness .   i think you re feeling hopeless .     never   whispered raych .    very resolute of you  but you can t fight the chemical .  and the more hopeless you feel  the more effective the drug .     no chance .     think about it  planchet .  namarti recognized you at once  even without your mustache .  he knows you are raych seldon and  at my direction  you are going to kill your father .    raych muttered   not before i kill you .    he rose from his chair .  there should be no problem at all in this .  andorin might be taller  but he was slender and clearly no athlete .  raych would break him in two with one arm but he swayed as he rose .  he shook his head  but it wouldn t clear .   andorin rose  too  and backed away .  he drew his right hand from where it had been resting within his left sleeve .  he was holding a weapon .   he said pleasantly   i came prepared .  i have been informed of your prowess as a heliconian twister and there will be no hand to hand combat .    he looked down at his weapon .   this is not a blaster   he said .   i can t afford to have you killed before you accomplish your task .  it s a neuronic whip .  much worse  in a way .  i will aim at your left shoulder and  believe me  the pain will be so excruciating that the world s greatest stoic would not be able to endure it .    raych  who had been advancing slowly and grimly  stopped abruptly .  he had been twelve years old when he had had a taste a small one of a neuronic whip .  once struck  no one ever forgets the pain  however long he lives  however full of incidents his life is .   andorin said   moreover  i will use full strength so that the nerves in your upper arms will be stimulated first into unbearable pain and then damaged into uselessness .  you will never use your left arm again .  i will spare the right so you can handle the blaster .   now if you sit down and accept matters  as you must  you may keep both arms .  of course  you must eat again so your desperance level increases .  your situation will only worsen .    raych felt the drug induced despair settle over him and that despair served  in itself  to deepen the effect .  his vision was turning double and he could think of nothing to say .   raych only knew that he would have to do what andorin would tell him to do .  he had played the game and he had lost .        no .   hari seldon was almost violent .   i don t want you out there  dors .    dors venabili stared back at him with an expression as firm as his own .   then i won t let you go  either  hari .     i must be there .     it is not your place .  it is the gardener first class who must greet these new people .     so it is .  but gruber can t do it .  he s a broken man .     he must have an assistant of some sort .  or let the old chief gardener do it .  he holds the office till the end of the year .     the old chief gardener is too ill .  besides  seldon hesitated    there are ringers among the gardeners .  trantorians .  they re here  for some reason .  i have the names of every one of them .     have them taken into custody  then .  every last one of them .  it s simple .  why are you making it so complex .     because we don t know why they re here .  something s up .  i don t see what twelve gardeners can do  but  no  let me rephrase that .  i can see a dozen things they can do  but i don t know which one of those things they ve planned .  we will  indeed  take them into custody  but i must know more about everything before it s done .    we have to know enough to winkle out everyone in the conspiracy from top to bottom and we must know enough of what they re doing to be able to make the proper punishment stick .  i don t want to get twelve men and women on what is essentially a misdemeanor charge .  they ll plead desperation  the need for a job .  they ll complain that it isn t fair for trantorians to be excluded .  they ll get plenty of sympathy and we ll be left looking like fools .  we must give them a chance to convict themselves of more than that .  besides    there was a long pause and dors said wrathfully   well  what s the new  besides  .    seldon s voice lowered .   one of the twelve is raych  using the alias planchet .     what .     why are you surprised .  i sent him to wye to infiltrate the joranumite movement and he s succeeded in infiltrating something .  i have every faith in him .  if he s there  he knows why he s there and he must have some sort of plan to put a spoke in the wheel .  but i want to be there  too .  i want to see him .  i want to be in a position to help him if i can .     if you want to help him  have fifty guards of the palace standing shoulder to shoulder on either side of your gardeners .     no .  again  we ll end up with nothing .  the imperial guard will be in place but not in evidence .  the gardeners in question must think they have a clear hand to do whatever it is they plan to do .  before they can do so  but after they have made it quite plain what they intend we ll have them .     that s risky .  it s risky for raych .     risks are something we have to take .  there s more riding on this than individual lives .     that is a heartless thing to say .     you think i have no heart .  even if it broke  my concern would have to be with psycho     don t say it .   she turned away  as if in pain .    i understand   said seldon   but you mustn t be there .  your presence would be so inappropriate that the conspirators will suspect we know too much and will abort their plan .  i don t want their plan aborted .    he paused  then said softly   dors  you say your job is to protect me .  that comes before protecting raych and you know that .  i wouldn t insist on it  but to protect me is to protect psychohistory and the entire human species .  that must come first .  what i have of psychohistory tells me that    in turn  must protect the center at all costs and that is what i am trying to do .   do you understand .    dors said   i understand   then turned away from him .   seldon thought  and i hope i m right .   if he weren t  she would never forgive him .  far worse  he would never forgive himself psychohistory or not .       they were lined up beautifully  feet spread apart  hands behind their hacks  every one in a natty green uniform  loosely fitted and with wide pockets .  there was very little gender differential and one could only guess that some of the shorter ones were women .  the hoods covered whatever hair they had  but then  gardeners were supposed to clip their hair quite short either sex and there could be no facial hair .   why that should be  one couldn t say .  the word  tradition  covered it all  as it covered so many things  some useful  some foolish .   facing them was mandell gruber  flanked on either side by an assistant .  gruber was trembling  his wide opened eyes glazed .   hari seldon s lips tightened .  if gruber could but manage to say   the emperor s gardeners greet you all   that would be enough .  seldon himself would then take over .   his eyes swept over the new contingent and he located raych .   his heart jumped a bit .  it was the mustacheless raych in the front row  standing more rigid than the rest  staring straight ahead .  his eyes did not move to meet seldon s  he showed no sign of recognition  however subtle .   good  thought seldon .  he s not supposed to .  he s giving nothing away .   gruber muttered a weak welcome and seldon jumped in .   he advanced with an easy stride  putting himself immediately before gruber  and said   thank you  gardener first class .  men and women  gardeners of the emperor  you are to undertake an important task .  you will be responsible for the beauty and health of the only open land on our great world of trantor  capital of the galactic empire .  you will see to it that if we don t have the endless vistas of open undomed worlds  we will have a small jewel here that will outshine anything else in the empire .    you will all be under mandell gruber  who will shortly become chief gardener .  he will report to me  when necessary  and i will report to the emperor .  this means  as you can all see  that you will be only three levels removed from the imperial presence and you will always be under his benign watch .  i am certain that even now he is surveying us from the small palace  his personal home  which is the building you see to the right the one with the opal layered dome and that he is pleased with what he sees .    before you start work  of course  you will all undertake a course of training that will make you entirely familiar with the grounds and its needs .  you will       he had  by this time  moved  almost stealthily  to a point directly in front of raych  who still remained motionless  unblinking .   seldon tried not to look unnaturally benign and then a slight frown crossed his face .  the person directly behind raych looked familiar .  he might have gone unrecognized if seldon had not studied his hologram .  wasn t that gleb andorin of wye .  raych s patron in wye  in fact .  what was he doing here .   andorin must have noticed seldon s sudden regard  for he muttered something between scarcely opened lips and raych s right arm  moving forward from behind his back  plucked a blaster out of the wide pocket of his green doublet .  so did andorin .   seldon felt himself going into near shock .  how could blasters have been allowed onto the grounds .  confused  he barely heard the cries of   treason .   and the sudden noise of running and shouting .   all that really occupied seldon s mind was raych s blaster pointing directly at him and raych looking at him without any sign of recognition .  seldon   s mind filled with horror as he realized that his son was going to shoot and that he himself was only seconds from death .       a blaster  despite its name  does not  blast  in the proper sense of the term .  it vaporizes and blows out an interior and if anything causes an implosion .  there is a soft sighing sound  leaving what appears to be a  blasted  object .   hari seldon did not expect to hear that sound .  he expected only death .  it was  therefore  with surprise that he heard the distinctive soft sighing sound and he blinked rapidly as he looked down at himself  slackjawed .   he was alive .   he thought it as a question  not a statement .    raych was still standing there  his blaster pointing forward  his eyes glazed .  he was absolutely motionless  as though some motive power had ceased .   behind him was the crumpled body of andorin  fallen in a pool of blood  and standing next to him  blaster in hand  was a gardener .  the hood had slipped away  the gardener was clearly a woman with freshly clipped hair .   she allowed herself a glance at seldon and said   your son knows me as manella dubanqua .  i m a security officer .  do you want my reference number  first minister .     no   said seldon faintly .  imperial guard had converged on the scene .   my son .  what s wrong with my son .     desperance  i think   said manella .   that can be washed out eventually .   she reached forward to take the blaster out of raych s hand .   i m sorry i didn t act sooner .  i had to wait for an overt move and  when it came  it almost caught me napping .     i had the same trouble .  we must take raych to the palace hospital .    a confused noise suddenly emanated from the small palace .  it occurred to seldon that the emperor was  indeed  watching the proceedings and  if so  he must be grandly furious  indeed .    take care of my son  miss dubanqua   said seldon .   i must see the emperor .    he set off at an undignified run through the chaos on the great lawns and dashed into the small palace without ceremony .  cleon could scarcely grow any angrier over that .   and there  with an appalled group watching in stupor there  on the semicircular stairway was the body of his imperial majesty  cleon i  smashed all but beyond recognition .  his rich imperial robes now served as a shroud .  cowering against the wall  staring stupidly at the horrified faces surrounding him  was mandell gruber .   seldon felt he could take no more .  he took in the blaster lying at gruber s feet .  it had been andorin s  he was sure .  he asked softly   gruber  what have you done .    gruber  staring at him  babbled   everyone screaming and yelling .  i thought  who would know .  they would think someone else had killed the emperor .  but then i couldn t run .     but  gruber .  why .     so i wouldn t have to be chief gardener .   and he collapsed .   seldon stared in shock at the unconscious gruber .   everything had worked out by the narrowest of margins .  he himself was alive .  raych was alive .  andorin was dead and the joranumite conspiracy would now be hunted down to the last person .   the center would have held  just as psychohistory had dictated .   and then one man  for a reason so trivial as to defy analysis  had killed the emperor .   and now  thought seldon in despair  what do we do .  what happens next .       part iii    dors venabili      venabili  dors  the life of hari seldon is well encrusted with legend and uncertainty  so that little hope remains of ever obtaining a biography that can be thoroughly factual .  perhaps the most puzzling aspect of his life deals with his consort  dors venabili .  there is no information whatever concerning dors venabili  except for her birth on the world of cinna  prior to her arrival at streeling university to become a member of the history faculty .  shortly after that  she met seldon and remained his consort for twenty eight years .  if anything  her life is more interlarded with legend than seldon s is .  there are quite unbelievable tales of her strength and speed and she was widely spoken of  or perhaps whispered of  as  the tiger woman .   still more puzzling than her coming  however  is her going  for after a certain time  we hear of her no more and there is no indication as to what happened .   her role as a historian is evidenced by her works on   encyclopedia galactica       wanda was almost eight years old now  going by galactic standard time  as everyone did .  she was quite the little lady grave in manner  with straight light brown hair .  her eyes were blue but were darkening and she might well end with the brown eyes of her father .   she sat there  lost in thought .   sixty .   that was the number that preoccupied her .  grandfather was going to have a birthday and it was going to be his sixtieth and sixty was a large number .  it bothered her because yesterday she had had a bad dream about it .   she went in search of her mother .  she would have to ask .   her mother was not hard to find .  she was talking to grandfather about the birthday surely .  wanda hesitated .  it wouldn t be nice to ask in front of grandfather .   her mother had no trouble whatever sensing wanda s consternation .  she said   one minute  hari  and let s see what s bothering wanda .  what is it  dear .    wanda pulled at her hand .   not here  mother .  private .    manella turned to hari seldon .   see how early it starts .  private lives .  private problems .  of course  wanda  shall we go to your room .     yes  mother .   wanda was clearly relieved .   hand in hand  they went and then her mother said   now what is the problem  wanda .     it s grandfather  mother .     grandfather .  i can t imagine him doing anything to bother you .     well  he is .   wanda s eyes filled with sudden tears .   is he going to die .     your grandfather .  what put that into your head  wanda .     he s going to be sixty .  that s so old .     no  it isn t .  it s not young  but it s not old  either .  people live to be eighty  ninety  even a hundred and your grandfather is strong and healthy .  he ll live a long time .     are you sure .   she was sniffing .   manella grasped her daughter by the shoulders and looked her straight in the eyes .   we must all die someday  wanda .  i ve explained that to you before .  just the same  we don t worry about it till the someday is much closer .   she wiped wanda s eyes gently .   grandfather is going to stay alive till you re all grown up and have babies of your own .  you ll see .  now come back with me .  i want you to talk to grandfather .    wanda sniffed again .   seldon looked at the little girl with a sympathetic expression on her return and said   what is it  wanda .  why are you unhappy .    wanda shook her head .   seldon turned his gaze to the girl s mother .   well  what is it  manella .    manella shook her head .   she ll have to tell you herself .    seldon sat down and tapped his lap .   come  wanda .  have a seat and tell me your troubles .    she obeyed and wriggled a bit  then said   i m scared .    seldon put his arm around her .   nothing to be scared of in your old grandfather .    manella made a face .   wrong word .    seldon looked up at her .   grandfather .     no .  old .    that seemed to break the dike .  wanda burst into tears .   you re old  grandfather .     i suppose so .  i m sixty .   he bent his face down to wanda s and whispered   i don t like it  either  wanda .  that s why i m glad you re only seven going on eight .     your hair is white  grandpa .     it wasn t always .  it just turned white recently .     white hair means you re going to die  grandpa .    seldon looked shocked .  he said to manella   what is all this .     i don t know  hari .  it s her own idea .     i had a bad dream   said wanda .   seldon cleared his throat .   we all have bad dreams now and then  wanda .  it s good we do .  bad dreams get rid of bad thoughts and then we re better off .     it was about you dying  grandfather .     i know .  i know .  dreams can be about dying  but that doesn t make them important .  look at me .  don t you see how alive i am and cheerful and laughing .  do i look as though i m dying .  tell me .     n no .     there you are  then .  now you go out and play and forget all about this .  i m just having a birthday and everyone will have a good time .  go ahead  dear .    wanda left in reasonable cheer  but seldon motioned to manella to stay .      seldon said   wherever do you think wanda got such a notion .     come now  hari .  she had a salvanian gecko that died  remember .  one of her friends had a father who died in an accident and she sees deaths on holovision all the time .  it is impossible for any child to be so protected as not to be aware of death .  actually i wouldn t want her to be so protected .  death is an essential part of life  she must learn that .     i don t mean death in general  manella .  i mean my death in particular .  what has put that into her head .    manella hesitated .  she was very fond  indeed  of hari seldon .  she thought  who would not be  so how can i say this .   but how could she not say this .  so she said   hari  you yourself put it into her head .     i .     of course  you ve been speaking for months of turning sixty and complaining loudly of growing old .  the only reason people are setting up this party is to console you .     it s no fun turning sixty   said seldon indignantly .   wait .  wait .  you ll find out .     i will if i m lucky .  some people don t make it to sixty .  just the same  if turning sixty and being old are all you talk about  you end up frightening an impressionable little girl .    seldon sighed and looked troubled .   i m sorry  but it s hard .  look at my hands .  they re getting spotted and soon they ll be gnarled .  i can do hardly anything in the way of twisting any longer .  a child could probably force me to my knees .     in what way does that make you different from other sixty year olds .  at least your brain is working as well as ever .  how often have you said that that s all that counts .     i know .  but i miss my body .    manella said with just a touch of malice   especially when dors doesn t seem to get any older .    seldon said uneasily   well yes  i suppose   he looked away  clearly unwilling to talk about the matter .   manella looked at her father in law gravely .  the trouble was  he knew nothing about children or about people generally .  it was hard to think that he had spent ten years as first minister under the old emperor and yet ended up knowing as little about people as he did .   of course  he was entirely wrapped up in this psychohistory of his  that dealt with quadrillions of people  which ultimately meant dealing with no people at all as individuals .  and how could he know about children when he had had no contact with any child except raych  who had entered his life as a twelve year old .  now he had wanda  who was and would probably remain to him an utter mystery .   manella thought all this lovingly .  she had the incredible desire to protect hari seldon from a world he did not understand .  it was the only point at which she and her mother in law  dors venabili  met and coalesced this desire to protect hari seldon .   manella had saved seldon s life ten years before .  dors  in her strange way  had considered this an invasion of her prerogative and had never quite forgiven manella .   seldon  in his turn  had then saved manella s life .  she closed her eyes briefly and the whole scene returned to her  almost as though it were happening to her right now .      it was a week after the assassination of cleon and a horrible week it shad been .  all of trantor was in chaos .   hari seldon still kept his office as first minister  but it was clear he had no power .  he called in manella dubanqua .    i want to thank you for saving raych s life and my own .  i haven t  i a chance to do so yet .   then with a sigh   i have scarcely had a chance to do anything this past week .    manella asked   what happened to the mad gardener .     executed .  at once .  no trial .  i tried to save him by pointing out that was insane .  but there was no question about it .  if he had done anything else  committed any other crime  his madness would have been recognized and he would have been spared .  committed locked up and treated but spared  nonetheless .  but to kill the emperor   seldon shook his head sadly .   manella said   what s going to happen now  first minister .     i ll tell you what i think .  the entun dynasty is finished .  cleon s son will not succeed .  i don t think he wants to .  he fears assassination in his turn and i don t blame him one bit .  it would be much better for him to retire to one of the family estates on some outer world and live a quiet because he is a member of the imperial house  he will untie allowed to do this .  you and i may be less fortunate .    manella frowned .   in what way  sir .    seldon cleared his throat .   it is possible to argue that because you killed gleb andorin  he dropped his blaster  which became available to mandell gruber  who used it to kill cleon .  therefore you bear a strong share of the responsibility of the crime and it may even be said that it was all prearranged .         but that   s ridiculous .  i am a member of the security establishment  fulfilling my duties doing what i was ordered to do .    seldon smiled sadly .   you re arguing rationally and rationality is not going to be in fashion for a while .  what s going to happen now  in the absence of a legitimate successor to the imperial throne  is that we are bound to have a military government .     in later years  when manella came to understand the workings of psychohistory  she wondered if seldon had used the technique to work out what was going to happen  for the military rule certainly came to pass .  at the time  however  he made no mention of his fledgling theory .     if we do have a military government   he went on   then it will be necessary for them to establish a firm rule at once  crush any signs of disaffection  act vigorously and cruelly  even in defiance of rationality and justice .  if they accuse you  miss dubanqua  of being part of a plot to kill the emperor  you will be slaughtered  not as an act of justice but as a way of cowing the people of trantor .    for that matter  they might say that i was part of the plot  too .  after all  i went out to greet the new gardeners when it was not my place to do so .  had i not done so  there would have been no attempt to kill me  you would not have struck back  and the emperor would have lived .   do you see how it all fits .     i can t believe they will do this .     perhaps they won t .  i ll make them an offer that  just perhaps  they may not wish to refuse .     what would that be .     i will offer to resign as first minister .  they don t want me  they won t have me .  but the fact is that i do have supporters at the imperial court and  even more important  people in the outer worlds who find me acceptable .  that means that if the members of the imperial guard force me out  then even if they don t execute me  they will have some trouble .  if  on the other hand  i resign  stating that i believe the military government is what trantor and the empire needs  then i actually help them  you see .    he mused a little and said   besides  there is the little matter of psychohistory .     that was the first time manella had ever heard the word .     what s that .     something i m working on .  cleon believed in its powers very strongly more strongly than i did at the time and there s a considerable feeling in the court that psychohistory is  or might be  a powerful tool that could be made to work on the side of the government whatever the government might be .    nor does it matter if they know nothing about the details of the science .  i d rather they didn t .  lack of knowledge can increase what we might call the superstitious aspect of the situation .  in which case  they will let me continue working on my research as a private citizen .  at least  i hope so .   and that brings me to you .    what about me .     i m going to ask as part of the deal that you be allowed to resign h the security establishment and that no action be taken against you   the events in connection with the assassination .  i ought to be able to   but you re talking about ending my career .     your career is  in any case  over .  even if the imperial guard doesn t up an order of execution against you  can you imagine that you will be allowed to continue working as a security officer .     but what do i do .  how do i make a living .     i ll take care of that  miss dubanqua .  in all likelihood  i ll go back to streeling university  with a large grant for my psychohistorical research  i m sure that i can find a place for you .    manella  round eyed  said   why should you    seldon said   i can t believe you re asking .  you saved raych s life and own .  is it conceivable that i don t owe you anything .    and it was as he said .  seldon resigned gracefully from the post he had held for ten years .  he was given a fulsome letter of appreciation for his services by the just formed military government  a junta led by certain members of the imperial guard and the armed forces .  he returned to streeling university and manella dubanqua  relieved of her own post as security officer  went with seldon and his family .      raych came in  blowing on his hands .   i m all for deliberate variety in the weather .  you don t want things under a dome to always be the same .  today though  they made it just a little too cold and worked up a wind  besides .  i think it s about time someone complained to weather control .       i don t know that it s weather control s fault   said seldon .   it s getting harder to control things in general .     i know .  deterioration .   raych brushed his thick black mustache with the back of his hand .  he did that often  as though he had never quite managed to get over the few months during which he had been mustacheless in wye .  he had also put on a little weight around the middle and  overall  had come to seem very comfortable and middleclass .  even his dahl accent had faded somewhat .   he took off his light coverall and said   and how s the old birthday boy .     resenting it .  wait  wait  my son .  one of these days  you ll be celebrating your fortieth birthday .  we ll see how funny you ll think that is .     not as funny as sixty .     stop joking   said manella  who had been chafing raych s hands  trying to warm them .   seldon spread his own hands .   we re doing the wrong thing  raych .  your wife is of the opinion that all this talk about my turning sixty has sent little wanda into a decline over the possibility of my dying .     really .   said raych .   that accounts for it  then .  i stopped in to see her and she told me at once  before i even had a chance to say a word  that she had had a bad dream .  was it about your dying .     apparently   said seldon .    well  she ll get over that .  no way of stopping bad dreams .     i m not dismissing it that easily   said manella .   she s brooding over it and that s not healthy .  i m going to get to the bottom of this .     as you say  manella   said raych agreeably .   you re my dear wife and whatever you say about wanda goes .   and he brushed his mustache again .   his dear wife .  it hadn t been so easy to make her his dear wife .  raych remembered his mother s attitude toward the possibility .  talk about nightmares .  it was he who had the periodic nightmares in which he had to face down the furious dors venabili once more .      raych s first clear memory  after emerging from his desperance induced ordeal  was that of being shaved .   he felt the vibrorazor moving along his cheek and he said weakly   don t cut anywhere near my upper lip  barber .  i want my mustache back .    the barber  who had already received his instructions from seldon held up a mirror to reassure him .   dors venabili  who was sitting at his bedside  said   let him work  raych .  don t excite yourself .    raych s eyes turned toward her momentarily and he was quiet .  when the barber left  dors said   how do you feel  raych .     rotten   he muttered .   i m so depressed  i can t stand it .     that s the lingering effect of the desperance you ve been dosed with .  the effects will wash out .     i can t believe it .  how long has it been .     never mind .  it will take time .  you were pumped full of it .    he looked around restlessly .   has manella been to see me .     that woman .    raych was getting used to hearing dors speak of manella with those words and in that tone of voice .    no .  you re not fit for visitors yet .    interpreting the look on raych s face  dors quickly added   i m an exception because i m your mother  raych .  why would you want that woman to see you  anyway .  you re in no condition to be seen .     all the more reason to see her   muttered raych .   i want her to see me at my worst .   he then turned to one side dispiritedly .   i want to sleep .    dors venabili shook her head .  later that day she said to seldon  i don t know what we re going to do about raych .  hari .  he s quite unreasonable .    seldon said   he s not well  dors .  give the young man a chance .     he keeps muttering about that woman .  whatever her name is .     manella dubanqua .  it s not a hard name to remember .     i think he wants to set up housekeeping with her .  live with her .  marry her .    seldon shrugged .   raych is thirty old enough to make up his own mind .     as his parents  we have something to say surely .    hari sighed .   and i m sure you ve said it  dors .  and once you ve said it  i m sure he ll do as he wishes .     is that your final word .  do you intend to do nothing while he makes plans to marry a woman like that .     what do you expect me to do  dors .  manella saved raych s life .  do you expect him to forget that .  she saved mine  too  for that matter .    that seemed to feed dors s anger .  she said   and you also saved her .  the score is even .     i didn t exactly     of course you did .  the military rascals who now run the empire would have slaughtered her if you didn t step in and sell them your resignation and your support in order to save her .     though i may have evened the score  which i don t think i have  raych has not .  and  dors dear  i would be very careful when it came to using unfortunate terms to describe our government .  these times are not going to be as easy as the times when cleon ruled and there will always be informers to repeat what they hear you say .     never mind that .  i don t like that woman .  i presume that  at least  is permissible .     permissible  certainly  but of no use .    hari looked down at the floor  deep in thought .  dors s usually unfathomable black eyes were positively flashing in anger .  hari looked up .    what i d like to know  dors  is why .  why do you dislike manella so .  she saved our lives .  if it had not been for her quick action  both raych and i would be dead .    dors snapped back   yes  hari .  i know that better than anyone .  and if she had not been there  i would not have been able to do a thing to prevent your murder .  i suppose you think i should be grateful .  but every time i look at that woman  i am reminded of my failure .  i know these feelings are not truly rational and that is something i can t explain .  so do not ask me to like her  hari .  i cannot .    but the next day even dors had to back down when the doctor said   your son wishes to see a woman named manella .     he s in no condition to see visitors   snapped dors .    on the contrary .  he is .  he s doing quite well .  besides  he insists and is doing so most strenuously .  i don t know that we d be wise to refuse him .    so they brought in manella and raych greeted her effusively and with the first faint sign of happiness since he had arrived at the hospital .   he made an unmistakable small gesture of dismissal at dors .  lips tightened  she left .   and the day came when raych said   she ll have me  mom .    dors said   do you expect me to be surprised  you foolish man .  of course she ll have you .  you re her only chance  now that she s been disgraced  ousted from the security establishment  .   .   .    raych said   mom  if you re trying to lose me  this is exactly the way of doing it .  don t say things like that .     i m only thinking of your welfare .     i ll think of my own good  thank you .  i m no one s ticket to respectability if you ll stop to think of it .  i m not exactly handsome .  i m short .  dad isn t first minister anymore and i talk solid lower class .  what s there for her to be proud of in me .  she can do a lot better  but she wants me .  and let me tell you  i want her .     but you know what she is .     of course i know what she is .  she s a woman who loves me .  she s the woman i love .  that s what she is .     and before you fell in love with her  what was she .  you know some of what she had to do while undercover in wye you were one of her  assignments .   how many others were there .  are you able to live with her past .  with what she did in the name of duty .  now you can afford to be idealistic .  but someday you will have your first quarrel with her or your second or your nineteenth and you ll break down and say   you  raych shouted angrily   don t say that .  when we fight  i ll call her unreasonable  irrational  nagging  whining  inconsiderate a million adjectives that will fit the situation .  and she ll have words for me .  but they ll all be sensible words that can be withdrawn when the fight is over .     you think so but just wait till it happens .    raych had turned white .  he said   mother  you ve been with father now for almost twenty years .  father is a hard man to disagree with  but there have been times when you two have argued .  i ve heard you .  in all those twenty years  has he ever called you by any name that would in any way compromise your role as human being .  for that matter  have i done so .  can you conceive of me doing so now no matter how angry i get .    dors struggled .  her face did not show emotion in quite the same way that raych s did or seldon s would  but it was clear that she was momentarily incapable of speech .    in fact   said raych  pushing his advantage  and feeling horrible at doing so   the fact of the matter is that you are jealous because manella saved dad s life .  you don t want anyone to do that but you .  well  you had no chance to do so .  would you prefer it if manella had not shot andorin if dad had died .  and me  too .    dors said in a choked voice   he insisted on going out to meet the gardeners alone .  he would not allow me to come .     but that wasn t manella s fault .     is that why you want to marry her .  gratitude .     no .  love .    and so it was  but manella said to raych after the ceremony   your mother may have attended the wedding because you insisted  raych  but she looked like one of those thunderclouds they sometimes send sailing under the dome .    raych laughed .   she doesn t have the face to be a thundercloud .  you re just imagining it .     not at all .  how will we ever get her to give us a chance .     we ll just be patient .  she ll get over it .    but dors venabili didn t .   two years after the wedding  wanda was born .  dors s attitude toward the child was all raych and manella could have wanted  but wanda s mother remained  that woman  to raych s mother .      hari seldon was fighting off melancholy .  he was lectured in turn by dors  by raych  by yugo  and by manella .  all united to tell him that sixty was not old .   they simply did not understand .  he had been thirty when the first hint of psychohistory had come to him  thirty two when he delivered his famous lecture at the decennial convention  following which everything seemed to happen to him at once .  after his brief interview with cleon  he had fled across trantor and met demerzel  dors  yugo  and raych  to say nothing of the people of mycogen  of dahl  and of wye .   he was forty when he became first minister and fifty when he had relinquished the post .  now he was sixty .   he had spent thirty years on psychohistory .  how many more years would he require .  how many more years would he live .  would he die with the psychohistory project unfinished after all .   it was not the dying that bothered him  he told himself .  it was the matter of leaving the psychohistory project unfinished .   he went to see yugo amaryl .  in recent years they had somehow drifted apart  as the psychohistory project had steadily increased in size .  in the first years at streeling  it had merely been seldon and amaryl working together no one else .  now   amaryl was nearly fifty not exactly a young man and he had somehow lost his spark .  in all these years  he had developed no interest in anything but psychohistory  no woman  no companion  no hobby  no subsidiary activity .   amaryl blinked at seldon who couldn t help but note the changes in the man s appearance .  part of it may have been because yugo had had to have his eyes reconstructed .  he saw perfectly well  but there was an unnatural look about them and he tended to blink slowly .  it made him appear sleepy .    what do you think  yugo .   said seldon .   is there any light at the end of the tunnel .     light .  yes  as a matter of fact   said amaryl .   there s this new fellow  tamwile elar .  you know him  of course .     oh yes .  i m the one who hired him .  very vigorous and aggressive .  how s he doing .     i can t say i m really comfortable with him  hari .  his loud laughter gets on my nerves .  but he s brilliant .  the new system of equations fits right into the prime radiant and they seem to make it possible to get around the problem of chaos .     seem .  or will .     too early to say  but i m very hopeful .  i have tried a number of things that would have broken them down if they were worthless and the new equations survived them all .  i m beginning to think of them as  the achaotic equations .       i don t imagine   said seldon  we have anything like a rigorous demonstration concerning these equations .     no  we don t  though i ve put half a dozen people on it  including elar  of course .   amaryl turned on his prime radiant which was every bit as advanced as seldon s was and he watched as the curving lines of luminous equations curled in midair too small  too fine to be read without amplification .   add the new equations and we may be able to begin to predict .     each time i study the prime radiant now   said seldon thoughtfully   i wonder at the electro clarifier and how tightly it squeezes material into the lines and curves of the future .  wasn t that elar s idea  too .     yes .  with the help of cinda monay  who designed it .     it s good to have new and brilliant men and women in the project .  somehow it reconciles me to the future .     you think someone like elar may be heading the project someday .   asked amaryl  still studying the prime radiant .    maybe .  after you and i have retired or died .    amaryl seemed to relax and turned off the device .   i would like to complete the task before we retire or die .     so would i  yugo .  so would i .     psychohistory has guided us pretty well in the last ten years .    that was true enough  but seldon knew that one couldn t attach too much triumph to that .  things had gone smoothly and without major surprises .   psychohistory had predicted that the center would hold after cleon s death predicted it in a very dim and uncertain way and it did hold .  trantor was reasonably quiet .  even with an assassination and the end of a dynasty  the center had held .   it did so under the stress of military rule dors was quite right in speaking of the junta as  those military rascals .   she might have even gone farther in her accusations without being wrong .  nevertheless  they were holding the empire together and would continue to do so for a time .  long enough  perhaps  to allow psychohistory to play an active role in the events that were to transpire .   lately yugo had been speaking about the possible establishment of foundations separate  isolated  independent of the empire itself serving as seeds for developments through the forthcoming dark ages and into a new and better empire .  seldon himself had been working on the consequences of such an arrangement .   but he lacked the time and  he felt  with a certain misery   he lacked the youth as well .  his mind  however firm and steady  did not have the resiliency and creativity that it had had when he was thirty and with each passing year  he knew he would have less .   perhaps he ought to put the young and brilliant elar on the task  taking him off everything else .  seldon had to admit to himself  shamefacedly  that the possibility did not excite him .  he did not want to have invented psychohistory so that some stripling could come in and reap the final fruits of fame .  in fact  to put it at its most disgraceful  seldon felt jealous of elar and realized it just sufficiently to feel ashamed of the emotion .   yet  regardless of his less rational feelings  he would have to depend on other younger men whatever his discomfort over it .  psychohistory was no longer the private preserve of himself and amaryl .  the decade of his being first minister had converted it into a large government sanctioned and  budgeted undertaking and  quite to his surprise  after resigning from his post as first minister and returning to streeling university  it had grown still larger .  hari grimaced at its ponderous and pompous official name  the seldon psychohistory project at streeling university .  but most people simply referred to it as the project .   the military junta apparently saw the project as a possible political weapon and while that was so  funding was no problem .  credits poured in .  in return  it was necessary to prepare annual reports  which  however  were quite opaque .  only fringe matters were reported on and even then the mathematics was not likely to be within the purview of any of the members of the junta .   it was clear as he left his old assistant that amaryl  at least  was more than satisfied with the way psychohistory was going and yet seldon felt the blanket of depression settle over him once more .   he decided it was the forthcoming birthday celebration that was bothering him .  it was meant as a celebration of joy  but to hari it was not even a gesture of consolation it merely emphasized his age .   besides  it was upsetting his routine and hari was a creature of habit .  his office and a number of those adjoining had been cleared out and it had been days since he had been able to work normally .  his proper offices would be converted into halls of glory  he supposed  and it would be many days before he could get back to work .  only amaryl absolutely refused to budge and was able to maintain his office .   seldon had wondered  peevishly  who had thought of doing all this .  it wasn t dors  of course .  she knew him entirely too well .  not amaryl or raych  who never even remembered their own birthdays .  he had suspected manella and had even confronted her on the matter .   she admitted that she was all for it and had given orders for the arrangements to take place  but she said that the idea for the birthday party had been suggested to her by tamwile elar .   the brilliant one  thought seldon .  brilliant in everything .   he sighed .  if only the birthday were all over .   dors poked her head through the door .   am i allowed to come in .     no  of course not .  why should you think i would .     this is not your usual place .     i know   sighed seldon .   i have been evicted from my usual place because of the stupid birthday party .  how i wish it were over .     there you are .  once that woman gets an idea in her head  it takes over and grows like the big bang .    seldon changed sides at once .   come .  she means well  dors .     save me from the well meaning   said dors .   in any case  i m here to discuss something else .  something which may be important .     go ahead .  what is it .     i ve been talking to wanda about her dream   she hesitated .   seldon made a gargling sound in the back of his throat  then said  can t believe it .  just let it go .     no .  did you bother to ask her for the details of the dream .     why should i put the little girl through that .     neither did raych  nor manella .  it was left up to me .     but why should you torture her with questions about it .     because i had the feeling i should   said dors grimly .   in the first place  she didn t have the dream when she was home in her bed .     where was she  then .     in your office .     what was she doing in my office .     she wanted to see the place where the party would be and she walked into your office and  of course  there was nothing to see  as it s been cleared out in preparation .  but your chair was still there .  the large one tall back  tall wings  broken down the one you won t let me replace .    hari sighed  as if recalling a longstanding disagreement .   it s not broken down .  i don t want a new one .  go on .     she curled up in your chair and began to brood over the fact that maybe you weren t really going to have a party and she felt bad .  then  she tells me  she must have fallen asleep because nothing is clear in her mind  except that in her dream there were two men not women  she was sure about that two men  talking .     and what were they talking about .     she doesn t know exactly .  you know how difficult it is to remember details under such circumstances .  but she says it was about dying and she thought it was you because you were so old .  and she remembers two words clearly .  they were  lemonade death .      what .     lemonade death .     what does that mean .     i don t know .  in any case  the talking ceased  the men left  and there she was in the chair  cold and frightened and she s been upset about it ever since .    seldon mulled over dors s report .  then he said   look  dear  what importance can we attach to a child s dream .     we can ask ourselves first  hari  if it even was a dream .     what do you mean .     wanda doesn t say outright it was .  she says she  must have fallen asleep .   those are her words .  she didn t say she fell asleep  she said she must have fallen asleep .     what do you deduce from that .     she may have drifted off into a half doze and  in that state  heard two men two real men  not two dream men talking .     real men .  talking about killing me with lemonade death .     something like that  yes .     dors   said seldon forcefully   i know that you re forever foreseeing danger for me  but this is going too far .  why should anyone want to kill me .     it s been tried twice before .     so it has  but consider the circumstances .  the first attempt came shortly after cleon appointed me first minister .  naturally this was an offense to the well established court hierarchy and i was very resented .  a few thought they might settle matters by getting rid of me .  the second time was when the joranumites were trying to seize power and they thought i was standing in their way plus namarti s distorted dream of revenge .    fortunately neither assassination attempt succeeded  but why should there now be a third .  i am no longer first minister and haven t been for ten years .  i am an aging mathematician in retirement and surely no one has anything to fear from me .  the joranumites have been rooted out and destroyed and namarti was executed long ago .  there is absolutely no motivation for anyone to want to kill me .    so please  dors  relax .  when you re nervous about me  you get unsettled  which makes you more nervous still  and i don t want that to happen .    dors rose from her seat and leaned across hari s desk .   it s easy for you to say that there is no motive to kill you  but none is needed .  our government is now a completely irresponsible one and if they wish     stop .   commanded seldon loudly .  then  very quietly   not a word  dors .  not a word against the government .  that could get us in the very trouble you re foreseeing .     i m only talking to you  hari .     right now you are  but if you get into the habit of saying foolish things  you don t know when something will slip out in someone else s presence someone who will then be glad to report you .  just learn  as a matter of necessity  to refrain from political commentary .     i ll try  hari   said dors  but she could not keep the indignation out of her voice .  she turned on her heel and left .   seldon watched her go .  dors had aged gracefully  so gracefully that at times she seemed not to have aged at all .  though she was two years younger than seldon  her appearance had not changed nearly as much as his had in the twenty eight years they had been together .  naturally .   her hair was frosted with gray  but the youthful luster beneath the gray still shone through .  her complexion had grown more sallow  her voice was a bit huskier  and  of course  she wore clothes that were suitable for middle age .  however  her movements were as agile and as quick as ever .  it was as if nothing could be allowed to interfere with her ability to protect hari in case of an emergency .   hari sighed .  this business of being protected more or less against his will  at all times was sometimes a heavy burden .      manella came to see seldon almost immediately afterward .    pardon me  hari  but what has dors been saying   seldon looked up again .  nothing but interruptions .    it wasn t anything important .  wanda s dream .    manella s lips pursed .   i knew it .  wanda said dors was asking her questions about it .  why doesn t she leave the girl alone .  you would think that having a bad dream was some sort of felony .     as a matter of fact   said seldon soothingly   it s just a matter of something wanda remembered as part of the dream .  i don t know if wanda told you  but apparently in her dream she heard something about  lemonade death .       hmm .   manella was silent for a moment .  then she said   that doesn t really matter so much .  wanda is crazy about lemonade and she s expecting lots of it at the party .  i promised she d have some with mycogenian drops in it and she s looking forward to it .     so that if she heard something that sounded anything like lemonade  it would be translated into lemonade in her mind .     yes .  why not .     except that  in that case  what do you suppose it was that was actually said .  she must have heard something in order to misinterpret it .     i don t think that s necessarily so .  but why are we attaching so much importance to a little girl s dream .  please  i don t want anyone talking to her about it anymore .  it s too upsetting .     i agree .  i ll see to it that dors drops the subject at least with wanda .     all right .  i don t care if she is wanda s grandmother  hari .  i m her mother  after all  and my wishes come first .     absolutely   said seldon soothingly and looked after manella as she left .  that was another burden the unending competition between those two women .      tamwile elar was thirty six years old and had joined seldon s psychohistory project as senior mathematician four years earlier .  he was a tall man  with a habitual twinkle in his eye and with more than a touch of self assurance as well .   his hair was brown and had a loose wave in it  the more noticeable because he wore it rather long .  he had an abrupt way of laughing  but there was no fault to be found with his mathematical ability .   elar had been recruited from the west mandanov university and seldon always had to smile when he remembered how suspicious yugo amaryl had been of him at first .  but then  amaryl was suspicious of everyone .  deep in his heart  seldon felt sure   amaryl felt that psychohistory ought to have remained his and hari s private province .   but even amaryl was now willing to admit that elar s membership in the group had eased his own situation tremendously .  yugo said   his techniques for avoiding chaos are unique and fascinating .  no one else in the project could have worked it out the way he did .  certainly nothing of this sort ever occurred to me .  it didn t occur to you  either  hari .     well   said seldon grumpily   i m getting old .     if only   said amaryl   he didn t laugh so loud .     people can t help the way they laugh .    yet the truth was that seldon found himself having a little trouble accepting elar .  it was rather humiliating that he himself had come nowhere near the  achaotic equations   as they were now called .  it didn t bother seldon that he had never thought of the principle behind the electro clarifier that was not really his field .  the achaotic equations  however  he should  indeed  have thought of or at least gotten close to .   he tried reasoning with himself .  seldon had worked out the entire basis for psychohistory and the achaotic equations grew naturally out of that basis .  could elar have done seldon s work three decades earlier .  seldon was convinced that elar couldn t have .  and was it so remarkable that elar had thought up the principle of achaotism once the basis was in place .   all this was very sensible and very true  yet seldon still found himself uneasy when facing elar .  just slightly edgy .  weary age facing flamboyant youth .   yet elar never gave him obvious cause for feeling the difference in years .  he never failed to show seldon full respect or in any way to imply that the older man had passed his prime .   of course  elar was interested in the forthcoming festivities and had even  as seldon had discovered  been the first to suggest that seldon s birthday be celebrated .   was this a nasty emphasis on seldon s age .  seldon dismissed the possibility .  if he believed that  it would mean he was picking up some of dors s tricks of suspicion .   elar strode toward him and said   maestro   and seldon winced  as always .  he much preferred to have the senior members of the project call him hari  but it seemed such a small point to make a fuss over .    maestro   said elar .   the word is out that you ve been called in for a conference with general tennar .     yes .  he s the new head of the military junta and i suppose he wants to see me to ask what psychohistory is all about .  they ve been asking me that since the days of cleon and demerzel .    the new head .  the junta was like a kaleidoscope  with some of its members periodically falling from grace and others rising from nowhere .     but it s my understanding he wants it now right in the middle of the birthday celebration .     that doesn t matter .  you can all celebrate without me .     no  we can t  maestro .  i hope you don t mind  but some of us got together and put in a call to the palace and put the appointment off for a week .     what .   said seldon annoyed .   surely that was presumptuous of you and risky  besides .     it worked out well .  they ve put it off and you ll need that time .     why would i need a week .    elar hesitated .   may i speak frankly  maestro .     of course you can .  when have i ever asked that anyone speak to me m any way but frankly .    elar flushed slightly  his fair skin reddening  but his voice remained steady .   it s not easy to say this  maestro .  you re a genius at mathematics .  no one on the project has any doubt of that .  no one in the empire they knew you and understood mathematics would have any doubt tout it .  however  it is not given to anybody to be a universal genius .     i know that as well as you do  elar .     i know you do .  specifically  though  you lack the ability to handle ordinary people shall we say  stupid people .  you lack a certain deviousness  a certain ability to sidestep  and if you are dealing with someone who is both powerful in government and somewhat stupid  you can easily endanger the project and  for that matter  your own life  simply because you are too frank .     what is this .  am i suddenly a child .  i ve been dealing with politicians for a long time .  i was first minister for ten years  as perhaps you may remember .     forgive me  maestro  but you were not an extraordinarily effective one .  you dealt with first minister demerzel  who was very intelligent  by all accounts  and with the emperor cleon  who was very friendly .  now you will encounter military people who are neither intelligent nor friendly another matter entirely .     i ve even dealt with military people and survived .     not with general dugal tennar .  he s another sort of thing altogether .  i know him .     you know him .  you have met him .     i don t know him personally  but he s from mandanov  which  as you know  is my sector  and he was a power there before he joined the junta and rose through its ranks .     and what do you know about him .     ignorant  superstitious  violent .  he is not someone you can handle easily or safely .  you can use the week to work out methods for dealing with him .    seldon bit his lower lip .  there was something to what elar said and seldon recognized the fact that  while he had plans of his own  it would still be difficult to try to manipulate a stupid  self important  short tempered person with overwhelming force at his disposal .   he said uneasily   i ll manage somehow .  the whole matter of a military junta is  in any case  an unstable situation in the trantor of today .  it has already lasted longer than might have seemed likely .     have we been testing that .  i was not aware that we were making stability decisions on the junta .     just a few calculations by amaryl  making use of your achaotic equations .   he paused .   by the way  i ve come across some references to them as the elar equations .     not by me  maestro .     i hope you don t mind  but i don t want that .  psychohistoric elements are to be described functionally and not personally .  as soon as personalities intervene  bad feelings arise .       i understand and quite agree  maestro .     in fact   said seldon with a touch of guilt   i have always felt it wrong that we speak of the basic seldon equations of psychohistory .  the trouble is that s been in use for so many years  it s not practical to try to change it .     if you ll excuse my saying so  maestro  you re an exceptional case .  no one  i think  would quarrel with your receiving full credit for inventing the science of psychohistory .   but  if i may  i wish to get back to your meeting with general tennar .     well  what else is there to say .     i can t help but wonder if it might be better if you did not see him  did not speak to him  did not deal with him .     how am i to avoid that if he calls me in for a conference .     perhaps you can plead illness and send someone in your place .     whom .    elar was silent for a moment  but his silence was eloquent .   seldon said   you  i take it .     might that not be the thing to do .  i am a fellow sectoral citizen of the general  which may carry some weight .  you are a busy man  getting     in years  and it would be easy to believe that you are not entirely well .  and if i see him  rather than yourself please excuse me  maestro i can wiggle and maneuver more easily than you can .     lie  you mean .     if necessary .     you ll be taking a huge chance .     not too huge .  i doubt that he will order my execution .  if he becomes annoyed with me  as he well might  then i can plead or you can plead on my behalf youth and inexperience .  in any case  if i get into trouble  that will be far less dangerous than if you were to do so .  i m thinking of the project  which can do without me a great deal more easily than it can without you .    seldon said with a frown   i m not going to hide behind you  elar .  if the man wants to see me  he will see me .  i refuse to shiver and shake and ask you to take chances for me .  what do you think i am .     a frank and honest man when the need is for a devious one .     i will manage to be devious if i must .  please don t underestimate me  elar .    elar shrugged hopelessly .   very well .  i can only argue with you up to a certain point .     in fact  elar  i wish you had not postponed the meeting .  i would rather skip my birthday and see the general than the reverse .  this birthday celebration was not my idea .   his voice died away in a grumble .   elar said   i m sorry .     well   said seldon with resignation   we ll see what happens .    he turned and left .  sometimes he wished ardently that he could run what was called a  tight ship   making sure that everything went as he wished it to  leaving little or no room for maneuvering among his subordinates .  to do that  however  would take enormous time  enormous effort  would deprive him of any chance of working on psychohistory himself and  besides  he simply lacked the temperament for it .   he sighed .  he would have to speak to amaryl .       seldon strode into amaryl s office  unannounced .    yugo   he said abruptly   the session with general tennar has been postponed .   he seated himself in a rather pettish manner .   it took amaryl his usual few moments to disconnect his mind from his work .  looking up finally  he said   what was his excuse .     it wasn t he .  some of our mathematicians arranged a week s postponement so that it wouldn t interfere with the birthday celebration .  i find all of this to be extremely annoying .     why did you let them do that .     i didn t .  they just went ahead and arranged things .   seldon shrugged .   in a way  it s my fault .  i ve whined so long about turning sixty that everyone thinks they have to cheer me up with festivities .    amaryl said   of course  we can use the week .    seldon sat forward  immediately tense .   is something wrong .     no .  not that i can see  but it won t hurt to examine it further .  look  hari  this is the first time in nearly thirty years that psychohistory has leached the point where it can actually make a prediction .  it s not much of one it s just a small pinch of the vast continent of humanity but it s t lie best we ve had so far .  all right .  we want to take advantage of that  see how it works  prove to ourselves that psychohistory is what we think it is  a predictive science .  so it won t hurt to make sure that we haven t overlooked anything .  even this tiny bit of prediction is complex and i welcome another week of study .     very well  then .  i ll consult you on the matter before i go to see the general for any last minute modifications that have to be made .  meanwhile  yugo  do not allow any information concerning this to leak out to the others not to anyone .  if it fails  i don t want the people of the project to grow downhearted .  you and i will absorb the failure ourselves and keep on trying .    a rare wistful smile crossed amaryl s face .   you and i .  do you remember when it really was just the two of us .     i remember it very well and don t think that i don t miss those days .  we didn t have much to work with     not even the prime radiant  let alone the electro clarifier .     but those were happy days .     happy   said amaryl  nodding his head .       the university had been transformed and hari seldon could not refrain from being pleased .   the central rooms of the project complex had suddenly sprouted in color and light  with holography filling the air with shifting three dimensional images of seldon at different places and different times .  there was dors venabili smiling  looking somewhat younger raych as a teenager  still unpolished seldon and amaryl  looking unbelievably young  bent over their computers .  there was even a fleeting sight of eto demerzel  which filled seldon s heart with yearning for his old friend and the security he had felt before demerzel s departure .   the emperor cleon appeared nowhere in the holographics .  it was not because holographs of him did not exist  but it was not wise  under the rule of the junta  to remind people of the past imperium .   it all poured outward  overflowing  filling room after room  building after building .  somehow  time had been found to convert the entire university into a display the likes of which seldon had never seen or even imagined .  even the dome lights were darkened to produce an artificial night against which the university would sparkle for three days .    three days .   said seldon  half impressed  half horrified .    three days   said dors venabili  nodding her head .   the university would consider nothing less .     the expense .  the labor .   said seldon  frowning .    the expense is minimal   said dors   compared to what you have done for the university .  and the labor is all voluntary .  the students turned out and took care of everything .    a from the air view of the university appeared now  panoramically  and seldon stared at it with a smile forcing itself onto his countenance .   dors said   you re pleased .  you ve done nothing but grouse these past few months about how you didn t want any celebration for being an old man and now look at you .     well  it is flattering .  i had no idea that they would do anything like this .     why not .  you re an icon  hari .  the whole world the whole empire knows about you .     they do not   said seldon  shaking his head vigorously .   not one in a billion knows anything at all about me and certainly not about psychohistory .  no one outside the project has the faintest knowledge of how psychohistory works and not everyone inside does  either .     that doesn t matter  hari .  it s you .  even the quadrillions who don t know anything about you or your work know that hari seldon is the greatest mathematician in the empire .     well   said seldon  looking around   they certainly are making me feel that way right now .  but three days and three nights .  the place will be reduced to splinters .     no  it won t .  all the records have been stored away .  the computers and other equipment have been secured .  the students have set up a virtual security force that will prevent anything from being damaged .     you ve seen to all of that  haven t you  dors .   said seldon  smiling at her fondly .    a number of us have .  it s by no means all me .  your colleague tamwile elar has worked with incredible dedication .    seldon scowled .    what s the matter with elar .   said dors .   seldon said   he keeps calling me  maestro .      dors shook her head .   well  there s a terrible crime .    seldon ignored that and said   and he s young .     worse and worse .  come  hari  you re going to have to learn to grow old gracefully and to begin with you ll have to show that you re enjoying yourself .  that will please others and increase their enjoyment and surely you would want to do that .  come on .  move around .  don t hide here with me .  greet everyone .  smile .  ask after their health .  and remember that  after the banquet  you re going to have to make a speech .     i dislike banquets and i doubly dislike speeches .     you ll have to  anyway .  now move .    seldon sighed dramatically and did as he was told .  he cut quite an imposing figure as he stood in the archway leading into the main hall .  i he voluminous first minister s robes of yesteryear were gone  as were the heliconian style garments he had favored in his youth .  now seldon wore an outfit that bespoke his elevated status  straight pants  crisply pleated  a modified tunic on top .  embroidered in silver thread above his heart was the insignia  seldon psychohistory project at streeling university .  it sparkled like a beacon against the dignified titanium gray hue of his clothing .  seldon s eyes twinkled in a face now lined by age  his sixty years given away as much by his wrinkles as by his white hair .   he entered the room in which the children were feasting .  the room had been entirely cleared  except for trestles with food upon them .  the children rushed up to him as soon as they saw him knowing  as they did  that he was the reason for the feast and seldon tried to avoid their clutching fingers .    wait  wait  children   he said .   now stand back .    he pulled a small computerized robot from his pocket and placed it on the floor .  in an empire without robots  this was something that he could expect to be eye popping .  it had the shape of a small furry animal  but it also had the capacity to change shapes without warning  eliciting squeals of children s laughter each time  and when it did so  the sounds and motions it made changed as well .    watch it   said seldon   and play with it  and try not to break it .  later on  there ll be one for each of you .    he slipped out into the hallway leading back to the main hall and realized  as he did so  that wanda was following him .    grandpa   she said .   well  of course  wanda was different .  he swooped down and lifted her high in the air  turned her over  and put her down .    are you having a good time  wanda .   he asked .    yes   she said   but don t go into that room .     why not  wanda .  it s my room .  it s the office where i work .     it s where i had my bad dream .     i know  wanda  but that s all over  isn t it .   he hesitated  then he led wanda to one of the chairs lining the hallway .  he sat down and placed her on his lap .    wanda   he said   are you sure it was a dream .     i think it was a dream .     were you really sleeping .     i think i was .    she seemed uncomfortable talking about it and seldon decided to let it go .  there was no use pushing her any further .   he said   well  dream or not  there were two men and they talked of lemonade death  didn t they .    wanda nodded reluctantly .   seldon said   you re sure they said lemonade .    wanda nodded again .    might they have said something else and you thought they said lemonade .     lemonade is what they said .    seldon had to be satisfied with that .   well  run off and have a good time  wanda .  forget about the dream .     all right  grandpa .   she cheered up as soon as the matter of the dream was dismissed and off she went to join the festivities .   seldon went to search for manella .  it took him an extraordinarily long time to find her  since  at every step  he was stopped  greeted  and conversed with .   finally he saw her in the distance .  muttering   pardon me  pardon me  there s someone i must  pardon me    he worked his way over to her with considerable trouble .    manella   he said and drew her off to one side  smiling mechanically in all directions .    yes  hari   she said .   is something wrong .     it s wanda s dream .     don t tell me she s still talking about it .     well  it s still bothering her .  listen  we have lemonade at the party  haven t we .     of course  the children adore it .  i ve added a couple of dozen different mycogenian taste buds to very small glasses of different shapes and the children try them one after the other to see which taste best .  the adults have been drinking it  too .  i have .  why don t you taste it  hari .  it s great .     i m thinking .  if it wasn t a dream  if the child really heard two men speak of lemonade death   he paused  as though ashamed to continue .   manella said   are you thinking that someone poisoned the lemonade .  that s ridiculous .  by now every child in the place would be sick or dying .     i know   muttered seldon .   i know .    he wandered off and almost didn t see dors when he passed her .  she seized his elbow .    why the face .   she said .   you look concerned .     i ve been thinking of wanda s lemonade death .     so have i  but i can t make anything of it so far .     i can t help but think of the possibility of poisoning .     don t .  i assure you that every bit of food that came into this party has been molecularly checked .  i know you ll think that s my typical paranoia  but my task is guarding you and that is what i must do .     and everything is     no poison .  i promise you .    seldon smiled   well  good .  that s a relief .  i didn t really think     let s hope not   said dors dryly .   what concerns me far more than this myth of poison is that i have heard that you re going to be seeing that monster tennar in a few days .     don t call him a monster  dors .  be careful .  we re surrounded by cars and tongues .    dors immediately lowered her voice .   i suppose you re right .  look  round .  all these smiling faces and yet who knows which of our friends  will be reporting back to the head and his henchmen when the night is over .  ah  humans .  even after all these thousands of centuries  to think that such base treachery still exists .  it seems to me to be so unnecessary .  yet i know the harm it can do .  that is why i must go with you  hari .     impossible  dors .  it would just complicate matters for me .  i ll go myself and i ll have no trouble .     you would have no idea how to handle the general .    seldon looked grave .   and you would .  you sound exactly like elar .  he  too  is convinced that i am a helpless old fool .  he  too  wants to come with me or  rather  to go in my place .   i wonder how many people on trantor are willing to take my place   he added with clear sarcasm .   dozens .  millions .        for ten years the galactic empire had been without an emperor  but there was no indication of that fact in the way the imperial palace grounds were operated .  millennia of custom made the absence of an emperor meaningless .   it meant  of course  that there was no figure in imperial robes to preside over formalities of one sort or another .  no imperial voice gave orders  no imperial wishes made themselves known  no imperial gratifications or annoyances made themselves felt  no imperial pleasures warmed either palace  no imperial sicknesses cast them in gloom .  the emperor s own quarters in the small palace were empty the imperial family did not exist .   and yet the army of gardeners kept the grounds in perfect condition .  an army of service people kept the buildings in top shape .  the emperor s bed never slept in was made with fresh sheets every day  the rooms were cleaned  everything worked as it always worked  and the entire imperial staff  from top to bottom  worked as they had always worked .  the top officials gave commands as they would have done if the emperor had lived  commands that they knew the emperor would have given .  in many cases  in particular in the higher echelons  the personnel were the same as those who had been there on cleon s last day of life .  the new personnel who had been taken on were carefully molded and trained into the traditions they would have to serve .   it was as though the empire  accustomed to the rule of an emperor  insisted on this  ghost rule  to hold the empire together .   the junta knew this or  if they didn t  they felt it vaguely .  in ten years none of those military men who had commanded the empire had moved into the emperor s private quarters in the small palace .  whatever these men were  they were not imperial and they knew they had no rights there .  a populace that endured the loss of liberty would not endure any sign of irreverence to the emperor alive or dead .   even general tennar had not moved into the graceful structure that had housed the emperors of a dozen different dynasties for so long .  he hid made his home and office in one of the structures built on the outskirts of the grounds eyesores  but eyesores that were built like fortresses  sturdy enough to withstand a siege  with outlying buildings in which an enormous force of guards was housed .   tennar was a stocky man  with a mustache .  it was not a vigorous overflowing dahlite mustache but one that was carefully clipped and fitted to the upper lip  leaving a strip of skin between the hair and the line of the lip .  it was a reddish mustache and tennar had cold blue eyes .  he had probably been a handsome man in his younger days  but his face was pudgy now and his eyes were slits that expressed anger more often than any other emotion .   so he said angrily as one would  who felt himself to be absolute master of millions of worlds and yet who dared not call himself an emperor to hender linn   i can establish a dynasty of my own .   he hooked around with a scowl .   this is not a fitting place for the master of the empire .    linn said softly   to be master is what is important .  better to be a master in a cubicle than a figurehead in a palace .     best yet  to be master in a palace .  why not .    linn bore the title of colonel  but it is quite certain that he had never engaged in any military action .  his function was that of telling tennar what he wanted to hear and of carrying his orders  unchanged  to others .  on occasion if it seemed safe he might try to steer tennar into more prudent courses .   linn was well known as  tennar s lackey  and knew that was how he was known .  it did not bother him .  as lackey  he was safe and he had seen the downfall of those who had been too proud to be lackeys .   the time might  of course  come when tennar himself would be buried in the ever changing junta panorama  but linn felt  with a certain amount of philosophy  that he would be aware of it in time and save himself .   or he might not .  there was a price for everything .    no reason why you can t found a dynasty  general   said linn .  many others have done it in the long imperial history .  still  it takes lime .  the people are slow to adapt .  it is usually only the second or even third of the dynasty who is fully accepted as emperor .     i don t believe that .  i need merely announce myself as new em wror .  who will dare quarrel with that .  my grip is tight .     so it is  general .  your power is unquestioned on trantor and in most of the inner worlds  yet it is possible that many in the farther outer worlds will not just yet accept a new imperial dynasty .     inner worlds or outer worlds  military force rules all .  that is an old imperial maxim .     and a good one   said linn   but many of the provinces have armed forces of their own  nowadays  that they may not use on your behalf .  these are difficult times .     you counsel caution  then .     i always counsel caution  general .     and someday you may counsel it once too often .    linn bent his head .   i can only counsel what seems to me to be good and useful to you  general .     as in your constant harping to me about this hari seldon .     he is your greatest danger  general .     so you keep saying  but i don t see it .  he s just a college professor .    linn said   so he is  but he was once first minister .     i know  but that was in cleon s time .  has he done anything since .  with times being difficult and with the governors of the provinces being fractious  why is a professor my greatest danger .     it is sometimes a mistake   said linn carefully  for one had to be careful in educating the general    to suppose that a quiet unobtrusive man can be harmless .  seldon has been anything but harmless to those he has opposed .  twenty years ago the joranumite movement almost destroyed cleon s powerful first minister  eto demerzel .    tennar nodded  but the slight frown on his face betrayed his effort to remember the matter .    it was seldon who destroyed joranum and who succeeded demerzel as first minister .  the joranumite movement survived  however  and seldon engineered its destruction  too  but not before it succeeded in bringing about the assassination of cleon .     but seldon survived that  didn t he .     you are perfectly correct .  seldon survived .     that is strange .  to have permitted an imperial assassination should have meant death for a first minister .     so it should have .  nevertheless  the junta has allowed him to live .  it seemed wiser to do so .     why .    linn sighed internally .   there is something called psychohistory  general .     i know nothing about that   said tennar flatly .   actually he had a vague memory of linn trying to talk to him on a number of occasions concerning this strange collection of syllables .  he had never wanted to listen and linn had known better than to push the matter .  tennar didn t want to listen now  either  but there seemed to be a hidden urgency in linn s words .  perhaps  tennar thought  he had now better listen .    almost no one knows anything about it   said linn   yet there are a few uh intellectuals  who find it of interest .     and what is it .     it is a complex system of mathematics .    tennar shook his head .   leave me out of that  please .  i can count my military divisions .  that s all the mathematics i need .     the story is   said linn   that psychohistory may make it possible to predict the future .    the general s eyes bulged .   you mean this seldon is a fortune    not in the usual fashion .  it is a matter of science .     i don t believe it .     it is hard to believe  but seldon has become something of a cult figure here on trantor and in certain places in the outer worlds .  now psychohistory if it can be used to predict the future or if even people merely think it can be so used can be a powerful tool with which to uphold the regime .  i m sure you have already seen this  general .  one need merely predict our regime will endure and bring forth peace and prosperity for the empire .  people  believing this  will help make it a self fulfilling prophecy .  on the other hand  if seldon wishes the reverse  he can predict civil war and ruin .  people will believe that  too  and that would destabilize the regime .     in that case  colonel  we simply make sure that the predictions of psychohistory are what we want them to be .     it would be seldon who would have to make them and he is not a friend of the regime .  it is important  general  that we differentiate between the project that is working at streeling university to perfect psychohistory and hari seldon .  psychohistory can be extremely useful to us  but it will be so only if someone other than seldon were in charge .     are there others who could be .     oh yes .  it is only necessary to get rid of seldon .     what is so difficult with that .  an order of execution and it is done .     it would be better  general  if the government was not seen to be directly involved in such a thing .     i have arranged to have him meet with you  so that you can use your skill to probe his personality .  you would then be able to judge whether certain suggestions i have in mind are worthwhile or not .     when is the meeting to take place .     it was to take place very soon  but his representatives at the project asked for a few days leeway  because they were in the process of celebrating his birthday his sixtieth  apparently .  it seemed wise to allow that and to permit a week s delay .     why .   demanded tennar .   i dislike any display of weakness .     quite right  general .  quite right .  your instincts are  as always  correct .  however  it seemed to me that the needs of the state might require us to know what and how the birthday celebration which is taking place right now might involve .     why .     all knowledge is useful .  would you care to see some of the festivities .    general tennar s face remained dark .   is that necessary .     i think you will find it interesting  general .    the reproduction sight and sound was excellent and for quite a while the hilarity of the birthday celebration filled the rather stark room in which the general sat .   linn s low voice served as commentary .   most of this  general  is taking place in the project complex  but the rest of the university is involved .  we will have an air view in a few moments and you will see that the celebration covers a wide area .  in fact  though i don t have the evidence available right now  there are corners of the planet here and there  in various university and sectoral settings mostly  where what we might call  sympathy celebrations  of one sort or another are taking place .  the celebrations are still continuing and will endure for another day at least .     are you telling me that this is a trantor wide celebration .     in a specialized way .  it affects mostly the intellectual classes  but it is surprisingly widespread .  it may even be that there is some shouting on worlds other than trantor .     where did you get this reproduction .    linn smiled .   our facilities in the project are quite good .  we have reliable sources of information  so that little can happen that doesn t come our way at once .     well then  linn  what are all your conclusions about this .     it seems to me  general  and i m sure that it seems so to you  that hari seldon is the focus of a personality cult .  he has so identified himself with psychohistory that if we were to get rid of him in too open a manner  we would entirely destroy the credibility of the science .  it would be useless to us .    on the other hand  general  seldon is growing old and it is not difficult to imagine him being replaced by another man  someone we could choose and who would be friendly to our great aims and hopes for the empire .  if seldon could be removed in such a way that it is made to seem natural  then that is all we need .    the general said   and you think i ought to see him .     yes  in order to weigh his quality and decide what we ought to do .  but we must be cautious  for he is a popular man .     i have dealt with popular people before   said tennar darkly .        yes   said hari seldon wearily   it was a great triumph .  i had a wonderful time .  i can hardly wait until i m seventy so i can repeat it .  but the fact is  i m exhausted .     so get yourself a good night s sleep  dad   said raych  smiling .   that s an easy cure .     i don t know how well i can relax when i have to see our great leader in a few days .     not alone  you won t see him   said dors venabili grimly .   seldon frowned .   don t say that again  dors .  it is important for me to see him alone .     it won t be safe with you alone .  do you remember what happened ten years ago when you refused to let me come with you to greet the gardeners .     there is no danger of my forgetting when you remind me of it twice a week  dors .  in this case  though  i intend to go alone .  what can he want to do to me if i come in as an old man  utterly harmless  to find out what he wants .     what do you imagine he wants .   said raych  biting at his knuckle .    i suppose he wants what cleon always wanted .  it will turn out that he has found out that psychohistory can  in some way  predict the future and he will want to use it for his own purposes .  i told cleon the science wasn t up to it nearly thirty years ago and i kept telling him that all through my tenure as first minister and now i ll have to tell general tennar the same thing .     how do you know he ll believe you .   said raych .    i ll think of some way of being convincing .    dors said   i do not wish you to go alone .     your wishing  dors  makes no difference .    at this point  tamwile elar interrupted .  he said   i m the only nonfamily person here .  i don t know if a comment from me would be welcome .     go ahead   said seldon .   come one  come all .     i would like to suggest a compromise .  why don t a number of us go with the maestro .  quite a few of us .  we can act as his triumphal escort  a kind of finale to the birthday celebration .   now wait  i don t mean that we will all crowd into the general s offices .  i don t even mean entering the imperial palace grounds .  we can just take hotel rooms in the imperial sector at the edge of the grounds the dome s edge hotel would be just right and we ll give ourselves a day of pleasure .     that s just what i need   snorted seldon .   a day of pleasure .     not you  maestro   said elar at once .   you ll be meeting with general tennar .  the rest of us  though  will give the people of the imperial sector a notion of your popularity and perhaps the general will take note also .  and if he knows we re all waiting for your return  it may keep him from being unpleasant .    there was a considerable silence after that .  finally raych said   it sounds too showy to me .  it don t fit in with the image the world has of dad .    but dors said   i m not interested in hari s image .  i m interested in hari s safety .  it strikes me that if we cannot invade the general s presence or the imperial grounds  then allowing ourselves to accumulate  so to speak  as near the general as we can  might do us well .  thank you  dr .  elar  for a very good suggestion .     i don t want it done   said seldon .    but i do   said dors   and if that s as close as i can get to offering you personal protection  then that much i will insist on .    manella  who had listened to it all without comment till then  said   visiting the dome s edge hotel could be a lot of fun .     it s not fun i m thinking of   said dors   but i ll accept your vote in favor .    and so it was .  the following day some twenty of the higher echelon of the psychohistory project descended on the dome s edge hotel  with rooms overlooking the open spaces of the imperial palace grounds .   the following evening hari seldon was picked up by the general s armed guards and taken off to the meeting .   at almost the same time dors venabili disappeared  but her absence was not noted for a long time .  and when it was noted  no one could guess what had happened to her and the gaily festive mood turned rapidly into apprehension .       dors venabili had lived on the imperial palace grounds for ten years .  as wife of the first minister  she had entry to the grounds and could pass freely from the dome to the open  with her fingerprints as the pass .   in the confusion that followed cleon s assassination  her pass had never been removed and now when  for the first time since that dreadful clay  she wanted to move from the dome into the open spaces of the grounds  she could do so .   she had always known that she could do so easily only once  for  upon discovery  the pass would be canceled but this was the one time to do it .   there was a sudden darkening of the sky as she moved into the open  rod she felt a distinct lowering of the temperature .  the world under the dome was always kept a little lighter during the night period than natural night would require and was kept a little dimmer during the day period .  and  of course  the temperature beneath the dome was always a bit milder than the outdoors .   most trantorians were unaware of this  for they spent their entire lives under the dome .  to dors it was expected  but it didn t really matter .   she took the central roadway  into which the dome opened at the site of the dome s edge hotel .  it was  of course  brightly lit  so that the darkness of the sky didn t matter at all .   dors knew that she would not advance a hundred meters along the roadway without being stopped  less perhaps in the present paranoid lays of the junta .  her alien presence would be detected at once .   nor was she disappointed .  a small ground car skittered up and the guardsman shouted out the window   what are you doing here .  where are you going .    dors ignored the question and continued to walk .   the guardsman called out   halt .   then he slammed on the brakes and stepped out of the car  which was exactly what dors had wanted him to do .   the guardsman was holding a blaster loosely in his hand not threatening to use it  merely demonstrating its existence .  he said   your reference number .    dors said   i want your car .     what .   the guardsman sounded outraged .   your reference number .  immediately .   and now the blaster came up .   dors said quietly   you don t need my reference number   then she walked toward the guardsman .   the guardsman took a backward step .   if you don t stop and present your reference number  i ll blast you .     no .  drop your blaster .    the guardsman s lips tightened .  his finger began to edge toward the contact  but before he could reach it  he was lost .   he could never describe afterward what happened in any accurate way .  all he could say was  how was i to know it was the tiger woman .    the time came when he would be proud of the encounter .    she moved so fast  i didn t see exactly what she did or what happened .  one moment i was going to shoot her down i was sure she was some sort of madwoman and the next thing i knew  i was completely overwhelmed .    dors held the guardsman in a firm grip  the hand with the blaster forced high .  she said   either drop the blaster at once or i will break your arm .    the guardsman felt a kind of death grip around his chest that all but prevented him from breathing .  realizing he had no choice  he dropped the blaster .   dors venabili released him  but before the guardsman could make a move to recover  he found himself facing his own blaster in dors s hand .   dors said   i hope you ve left your detectors in place .  don t try to report what s happened too quickly .  you had better wait and decide what it is you plan to tell your superiors .  the fact that an unarmed woman took your blaster and your car may well put an end to your usefulness to the junta .    dors started the car and began to speed down the central roadway .  a ten year stay on the grounds told her exactly where she was going .  the car she was in an official ground car was not an alien intrusion into the grounds and would not be picked up as a matter of course .  however  she had to take a chance on speed  for she wanted to reach her destination rapidly .  she pushed the car to a speed of two hundred kilometers per hour .   the speed  at least  eventually did attract attention .  she ignored radioed cries  demanding to know why she was speeding  and before long the car s detectors told her that another ground car was in hot pursuit .   she knew that there would be a warning sent up ahead and that there would be other ground cars waiting for her to arrive  but there was little any of them could do  short of trying to blast her out of existence something apparently no one was willing to try  pending further investigation .   when she reached the building she had been heading for  two ground cars were waiting for her .  she climbed serenely out of her own car and walked toward the entrance .   two men at once stood in her way  obviously astonished that the driver of the speeding car was not a guardsman but a woman dressed in civilian clothes .    what are you doing here .  what was the rush .    dors said quietly   important message for colonel header linn .     is that so .   said the guardsman harshly .  there were now four men between her and the entrance .   reference number  please .    dors said   don t delay me .     reference number  i said .     you re wasting my time .    one of the guardsmen said suddenly   you know who she looks like .  the old first minister s wife .  dr .  venabili .  the tiger woman .    there was an odd backward step on the part of all four  but one of them said   you re under arrest .     am i .   said dors .   if i m the tiger woman  you must know that i am considerably stronger than any of you and that my reflexes are considerably faster .  let me suggest that all four of you accompany me quietly inside and we ll see what colonel linn has to say .     you re under arrest  came the repetition and four masters were aimed at dors .    well   said dors .   if you insist .    she moved rapidly and two of the guardsmen were suddenly on the ground  groaning  while dors was standing with a blaster in each hand .   she said   i have tried not to hurt them  but it is quite possible that i dave broken their wrists .  that leaves two of you and i can shoot faster than you can .  if either of you makes the slightest move the slightest i will have to break the habit of a lifetime and kill you .  it will sicken me to do so and i beg you not to force me into it .    there was absolute silence from the two guardsmen still standing no motion .    i would suggest   said dors   that you two escort me into the colonel s presence and that you then seek medical help for your comrades .    the suggestion was not necessary .  colonel linn emerged from his office .   what is going on here .  what is    dors turned to him .   ah .  let me introduce myself .  i am dr .  dors venabili  the wife of professor hari seldon .  i have come to see you on important business .  these four tried to stop me and  as a result  two are badly hurt .  send them all about their business and let me talk to you .  i mean you no harm .    linn stared at the four guardsmen  then at dors .  he said calmly   you mean me no harm .  though four guardsmen have not succeeded in stopping you  i have four thousand at my instant call .     then call them   said dors .   however quickly they come  it will not be in time to save you  should i decide to kill you .  dismiss your guardsmen and let us talk civilly .    linn dismissed the guardsmen and said   well  come in and we will talk .  let me warn you  though  dr .  venabili i have a long memory .     and i   said dors .  they walked into linn s quarters together .       linn said with utmost courtesy   tell me exactly why you are here  dr .  venabili .    dors smiled without menace and yet not exactly pleasantly  either .   to begin with   she said   i have come here to show you that i can come here .     yes .  my husband was taken to his interview with the general in an official ground car under armed guard .  i myself left the hotel at a the same time he did  on foot and unarmed and here i am and i believe i got here before he did .  i had to wade through five guardsmen  including the guardsman whose car i appropriated  in order to reach you .  i would have waded through fifty .    linn nodded his head phlegmatically .   i understand that you are sometimes called the tiger woman .     i have been called that .   now  having reached you  my task is to make certain that no harm comes to my husband .  he is venturing into the general s lair if i can be dramatic about it and i want him to emerge unharmed and unthreatened .     as far as i am concerned  i know that no harm will come to your husband as a result of this meeting .  but if you are concerned  why do you come to me .  why didn t you go directly to the general .     because  of the two of you  it is you that has the brains .    there was a short pause and linn said   that would be a most dangerous remark if overheard .     more dangerous for you than for me  so make sure it is not overheard .   now  if it occurs to you that i am to be simply soothed and put off and that  if my husband is imprisoned or marked for execution  that there will really be nothing i can do about it  disabuse yourself .    she indicated the two blasters that lay on the table before her .   i entered the grounds with nothing .  i arrived in your immediate vicinity with two masters .  if i had no masters  i might have had knives  with which i am an expert .  and if i had neither blasters nor knives  i would still be a formidable person .  this table we re sitting at is metal obviously and sturdy .     it is .    dors held up her hands  fingers splayed  as if to show that she held no weapon .  then she dropped them to the table and  palms down  caressed its surface .   abruptly dors raised her fist and then brought it down on the table with a loud crash  which sounded almost as if metal were striking metal .  she smiled and lifted her hand .    no bruise   dors said .   no pain .  but you ll notice that the table is slightly bent where i struck it .  if that same blow had come down with the name force on a person s head  the skull would have exploded .  i have never done such a thing  in fact  i have never killed anyone  though i have injured several .  nevertheless  if professor seldon is harmed     you are still threatening .     i am promising .  i will do nothing if professor seldon is unharmed .  otherwise  colonel linn  i will be forced to maim or kill you and i promise you again i will do the same to general tennar .    linn said   you cannot withstand an entire army  no matter how tigerish a woman you are .  what then .     stories spread   said dors   and are exaggerated .  i have not really done much in the way of tigerishness  but many more stories are told of me than are true .  your guardsmen fell back when they recognized me and they themselves will spread the story  with advantage  of how i made my way to you .  even an army might hesitate to attack me  colonel linn  but even if they did and even if they destroyed me  beware the indignation of the people .  the junta is maintaining order  but it is doing so only barely and you don t want anything to upset matters .  think  then  of how easy the alternative is .  simply do not harm professor hari seldon .     we have no intention of harming him .     why the interview  then .     what s the mystery .  the general is curious about psychohistory .  the government records are open to us .  the old emperor cleon was interested .  demerzel  when he was first minister  was interested .  why should we not be in our turn .  in fact  more so .     why more so .     because time has passed .  as i understand it  psychohistory began as a thought in professor seldon s mind .  he has been working on it  with increasing vigor and with larger and larger groups of people  for nearly thirty years .  he has done so almost entirely with government support  so that  in a way  his discoveries and techniques belong to the government .  we intend to ask him about psychohistory  which  by now  must be far advanced beyond what existed in the times of demerzel and cleon  and we expect him to tell us what we want to know .  we want something more practical than the vision of equations curling their way through air .  do you understand me .     yes   said dors  frowning .    and one more thing .  do not suppose that the danger to your husband comes from the government only and that any harm that reaches him will mean that you must attack us at once .  i would suggest that professor seldon may have purely private enemies .  i have no knowledge of such things  but surely it is possible .     i shall keep that in mind .  right now  i want to have you arrange that i join my husband during his interview with the general .  i want to know  beyond doubt  that he is safe .     that will be hard to arrange and will take some time .  it would be impossible to interrupt the conversation  but if you wait till it is ended     take the time and arrange it .  do not count on double crossing me and remaining alive .        general tennar stared at hari seldon in a rather pop eyed manner and his fingers tapped lightly at the desk where he sat .    thirty years   he said .   thirty years and you are telling me you still have nothing to show for it .     actually  general  twenty eight years .    tennar ignored that .   and all at government expense .  do you know how many billions of credits have been invested in your project  professor .     i haven t kept up  general  but we have records that could give me the answer to your question in seconds .     and so have we .  the government  professor  is not an endless source of funds .  these are not the old times .  we don t have cleon s old free and easy attitude toward finances .  raising taxes is hard and we need credits for many things .  i have called you here  hoping that you can benefit us in some way with your psychohistory .  if you cannot  then i must tell you  quite frankly  that we will have to shut off the faucet .  if you ran continue your research without government funding  do so  for unless you show me something that would make the expense worth it  you will have to do just that .     general  you make a demand i cannot meet  but  if in response  you and government support  you will be throwing away the future .  give me wile and eventually     various governments have heard that  eventually  from you for decades .  isn t it true  professor  that you say your psychohistory predicts that the junta is unstable  that my rule is unstable  that in a short time it will collapse .    seldon frowned .   the technique is not yet firm enough for me to say that this is something that psychohistory states .     i put it to you that psychohistory does state it and that this is common knowledge within your project .     no   said seldon warmly .   no such thing .  it is possible that some among us have interpreted some relationships to indicate that the junta may be an unstable form of government  but there are other relationships that may easily be interpreted to show it is stable .  that is the reason why we must continue our work .  at the present moment it is all too easy to use incomplete data and imperfect reasoning to reach any conclusion we wish .     but if you decide to present the conclusion that the government is unstable and say that psychohistory warrants it even if it does not actually do so will it not add to the instability .     it may very well do that  general .  and if we announced that the government is stable  it may well add to the stability .  i have had this very same discussion with emperor cleon on a number of occasions .  it is possible to use psychohistory as a tool to manipulate the emotions of the people and achieve short term effects .  in the long run  however  the predictions are quite likely to prove incomplete or downright erroneous and psychohistory will lose all its credibility and it will be as though it had never existed .     enough .  tell me straight out .  what do you think psychohistory shows about my government .     it shows  we think  that there are elements of instability in it  but we are not certain and cannot be certain exactly in what way this can be made worse or made better .     in other words  psychohistory simply tells you what you would know without psychohistory and it is that in which government has invested uncounted piles of credits .     the time will come when psychohistory will tell us what we could not know without it and then the investment will pay itself back many  many times over .     and how long will it be before that time comes .     not too long  i hope .  we have been making rather gratifying progress in the last few years .    tennar was tapping his fingernail on his desk again .   not enough .  tell me something helpful now .  something useful .    seldon pondered  then said   i can prepare a detailed report for you  but it will take time .     of course it will .  days  months  years and somehow it will never be written .  do you take me for a fool .     no  of course not  general .  however  i don t want to be taken for a fool  either .  i can tell you something that i will take sole responsibility for .  i have seen it in my psychohistorical research  but i may have misinterpreted what i saw .  however  since you insist     i insist .     you mentioned taxes a little while ago .  you said raising taxes was difficult .  certainly .  it is always difficult .  every government must do its work by collecting wealth in one form or another .  the only two ways in which such credits can be obtained are  first  by robbing a neighbor  or second  persuading a government s own citizens to grant the credits willingly and peaceably .    since we have established a galactic empire that has been conducting its business in reasonable fashion for thousands of years  there is no possibility of robbing a neighbor  except as the result of an occasional rebellion and its repression .  this does not happen often enough to support a government and  if it did  the government would be too unstable to last long  in any case .    seldon drew a deep breath and went on .   therefore  credits must be raised by asking the citizens to hand over part of their wealth for government use .  presumably  since the government will then work efficiently  the citizens can better spend their credits in this way than to hoard it each man to himself while living in a dangerous and chaotic anarchy .    however  though the request is reasonable and the citizenry is better off paying taxes as their price for maintaining a stable and efficient government  they are nevertheless reluctant to do so .  in order to overcome this reluctance  governments must make it appear that they are not taking too many credits  and that they are considering each citizen s rights and benefits .  in other words  they must lower the percentage taken out of low incomes  they must allow deductions of various kinds to be made before the tax is assessed  and so on .    as time goes on  the tax situation inevitably grows more and more complex as different worlds  different sectors within each world  and different economic divisions all demand and require special treatment .  me result is that the tax collecting branch of the government grows in size and complexity and tends to become uncontrollable .  the average citizen cannot understand why or how much he is being taxed  what he can get away with and what he can t .  the government and the tax agency itself are often in the dark as well .    what s more  an ever larger fraction of the funds collected must be put into running the overelaborate tax agency maintaining records  pursuing tax delinquents so the amount of credits available for good  end useful purposes declines despite anything we can do .    in the end  the tax situation becomes overwhelming .  it inspires discontent and rebellion .  the history books tend to ascribe these things to greedy businessmen  to corrupt politicians  to brutal warriors  to ambitious viceroys but these are just the individuals who take advantage of the tax overgrowth .    the general said harshly   are you telling me that our tax system is overcomplicated .    seldon said   if it were not  it would be the only one in history that wasn t  as far as i know .  if there is one thing that psychohistory tells me is inevitable  it is tax overgrowth .     and what do we do about it .     that i cannot tell you .  it is that for which i would like to prepare a report that as you say may take a while to get ready .     never mind the report .  the tax system is overcomplicated  isn t it .  isn t that what you are saying .     it is possible that it is   said seldon cautiously .    and to correct that  one must make the tax system simpler as simple as possible  in fact .     i would have to study     nonsense .  the opposite of great complication is great simplicity .  i don t need a report to tell me that .     as you say  general   said seldon .   at this point the general looked up suddenly  as though he had been called as  indeed  he had been .  his fists clenched and holovision images of colonel linn and dors venabili suddenly appeared in the room .   thunderstruck  seldon exclaimed   dors .  what are you doing here .    the general said nothing  but his brow furrowed into a frown .       the general had had a bad night and so  out of apprehension  had the colonel .  they faced each other now each at a loss .   the general said   tell me again what this woman did .    linn seemed to have a heavy weight on his shoulders .   she s the tiger woman .  that s what they call her .  she doesn t seem to be quite human  somehow .  she s some sort of impossibly trained athlete  full of self confidence  and  general  she s quite frightening .     did she frighten you .  a single woman .     let me tell you exactly what she did and let me tell you a few other things about her .  i don t know how true all the stories about her are  but what happened yesterday evening is true enough .    he told the story again and the general listened  puffing out his cheeks .    bad   he said .   what do we do .     i think our course is plain before us .  we want psychohistory     yes  we do   said the general .   seldon told me something about taxation that  but never mind .  that is beside the point at the moment .  go on .    linn  who  in his troubled state of mind  had allowed a small fragment of impatience to show on his face  continued   as i say  we want psychohistory without seldon .  he is  in any case  a used up man .  the more i study him  the more i see an elderly scholar who is living on his past deeds .  he has had nearly thirty years to make a success of psychohistory and he has failed .  without him  with new men at the helm  psychohistory may advance more rapidly .     yes  i agree .  now what about the woman .     well  there you are .  we haven t taken her into consideration because she has been careful to remain in the background .  but i strongly suspect now that it will be difficult  perhaps impossible  to remove seldon quietly and without implicating the government  as long as the woman remains alive .     do you really believe that she will mangle you and me if she thinks we have harmed her man .   said the general  his mouth twisting in contempt .    i really think she will and that she will start a rebellion as well .  it will he exactly as she promised .     you are turning into a coward .     general  please .  i am trying to be sensible .  i m not backing off .  we must take care of this tiger woman .   he paused thoughtfully .   as a matter of fact  my sources have told me this and i admit to having paid far too little attention to the matter .     and how do you think we can get rid of her .    linn said   i don t know .   then  more slowly   but someone else might .        seldon had had a bad night also  nor was the new day promising to be much better .  there weren t too many times when hari felt annoyed with dors .  but this time  he was very annoyed .   he said   what a foolish thing to do .  wasn t it enough that we were all staying at the dome s edge hotel .  that alone would have been sufficient to drive a paranoid ruler into thoughts of some sort of conspiracy .     how .  we were unarmed  hari .  it was a holiday affair  the final touch of your birthday celebration .  we posed no threat .     yes  but then you carried out your invasion of the palace grounds .  it was unforgivable .  you raced to the palace to interfere with my session with the general  when i had specifically and several times made it plain that i didn t want you there .  i had my own plans  you know .    dors said   your desires and your orders and your plans all take second place to your safety .  i was primarily concerned about that .     i was in no danger .     that is not something i can carelessly assume .  there have been two attempts on your life .  what makes you think there won t be a third .     the two attempts were made when i was first minister .  i was probably worth killing then .  who would want to kill an elderly mathematician .    dors said   that s exactly what i want to find out and that s what i want to stop .  i must begin by doing some questioning right here at the project .     no .  you will simply be upsetting my people .  leave them alone .     that s exactly what i can t do .  hari  my job is to protect you and for twenty eight years i ve been working at that .  you cannot stop me now .    something in the blaze of her eyes made it quite clear that  whatever seldon s desires or orders might be  dors intended to do as she pleased .   seldon s safety came first .        may i interrupt you  yugo .     of course  dors   said yugo amaryl with a large smile .   you are lover an interruption .  what can i do for you .     i am trying to find out a few things  yugo  and i wonder if you would humor me in this .     if i can .     you have something in the project called the prime radiant .  i hear it now and then .  hari speaks of it  so i imagine i know what it looks like when it is activated  but i have never actually seen it in operation .  i would like to .    amaryl looked uncomfortable .   actually the prime radiant is just about the most closely guarded part of the project and you aren t on the list of the members who have access .     i know that  but we ve known each other for twenty eight years     and you re hari s wife .  i suppose we can stretch a point .  we only have two full prime radiants .  there s one in hari s office and one here .  right there  in fact .    dors looked at the squat black cube on the central desk .  it looked utterly undistinguished .   is that it .     that s it .  it stores the equations that describe the future .     how do you get at those equations .    amaryl moved a contact and at once the room darkened and then came to life in a variegated glow .  all around dors were symbols  arrows  mathematical signs of one sort or another .  they seemed to be moving  spiraling  but when she focused her eyes on any particular portion  it seemed to be standing still .   she said   is that the future  then .     it may be   said amaryl  turning off the instrument .   i had it at full expansion so you could see the symbols .  without expansion  nothing is visible but patterns of light and dark .     and by studying those equations  you are able to judge what the future holds in store for us .     in theory .   the room was now back to its mundane appearance .   but there are two difficulties .     oh .  what are they .     to begin with  no human mind has created those equations directly .  we have merely spent decades programming more powerful computers and they have devised and stored the equations  but  of course  we don t know if they are valid and have meaning .  it depends entirely on how valid and meaningful the programming is in the first place .     they could be all wrong  then .     they could be .   amaryl rubbed his eyes and dors could not help thinking how old and tired he seemed to have grown in the last couple of years .  he was younger than hari by nearly a dozen years  but he seemed much older .    of course   amaryl went on in a rather weary voice   we hope that they aren t all wrong  but that s where the second difficulty comes in .  although hari and i have been testing and modifying them for decades  we can never be sure what the equations mean .  the computer has constructed them  so it is to be presumed they must mean something but what .  there are portions that we think we have worked out .  in fact  right now  i m working on what we call section a     a particularly knotty system of relationships .  we have not yet been able to match it with anything in the real universe .  still  each year sees us further advanced and i look forward confidently to the establishment of psychohistory as a legitimate and useful technique for dealing with the future .     how many people have access to these prime radiants .     every mathematician in the project has access but not at will .  there have to be applications and time allotted and the prime radiant has to be adjusted to the portion of the equations a mathematician wishes to refer to .  it gets a little complicated when everyone wants to use the prime radiant at the same time .  right now  things are slow  possibly because we re still in the aftermath of hari s birthday celebration .     is there any plan for constructing additional prime radiants .    amaryl thrust out his lips .   yes and no .  it would be very helpful if we had a third  but someone would have to be in charge of it .  it can t just be a community possession .  i have suggested to hari that tamwile elar you know him  i think     yes  i do .     that elar have a third prime radiant .  his achaotic equations and the electro clarifier he thought up make him clearly the third man in the project after hari and myself .  hari hesitates  however .     why .  do you know .     if elar gets one  he is openly recognized as the third man  over the head of other mathematicians who are older and who have more senior status in the project .  there might be some political difficulties  so to speak .  i think that we can t waste time in worrying about internal politics  but hari  well  you know hari .     yes  i know hari .  suppose i tell you that linn has seen the prime radiant .     linn .     colonel hender linn of the junta .  tennar s lackey .     i doubt that very much  dors .     he has spoken of spiraling equations and i have just seen them produced by the prime radiant .  i can t help but think he s been here and seen it working .    amaryl shook his head   i can t imagine anyone bringing a member of the junta into hari s office or mine .     tell me  who in the project do you think is capable of working with the junta in this fashion .     no one   said amaryl flatly and with clearly unlimited faith .   that would be unthinkable .  perhaps linn never saw the prime radiant but was merely told about it .     who would tell him about it .    amaryl thought a moment and said   no one .     well now  you talked about internal politics a while ago in connection with the possibility of elar having a third prime radiant .  i suppose in a project such as this one with hundreds of people  there are little feuds going on all the time frictions quarrels .     oh yes .  poor hari talks to me about it every once in a while .  he has to deal with them in one way or another and i can well imagine what a headache it must be for him .     are these feuds so bad that they interfere with the working of the project .     not seriously .     are there any people who are more quarrelsome than others or any duo draw more resentment than others .  in short  are there people you can get rid of and perhaps remove    percent of the friction at the cost of   or   percent of the personnel .    amaryl raised his eyebrows .   it sounds like a good idea  but i don t know whom to get rid of .  i don t really participate in all the minutiae of internal politics .  there s no way of stopping it  so for my part  i merely avoid it .     that s strange   said dors .   aren t you in this way denying any credibility to psychohistory .     in what way .     how can you pretend to reach a point where you can predict and guide the future  when you cannot analyze and correct something as homegrown as personal frictions in the very project that promises so much .    amaryl chuckled softly .  it was unusual  for he was not a man who was given to humor and laughter .   i m sorry  dors  but you picked on the one problem that we have solved  after a manner of speaking .  hari himself identified the equations that represented the difficulties of personal friction years ago and i myself then added the final touch last year .    i found that there were ways in which the equations could be changed so as to indicate a reduction in friction .  in every such case  however  a reduction in friction here meant an increase in friction there .  never at any time was there a total decrease or  for that matter  a total increase in the friction within a closed group that is  one in which no old members leave and no new members come in .  what i proved  with the help of elar s achaotic equations  was that this was true despite any conceivable action anyone could take .  hari calls it  the law of conservation of personal problems .     it gave rise to the notion that social dynamics has its conservation laws as physics does and that  in fact  it is these laws that offer us the best possible tools for solving the truly troublesome aspects of psychohistory .    dors said   rather impressive  but what if you end up finding that nothing at all can be changed  that everything that is bad is conserved  and that to save the empire from destruction is merely to increase destruction of another kind .     actually some have suggested that  but i don t believe it .     very well .  back to reality .  is there anything in the frictional problems within the project that threaten hari .  i mean  with physical harm .     harm hari .  of course not .  how can you suggest such a thing .     might there not be some who resent hari  for being too arrogant  too pushy  too self absorbed  too eager to grab all the credit .  or  if none of these things apply  might they not resent him simply because he has run the project for so long a time .     i never heard anyone say such a thing about hari .    dors seemed dissatisfied .   i doubt that anyone would say such things in your hearing  of course .  but thank you  yugo  for being so helpful and for giving me so much of your time .    amaryl stared after her as she left .  he felt vaguely troubled  but then returned to his work and let other matters drift away .       one way hari seldon had  out of not too many ways  for pulling away from his work for a time was to visit raych s apartment  just outside the university grounds .  to do this invariably filled him with love for his foster son .  there were ample grounds .  raych had been good  capable  and loyal but besides that was the strange quality raych had of inspiring trust and love in others .   hari had observed it when raych was a twelve year old street boy  who somehow pulled at his own and at dors s heartstrings .  he remembered how raych had affected rashelle  the onetime mayor of wye .  hari remembered how joranum had trusted raych  which led to his own destruction .  raych had even managed to win the heart of the beautiful manella .  hari did not completely understand this particular quality that raych embodied  but he enjoyed whatever contact he had with his foster son .   he entered the apartment with his usual  all well here .    raych put aside the holographic material he was working with and rose to greet him   all well  dad .     i don t hear wanda .     for good reason .  she s out shopping with her mother .    seldon seated himself and looked good humoredly at the chaos of reference material .   how s the book coming .     it s doing fine .  it s me who might not survive .   he sighed .   but for once  we ll get the straight poop on dahl .  nobody s ever written a book devoted to that section  wouldja believe .    seldon had always noted that  whenever raych talked of his home sector  his dahlite accent always strengthened .   raych said   and how are you  dad .  glad the festivities are over .     enormously .  i hated just about every minute of it .     not so anyone could notice .     listen  i had to wear a mask of sorts .  i didn t want to spoil the celebration for everyone else .     you must have hated it when mom chased after you onto the palace grounds .  everyone i know has been talking about that .     i certainly did hate it .  your mother  raych  is the most wonderful person in the world  but she is very difficult to handle .  she might have spoiled my plans .     what plans are those  dad .    seldon settled back .  it was always pleasant to speak to someone in whom he had total trust and who knew nothing about psychohistory .  more than once he had bounced thoughts off raych and had worked them out into more sensible forms than would have been the case if those same thoughts had been mulled over in his mind .  he said   are we shielded .     always .     good .  what i did was to set general tennar thinking along curious lines .     what lines .     well  i discussed taxation a bit and pointed out that  in the effort to make taxation rest evenly on the population  it grew more and more complex  unwieldy  and costly .  the obvious implication was that the tax system must be simplified .     that seems to make sense .     up to a point  but it is possible that  as a result of our little discussion  tennar may oversimplify .  you see  taxation loses effectiveness at both extremes .  overcomplicate it and people cannot understand it and pay for an overgrown and expensive tax organization .  oversimplify it and people consider it unfair and grow bitterly resentful .  the simplest tax is a poll tax  in which every individual pays the same amount  but the unfairness of treating rich and poor alike in this way is too evident to overlook .     and you didn t explain this to the general .     somehow  i didn t get a chance .     do you think the general will try a poll tax .     i think he will plan one .  if he does  the news is bound to leak out and that alone would suffice to set off riots and possibly upset the government .     and you ve done this on purpose  dad .     of course .    raych shook his head .   i don t quite understand you  dad .  in your personal life  you re as sweet and gentle as any person in the empire .  yet you can deliberately set up a situation in which there will be riots  suppression  deaths .  there ll be a lot of damage done  dad .  have you thought of that .    seldon leaned back in his chair and said sadly   i think of nothing else  raych .  when i first began my work on psychohistory  it seemed a purely academic piece of research to me .  it was something that could not he worked out at all  in all likelihood  and  if it was  it would not be something that could be practically applied .  but the decades pass and we know more and more and then comes the terrible urge to apply it .     so that people can die .     no  so that fewer people can die .  if our psychohistorical analyses are correct now  then the junta cannot survive for more than a few years and there are various alternative ways in which it can collapse .  they will all he fairly bloody and desperate .  this method the taxation gimmick should do it more smoothly and gently than any other if i repeat our analyses are correct .     if they re not correct  what then .     in that case  we don t know what might happen .  still  psychohistory must reach the point where it can be used and we ve been searching for years for something in which we have worked out the consequences with a certain assuredness and can find those consequences tolerable as compared with alternatives .  in a way  this taxation gimmick is the first great psychohistoric experiment .     i must admit  it sounds like a simple one .     it isn t .  you have no idea how complex psychohistory is .  nothing is simple .  the poll tax has been tried now and then throughout history .  it is never popular and it invariably gives rise to resistance of one form or another  but it almost never results in the violent overthrow of a government .  after all  the powers of governmental oppression may be too strong or there may be methods whereby the people can bring to bear their opposition in a peaceful manner and achieve redress .  if a poll tax were invariably or even just sometimes fatal  then no government would ever try it .  it is only because it isn t fatal that it is tried repeatedly .  the situation on trantor is  however  not exactly normal .  there are certain instabilities that seem clear in psychohistorical analysis  which make it seem that resentment will be particularly strong and repression particularly weak .    raych sounded dubious .   i hope it works  dad  but don t you think that the general will say that he was working under psychohistorical advice and bring you down with him .     i suppose he recorded our little session together  but if he publicizes that  it will show clearly that i urged him to wait till i could analyze the situation properly and prepare a report and he refused to wait .     and what does mom think of all this .    seldon said   i haven t discussed it with her .  she s off on another tangent altogether .     really .     yes .  she s trying to sniff out some deep conspiracy in the project aimed at me .  i imagine she thinks there are many people in the project who would like to get rid of me .   seldon sighed .   i m one of them  i think .  i would like to get rid of me as director of the project and leave the gathering responsibilities of psychohistory to others .    raych said   what s bugging mom is wanda s dream .  you know how mom feels about protecting you .  i ll bet even a dream about your dying would be enough to make her think of a murder conspiracy against you .     i certainly hope there isn t one .    and at the idea of it both men laughed .       the small electro clarification laboratory was  for some reason  maintained at a temperature somewhat lower than normal and dors venabili wondered idly why that might be .  she sat quietly  waiting for the one occupant of the lab to finish whatever it was she was doing .   dors eyed the woman carefully .  slim  with a long face .  not exactly attractive  with her thin lips and receding jawline  but a look of intelligence shone in her dark brown eyes .  the glowing nameplate on her desk said  cinda monay .   she turned to dors at last and said   my apologies  dr .  venabili  but there are some procedures that can t be interrupted even for the wife of the director .     i would have been disappointed in you if you had neglected the procedure on my behalf .  i have been told some excellent things about you .     that s always nice to hear .  who s been praising me .     quite a few   said dors .   i gather that you are one of the most prominent nonmathematicians in the project .    monay winced .   there s a certain tendency to divide the rest of us from the aristocracy of mathematics .  my own feeling is that  if i m prominent  then i m a prominent member of the project .  it makes no difference that i m a nonmathematician .     that certainly sounds reasonable to me .   how long have you been with the project .     two and a half years .  before that i was a graduate student in radiational physics at streeling and  while i was doing that  i served a couple of years with the project as an intern .     you ve done well at the project  i understand .     i ve been promoted twice  dr .  venabili .     have you encountered any difficulties here  dr .  monay .   whatever you say will be held confidential .     the work is difficult  of course  but if you mean  have i run into any social difficulties  the answer is no .  at least not any more than one would expect in any large and complex project  i imagine .     and by that you mean .     occasional spats and quarrels .  we re all human .     but nothing serious .    monay shook her head .   nothing serious .     my understanding  dr .  monay   said dors   is that you have been responsible for the development of a device important to the use of the prime radiant .  it makes it possible to cram much more information into the prime radiant .    monay broke into a radiant smile .   do you know about that .  yes  the electro clarifier .  after that was developed  professor seldon established this small laboratory and put me in charge of other work in that direction .     i m amazed that such an important advance did not bring you up into the higher echelons of the project .     oh well   said monay  looking a trifle embarrassed .   i don t want to take all the credit .  actually my work was only that of a technician a very skilled and creative technician  i like to think but there you are .     and who worked with you .     didn t you know .  it was tamwile elar .  he worked out the theory that made the device possible and i designed and built the actual instrument .     does that mean he took the credit  dr .  monay .     no no .  you mustn t think that .  dr .  elar is not that kind of man .  he gave me full credit for my share of the work .  in fact  it was his idea to call the device by our names both our names but he couldn t .     why not .     well  that s professor seldon s rule  you know .  all devices and equations are to be given functional names and not personal ones to avoid resentment .  so the device is just the electro clarifier .  when we re working together  however  he gives the device our names and  i tell you  dr .  venabili  it sounds grand .  perhaps someday  all of the project personnel will use the personal name .  i hope so .     i hope so  too   said dors politely .   you make elar sound like a very decent individual .     he is .  he is   said monay earnestly .   he is a delight to work for .  right now  i m working on a new version of the device  which is more powerful and which i don t quite understand .   i mean  what it s to be used for .  however  he s directing me there .     and are you making progress .     indeed .  in fact  i ve given dr .  elar a prototype  which he plans to test .  if it works out  we can proceed further .     it sounds good   agreed dors .   what do you think would happen if professor seldon were to resign as director of the project .  if he were to retire .    monay looked surprised .   is the professor planning to retire .     not that i know of .  i m presenting you with a hypothetical case .  suppose he retires .  who do you think would be a natural successor .  i think from what you have said that you would favor professor elar as the new director .     yes  i would   responded monay after a trifling hesitation .   he s far and away the most brilliant of the new people and i think he could run the project in the best possible way .  still  he s rather young .  there are a considerable number of old fossils well  you know what i mean who would resent being passed over by a young squirt .     is there any old fossil you re thinking of in particular .  remember  this is confidential .     quite a few of them  but there s dr .  amaryl .  he s the heir apparent .     yes  i see what you mean .   dors rose .   well  thank you so much for your help .  i ll let you return to your work now .    she left  thinking about the electro clarifier .  and about amaryl .       yugo amaryl said   here you are again  dors .     sorry  yugo .  i m bothering you twice this week .  actually you don t see anyone very often  do you .    amaryl said   i don t encourage people to visit me  no .  they tend to interrupt me and break my line of thought .   not you  dors .  you re altogether special  you and hari .  there s never a day i don t remember what you two have done for me .    dors waved her hand .   forget it  yugo .  you ve worked hard for hari and any trifling kindness we did for you has long been overpaid .  how is the project going .  hari never talks about it not to me  anyway .    amaryl s face lightened and his whole body seemed to take on an infusion of life .   very well .  very well .  it s difficult to talk about it without mathematics  but the progress we ve made in the last two years is amazing more than in all the time before that .  it s as though  after we ve been hammering away and hammering away  things have finally begun to break loose .     i ve been hearing that the new equations worked out by dr .  elar have helped the situation .     the achaotic equations .  yes .  enormously .     and the electro clarifier has been helpful  too .  i spoke to the woman who designed it .     cinda monay .     yes .  that s the one .     a very clever woman .  we re fortunate to have her .     tell me  yugo  you work at the prime radiant virtually all the time  don t you .     i m more or less constantly studying it .  yes .     and you study it with the electro clarifier .     certainly .     don t you ever think of taking a vacation  yugo .    amaryl looked at her owlishly  blinking slowly .   a vacation .     yes .  surely you ve heard the word .  you know what a vacation is .     why should i take a vacation .     because you seem dreadfully tired to me .     a little  now and then .  but i don t want to leave the work .     do you feel more tired now than you used to .     a little .  i m getting older  dors .     you re only forty nine .     that s still older than i ve ever been before .     well  let it go .  tell me  yugo just to change the subject .  how is hari doing at his work .  you ve been with him so long that no one could possibly know him better than you do .  not even i .  at least  as far as his work is concerned .     he s doing very well  dors .  i see no change in him .  he still has the quickest and brightest brain in the place .  age is having no effect on him  at least  not so far .     that s good to hear .  i m afraid that his own opinion of himself is not as high as yours is .  he s not taking his age well .  we had a difficult time getting him to celebrate his recent birthday .  were you at the festivities  by the way .  i didn t see you .     i attended part of the time .  but  you know  parties of that kind are not the sort of thing i feel at home with .     do you think hari is wearing out .  i m not referring to his mental brilliance .  i m referring to his physical capacities .  in your opinion  is he growing tired too tired to bear up under his responsibilities .    amaryl looked astonished .   i never gave it any thought .  i can t imagine him growing tired .     he may be  just the same .  i think he has the impulse  now and then  to give up his post and hand the task over to some younger man .    amaryl sat back in his chair and put down the graphic stylus he had been fiddling with ever since dors had entered .   what .  that s ridiculous .  impossible .     are you sure .     absolutely .  he certainly wouldn t consider such a thing without discussing it with me .  and he hasn t .     be reasonable  yugo .  hari is exhausted .  he tries not to show it  but he is .  what if he does decide to retire .  what would become of the project .  what would become of psychohistory .    amaryl s eyes narrowed .   are you joking  dors .     no .  i m just trying to look into the future .     surely  if hari retires  i succeed to the post .  he and i ran the project for years before anyone else joined us .  he and i .  no one else .  except for him  no one knows the project as i do .  i m amazed you don t take my succession for granted  dors .    dors said   there s no question in my mind or in anyone else s that you are the logical successor  but do you want to be .  you may know everything about psychohistory  but do you want to throw yourself into the politics and complexities of a large project and abandon much of your work in order to do so .  actually it s trying to keep everything moving smoothly that s been wearing hari down .  can you take on that part of the job .     yes  i can and it s not something i intend to discuss .   look here  dors .  did you come here to break the news that hari intends to ease me out .    dors said   certainly not .  how could you think that of hari .  have you ever known him to turn on a friend .     very well  then .  let s drop the subject .  really  dors  if you don t mind  there are things i must do .   abruptly he turned away from her and bent over his work once more .    of course .  i didn t mean to take up this much of your time .    dors left  frowning .       raych said   come in  mom .  the coast is clear .  i ve sent manella and wanda off somewhere .    dors entered  looked right and left out of sheer habit  and sat down in the nearest chair .    thanks   said dors .  for a while she simply sat there  looking as if the weight of the empire were on her shoulders .   raych waited  then said   i never got a chance to ask you about your wild trip into the palace grounds .  it isn t every guy who has a mom who can do that .     we re not talking about that  raych .     well then  tell me  you re not one for giving anything away by facial expressions  but you look sorta down .  why is that .     because i feel  as you say  sorta down .  in fact  i m in a bad mood because i have terribly important things on my mind and there s no use talking to your father about it .  he s the most wonderful man in the world  but he s very hard to handle .  there s no chance that he d take an interest in the dramatic .  he dismisses it all as my irrational fears for his life and my subsequent attempts to protect him .     come on  mom  you do seem to have irrational fears where dad s concerned .  if you ve got something dramatic in mind  it s probably all wrong .     thank you .  you sound just like he does and you leave me frustrated .  absolutely frustrated .     well then  unburden yourself  mom .  tell me what s on your mind .  from the beginning .     it starts with wanda s dream .     wanda s dream .  mom .  maybe you d better stop right now .  i know that dad won t want to listen if you start that way .  i mean  come on .  a little kid has a dream and you make a big deal of it .  that s ridiculous .     i don t think it was a dream  raych .  i think what she thought was a dream were two real people  talking about what she thought concerned the death of her grandfather .     that s a wild guess on your part .  what possible chance does this have of being true .     just suppose it is true .  the one phrase that remained with her was  lemonade death .   why should she dream that .  it s much more likely that she heard that and distorted the words she heard in which case  what were the undistorted words .     i can t tell you   said raych  his voice incredulous .   dors did not fail to catch that .   you think this is just my sick invention .  still  if i happen to be right  i might be at the start of unraveling a conspiracy against hari right here in the project .     are there conspiracies in the project .  that sounds as impossible to me as finding significance in a dream .     every large project is riddled with angers  frictions  jealousies of all sorts .     sure .  sure .  we re talking nasty words and faces and nose thumbing and tale bearing .  that s nothing at all like talking conspiracy .  it s not like talking about killing dad .     it s just a difference in degree .  a small difference maybe .     you ll never make dad believe that .  for that matter  you ll never make me believe that .   raych walked hastily across the room and back again   and you ve been trying to nose out this so called conspiracy  have you .    dors nodded .    and you ve failed .    dors nodded .    doesn t it occur to you that you ve failed because there is no conspiracy  mom .    dors shook her head .   i ve failed so far  but that doesn t shake my belief that one exists .  i have that feeling .    raych laughed .   you sound very ordinary  mom .  i would expect more from you than  i have that feeling .      there is one phrase that i think can be distorted into  lemonade .   that s  layman aided .       laymanayded .  what s that .     layman aided .  two words .  a layman is what the mathematicians at the project call nonmathematicians .     well .     suppose   interjected dors firmly   someone spoke of  laymanaided death   meaning that some way could be found to kill hari in which one or more nonmathematicians would play an essential role .  might that not have sounded to wanda like  lemonade death   considering that she had never heard the phrase  layman aided  any more than you did  but that she was extraordinarily fond of lemonade .     are you trying to tell me that there were people in dad s private office  of all places  how many people  by the way .     wanda  in describing her dream  says two .  my own feeling is that one of the two was none other than colonel hender linn of the junta and that he was being shown the prime radiant and that there must have been a discussion involving the elimination of hari .     you re getting wilder and wilder  mom .  colonel linn and another man in dad s office talking murder and not knowing that there was a little girl hidden in a chair  overhearing them .  is that it .     more or less .     in that case  if there is mention of laymen  then one of the people  presumably the one that isn t linn  must be a mathematician .     it would seem to be so .     that seems utterly impossible .  but even if it were true  which mathematician do you suppose might be in question .  there are at least fifty in ilic project .     i haven t questioned them all .  i ve questioned a few and some laymen  too  for that matter  but i have uncovered no leads .  of course  i can t be too open in my questions .     in short  no one you have interviewed has given you any lead on any dangerous conspiracy .     no .     i m not surprised .  they haven t done so  because     i know your  because   raych .  do you suppose people are going to break down and give away conspiracies under mild questioning .  i am in no position to try to beat the information out of anyone .  can you imagine what your father would say if i upset one of his precious mathematicians .    then  with a sudden change in the intonation of her voice  she said   raych  have you talked to yugo amaryl lately .     no  not recently .  he s not one of your sociable creatures  you know .  if you pulled the psychohistory out of him  he d collapse into a little pile of dry skin .    dors made a face at the picture and said   i ve talked to him twice recently and he seems to me to be a little withdrawn .  i don t mean just tired .  it is almost as though he s not aware of the world .     yes .  that s yugo .     is he getting worse lately .    raych thought awhile .   he might be .  he s getting older  you know .  we all are .   except you  mom .     would you say that yugo had crossed the line and become a little unstable  raych .     who .  yugo .  he has nothing to be unstable about .  or with .  just leave him at his psychohistory and he ll mumble quietly to himself for the rest of his life .     i don t think so .  there is something that interests him and very strongly  too .  that s the succession .     what succession .     i mentioned that someday your father might want to retire and it turns out that yugo is determined absolutely determined to be his successor .     i m not surprised .  i imagine that everyone agrees that yugo is the natural successor .  i m sure dad thinks so  too .     but he seemed to me to be not quite normal about it .  he thought i was coming to him to break the news that hari had shoved him aside in favor of someone else .  can you imagine anyone thinking that of hari .     it is surprising   raych interrupted himself and favored his mother with a long look .  he said   mom  are you getting ready to tell me that it might be yugo who s at the heart of this conspiracy you re speaking of .  that he wants to get rid of dad and take over .     is that entirely impossible .     yes  it is  mom .  entirely .  if there s anything wrong with yugo  it s overwork and nothing else .  staring at all those equations or whatever they are  all day and half the night  would drive anyone crazy .   dors rose to her feet with a jerk .   you re right .   raych  startled  said   what s the matter .    what you ve said .  it s given me an entirely new idea .  a crucial one  i think .   turning  without another word  she left .       dors venabili disapproved  as she said to hari seldon  you ve spent four days at the galactic library .  completely out of touch and again you managed to go without me .    husband and wife stared at each other s image on their holoscreens .  hari had just returned from a research trip to the galactic library in imperial sector .  he was calling dors from his project office to let her know he d returned to streeling .  even in anger  thought hari  dors is beautiful .  he wished he could reach out and touch her cheek .    dors   he began  a placating note in his voice   i did not go alone .  i had a number of people with me and the galactic library  of all places  is safe for scholars  even in these turbulent times .  i am going to have to be at the library more and more often  i think  as time goes on .     and you re going to continue to do it without telling me .     dors  i can t live according to these death filled views of yours .  nor rio i want you running after me and upsetting the librarians .  they re not the junta .  i need them and i don t want to make them angry .  but i do think that i we should take an apartment nearby .    dors looked grim  shook her head  and changed the subject .   do you know that i had two talks with yugo recently .     good .  i m glad you did .  he needs contact with the outside world .     yes  he does  because something s wrong with him .  he s not the   ugo we ve had with us all these years .  he s become vague  distant  and  oddly enough passionate on only one point  as nearly as i can tell his determination to succeed you on your retirement .     that would be natural if he survives me .     don t you expect him to survive you .     well  he s eleven years younger than i am  but the vicissitudes of circumstance     what you really mean is that you recognize that yugo is in a bad way .  he looks and acts older than you do  for all his younger age  and that seems to be a rather recent development .  is he ill .     physically .  i don t think so .  he has his periodic examinations .  i ll admit  though  that he seems drained .  i ve tried to persuade him to take a vacation for a few months a whole year s sabbatical  if he wishes .  i ve suggested that he leave trantor altogether  just so that he is as far away from the project as possible for a while .  there would be no problem in financing his stay on getorin which is a pleasant resort world not too many light years away .    dors shook her head impatiently .   and  of course  he won t .  i suggested a vacation to him and he acted as though he didn t know the meaning of the word .  he absolutely refused .     so what can we do .   said seldon .   dors said   we can think a little .  yugo worked for a quarter of a century on the project and seemed to maintain his strength without any trouble at all and now suddenly he has weakened .  it can t be age .  he s not yet fifty .     are you suggesting something .     yes .  how long have you and yugo been using this electro clarifier thing on your prime radiants .     about two years maybe a little more .     i presume that the electro clarifier is used by anyone who uses the prime radiant .     that s right .     which means yugo and you  mostly .     yes .     and yugo more than you .     yes .  yugo concentrates fiercely on the prime radiant and its equations .     unfortunately  have to spend much of my time on administrative duties .     and what effect does the electro clarifier have on the human body .    seldon looked surprised .   nothing of any significance that i am aware of .     in that case  explain something to me  hari .  the electro clarifier has been in operation for over two years and in that time you ve grown measurably more tired  crotchety  and a little out of touch .  why is that .     i m getting older  dors .     nonsense .  whoever told you that sixty is crystallized senility .  you re using your age as a crutch and a defense and i want you to stop it .  yugo  though he s younger  has been exposed to the electro clarifier more than you have and  as a result  he is more tired  more crotchety  and  in my opinion  a great deal less in touch than you are .  and he is rather childishly intense about the succession .  don t you see anything significant in this .     age and overwork .  that s significant .     no  it s the electro clarifier .  it s having a long term effect on the two of you .    after a pause  seldon said   i can t disprove that  dors  but i don t see how it s possible .  the electro clarifier is a device that produces an unusual electronic field  but it is still only a field of the type to which human beings are constantly exposed .  it can t do any unusual harm .   in any case  we can t give up its use .  there s no way of continuing the progress of the project without it .     now  hari  i must ask something of you and you must cooperate with me on this .  go nowhere outside the project without telling me and do nothing out of the ordinary without telling me .  do you understand .     dors  how can i agree to this .  you re trying to put me into a straitjacket .     it s just for a while .  a few days .  a week .     what s going to happen in a few days or a week .    dors said   trust me .  i will clear up everything .        hari seldon knocked gently with an old fashioned code and yugo amaryl looked up .   hari  how nice of you to drop around .     i should do it more often .  in the old days we were together all the time .  now there are hundreds of people to worry about here  there  and everywhere and they get between us .  have you heard the news .     what news .     the junta is going to set up a poll tax a nice substantial one .  it will be announced on trantorvision tomorrow .  it will be just trantor for now and the outer worlds will have to wait .  that s a little disappointing .  i had hoped it would be empire wide all at once  but apparently i didn t give the general enough credit for caution .    amaryl said   trantor will be enough .  the outer worlds will know that their turn will follow in not too long a time .     now we ll have to see what happens .     what will happen is that the shouting will start the instant the announcement is out and the riots will begin  even before the new tax goes into effect .     are you sure of it .    amaryl put his prime radiant into action at once and expanded the appropriate section .   see for yourself  hari .  i don t see how that can be misinterpreted and that s the prediction under the particular circumstances that now exist .  if it doesn t happen  it means that everything we ve worked out in psychohistory is wrong and i refuse to believe that .     i ll try to have courage   said seldon  smiling .  then  how do you feel lately  yugo .     well enough .  reasonably well .   and how are you  by the way .  i ve heard rumors that you re thinking of resigning .  even dors said something about that .     pay no attention to dors .  these days she s saying all sorts of things .   she has a bug in her head about some sort of danger permeating the project .     what kind of danger .     it s better not to ask .  she s just gone off on one of her tangents and  as always  that makes her uncontrollable .    amaryl said   see the advantage i have in being single .   then  in a lower voice   if you do resign  hari  what are your plans for the future .    seldon said   you ll take over .  what other plans can i possibly have .    and amaryl smiled .       in the small conference room in the main building  tamwile elar listened to dors venabili with a gathering look of confusion and anger on his face .  finally he burst out   impossible .    he rubbed his chin  then went on cautiously   i don t mean to offend you  dr .  venabili  but your suggestions are ridic  cannot be right .  i here s no way in which anyone can think that there are  in this psychohistory project  any feelings so deadly as to justify your suspicions .  i would certainly know if there were and i assure you there are not .  don t think it .     i do think it   said dors stubbornly   and i can find evidence for it .    elar said   i don t know how to say this without offense  dr .  venabili  but if a person is ingenious enough and intent enough on proving something  he or she can find all the evidence he or she wants or  at least  something he or she believes is evidence .     do you think i m paranoid .     i think that in your concern for the maestro something in which i   m with you all the way you re  shall we say  overheated .    dors paused and considered elar s statement .   at least you re right that a person with sufficient ingenuity can find evidence anywhere .  i can build a case against you  for instance .    elar s eyes widened as he stared at her in total astonishment .   against me .  i would like to hear what case you can possibly have against me .     very well .  you shall .  the birthday party was your idea  wasn t it .    elar said   i thought of it  yes  but i m sure others did  too .  with the maestro moaning about his advancing years  it seemed a natural way of cheering him up .     i m sure others may have thought of it  but it was you who actually pressed the issue and got my daughter in law fired up about it .  she took over the details and you persuaded her that it was possible to put together a really large celebration .  isn t that so .     i don t know if i had any influence on her  but even if i did  what s wrong with that .     in itself  nothing  but in setting up so large and widespread and prolonged a celebration  were we not advertising to the rather unstable and suspicious men of the junta that hari was too popular and might be a danger to them .     no one could possibly believe such a thing was in my mind .    dors said   i am merely pointing out the possibility .   in planning the birthday celebration  you insisted that the central offices be cleared out     temporarily .  for obvious reasons .      and insisted that they remain totally unoccupied for a while .  no work was done except by yugo amaryl during that time .     i didn t think it would hurt if the maestro had some rest in advance of the party .  surely you can t complain about that .     but it meant that you could consult with other people in the empty offices and do so in total privacy .  the offices are  of course  well shielded .     i did consult there with your daughter in law  with caterers  suppliers  and other tradesmen .  it was absolutely necessary  wouldn t you say .     and if one of those you consulted with was a member of the junta .    elar looked as though dors had hit him .   i resent that  dr .  venabili .  what do you take me for .    dors did not answer directly .  she said   you went on to talk to dr .  seldon about his forthcoming meeting with the general and urged him rather pressingly to let you take his place and run the risks that might follow .  the result was  of course  that dr .  seldon insisted rather vehemently on seeing the general himself  which one can argue was precisely what you wanted him to do .    elar emitted a short nervous laugh .   with all due respect  this does sound like paranoia  doctor .    dors pressed on .   and then  after the party  it was you  wasn t it  who was the first to suggest that a group of us go to the dome s edge hotel .     yes and i remember you saying it was a good idea .     might it not have been suggested in order to make the junta uneasy  as yet another example of hari s popularity .  and might it not have been arranged to tempt me into invading the palace grounds .     could i have stopped you .   said elar  his incredulity giving way to anger .   you had made up your own mind about that .    dors paid no attention .   and  of course  you hoped that by entering the palace grounds i might make sufficient trouble to turn the junta even further against hari .     but why  dr .  venabili .  why would i be doing this .     one might say it was to get rid of dr .  seldon and to succeed him as director of the project .     how can you possibly think this of me .  i can t believe you are serious .  you re just doing what you said you would at the start of this exercise just showing me what can be done by an ingenious mind intent on finding so called evidence .     let s turn to something else .  i said that you were in a position to use the empty rooms for private conversations and that you may have been there with a member of the junta .     that is not even worth a denial .     but you were overheard .  a little girl wandered into the room  curled up in a chair out of sight  and overheard your conversation .    elar frowned .   what did she hear .     she reported that two men were talking about death .  she was only a child and could not repeat anything in detail  but two words did impress her and they were  lemonade death .       now you seem to be changing from fantasy to if you ll excuse me  madness .  what can  lemonade death  mean and what would it have to do with me .     my first thought was to take it literally .  the girl in question is very fond of lemonade and there was a good deal of it at the party  but no one had poisoned it .     thanks for granting sanity that much .     then i realized the girl had heard something else  which her imperfect command of the language and her love of the beverage had perverted into  lemonade .      and have you invented a distortion .   elar snorted .    it did seem to me for a while that what she might have heard was hymen aided death .      what does that mean .     an assassination carried through by laymen by nonmathematicians .    dors stopped and frowned .  her hand clutched her chest .   elar said with sudden concern   is something wrong  dr .  venabili .     no   said dors  seeming to shake herself .   for a few moments she said nothing further and elar cleared his throat .  there was no sign of amusement on his face any longer  as he said   your comments  dr .  venabili  are growing steadily more ridiculous and well  i don t care if i do offend you  but i have grown tired of them .  shall we put an end to this .     we are almost at an end  dr .  elar .  layman aided may indeed be ridiculous  as you say .  i had decided that in my own mind  too .   you are  in part  responsible for the development of the electro clarifier  aren t you .    elar seemed to stand straighter as he said with a touch of pride   entirely responsible .     surely not entirely .  i understand it was designed by cinda monay .     a designer .  she followed my instructions .     a layman .  the electro clarifier is a layman aided device .    with suppressed violence elar said   i don t think i want to hear that phrase again .  once more  shall we put an end to this .    dors forged on  as if she hadn t heard his request .   though you give her no credit now  you gave cinda credit to her face to keep her working eagerly  i suppose .  she said you gave her credit and she was very grateful because of it .  she said you even called the device by her name and yours  though that s not the official name .     of course not .  it s the electro clarifier .     and she said she was designing improvements  intensifiers  and so on and that you had the prototype of an advanced version of the new device for testing .     what has all this to do with anything .     since dr .  seldon and dr .  amaryl have been working with the electro clarifier  both have in some ways deteriorated .  yugo  who works with it more  has also suffered more .     the electro clarifier can  in no way  do that kind of damage .    dors put her hand to her forehead and momentarily winced .  she said   and now you have a more intense electro clarifier that might do more damage  that might kill quickly  rather than slowly .     absolute nonsense .     now consider the name of the device  a name which  according to the woman who designed it  you are the only one to use .  i presume you called it the elar monay clarifier .     i don t ever recall using that phrase   said elar uneasily .    surely you did .  and the new intensified elar monay clarifies could he used to kill with no blame to be attached to anyone just a sad accident through a new and untried device .  it would be the  elar monay death  and a little girl heard it as  lemonade death .      dors s hand groped at her side .   elar said softly   you are not well  dr .  venabili .     i am perfectly well .  am i not correct .     look  it doesn t matter what you can twist into lemonade .  who knows what the little girl may have heard .  it all boils down to the deadliness of the electro clarifier .  bring me into court or before a scientific investigating board and let experts as many as you like   check the effect of the electro clarifier  even the new intensified one  on human beings .  they will find it has no measurable effect .     i don t believe that   muttered venabili .  her hands were now at her forehead and her eyes were closed .  she swayed slightly .   elar said   it is clear that you are not well  dr .  venabili .  perhaps that means it is my turn to talk .  may i .    dors s eyes opened and she simply stared .    i ll take your silence for consent  doctor .  of what use would it be for me to try to to get rid of dr .  seldon and dr .  amaryl in order to take my place as director .  you would prevent any attempt i made at assassination  as you now think you are doing .  in the unlikely case that i succeeded in such a project and was rid of the two great men  you would tear me to pieces afterward .  you re a very unusual woman strong and post beyond belief and while you are alive  the maestro is safe .     yes   said dors  glowering .    i told this to the men of the junta .   why should they not consult me on matters involving the project .  they are very interested in psychohistory  as well they ought to be .  it was difficult for them to believe what i told them about you until you made your foray into the palace grounds .  that convinced them  you can be sure  and they agreed with my plan .     aha .  now we come to it   dors said weakly .    i told you the electro clarifier cannot harm human beings .  it cannot .  amaryl and your precious hari are just getting old  though you refuse to accept it .  so what .  they are fine perfectly human .  the electromagnetic field has no effect of any importance on organic materials .  of course  it may have adverse effects on sensitive electromagnetic machinery and  if we could imagine a human being built of metal and electronics  it might have an effect on it .  legends tell us of such artificial human beings .  the mycogenians have based their religion on them and they call such beings  robots .   if there were such a thing as a robot  one would imagine it would be stronger and faster by far than an ordinary human being  that it would have properties  in fact  resembling those you have  dr .  venabili .  and such a robot could  indeed  be stopped  hurt  even destroyed by an intense electro clarifier  such as the one that i have here  one that has been operating at low energy since we began our conversation .  that is why you are feeling ill  dr .  venabili and for the first time in your existence  i m sure .    dors said nothing  merely stared at the man .  slowly she sank into a chair .   elar smiled and went on   of course  with you taken care of  there will be no problem with the maestro and with amaryl .  the maestro  in fact  without you  may fade out at once and resign in grief  while amaryl is merely a child in his mind .  in all likelihood  neither will have to be killed .  how does it feel  dr .  venabili  to be unmasked after all these years .  i must admit  you were very good at concealing your true nature .  it s almost surprising that no one else discovered the truth before now .  but then  i am a brilliant mathematician an observer  a thinker  a deducer .  even i would not have figured it out were it not for your fanatical devotion to the maestro and the occasional bursts of superhuman power you seemed to summon at will when he was threatened .    say good bye  dr .  venabili .  all i have to do now is to turn the device to full power and you will be history .    dors seemed to collect herself and rose slowly from her seat  mumbling   i may be better shielded than you think .   then  with a grunt  she threw herself at elar .   elar  his eyes widening  shrieked and reeled back .   then dors was on him  her hand flashing .  its side struck elar s neck  smashing the vertebrae and shattering the nerve cord .  he fell dead on the floor .   dors straightened with an effort and staggered toward the door .  she had to find hari .  he had to know what had happened .       hari seldon rose from his seat in horror .  he had never seen dors look so  her face twisted  her body canted  staggering as though she were drunk .    dors .  what happened .  what s wrong .    he ran to her and grasped her around the waist  even as her body gave way and collapsed in his arms .  he lifted her  she weighed more than  m ordinary woman her size would have  but seldon was unaware of that  it the moment  and placed her on the couch .    what happened .   he said .   she told him  gasping  her voice breaking now and then  while he cradled her head and tried to force himself to believe what was happening .    elar is dead   she said .   i finally killed a human being .   first time .  makes it worse .     how badly are you damaged  dors .     badly .  elar turned on his device full when i rushed him .     you can be readjusted .     how .  there s no one on trantor who knows how .  i need i daneel .    daneel .  demerzel .  somehow  deep inside  hari had always known .  his friend a robot had provided him with a protector a robot to ensure that psychohistory and the seeds of the foundations were given a chance to take root .  the only problem was  hari had fallen in love with his protector a robot .  it all made sense now .  all the nagging doubts and the questions could be answered .  and somehow  it didn t matter one bit .  all that mattered was dors .    we can t let this happen .     it must .   dors s eyes fluttered open and looked at seldon .   must .  tried to save you  but missed vital point who will protect you now .    seldon couldn t see her clearly .  there was something wrong with his eyes .   don t worry about me  dors .  it s you  it s you     no .  you  hari .  tell manella manella i forgive her now .  she did better than i .  explain to wanda .  you and raych take care of each other .     no no no   said seldon  rocking back and forth .   you can t do this .  hang on  dors .  please .  please  my love .    dors s head shook feebly and she smiled even more feebly .   goodbye  hari  my love .  remember always all you did for me .     i did nothing for you .     you loved me and your love made me human .    her eyes remained open  but dors had ceased functioning .   yugo amaryl came storming into seldon s office .   hari  the riots are beginning  sooner and harder even than exp    and then he stared at seldon and dors and whispered   what happened .    seldon looked up at him in agony .   riots .  what do i care about riots now .   what do i care about anything now .        part iv    wanda seldon      seldon  wanda   .   .   .  in the waning years of hari seldon s life  he grew most attached to  some say dependent upon  his granddaughter  wanda .  orphaned in her teens  wanda seldon devoted herself to her grandfather s psychohistory project  filling the vacancy left by yugo amaryl  .   .   .   .   the content of wanda seldon s work remains largely a mystery  for it was conducted in virtually total isolation .  the only individuals allowed access to wanda seldon s research were hari himself and a young man named stettin palver  whose descendant preem would four hundred years later contribute to the rebirth of trantor  as the planet rose from the ashes of the great sack      f . e .    .   although the full extent of wanda seldon s contribution to the foundation is unknown  it was undoubtedly of the greatest magnitude  .   .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       hari seldon walked into the galactic library  limping a little  as he did more and more often these days  and made for the banks of skitters  the little vehicles that slid their way along the interminable corridors of the building complex .   he was held up  however  by the sight of three men seated at one of the galactography alcoves  with the galactograph showing the galaxy in full three dimensional representation and  of course  its worlds slowly pinwheeling around its core  spinning at right angles to that as well .   from where seldon stood he could see that the border province of anacreon was marked off in glowing red .  it skirted the edge of the galaxy and took up a great volume  but it was sparsely populated with stars .  anacreon was not remarkable for either wealth or culture but was remarkable for its distance from trantor  ten thousand parsecs away .   seldon acting on impulse  took a seat at a computer console near the three and set up a random search he was sure would take an indefinite period .  some instinct told him that such an intense interest in anacreon must be political in nature its position in the galaxy made it one of the least secure holdings of the current imperial regime .  his eyes remained on his screen  but seldon s ears were open for the discussion near him .  one didn t usually hear political discussions in the library .  they were  in point of fact  not supposed to take place .   seldon did not know any of the three men .  that was not entirely surprising .  there were habitues of the library  quite a few  and seldon knew most of them by sight and some even to talk to but the library was open to all citizens .  no qualifications .  anyone could enter and use its facilities .   for a limited period of time  of course .  only a select few  like seldon were allowed to  set up shop  in the library .  seldon had i uen granted the use of a locked private office and complete access to library resources .    one of the men  seldon thought of him as hook nose  for obvious reasons  spoke in a low urgent voice .    let it go   he said .   let it go .  it s costing us a mint to try to hold on and  even if we do  it will only be while they re there .  they can t stay there forever and  as soon as they leave  the situation will revert to what it was .    seldon knew what they were talking about .  the news had come over trantorvision only three days ago that the imperial government had decided on a show of force to bring the obstreperous governor of anacreon into line .  seldon s own psychohistorical analysis had shown him that it was a useless procedure  but the government did not generally listen when its emotions were stirred .  seldon smiled slightly and grimly at hearing hook nose say what he himself had said and the young man said it without the benefit of any knowledge of psychohistory .   hook nose went on .   if we leave anacreon alone  what do we lose .  it s still there  right where it always was  right at the edge of the empire .  it can t pick up and go to andromeda  can it .  so it still has to trade with us and life continues .  what s the difference if they salute the emperor or not .  you ll never be able to tell the difference .    the second man  whom seldon had labeled baldy  for even more obvious reasons  said   except this whole business doesn t exist in a vacuum .  if anacreon goes  the other border provinces will go .  the empire will break up .     so what .   whispered hook nose fiercely .   the empire can t run itself effectively anymore  anyway .  it s too big .  let the border go and take care of itself if it can .  the inner worlds will be all the stronger and better off .  the border doesn t have to be ours politically  it will still be ours economically .    and now the third man  red cheeks  said   i wish you were right  but that s not the way it s going to work .  if the border provinces establish their independence  the first thing each will do will be to try to increase its power at the expense of its neighbors .  there ll be war and conflict and every one of the governors will dream of becoming emperor at last .  it will be like the old days before the kingdom of trantor a dark age that will last for thousands of years .    baldy said   surely things won t be that bad .  the empire may break up  but it will heal itself quickly when people find out that the breakup just means war and impoverishment .  they ll look back on the golden days of the intact empire and all will be well again .  we re not barbarians  you know .  we ll find a way .     absolutely   said hook nose .   we ve got to remember that the empire has faced crisis after crisis in its history and has pulled through time and again .    but red cheeks shook his head as he said   this is not just another crisis .  this is something much worse .  the empire has been deteriorating for generations .  ten years  worth of the junta destroyed the economy and since the fall of the junta and the rise of this new emperor  the empire has been so weak that the governors on the periphery don t have to do anything .  it s going to fall of its own weight .     and the allegiance to the emperor   began hook nose .    what allegiance .   said red cheeks .   we went for years without an emperor after cleon was assassinated and no one seemed to mind much .  and this new emperor is just a figurehead .  there s nothing he can do .  there s nothing anyone can do .  this isn t a crisis .  this is the end .     the other two stared at red cheeks  frowning .  baldy said   you really believe it .  you think that the imperial government will just sit there and let it all happen .     yes .  like you two  they won t believe it is happening .  that is  until it s too late .     what would you want them to do if they did believe it .   asked baldy .   red cheeks stared into the galactograph  as if he might find an answer there .   i don t know .  look  in due course of time i ll die  things won t be too bad by then .  afterward  as the situation gets worse  other people can worry about it .  i ll be gone .  and so will the good old days .  maybe forever .  i m not the only one who thinks this  by the way .  ever hear of someone named hari seldon .     sure   said hook nose at once .   wasn t he first minister under cleon .     yes   said red cheeks .   he s some sort of scientist .  i heard him give a talk a few months back .  it felt good to know i m not the only one who believes the empire is falling apart .  he said     and he said everything s going to pot and there s going to be a permanent dark age .   baldy interjected .    well no   said red cheeks .   he s one of these real cautious types .  ire says it might happen  but he s wrong .  it will happen .    seldon had heard enough .  he limped toward the table where the three men sat and touched red cheeks on the shoulder .    sir   he said   may i speak to you for a moment .    startled  red cheeks looked up and then he said   hey  aren t you professor seldon .     i always have been   said seldon .  he handed the man a reference tile bearing his photograph .   i would like to see you here in my library office at   p . m .   day after tomorrow .  can you manage that .     i have to work .     call in sick if you have to .  it s important .     well  i m not sure  sir .     do it   said seldon .   if you get into any sort of trouble over it  i ll straighten it out .  and meanwhile  gentlemen  do you mind if i study the galaxy simulation for a moment .  it s been a long time since i ve looked at one .    they nodded mutely  apparently abashed at being in the presence of a former first minister .  one by one the men stepped back and allowed seldon access to the galactograph controls .   seldon s finger reached out to the controls and the red that had marked off the province of anacreon vanished .  the galaxy was unmarked  a glowing pinwheel of mist brightening into the spherical glow at the center  behind which was the galactic black hole .   individual stars could not be made out  of course  unless the view were magnified  but then only one portion or another of the galaxy would be shown on the screen and seldon wanted to see the whole thing  to get a look at the empire that was vanishing .   he pushed a contact and a series of yellow dots appeared on the galactic image .  they represented the habitable planets twenty five million of them .  they could be distinguished as individual dots in the thin fog that represented the outskirts of the galaxy  but they were more and more thickly placed as one moved in toward the center .  there was a belt of what seemed solid yellow  but which would separate into individual dots under magnification  around the central glow .  the central glow itself remained white and unmarked  of course .  no habitable planets could exist in the midst of the turbulent energies of the core .   despite the great density of yellow  not one star in ten thousand  seldon knew  had a habitable planet circling it .  this was true  despite the planet molding and terraforming capacities of humanity .  not all the molding in the galaxy could make most of the worlds into anything a human being could walk on in comfort and without the protection of a spacesuit .   seldon closed another contact .  the yellow dots disappeared  but one tiny region glowed blue  trantor and the various worlds directly dependent on it .  as close as it could be to the central core and yet remaining insulated from its deadliness  it was commonly viewed as being located at the  center of the galaxy   which it wasn t not truly .  as usual  one had to be impressed by the smallness of the world of trantor  a tiny place in the vast realm of the galaxy  but within it was squeezed the largest concentration of wealth  culture  and governmental authority that humanity had ever seen .   and even that was doomed to destruction .   it was almost as though the men could read his mind or perhaps they interpreted the sad expression on his face .   baldy asked softly   is the empire really going to be destroyed .    seldon replied  softer still   it might .  it might .  anything might happen .    he rose  smiled at the men  and left  but in his thoughts he screamed  it will .  it will .      seldon sighed as he climbed into one of the skitters that were ranked side by side in the large alcove .  there had been a time  just a few years ago  when he had gloried in walking briskly along the interminable corridors of the library  telling himself that even though he was past sixty he could manage it .   but now  at seventy  his legs gave way all too quickly and he had to take a skitter .  younger men took them all the time because skitters saved them trouble  but seldon did it because he had to and that made all the difference .   after seldon punched in the destination  he closed a contact and the skitter lifted a fraction of an inch above the floor .  off it went at a rather casual pace  very smoothly  very silently  and seldon leaned back and watched the corridor walls  the other skitters  the occasional walkers .   he passed a number of librarians and  even after all these years  he still smiled when he saw them .  they were the oldest guild in the empire  the one with the most revered traditions  and they clung to ways that were more appropriate centuries before maybe millennia before .   their garments were silky and off white and were loose enough to be almost gownlike  coming together at the neck and billowing out from there .   trantor  like all the worlds  oscillated  where the males were concerned  between facial hair and smoothness .  the people of trantor itself  or at least most of its sectors were smooth shaven and had been smooth shaven for as far back as he knew excepting such anomalies as the mustaches worn by dahlites  such as his own foster son  raych .   the librarians  however  clung to the beards of long ago .  every librarian had a rather short neatly cultivated beard running from ear to ear but leaving bare the upper lip .  that alone was enough to mark them for what they were and to make the smooth shaven seldon feel a little uncomfortable when surrounded by a crowd of them .   actually the most characteristic thing of all was the cap each wore  perhaps even when asleep  seldon thought  .  square  it was made of a velvety material  in four parts that came together with a button at the top .  the caps came in an endless variety of colors and apparently each color had significance .  if you were familiar with librarian lore  you could tell a particular librarian s length of service  area of expertise  grades of accomplishment  and so on .  they helped fix a pecking order .  every librarian could  by a glance at another s hat  tell whether to be respectful  and to what degree  or overbearing  and to what degree  .   the galactic library was the largest single structure on trantor  possibly in the galaxy   much larger than even the imperial palace  and it had once gleamed and glittered  as though boasting of its size and magnificence .  however  like the empire itself  it had faded and withered .  it was like an old dowager still wearing the jewels of her youth but upon a body that was wrinkled and wattled .   the skitter stopped in front of the ornate doorway of the chief librarian s office and seldon climbed out .   las zenow smiled as he greeted seldon .   welcome  my friend   he said in his high pitched voice .   seldon wondered if he had ever sung tenor in his younger days but had never dared to ask .  the chief librarian was a compound of dignity always and the question might have seemed offensive .     greetings   said seldon .  zenow had a gray beard  rather more than halfway to white  and he wore a pure white hat .  seldon understood that without any explanation .  it was a case of reverse ostentation .  the total absence of color represented the highest peak of position .   zenow rubbed his hands with what seemed to be an inner glee .   i ve called you in  hari  because i ve got good news for you .   we ve found it .    by  it   las  you mean     a suitable world .  you wanted one far out .  i think we ve located the ideal one .   his smile broadened .   you just leave it to the library .  hari .  we can find anything .     i have no doubt  las .  tell me about this world .     well  let me show you its location first .   a section of the wall slid aside  the lights in the room dimmed  and the galaxy appeared in three dimensional form  turning slowly .  again  red lines marked off the province of anacreon  so that seldon could almost swear that the episode with the three men had been a rehearsal for this .   and then a brilliant blue dot appeared at the far end of the province .   there it is   said zenow .   it s an ideal world .  sizable  well watered  good oxygen atmosphere  vegetation  of course .  a great deal of sea life .  it s there just for the taking .  no planet molding or terraforming required  or  at least  none that cannot be done while it is actually occupied .    seldon said   is it an unoccupied world  las .     absolutely unoccupied .  no one on it .     but why if it s so suitable .  i presume that  if you have all the details about it  it must have been explored .  why wasn t it colonized .     it was explored  but only by unmanned probes .  and there was no colonization presumably because it was so far from everything .  the planet revolves around a star that is farther from the central black hole than that of any inhabited planet farther by far .  too far  i suppose  for prospective colonists  but i think not too far for you .  you said   the farther  the better .       yes   said seldon  nodding .   i still say so .  does it have a name or is there just a letter number combination .     believe it or not  it has a name .  those who sent out the probes named it terminus  an archaic word meaning  the end of the line .   which it would seem to be .    seldon said   is the world part of the territory of the province of anacreon .     not really   said zenow .   if you ll study the red line and the red shading  you will see that the blue dot of terminus lies slightly outside it  fifty light years outside it  in fact .  terminus belongs to nobody  it s not even part of the empire  as a matter of fact .     you re right  then  las .  it does seem like the ideal world i ve been looking for .     of course   said zenow thoughtfully   once you occupy terminus  i imagine the governor of anacreon will claim it as being under his jurisdiction .     that s possible   said seldon   but we ll have to deal with that when   he matter comes up .    zenow rubbed his hands again .   what a glorious conception .  setting up a huge project on a brand new world  far away and entirely isolated  so that year by year and decade by decade a huge encyclopedia of all human knowledge can be put together .  an epitome of what is present in this library .  if i were only younger  i would love to join the expedition .    seldon said sadly   you re almost twenty years younger than i am .    almost everyone is far younger than i am  he thought  even more sadly .    zenow said   ah yes  i heard that you just passed your seventieth birthday .  i hope you enjoyed it and celebrated appropriately .    seldon stirred .   i don t celebrate my birthdays .     oh  but you did .  i remember the famous story of your sixtieth birthday .    seldon felt the pain  as deeply as though the dearest loss in all the world had taken place the day before .   please don t talk about it   he said .   abashed  zenow said   i m sorry .  we ll talk about something else .  if  indeed  terminus is the world you want  i imagine that your work on the preliminaries to the encyclopedia project will be redoubled .  as you know  the library will be glad to help you in all respects .     i m aware of it  las  and i am endlessly grateful .  we will  indeed  keep working .    he rose  not yet able to smile after the sharp pang induced by the reference to his birthday celebration of ten years back .  he said   so i must go to continue my labors .    and as he left  he felt  as always  a pang of conscience over the deceit he was practicing .  las zenow did not have the slightest idea of seldon s true intentions .      hari seldon surveyed the comfortable suite that had been his personal office at the galactic library these past few years .  it  like the rest of the library  had a vague air of decay about it  a kind of weariness something that had been too long in one place .  and yet seldon knew it might remain here  in the same place  for centuries more with judicious rebuildings for millennia even .   how did he come to be here .   over and over again  he felt the past in his mind  ran his mental tendrils along the line of development of his life .  it was part of growing older  no doubt .  there was so much more in the past  so much less in the future  that the mind turned away from the looming shadow ahead to contemplate the safety of what had gone before .   in his case  though  there was that change .  for over thirty years psychohistory had developed in what might almost be considered a straight line progress creepingly slow but moving straight ahead .  then six years ago there had been a right angled turn totally unexpected .   and seldon know exactly how it had happened  how a concatenation of events came together to make it possible .   it was wanda  of course  seldon s granddaughter .  hari closed his eyes and settled into his chair to review the events of six years before .   twelve year old wanda was bereft .  her mother  manella  had had another child  another little girl  bellis  and for a time the new baby was a total preoccupation .   her father  raych  having finished his book on his home sector of dahl  found it to be a minor success and himself a minor celebrity .  he was called upon to talk on the subject  something he accepted with alacrity  for he was fiercely absorbed in the subject and  as he said to hari with a grin   when i talk about dahl  i don t have to hide my dahlite accent .  in fact  the public expects it of me .    the net result  though  was that he was away from home a considerable amount of time and when he wasn t  it was the baby he wanted to see .   as for dors dors was gone and to hari seldon that wound was ever fresh  ever painful .  and he had reacted to it in an unfortunate manner .  it had been wanda s dream that had set in motion the current of events that had ended with the loss of dors .   wanda had had nothing to do with it seldon knew that very well .  and yet he found himself shrinking from her  so that he also failed her in the crisis brought about by the birth of the new baby .   and wanda wandered disconsolately to the one person who always seemed glad to see her  the one person she could always count on .  that was yugo amaryl  second only to hari seldon in the development of psychohistory and first in his absolute round the clock devotion to it .  hari had had dors and raych  but psychohistory was yugo s life  he had no wife and children .  yet whenever wanda came into his presence  something within him recognized her as a child and he dimly felt for just that moment a sense of loss that seemed to be assuaged only by showing the child affection .  to be sure  he tended to treat her as a rather undersized adult  but wanda seemed to like that .   it was six years ago that she had wandered into yugo s office .  yugo looked up at her with his owlish reconstituted eyes and  as usual  took a moment or two to recognize her .   then he said   why  it s my dear friend wanda .   but why do you look so sad .  surely an attractive young woman like you should never feel sad .    and wanda  her lower lip trembling  said   nobody loves me .     oh come  that s not true .     they just love that new baby .  they don t care about me anymore .     i love you  wanda .     well  you re the only one then  uncle yugo .   and even though she could no longer crawl onto his lap as she had when she was younger  she cradled her head on his shoulder and wept .   amaryl  totally unaware of what he should do  could only hug the girl and say   don t cry .  don t cry .   and out of sheer sympathy and because he had so little in his own life to weep about  he found that tears were trickling down his own cheeks as well .   and then he said with sudden energy   wanda  would you like to see something pretty .     what .   sniffled wanda .   amaryl knew only one thing in life and the universe that was pretty .  he said   did you ever see the prime radiant .     no .  what is it .     it s what your grandfather and i use to do our work .  see .  it s right here .    he pointed to the black cube on his desk and wanda looked at it woefully .   that s not pretty   she said .    not now   agreed amaryl .   but watch when i turn it on .    he did so .  the room darkened and filled with dots of light and flashes of different colors .   see .  now we can magnify it so all the dots become mathematical symbols .    and so they did .  there seemed a rush of material toward them and there  in the air  were signs of all sorts  letters  numbers  arrows  and shapes that wanda had never seen before .    isn t it pretty .   asked amaryl .    yes  it is   said wanda  staring carefully at the equations that  she didn t know  represented possible futures .   i don t like that part  though .  i think it s wrong .   she pointed at a colorful equation to her left .    wrong .  why do you say it s wrong  said amaryl  frowning .    because it s not  .   .   .  pretty .  i d do it a different way .    amaryl cleared his throat .   well  i ll try to fix it up .   and he moved closer to the equation in question  staring at it in his owlish fashion .   wanda said   thank you very much  uncle yugo  for showing me your pretty lights .  maybe someday i ll understand what they mean .     that s all right   said amaryl .   i hope you feel better .     a little  thanks   and  after flashing the briefest of smiles  she left the room .   amaryl stood there  feeling a trifle hurt .  he didn t like having the prime radiant s product criticized not even by a twelve year old girl who knew no better .   and as he stood there  he had no idea whatsoever that the psychohistorical revolution had begun .      that afternoon amaryl went to hari seldon s office at streeling university .  that in itself was unusual  for amaryl virtually never left his own office  even to speak with a colleague just down the hall .    hari   said amaryl  frowning and looking puzzled .   something very odd has happened .  very peculiar .    seldon looked at amaryl with deepest sorrow .  he was only fifty three  but he looked much older  bent  worn down to almost transparency .  when forced  he had undergone doctors  examinations and the doctors had all recommended that he leave his work for a period of time  some said permanently  and rest .  only this  the doctors said  might improve his health .  otherwise  seldon shook his head .   take him away from his work and he ll die all the sooner and unhappier .  we have no choice .    and then seldon realized that  lost in such thoughts  he was not hearing amaryl speak .   he said   i m sorry  yugo .  i m a little distracted .  begin again .    amaryl said   i m telling you that something very odd has happened .  very peculiar .     what is it  yugo .     it was wanda .  she came in to see me very sad  very upset .     why .     apparently it s the new baby .     oh yes   hari said with more than a trace of guilt in his voice .    so she said and cried on my shoulder i actually cried a bit  too  hari .  and then i thought i d cheer her up by showing her the prime radiant .   here amaryl hesitated  as if choosing his next words carefully .    go on  yugo .  what happened .     well  she stared at all the lights and i magnified a portion  actually section        .  you re acquainted with that .    seldon smiled .   no  yugo  i haven t memorized the equations quite as well as you have .     well  you should   said amaryl severely .   how can you do a good job if  but never mind that .  what i m trying to say is that wanda pointed to a part of it and said it was no good .  it wasn t pretty .      why not .  we all have our personal likes and dislikes .     yes  of course  but i brooded about it and i spent some time going over it and  hari  there was something wrong with it .  the programming was inexact and that area  the precise area to which wanda pointed  was no good .  and  really  it wasn t pretty .    seldon sat up rather stiffly  frowning .   let me get this straight  yugo .  she pointed to something at random  said it was no good  and she was right .     yes .  she pointed  but it wasn t at random  she was very deliberate .     but that s impossible .     but it happened .  i was there .     i m not saying it didn t happen .  i m saying it was just a wild coincidence .     is it .  do you think  with all your knowledge of psychohistory  you could take one glance at a new set of equations and tell me that one portion is no good .    seldon said   well then  yugo  how did you come to expand that particular portion of the equations .  what made you choose that piece for magnification .    amaryl shrugged .   that was coincidence if you like .  i just fiddled with the controls .     that couldn t be coincidence   muttered seldon .  for a few moments he was lost in thought  then he asked the question that pushed forward the psychohistorical revolution that wanda had begun .   he said   yugo  did you have any suspicions about those equations beforehand .  did you have any reason to believe there was something wrong with them .    amaryl fiddled with the sash of his unisuit and seemed embarrassed .   yes  i think i did .  you see     you think you did .     i know i did .  i seemed to recall when i was setting it up it s a new section  you know my fingers seemed to glitch on the programmer .  it looked all right then  but i guess i kept worrying about it inside .  i remember thinking it looked wrong  but i had other things to do and i just let it go .  but then when wanda happened to point to precisely the area i had been concerned about  i decided to check up on her otherwise i would just have let it go as a childish statement .     and you turned on that very fragment of the equations to show wanda .  as though it were haunting your unconscious mind .    amaryl shrugged .   who knows .     and just before that  you were very close together  hugging  both crying .    amaryl shrugged again  looking even more embarrassed .   seldon said   i think i know what happened  yugo .  wanda read your mind .    amaryl jumped  as though he had been bitten .   that s impossible .    slowly seldon said   i once knew someone who had unusual mental powers of that sort  and he thought sadly of eto demerzel or  as seldon had secretly known him  daneel   only he was somewhat more than human .  but his ability to read minds  to sense other people s thoughts  to persuade people to act in a certain way that was a mental ability .  i think  somehow  that perhaps wanda has that ability as well .     i can t believe it   said amaryl stubbornly .    i can   said seldon  but i don t know what to do about it .   dimly lie felt the rumblings of a revolution in psychohistorical research but only dimly .       dad   said raych with some concern   you look tired .     i dare say   said hari seldon   i feel tired .  but how are you .    raych was forty four now and his hair was beginning to show a bit of gray  but his mustache remained thick and dark and very dahlite in appearance .  seldon wondered if he touched it up with dye  but it would have been the wrong thing to ask .   seldon said   are you through with your lecturing for a while .     for a while .  not for long .  and i m glad to be home and see the baby and manella and wanda and you  dad .     thank you .  but i have news for you  raych .  no more lecturing .  i m going to need you here .    raych frowned .   what for .   on two different occasions he had been sent to carry out delicate missions  but those were back during the days of the joranumite menace .  as far as he knew  things were quiet now  especially with the overthrow of the junta and the reestablishment of a pale emperor .    it s wanda   said seldon .    wanda .  what s wrong with wanda .     nothing s wrong with her  but we re going to have to work out a complete genome for her and for you and manella as well and eventually for the new baby .     for bellis  too .  what s going on .    seldon hesitated .   raych  you know that your mother and i always thought there was something lovable about you  something that inspired affection and trust .     i know you thought so .  you said so often enough when you were trying to get me to do something difficult .  but i ll be honest with you .  i never felt it .     no  you won over me and  .   .   .  and dors .    he had such trouble saying the name  even though four years had passed since her destruction .    you won over rashelle of wye .  you won over jo jo joranum .  you won over manella .  how do you account for all that .     intelligence and charm   said raych  grinning .    have you thought you might have been in touch with their our minds .     no  i ve never thought that .  and now that you mention it  i think it s ridiculous .   with all due respect  dad  of course .     what if i told you that wanda seems to have read yugo s mind during a moment of crisis .     coincidence or imagination  i should say .     raych  i knew someone once who could handle people s minds as easily as you and i handle conversation .     who was that .     i can t speak of him .  take my word for it  though .     well   said raych dubiously .    i ve been at the galactic library  checking on such matters .  there is a curious story  about twenty thousand years old and therefore back to the misty origins of hyperspatial travel .  it s about a young woman  not much more than wanda s age  who could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun called nemesis .     surely a fairytale .     surely .  and incomplete  at that .  but the similarity with wanda is astonishing .    raych said   dad  what are you planning .     i m not sure  raych .  i need to know the genome and i have to find others like wanda .  i have a notion that youngsters are born not often but occasionally with such mental abilities  but that  in general  it merely gets them in trouble and they learn to mask it .  and as they grow tip  their ability  their talent  is buried deep within their minds sort of an unconscious act of self preservation .  surely in the empire or even just among trantor s forty billion  there must be more of that sort  like wanda  and if i know the genome i want  i can test those i think may be so .       and what would you do with them if you found them  dad .     i have the notion that they are what i need for the further development of psychohistory .    raych said   and wanda is the first of the type you know about and you intend to make a psychohistorian out of her .     perhaps .     like yugo .   dad  no .     why no .     because i want her to grow up like a normal girl and become a normal woman .  i will not have you sitting her before the prime radiant and make her into a living monument to psychohistorical mathematics .    seldon said   it may not come to that  raych  but we must have her genome .  you know that for thousands of years there have been suggestions that every human being have his genome on file .  it s only the expense that s kept it from becoming standard practice  no one doubts the usefulness of it .  surely you see the advantages .  if nothing else  we will know wanda s tendencies toward a variety of physiological disorders .  if we had ever had yugo s genome  i am certain he would not now be dying .  surely we can go that far .     well  maybe  dad  but no further .  i m willing to bet that manella is going to be a lot firmer on this than i am .    seldon said   very well .  but remember  no more lecture tours .  i need you at home .     we ll see   raych said and left .   seldon sat there in a quandary .  eto demerzel  the one person he knew who could handle minds  would have known what to do .  dors  with her nonhuman knowledge  might have known what to do .   for himself  he had a dim vision of a new psychohistory but nothing more than that .      it was not an easy task to obtain a complete genome of wanda .  to begin with  the number of biophysicists equipped to handle the genome was small and those that existed were always busy .   nor was it possible for seldon to discuss his needs openly  in order to interest the biophysicists .  it was absolutely essential  seldon felt  that the true reason for his interest in wanda s mental powers be kept secret from all the galaxy .   and if another difficulty was needed  it was the fact that the process was infernally expensive .   seldon shook his head and said to mian endelecki  the biophysicist he was now consulting   why so expensive  dr .  endelecki .  i am not an expert in the field  but it is my distinct understanding that the process is completely computerized and that  once you have a scraping of skin cells  the genome can be completely built and analyzed in a matter of days .     that s true .  but having a deoxyribonucleic acid molecule stretching out for billions of nucleotides  with every puring and pyrimidine in its place  is the least of it  the very least of it  professor seldon .  there is then the matter of studying each one and comparing it to some standard .    now  consider  in the first place  that although we have records of complete genomes  they represent a vanishingly small fraction of the number of genomes that exist  so that we don t really know how standard they are .    seldon asked   why so few .     a number of reasons .  the expense  for one thing .  few people are willing to spend the credits on it unless they have strong reason to think there is something wrong with their genome .  and if they have no strong reason  they are reluctant to undergo analysis for fear they will find something wrong .  now  then  are you sure you want your granddaughter genomed .     yes  i do .  it is terribly important .     why .  does she show signs of a metabolic anomaly .     no  she doesn t .  rather the reverse if i knew the antonym of  anomaly .   i consider her a most unusual person and i want to know just what it is that makes her unusual .     unusual in what way .     mentally  but it s impossible for me to go into details  since i don t entirely understand it .  maybe i will  once she is genomed .     how old is she .     twelve .  she ll soon be thirteen .     in that case  i ll need permission from her parents .    seldon cleared his throat .   that may be difficult to get .  i m her grandfather .  wouldn t my permission be enough .     for me  certainly .  but  you know  we re talking about the law .  i don   t wish to lose my license to practice .    it was necessary for seldon to approach raych again .  this  too  was difficult  as he protested once more that he and his wife  manella  wanted wanda to live a normal life of a normal girl .  what if her genome did turn out to be abnormal .  would she be whisked away to be prodded and probed like a laboratory specimen .  would hari  in his fanatical devotion to his psychohistory project  press wanda into a life of all work and no play  shutting her off from other young people her age .  but seldon was insistent .    trust me  raych .  i would never do anything to harm wanda .  but this must be done .  i need to know wanda s genome .  if it is as i suspect it is  we may be on the verge of altering the course of psychohistory  of the future of the galaxy itself .    and so raych was persuaded and somehow he obtained manella s consent  as well .  and together  the three adults took wanda to dr .  endelecki s office .   mian endelecki greeted them at the door .  her hair was a shining white  but her face showed no sign of age .   she looked at the girl  who walked in with a look of curiosity on her face but with no signs of apprehension or fear .  she then turned her gaze to the three adults who had accompanied wanda .   dr .  endelecki said with a smile   mother  father  and grandfather am i right .    seldon answered   absolutely right .    raych looked hang dog and manella  her face a little swollen and her eyes a little red  looked tired .    wanda   began the doctor .   that is your name  isn t it .     yes  ma am   said wanda in her clear voice .    i m going to tell you exactly what i m going to do with you .  you re right handed  i suppose .     yes  ma am .     very well  then  i ll spray a little patch on your left forearm with an anesthetic .  it will just feel like a cool wind .  nothing else .  i ll then scrape a little skin from you just a tiny bit .  there ll be no pain  no blood  no mark afterward .  when i m done  i ll spray a little disinfectant on it .  the whole thing will take just a few minutes .  does that sound all right to you .     sure   said wanda  as she held out her arm .   when it was over  dr .  endelecki said   i ll put the scraping under the microscope  choose a decent cell  and put my computerized gene analyzer to work .  it will mark off every last nucleotide  but there are billions of them .  it will probably take the better part of a day .  it s all automatic  of course  so i won t be sitting here watching it and there s no point in your doing so  either .    once the genome is prepared  it will take an even longer time to analyze it .  if you want a complete job  it may take a couple of weeks .  that is why it s so expensive a procedure .  the work is hard and long .  i ll call you in when i have it .   she turned away  as if she had dismissed the family  and busied herself with the gleaming apparatus on the table in front of her .   seldon said   if you come across anything unusual  will you get in touch with me instantly .  i mean  don t wait for a complete analysis if you find something in the first hour .  don t make me wait .     the chances of finding anything in the first hour are very slim  but i promise you  professor seldon that i will be in touch with you at once if it seems necessary .    manella snatched wanda s arm and led her off triumphantly .  raych followed  feet dragging .  seldon lingered and said   this is more important than you know  dr .  endelecki .    dr .  endelecki nodded as she said   whatever the reason  professor  i ll do my best .    seldon left  his lips pressed tightly together .  why he had thought that somehow the genome would be worked out in five minutes and that a glance at it in another five minutes would give him an answer  he did not know .  now he would have to wait for weeks  without knowing what would be found .   he ground his teeth .  would his newest brainchild  the second foundation  ever be established or was it an illusion that would remain always just out of reach .      hari seldon walked into dr .  endelecki s office  a nervous smile on his face .   he said   you said a couple of weeks  doctor .  it s been over a month mow .    dr .  endelecki nodded .   i m sorry  professor seldon but you wanted everything exact and that is what i have tried to do .     well .   the look of anxiety on seldon s face did not disappear .  what did you find .     a hundred or so defective genes .     what .  defective genes .  are you serious  doctor .     quite serious .  why not .  there are no genomes without at least a hundred defective genes  usually there are considerably more .  it s not as bad as it sounds  you know .     no  i don t know .  you re the expert  doctor  not i .    dr .  endelecki sighed and stirred in her chair .   you don t know anything about genetics  do you  professor .     no  i don t .  a man can t know everything .     you re perfectly right .  i know nothing about this what do you call it .  this psychohistory of yours .    dr .  endelecki shrugged  then continued .   if you wanted to explain anything about it  you would be forced to start from the beginning and i would probably not understand it even so .   now  as to genetics     well .     an imperfect gene usually means nothing .  there are imperfect genes so imperfect and so crucial that they produce terrible disorders .  these are very rare  though .  most imperfect genes simply don t work with absolute accuracy .  they re like wheels that are slightly out of balance .  a vehicle will move along  trembling a bit  but it will move along .     is that what wanda has .     yes .  more or less .  after all  if all genes were perfect  we would all look precisely the same  we would all behave precisely the same .  it s the difference in genes that makes for different people .     but won t it get worse as we grow older .     yes .  we all get worse as we grow older .  i noticed you limping when you came in .  why is that .     a touch of sciatica   muttered seldon .    did you have it all your life .     of course not .     well  some of your genes have gotten worse with time and now you limp .     and what will happen to wanda with time .     i don t know .  i can t predict the future  professor  i believe that is your province .  however  if i were to hazard a guess  i would say that nothing unusual will happen to wanda at least  genetically except the gathering of old age .    seldon said   are you sure .     you have to take my word for it .  you wanted to find out about wanda s genome and you ran the risk of discovering things perhaps it is better not to know .  but i tell you that  in my opinion  i can see nothing terrible happening to her .     the imperfect genes should we fix them .  can we fix them .     no .  in the first place  it would be very expensive .  secondly  the chances are that they would not stay fixed .  and finally  people are against it .    but why .     because they re against science in general .  you should know this as well as anyone  professor .  i m afraid the situation is such  especially since cleon s death  that mysticism has been gaining ground .  people don t believe in fixing genes scientifically .  they would rather cure things by the laying on of hands or by mumbo jumbo of some sort or other .  frankly it is extremely difficult for me to continue with my job .  very little funding is coming in .    seldon nodded .   actually i understand this situation all too well .  psychohistory explains it  but i honestly didn t think the situation was growing so bad so rapidly .  i ve been too involved in my own work to see the difficulties all around me .   he sighed .   i ve been watching the galactic empire slowly fall apart for over thirty years now and now that it s beginning to collapse much more rapidly  i don t see how we can stop it in time .     are you trying to .   dr .  endelecki seemed amused .    yes  i am .     lots of luck .   about your sciatica .  you know  fifty years ago it could have been cured .  not now  though .     why not .     well  the devices used for it are gone  the people who could have handled them are working on other things .  medicine is declining .     along with everything else   mused seldon .    but let s get back to wanda .  i feel she is a most unusual young woman with a brain that is different from most .  what do her genes tell you about her brain .    dr .  endelecki leaned back in her chair .   professor seldon do you know just how many genes are involved in brain function .     no .    i ll remind you that  of all the aspects of the human body  the brain junction is the most intricate .  in fact  as far as we know  there is nothing m the universe as intricate as the human brain .  so you won t be surprised when i tell you that there are thousands of genes that each play a i ale in brain function .     thousands .     exactly .  and it is impossible to go through those genes and see anything specifically unusual .  i will take your word for it  as far as wanda is concerned .  she is an unusual girl with an unusual brain  but i see nothing in her genes that can tell me anything about that brain except  of course  that it is normal .     could you find other people whose genes for mental functioning are like wanda s  that have the same brain pattern .     i doubt it very much .  even if another brain were much like hers  there would still be enormous differences in the genes .  no use looking for similarities .   tell me  professor  just what is it about wanda that makes you think her brain is so unusual .    seldon shook his head .   i m sorry .  it s not something i can discuss .     in that case  i am certain that i can find out nothing for you .  how did you discover that there was something unusual about her brain this thing you can t discuss .     accident   muttered seldon .   sheer accident .     in that case  you re going to have to find other brains like hers also by accident .  nothing else can be done .    silence settled over both of them .  finally seldon said   is there anything else you can tell me .     i m afraid not .  except that i ll send you my bill .    seldon rose with an effort .  his sciatica hurt him badly .   well then  thank you  doctor .  send the bill and i ll pay it .    hari seldon left the doctor s office  wondering just what he would do next .      like any intellectual  hari seldon had made use of the galactic library freely .  for the most part  it had been done long distance through computer  but occasionally he had visited it  more to get away from the pressures of the psychohistory project than for any other purpose .  and  for the past couple of years  since he had first formulated his plan to find others like wanda  he had kept a private office there  so he could have ready access to any of the library s vast collection of data .  he had even rented a small apartment in an adjacent sector under the dome so that he would be able to walk to the library when his ever increasing research there prevented him from returning to the streeling sector .   now  however  his plan had taken on new dimensions and he wanted to meet las zenow .  it was the first time he had ever met him face to face .   it was not easy to arrange a personal interview with the chief librarian of the galactic library .  his own perception of the nature and value of his office was high and it was frequently said that when the emperor wished to consult the chief librarian  even he had to visit the library himself and wait his turn .   seldon however  had no trouble .  zenow knew him well  though he had never seen hari seldon in person .   an honor  first minister   he said in greeting .   seldon smiled .   i trust you know that i have not held that post in sixteen years .     the honor of the title is still yours .  besides  sir  you were also instrumental in ridding us of the brutal rule of the junta .  the junta  on a number of occasions  violated the sacred rule of the neutrality of the library .     ah  thought seldon that accounts for the readiness with which he saw me .     merely rumor   he said aloud .    and now  tell me   said zenow  who could not resist a quick look at the time band on his wrist   what can i do for you .     chief librarian   began seldon  i have not come to ask anything easy of you .  what i want is more space at the library .  i want permission to bring in a number of my associates .  i want permission to undertake a long and elaborate program of the greatest importance .    las zenow s face drew into an expression of distress .   you ask a great deal .  can you explain the importance of all this .     yes .  the empire is in the process of disintegration .    there was a long pause .  then zenow said   i have heard of your research into psychohistory .  i have been told that your new science bears the promise of predicting the future .  is it psychohistorical predictions of which you are speaking .     no .  i have not yet reached the point in psychohistory where i can speak of the future with certainty .  but you don t need psychohistory to know that the empire is disintegrating .  you can see the evidence yourself .    zenow sighed .   my work here consumes me utterly  professor seldon .  i am a child when it comes to political and social matters .     you may  if you wish  consult the information contained in the library .  why look around this very office it is chock full of every conceivable sort of information from throughout the entire galactic empire .     i m the last to keep up with it all  i m afraid   zenow said  smiling sadly .   you know the old proverb  the shoemaker s child has no shoes .  it seems to me  though  that the empire is restored .  we have an emperor again .     in name only  chief librarian .  in most of the outlying provinces  the emperor s name is mentioned ritualistically now and then  but he plays no role in what they do .  the outer worlds control their own programs and  more important  they control the local armed forces  which are outside the grip of the emperor s authority .  if the emperor were to try to exert his authority anywhere outside the inner worlds  he would fail .  i doubt that it will take more than twenty years  at the outside  before some of the outer worlds declare their independence .    zenow sighed again .   if you are right  we live in worse times than the empire has ever seen .  but what has this to do with your desire for more office space and additional staff here in the library .     if the empire falls apart  the galactic library may not escape the general carnage .     oh  but it must   said zenow earnestly .   there have been bad times before and it has always been understood that the galactic library on trantor  as the repository of all human knowledge  must remain inviolate .  and so it will be in the future .     it may not be .  you said yourself that the junta violated its neutrality .       not seriously .     it might be more serious next time and we can t allow this repository of all human knowledge to be damaged .     how will your increased presence here prevent that .     it won t .  but the project i am interested in will .  i want to create a great encyclopedia  containing within it all the knowledge humanity will need to rebuild itself in case the worst happens an encyclopedia galactica  if you will .  we don t need everything the library has .  much of it is trivial .  the provincial libraries scattered over the galaxy may themselves be destroyed and  if not  all but the most local data is obtained by computerized connection with the galactic library in any case .  what i intend  then  is something that is entirely independent and that contains  in as concise a form as possible  the essential information humanity needs .     and if it  too  is destroyed .     i hope it will not be .  it is my intention to find a world far away on the outskirts of the galaxy  one where i can transfer my encyclopedists and where they can work in peace .  until such a place is found  however  i want the nucleus of the group to work here and to use the library facilities to decide what will be needed for the project .    zenow grimaced .   i see your point  professor seldon  but i m not sure that it can be done .     why not  chief librarian .     because being chief librarian does not make me an absolute monarch .  i have a rather large board a kind of legislature and please don t think that i can just push your encyclopedia project through .     i m astonished .     don t be .  i am not a popular chief librarian .  the board has been fighting  for some years now  for limited access to the library .  i have resisted .  it galls them that i have afforded you your small office space .     limited access .     exactly .  the idea is that if anyone needs information  he or she must communicate with a librarian and the librarian will get the information for the person .  the board does not wish people to enter the library freely and deal with the computers themselves .  they say that the expense required to keep the computers and other library equipment in shape is becoming prohibitive .     but that s impossible .  there s a millennial tradition of an open galactic library .     so there is  but in recent years  appropriations to the library have been cut several times and we simply don t have the funds we used to have .  it is becoming very difficult to keep our equipment up to the mark .    seldon rubbed his chin .   but if your appropriations are going down  i imagine you have to cut salaries and fire people or  at least  not hire new ones .     you are exactly right .     in which case  how will you manage to place new labors on a shrinking work force by asking your people to obtain all the information that the public will request .     the idea is that we won t find all the information that the public will request but only those pieces of information that we consider important .     so that not only will you abandon the open library but also the complete library .     i m afraid so .     i can t believe that any librarian would want this .     you don t know gennaro mummery  professor seldon .   at seldon s blank look  zenow continued .     who is he .   you wonder .  the leader of that portion of the board that wishes to close off the library .  more and more of the board are on his side .  if i let you and your colleagues into the library as an independent force  a number of board members who may not be on mummery s side but who are dead set against any control of any part of the library except by librarians may decide to vote with him .  and in that case  i will be forced to resign as chief librarian .     see here   said seldon with sudden energy .   all this business of possibly closing down the library  of making it less accessible  of refusing all information all this business of declining appropriations all this is itself a sign of imperial disintegration .  don t you agree .     if you put it that way  you may be right .     then let me talk to the board .  let me explain what the future may hold and what i wish to do .  perhaps i can persuade them  as i hope i ve persuaded you .    zenow thought for a moment .   i m willing to let you try  but you must know in advance that your plan may not work .     i ve got to take that chance .  please do whatever has to be done and let me know when and where i can meet the board .    seldon left zenow in a mood of unease .  everything he had told the chief librarian was true and trivial .  the real reason he needed the use of the library remained hidden .   partly this was because he didn t yet see that use clearly himself .      hari seldon sat at yugo amaryl s bedside patiently  sadly .  yugo was utterly spent .  he was beyond medical help  even if he would have consented to avail himself of such help  which he refused .   he was only fifty five .  seldon was himself sixty six and yet he was in fine shape  except for the twinge of sciatica or whatever it was that occasionally lamed him .   amaryl s eyes opened .   you re still here  hari .    seldon nodded .   i won t leave you .     till i die .     yes .   then  in an outburst of grief  he said   why have you done this  yugo .  if you had lived sensibly  you could have had twenty to thirty more years of life .    amaryl smiled faintly .   live sensibly .  you mean  take time off .  go to resorts .  amuse myself with trifles .     yes .  yes .     and i would either have longed to return to my work or i would have learned to like wasting my time and  in the additional twenty to thirty years you speak of  i would have accomplished no more .  look at you .     what about me .     for ten years you were first minister under cleon .  how much science did you do then .     i spent about a quarter of my time on psychohistory   said seldon gently .    you exaggerate .  if it hadn t been for me  plugging away  psychohistorical advance would have screeched to a halt .    seldon nodded .   you are right  yugo .  for that i am grateful .     and before and since  when you spend at least half your time on administrative duties  who does  did the real work .  eh .     you  yugo .     absolutely .   his eyes closed again .   seldon said   yet you always wanted to take over those administrative duties if you survived me .     no .  i wanted to head the project to keep it moving in the direction it had to move in  but i would have delegated all administration .    amaryl s breathing was growing stertorous  but then he stirred and his eyes opened  staring directly at hari .  he said   what will happen to psychohistory when i m gone .  have you thought of that .     yes  i have .  and i want to speak to you about it .  it may please you .  yugo  i believe that psychohistory is being revolutionized .    amaryl frowned slightly .   in what way .  i don t like the sound of that .     listen .  it was your idea .  years ago  you told me that two foundations should be established .  separate isolated and safe and arranged so that they would serve as nuclei for an eventual second galactic empire .  do you remember .  that was your idea .     the psychohistoric equations     i know .  they suggested it .  i m busy working on it now  yugo .  i ve managed to wangle an office in the galactic library     the galactic library .   amaryl s frown deepened .   i don t like diem .  a bunch of self satisfied idiots .     the chief librarian  las zenow  is not so bad  yugo .     did you ever meet a librarian named mummery  gennaro mummery .     no  but i ve heard of him .     a miserable human being .  we had an argument once when he claimed i had misplaced something or other .  i had done no such thing and i grew very annoyed  hari .  all of a sudden i was back in dahl .  one thing about the dahlite culture  hari  it is a cesspool of invective .  i used some of it on him and i told him he was interfering with psychohistory and he would go down in history as a villain .  i didn t just say  villain   either .   amaryl chuckled faintly .   i left him speechless .    suddenly seldon could see where mummery s animosity toward outsiders and  most probably  psychohistory must come from at least  in part but he said nothing .    the point is  yugo  you wanted two foundations  so that if one failed  the other would continue .  but we ve gone beyond that .     in what way .     do you remember that wanda was able to read your mind two years ago and see that something was wrong with a portion of the equations in the prime radiant .     yes  of course .     well  we will find others like wanda .  we will have one foundation that will consist largely of physical scientists  who will preserve the knowledge of humanity and serve as the nucleus for the second empire .  and there will be a second foundation of psychohistorians only mentalists  mind touching psychohistorians who will be able to work on psychohistory in a multiminded way  advancing it far more quickly than individual thinkers ever could .  they will serve as a group who will introduce fine adjustments as time goes on  you see .  ever in the background  watching .  they will be the empire s guardians .     wonderful .   said amaryl weakly .   wonderful .  you see how i ve chosen the right time to die .  there s nothing left for me to do .     don t say that  yugo .     don t make such a fuss over it  hari .  i m too tired to do anything .  thank you thank you for telling me  his voice was weakening    about the revolution .  it makes me happy happy hap    and those were yugo amaryl s last words .   seldon bent over the bed .  tears stung his eyes and rolled down his cheeks .   another old friend gone .  demerzel  cleon  dors  now yugo  .   .   .  leaving him emptier and lonelier as he grew old .   and the revolution that had allowed amaryl to die happy might never come to pass .  could he manage to make use of the galactic library .  could he find more people like wanda .  most of all  how long would it take .   seldon was sixty six .  if only he could have started this revolution at thirty two when he first came to trantor  .   .   .   .   now it might be too late .       gennaro mummery was making him wait .  it was a studied discourtesy  even insolence  but hari seldon remained calm .   after all  seldon needed mummery badly and for him to become angry with the librarian would only hurt himself .  mummery would  in fact  be delighted with an angry seldon .   so seldon kept his temper and waited and eventually mummery did walk in .  seldon had seen him before but only at a distance .  this was the first time they would be together alone .   mummery was short and plump  with a round face and a dark little beard .  he wore a smile on his face  but seldon suspected that smile of being a meaningless fixture .  it revealed yellowish teeth and mummery s inevitable hat was of a similar shade of yellow with a brown line snaking around it .   seldon felt a touch of nausea .  it seemed to him that he would dislike mummery  even if he had no reason to do so .   mummery said  without any preliminaries   well  professor  what can i do for you .   he looked at the time strip on the wall but made no apology for being late .   seldon said   i would like to ask you  sir  to put an end to your opposition to my remaining here at the library .    mummery spread his hands .   you ve been here for two years .  what opposition are you speaking of .     so far  that portion of the board represented by you and those who believe as you do have been unable to outvote the chief librarian  but there will be another meeting next month and las zenow tells me he is uncertain of the result .    mummery shrugged .   so am i uncertain .  your lease if we can call it that may well be renewed .     but i need more than that  librarian mummery .  i wish to bring in some colleagues .  the project in which i am engaged the establishment of what is needed in the way of the eventual preparation of a very special encyclopedia is not one i can do alone .     surely your colleagues can work wherever they please .  trantor is a large world .     we must work in the library .  i am an old man  sir  and i am in a hurry .     who can stay the advance of time .  i don t think the board will allow you to bring in colleagues .  the thin edge of the wedge  professor .     yes  indeed  thought seldon  but he said nothing .    mummery said   i have not been able to keep you out  professor .  not so far .  but i think i can continue to keep out your colleagues .    seldon realized that he was getting nowhere .  he opened the touch of frankness a notch .  he said   librarian mummery  surely your animosity toward me is not personal .  surely you understand the importance of the work i am doing .     you mean  your psychohistory .  come  you have been working on it for over thirty years .  what has come of it .     that s the point .  something may come of it now .     then let something come of it at streeling university .  why must it be at the galactic library .     librarian mummery .  listen to me .  what you want is to close the library to the public .  you wish to smash a long tradition .  have you the heart to do that .     it s not heart we need .  it s funding .  surely the chief librarian has wept on your shoulder in telling you our woes .  appropriations are down  salaries are cut  needed maintenance is absent .  what are we to do .  we ve got to cut services and we certainly can t afford to support you and your colleagues with offices and equipment .     has this situation been put to the emperor .     come  professor  you re dreaming .  isn t it true that your psychohistory tells you that the empire is deteriorating .  i ve heard you referred to as raven seldon  something that  i believe  refers to a fabled bird of ill omen .     it s true that we are entering bad times .     and do you believe the library is immune to those bad times .  professor  the library is my life and i want it to continue  but it won t continue unless we can find ways of making our dwindling appropriations do .   and you come here expecting an open library  with yourself as beneficiary .  it won t do  professor .  it just won t do .    seldon said desperately   what if i find the credits for you .     indeed .  how .     what if i talk to the emperor .  i was once first minister .  he ll see me and he ll listen to me .     and you ll get funding from him .   mummery laughed .    if i do  if i increase your appropriations  may i bring in my colleagues .     bring in the credits first   said mummery   and we ll see .  but i don t think you will succeed .    he seemed very sure of himself and seldon wondered how often and how uselessly the galactic library had already appealed to the emperor .   and whether his own appeal would get anywhere at all .       the emperor agis xiv had no real right to the name .  he had adopted it upon succeeding to the throne with the deliberate purpose of connecting himself with the agises who had ruled two thousand years ago  most of them quite ably particularly agis vi  who had ruled for forty two years and who had kept order in a prosperous empire with a firm but nontyrannical hand .   agis xiv did not look like any of the old agises if the holographic records had any value .  but  then again  truth be told  agis xiv did not look much like the official holograph that was distributed to the public .   as a matter of fact  hari seldon thought  with a twinge of nostalgia  that emperor cleon  for all his flaws and weaknesses  had certainly looked imperial .   agis xiv did not .  seldon had never seen him at close quarters and the few holographs he had seen were outrageously inaccurate .  the imperial holographer knew his job and did it well  thought seldon wryly .   agis xiv was short  with an unattractive face and slightly bulging eyes that did not seem alight with intelligence .  his only qualification for the throne was that he was a collateral relative of cleon .   to do him credit  however  he did not try to play the role of the mighty emperor .  it was understood that he rather liked to be called the  citizen emperor  and that only imperial protocol and the outraged outcry of the imperial guard prevented him from exiting the dome and wandering the walkways of trantor .  apparently  the story went  he wished to shake hands with the citizens and hear their complaints in person .    score one for him  thought seldon  even if it could never come to pass .    with a murmur and a bow  seldon said   i thank you  sire  for consenting to see me .    agis xiv had a clear and rather attractive voice  quite out of keeping with his appearance .  he said   an ex first minister must surely have his privileges  although i must give myself credit for amazing courage in agreeing to see you .    there was humor in his words and seldon found himself suddenly realizing that a man might not look intelligent and yet might be intelligent just the same .    courage  sire .     why  of course .  don t they call you raven seldon .     i heard the expression  sire  the other day for the first time .     apparently the reference is to your psychohistory  which seems to predict the fall of the empire .     it points out the possibility only  sire     so that you are coupled with a mythic bird of ill omen .  except that i think you yourself are the bird of ill omen .     i hope not  sire .     come  come .  the record is clear .  eto demerzel  cleon s old first minister  was impressed with your work and look what happened he was forced out of his position and into exile .  the emperor cleon himself was impressed with your work and look what happened he was assassinated .  the military junta was impressed with your work and look what happened they were swept away .  even the joranumites  it is said  were impressed with your work and  behold  they were destroyed .  and now  o raven seldon  you come to see me .  what may i expect .     why  nothing evil  sire .     i imagine not  because unlike all these others i have mentioned  i am not impressed with your work .  now tell me why you are here .    he listened carefully and without interruption while seldon explained the importance of setting up a project designed to prepare an encyclopedia that would preserve human learning if the worst happened .    yes yes   said agis xiv finally   so you are  indeed  convinced the empire will fall .     it is a strong possibility  sire  and it would not be prudent to refuse to take that possibility into account .  in a way  i wish to prevent it if i can  or ameliorate the effects if i can t .     raven seldon if you continue to poke your nose into matters  i am convinced that the empire will fall and that nothing can help it .     not so  sire .  i ask only permission to work .     oh  you have that  but i fail to see what it is you wish of me .  why have you told me all this about an encyclopedia .     because i wish to work in the galactic library  sire  or  more accurately  i wish others to work there with me .     i assure you that i won t stand in your way .     that is not enough  sire .  i want you to help .     in what way  ex first minister .     with funding .  the library must have appropriations or it will close its doors to the public and evict me .     credits .    a note of astonishment came into the emperor s voice .   you came to me for credits .     yes  sire .    agis xiv stood up in some agitation .  seldon stood up at once also  but agis waved him down .    sit down .  don t treat me as an emperor .  i m not an emperor .  i didn t want this job  but they made me take it .  i was the nearest thing to the imperial family and they jabbered at me that the empire needed an emperor .  so they have me and a lot of good i am to them .    credits .  you expect me to have credits .  you talk about the empire disintegrating .  how do you suppose it disintegrates .  are you thinking of rebellion .  of civil war .  of disorders here and there .    no .  think of credits .  do you realize that i cannot collect any taxes at all from half the provinces in the empire .  they re still part of the empire  hail the imperium .    all honor to the emperor  but they don t pay anything and i don t have the necessary force to collect it .  and if i can t get the credits out of them  they are not really part of the empire  are they .    credits .  the empire runs a chronic deficit of appalling proportions .   there s nothing i can pay for .  do you think there is enough funding to maintain the imperial palace grounds .  just barely .  i must cut corners .  i must let the palace decay .  i must let the number of retainers die down by attrition .    professor seldon .  if you want credits  i have nothing .  where will i find appropriations for the library .  they should be grateful i manage to squeeze out something for them each year at all .   as he finished  the emperor held out his hands  palms up  as if to signify the emptiness of the imperial coffers .   hari seldon was stunned .  he said   nevertheless  sire  even if you lack the credits  you still have the imperial prestige .  can you not order the library to allow me to keep my office and let my colleagues in to help me with our vital work .    and now agis xiv sat down again as though  once the subject was not credits  he was no longer in a state of agitation .   he said   you realize that  by long tradition  the galactic library is independent of the imperium  as far as its self government is concerned .  it sets up its rules and has done so since agis vi  my namesake  he smiled  attempted to control the news functions of the library .  he failed and  if the great agis vi failed  do you think i can succeed .     i m not asking you to use force  sire .  merely expressing a polite wish .  surely  when no vital function of the library is involved  they will be pleased to honor the emperor and oblige his wishes .     professor seldon  how little you know of the library .  i have but to express a wish  however gently and tentatively  to make it certain that they will proceed  in dudgeon  to do the opposite .  they are very sensitive to the slightest sign of imperial control .    seldon said   then what do i do .     why  i ll tell you what .  a thought occurs to me .  i am a member of the public and i can visit the galactic library if i wish .  it is located on the palace grounds  so i won t be violating protocol if i visit it .  well  you come with me and we shall be ostentatiously friendly .  i will not ask them for anything  but if they note us walking arm in arm  then perhaps some of the precious board of theirs may feel more kindly toward you than otherwise .   but that s all i can do .    and the deeply disappointed seldon wondered if that could possibly be enough .       las zenow said with a certain trace of awe in his voice   i didn t know you were so friendly with the emperor  professor seldon .     why not .  he s a very democratic fellow for an emperor and he was interested in my experiences as a first minister in cleon s time .     it made a deep impression on us all .  we haven t had an emperor in our halls for many years .  generally  when the emperor needs something from the library     i can imagine .  he calls for it and it is brought to him as a matter of courtesy .     there was once a suggestion   said zenow chattily   that the emperor be outfitted with a complete set of computerized equipment in his palace  hooked directly into the library system  so that he would not need to wait for service .  this was in the old days when credits were plentiful  but  you know  it was voted down .     was it .     oh yes  almost the entire board agreed that it would make the emperor too much a part of the library and that this would threaten our independence from the government .     and does this board  which will not bend to honor an emperor  consent to let me remain at the library .     at the present moment  yes .  there is a feeling and i ve done my best to encourage it that if we are not polite to a personal friend of the emperor  the chance of a rise in appropriations will be gone altogether  so     so credits or even the dim prospect of credits talk .     i m afraid so .     and can i bring in my colleagues .    zenow looked embarrassed .   i m afraid not .  the emperor was seen walking only with you not with your colleagues .  i m sorry  professor .    seldon shrugged and a mood of deep melancholy swept over him .  he had no colleague to bring in  anyhow .  for some time he had hoped to locate others like wanda and he had failed .  he  too  would need funding to mount an adequate search .  and he  too  had nothing .       trantor  the capital world city of the galactic empire  had changed considerably since the day hari first stepped off the hypership from his native helicon thirty eight years ago .  was it the pearly haze of an old man s memory that made the trantor of old shine so brightly in his mind s eye  hari wondered .  or perhaps it had been the exuberance of youth how could a young man from a provincial outer world such as helicon not be impressed by the gleaming towers  sparkling domes  the colorful  rushing masses of people that had seemed to swirl through trantor  day and night .   now  hari thought sadly  the walkways are nearly deserted  even in the full light of day .  roving gangs of thugs controlled various areas of the city  competing among themselves for territory .  the security establishment had dwindled  those who were left had their hands full processing complaints at the central office .  of course  security officers were dispatched as emergency calls came through  but they made it to the scene only after a crime was committed they no longer made even a pretense of protecting the citizens of trantor .  a person went out at his own risk and a great risk it was .  and yet hari seldon still took that risk  in the form of a daily walk  as if defying the forces that were destroying his beloved empire to destroy him as well .   and so hari seldon walked along  limping and thoughtful .   nothing worked .  nothing .  he had been unable to isolate the genetic pattern that set wanda apart and without that  he was unable to locate others like her .   wanda s ability to read minds had sharpened considerably in the six years since she had identified the flaw in yugo amaryl s prime radiant .  wanda was special in more ways than one .  it was as if  once she realized that her mental ability set her apart from other people  she was determined to understand it  to harness its energy  to direct it .  as she had progressed through her teen years  she had matured  throwing off the girlish giggles that had so endeared her to hari  at the same time becoming even dearer to him in her determination to help him in his work with the powers of her  gift .   for hari seldon had told wanda about his plan for a second foundation and she had committed herself to realizing that goal with him .   today  though  seldon was in a dark mood .  he was coming to the conclusion that wanda s mentalic ability would get him nowhere .  he had no credits to continue his work no credits to locate others like wanda  no credits to pay his workers on the psychohistory project at streeling  no credits to set up his all important encyclopedia project at the galactic library .   now what .   he continued to walk toward the galactic library .  he would have been better off taking a gravicab  but he wanted to walk limp or not .  he needed time to think .   he heard a cry  there he is .   but paid no attention .   it came again .   there he is .  psychohistory .    the word forced him to look up .   psychohistory .   a group of young men was closing in around him .   automatically seldon placed his back against the wall and raised his cane .   what is it you want .    they laughed .   credits  old man .  do you have any credits .     maybe  but why do you want them from me .  you said   psychohistory .   do you know who i am .     sure  you re raven seldon  said the young man in the lead .  he seemed both comfortable and pleased .    you re a creep   shouted another .    what are you going to do if i don t give you any credits .     we ll beat you up   said the leader   and we ll take them .     and if i give you my credits .     we ll beat you up anyway .   they all laughed .   hari seldon raised his cane higher .   stay away .  all of you .    by now he had managed to count them .  there were eight .   he felt himself choking slightly .  once he and dors and raych had been attacked by ten and they had had no trouble .  he had been only thirty two at the time and dors was dors .   now it was different .  he waved his cane .   the leader of the hoodlums said   hey  the old man is going to attack us .  what are we going to do .    seldon looked around swiftly .  there were no security officers around .  another indication of the deterioration of society .  an occasional person or two passed by  but there was no use calling for help .  their footsteps increased in speed and made a wide detour .  no one was going to run any risks of getting involved in an imbroglio .   seldon said   the first one of you who approaches gets a cracked head .     yeah .   and the leader stepped forward rapidly and seized the cane .  there was a short sharp struggle and the cane was wrested from seldon s grip .  the leader tossed it to one side .    now what  old man .    seldon shrunk back .  he could only wait for the blows .  they crowded around him  each eager to land a blow or two .  seldon lifted his arms to try to ward them off .  he could still twist after a fashion .  if he were facing only one or two  he might be able to twist his body  avoid their blows  strike back .  but not against eight surely not against eight .   he tried  at any rate  moving quickly to one side to avoid the blows and his right leg  with its sciatica  doubled under him .  he fell and knew himself to be utterly helpless .   then he heard a stentorian voice shouting   what s going on here .  get back  you thugs .  back or i ll kill you all .    the leader said   well  another old man .     not that old   said the newcomer .  with the back of one hand  he struck the leader s face  turning it an ugly red .   seldon said in surprise   raych  it s you .    raych s hand swept back .   stay out of this  dad .  just get up and move away .    the leader  rubbing his cheek  said   we ll get you for that .     no  you won t   said raych  drawing out a knife of dahlite manufacture  long and gleaming .  a second knife was withdrawn and he now held one in each hand .   seldon said weakly   still carrying knives  raych .     always   said raych .   nothing will ever make me stop .     i ll stop you   said the leader  drawing out a blaster .   faster than the eye could follow  one of raych s knives went sailing through the air and struck the leader s throat .  he made a loud gasp  then a gurgling sound  and fell  while the other seven stared .   raych approached and said   i want my knife back .   he drew it out of the hoodlum s throat and wiped it on the man s shirtfront .  in doing so  he stepped on the man s hand  bent down  and picked up his blaster .   raych dropped the blaster into one of his capacious pockets .  he said   i don t like to use a blaster  you bunch of good for nothings  because sometimes i miss .  i never miss with a knife  however .  never .  that man is dead .  there are seven of you standing .  do you intend to stay standing or will you leave .     get him .   shouted one of the hoodlums and the seven made a concerted rush .   raych took a backward step .  one knife flashed and then the other and two of the hoodlums stopped with  in each case  a knife buried in his abdomen .    give me back my knives   said raych  pulling each out with a cutting motion and wiping them .    these two are still alive  but not for long .  that leaves five of you on your feet .  are you going to attack again or are you going to leave .    they turned and raych called out   pick up your dead and dying .  i don t want them .    hastily they flung the three bodies over their shoulders  then they turned tail and ran .   raych bent to pick up seldon s cane .   can you walk  dad .     not very well   said seldon .   i twisted my leg .     well then  get into my car .  what were you doing walking  anyway .     why not .  nothing s ever happened to me .     so you waited till something did .  get into my car and i ll give you a lift back to streeling .    he programmed the ground car quietly  then said   what a shame we didn t have dors with us .  mom would have attacked them with her bare lands and left all eight dead in five minutes .    seldon felt tears stinging his eyelids .   i know  raych  i know .  do you think i don t miss her every day .     i m sorry   said raych in a low voice .   seldon asked   how did you know i was in trouble .     wanda told me .  she said there were evil people lying in wait for you  slid told me where they were and i took right off .     didn t you doubt that she knew what she was talking about .     not at all .  we know enough about her now to know that she has some sort of contact with your mind and with the things around you .     did she tell you how many people were attacking me .     no .  she just said   quite a few .      so you came out all by yourself  did you  raych .     i had no time to put together a posse  dad .  besides  one of me was enough .     yes  it was .  thank you  raych .        they were back at streeling now and seldon s leg was stretched out on a hassock .   raych looked at him somberly .   dad   he began   you re not to go walking around trantor on your own from now on .    seldon frowned .   why  because of one incident .     it was enough of an incident .  you can t take care of yourself any longer .  you re seventy years old and your right leg will not support you in an emergency .  and you have enemies     enemies .     yes  indeed .  and you know it .  those sewer rats were not after simply anyone .  they were not looking for just any unwary person to rip off .  they identified you by calling out   psychohistory .   and they called you a creep .  why do you suppose that was .     i don t know why .     that s because you live in a world all your own  dad  and you don t know what s going on on trantor .  don t you suppose the trantorians know that their world is going downhill at a rapid rate .  don t you suppose they know that your psychohistory has been predicting this for years .  doesn t it occur to you that they may blame the messenger for the message .  if things go bad and they are going bad there are many who think that you are responsible for it .     i can t believe that .     why do you suppose there s a faction at the galactic library that wants you out of there .  they don t want to be in the way when you are mobbed .  so you ve got to take care of yourself .  you can t go out alone .  i ll have to be with you or you will have to have bodyguards .  that s the way it s going to be  dad .    seldon looked dreadfully unhappy .   raych softened and said   but not for long  dad .  i ve got a new job .    seldon looked up .   a new job .  what kind .     teaching .  at a university .    which university .    santanni .    seldon s lips trembled .   santanni .  that s nine thousand parsecs away from trantor .  it s a provincial world on the other side of the galaxy .     exactly .  that s why i want to go there .  i ve been on trantor all my life  dad  and i m tired of it .  there s no world in all the empire that s deteriorating the way trantor is .  it s become a haunt of crime with no one to protect us .  the economy is limping  the technology is failing .  santanni  on the other hand  is a decent world  still humming along  and i want to be there to build a new life  along with manella and wanda and bellis .  we re all going there in two months .     all of you .     and you  dad .  and you .  we wouldn t leave you behind on trantor .  you re coming with us to santanni .    seldon shook his head .   impossible  raych .  you know that .     why impossible .     you know why .  the project .  my psychohistory .  are you asking me to abandon my life s work .     why not .  it s abandoned you .     you re mad .     no  i m not .  where are you going with it .  you have no credits .  you can t get any .  there s no one left on trantor who s willing to support you .         for nearly forty years     yes  i admit that .  but after all that time  you ve failed dad .  there s no crime in failing .  you ve tried so hard and you ve gone so far  but you ve run into a deteriorating economy  a falling empire .  it s the very thing you ve been predicting for so long that s stopping you at last .  so     no .  i will not stop .  somehow or other  i will keep going .     i tell you what  dad .  if you re really going to be so stubborn  then take psychohistory with you .  start it again on santanni .  there may be enough credits and enthusiasm to support it there .     and the men and women who have been working for me so faithfully .     oh bull  dad .  they ve been leaving you because you can t pay them .  you hang around here for the rest of your life and you ll be alone .   oh  come on  dad .  do you think i like to talk to you this way .  it s because no one has wanted to because no one has had the heart to that you re in your present predicament .  let s be honest with each other now .  when   .     u walk the streets of trantor and you re attacked for no reason other than that you re hari seldon  don t you think it s time for a little bit of truth .     never mind the truth .  i have no intention of leaving trantor .    raych shook his head .   i was sure you d be stubborn  dad .  you ve got two months to change your mind .  think about it  will you .        it had been a long time since hari seldon had smiled .  he had conducted the project in the same fashion that he always did  pushing always forward in the development of psychohistory  making plans for the foundation  studying the prime radiant .   but he did not smile .  all he did was to force himself through his work without any feeling of impending success .  rather  there was a feeling of impending failure about everything .   and now  as he sat in his office at streeling university  wanda entered .  he looked up at her and his heart lifted .  wanda had always been special .  seldon couldn t put his finger on just when he and the others had started accepting her pronouncements with more than the usual enthusiasm  it just seemed always to have been that way .  as a little girl  she had saved his life with her uncanny knowledge of  lemonade death  and all through her childhood she had somehow just known things .   although dr .  endelecki had asserted that wanda s genome was perfectly normal in every way  seldon was still positive that his granddaughter possessed mental abilities far beyond those of average humans .  and he was just as sure that there were others like her in the galaxy on trantor  even .  if only he could find them  these mentalics  what a great contribution they could make to the foundation .  the potential for such greatness all centered in his beautiful granddaughter .  seldon gazed at her  framed in his office doorway  and he felt as if his heart would break .  in a few days  she would be gone .   how could he bear it .  she was such a beautiful girl eighteen .  long blond hair  face a little broad but with a tendency to smile .  she was even smiling now and seldon thought  why not .  she s heading for santanni and for a new life .   he said   well  wanda  just a few more days .     no .  i don t think so  grandpa .    he stared at her .   what .    wanda approached him and put her arms around him .   i m not going to santanni .     have your father and mother changed their minds .     no  they re going .     and you re not .  why .  where are you going .     i m going to stay here  grandpa .  with you .   she hugged him .   poor grandpa .     but i don t understand .  why .  are they allowing this .     you mean mom and dad .  not really .  we ve been arguing over this for weeks  but i ve won out .  why not  grandpa .  they ll go to santanni and they ll have each other and they ll have little bellis  too .  but if i go with them and leave you here  you ll have no one .  i don t think i could stand that .     but how did you get them to agree .     well  you know i pushed .     what does that mean .     it s my mind .  i can see what you have in yours and in theirs and  as time goes on  i can see more clearly .  and i can push them to do what i want .     how do you do that .     i don t know .  but after a while  they get tired of being pushed and they re willing to let me have my way .  so i m going to stay with you .    seldon looked up at her with helpless love .   this is wonderful  wanda .  but bellis     don t worry about bellis .  she doesn t have a mind like mine .     are you certain .   seldon chewed at his lower lip .    quite certain .  besides  mom and dad have to have someone  too .    seldon wanted to rejoice  but he couldn t do so openly .  there were raych and manella .  what of them .   he said   wanda  what about your parents .  can you be so cold blooded about them .     i m not cold blooded .  they understand .  they realize i must be with you .     how did you manage that .     i pushed   said wanda simply   and eventually they came to see it my way .    you can do that .     it wasn t easy .     and you did it because   seldon paused .   wanda said   because i love you .  of course .  and because     yes .     i must learn psychohistory .  i know quite a bit of it already .     how .     from your mind .  from the minds of others at the project  especially from uncle yugo before he died .  but it s in rags and tatters  so far .  i want the real thing .  grandpa  i want a prime radiant of my own .   her face lit up and her words came quickly  with passion .   i want to study psychohistory in great detail .  grandpa  you re quite old and quite tired .  i m young and eager .  i want to learn all i can  so i can carry on when    seldon said   well  that would be wonderful if you could do it but there is no funding anymore .  i ll teach you all i can  but we can t do anything .     we ll see  grandpa .  we ll see .        raych  manella  and little bellis were waiting at the spaceport .   the hypership was preparing for liftoff and the three had already checked their baggage .   raych said   dad  come along with us .    seldon shook his head .   i cannot .     if you change your mind  we will always have a place for you .     i know it  raych .  we ve been together for almost forty years and they ve been good years .  dors and i were lucky to find you .     i m the lucky one .   his eyes filled with tears .   don t think i don t think of mother every day .     yes .   seldon looked away miserably .  wanda was playing with bellis when the call rang out for everyone to board the hypership .   they did  after a tearful last embrace of wanda by her parents .  raych looked back to wave at seldon and to try to plant a crooked smile on his face .   seldon waved and one hand moved out blindly to embrace wanda s shoulders .   she was the only one left .  one by one through his long life  he had lost his friends and those he had loved .  demerzel had left  never to return  emperor cleon was gone  his beloved dors was gone  his faithful friend yugo amaryl was gone  and now raych  his only son  was gone as well .   he was left only with wanda .       hari seldon said   it is beautiful outside a marvelous evening .  considering that we live under a dome  you would think we would have beautiful weather like this every evening .    wanda said indifferently   we would grow tired of it  grandpa  if it were beautiful all the time .  a little change from night to night is good for us .     for you  because you re young  wanda .  you have many  many evenings ahead of you .  i don t .  i want more good ones .     now  grandpa  you re not old .  your leg is doing well and your mind m as sharp as ever .  i know .      sure .  go ahead .  make me feel better .   he then said with an air of discomfort   i want to walk .  i want to get out of this tiny apartment and take a walk to the library and enjoy this beautiful evening .     what do you want at the library .     at the moment  nothing .  i want the walk .   but  .   .   .     yes .  but .     i promised raych i wouldn t go walking around trantor without a bodyguard .     raych isn t here .     i know   mumbled seldon  but a promise is a promise .     he didn t say who the bodyguard should be  did he .  let s go for a walk and i ll be your bodyguard .     you .   seldon grinned .    yes  me .  i hereby volunteer my services .  get yourself ready and we ll go for a walk .    seldon was amused .  he had half a mind to go without his cane  since his leg was scarcely painful of late  but  on the other hand  he had a new cane  one in which the head had been filled with lead .  it was both heavier and stronger than his old cane and  if he was going to have none other than wanda as a bodyguard  he thought he had better bring his new cane .   the walk was delightful and seldon was terribly glad he had given in to the temptation until they reached a certain spot .   seldon lifted his cane in a mixture of anger and resignation and said   look at that .    wanda lifted her eyes .  the dome was glowing  as it always did in the evening  in order to lend an air of first twilight .  it grew darker as night went on  of course .   what seldon was pointing at  however  was a strip of darkness along the dome .  a section of lights had gone out .   seldon said   when i first came to trantor  anything like that was unthinkable .  there were people tending the lights at all times .  the city worked  but now it is falling apart in all these little ways and what bothers me most is that no one cares .  why aren t there petitions to the imperial palace .  why aren t there meetings of indignation .  it is as though the people of trantor expect the city to be falling apart and then they find themselves annoyed with me because i am pointing out that this is exactly what is happening .    wanda said softly   grandpa  there are two men behind us .    they had walked into the shadows beneath the broken dome lights and seldon asked   are they just walking .     no .   wanda did not look at them .  she did not have to .   they re after you .     can you stop them push them .     i m trying  but there are two and they are determined .  it s it s like pushing a wall .     how far behind me are they .     about three meters .     closing in .     yes  grandpa .     tell me when they re a meter behind me .   he slid his hand down his cane till he was holding the thin end  leaving the leaded head swinging free .    now  grandpa .   hissed wanda .   and seldon turned  swinging his cane .  it came down hard upon the shoulder of one of the men behind him  who went down with a scream  writhing on the pavement .   seldon said   where s the other guy .     he took off .    seldon looked down on the man on the ground and put his foot on his chest .  he said   go through his pockets  wanda .  someone must have paid him and i d like to find his credit file perhaps i can identify where they came from .   he added thoughtfully   i meant to hit him on the head .     you d have killed him  grandpa .    seldon nodded .   it s what i wanted to do .  rather shameful .  i m lucky i missed .    a harsh voice said   what is all this .   a figure in uniform came running up  perspiring .   give me that cane  you .     officer   said seldon mildly .    you can give me your story later .  we ve got to call an ambulance for this poor man .     poor man    said seldon angrily .   he was going to assault me .  i acted in self defense .     i saw it happen   said the security officer .   this guy never laid a finger on you .  you turned on him and struck him without provocation .  that s not self defense .  that s assault and battery .     officer  i m telling you that     don t tell me anything .  you can tell it in court .    wanda said in a sweet small voice   officer  if you will just listen to us    the officer said   you go along home  young lady .    wanda drew herself up .   i most certainly won t  officer .  where my grandfather goes  there go i .   her eyes flashed and the security officer muttered   well  come along  then .        seldon was enraged .   i ve never been in custody before in my entire life .  a couple of months ago eight men assaulted me .  i was able to fight them off with the help of my son  but while that was going on was there a security officer in sight .  did people stop to help me .  no .  this time  i m better prepared and i knocked a man flat who had been about to assault me .  was there a security officer in sight .  absolutely .  she put the collar on me .  there were people watching  too  and they were amused at seeing an old man being taken in for assault and battery .  what kind of world do we live on .    civ novker  seldon s lawyer  sighed and said calmly   a corrupt world  but don t worry .  nothing will happen to you .  i ll get you out on bail and then  eventually  you ll come back for trial before a jury of your peers and the most you ll get the very most are some hard words from the bench .  your age and your reputation     forget my reputation   said seldon  still angry .   i m a psychohistorian and  at the present time  that is a dirty word .  they ll be glad to see me in jail .     no  they won t   said novker .   there may be some screwballs who have it in for you  but i ll see to it that none of them gets on the jury .    wanda said   do we really have to subject my grandfather to all this .  he s not a young man anymore .  can t we just appear before the magistrate and not bother with a jury trial .    the lawyer turned to her .   it can be done .  if you re insane  maybe .  magistrates are impatient power mad people who would just as soon put a person into jail for a year as listen to him .  no one goes up before a magistrate .     i think we should   said wanda .   seldon said   well now  wanda  i think we ought to listen to civ   but as he said that  he felt a strong churning in his abdomen .  it was wanda s  push .   seldon said   well if you insist .     she can t insist   said the lawyer .   i won t allow it .    wanda said   my grandfather is your client .  if he wants something done his way  you ve got to do it .     i can refuse to represent him .     well then  leave   said wanda sharply   and we ll face the magistrate alone .    novker thought and said   very well  then if you re going to be so adamant .  i ve represented hari for years and i suppose i won t abandon him now .  but i warn you  the chances are he ll get a jail sentence and i ll have to work like the devil to get it lifted if i can do it  . at all .     i m not afraid   said wanda .   seldon bit his lip and the lawyer turned to him .   what about you .  are you willing to let your granddaughter call the shots .    seldon thought a bit  then admitted  much to the old lawyer s surprise   yes .  yes  i am .        the magistrate looked sourly at seldon as he gave his story .   the magistrate said   what makes you think it was the intention of this man you struck to attack you .  did he strike you .  did he threaten you .  did he in any way place you under bodily fear .     my granddaughter was aware of his approach and was quite certain that he was planning to attack me .     surely  sir  that cannot be enough .  is there anything else you can tell me before i pass judgment .     well now  wait a while   said seldon indignantly .   don t pass judgment so quickly .  i was assaulted a few weeks ago by eight men whom i held off with the help of my son .  so  you see  i have reason to think that i might be assaulted again .    the magistrate shuffled his papers .   assaulted by eight men .  did you report that .     there were no security officers around .  not one .     aside from the point .  did you report it .     no  sir .     why not .     for one thing  i was afraid of getting into long drawn out legal proceedings .  since we had driven off eight men and were safe  it seemed useless to ask for more trouble .     how did you manage to ward off eight men just you and your son .    seldon hesitated .   my son is now on santanni and outside trantorian control .  thus  i can tell you that he had dahlite knives and was expert in their use .  he killed one man and badly hurt two others .  the rest ran  carrying off the dead and wounded .     but did you not report the death of a man and the wounding of two others .     no  sir .  same reason as before .  and we fought in self defense .  however  if you can track down the three dead and wounded  you will have evidence that we were attacked .    the magistrate said   track down one dead and two wounded nameless faceless trantorians .  are you aware that on trantor over two thousand people are found dead every day by knife wounds alone .  unless these things are reported to us at once  we are helpless .  your story of being assaulted once before will not hold water .  what we must do is deal with the events of today  which were reported and which had a security officer as a witness .    so  let s consider the situation as of now .  why do you think the fellow was going to attack .  simply because you happened to be passing by .  because you seemed old and defenseless .  because you looked like you might be carrying a great deal of credits .  what do you think .     i think  magistrate  it was because of who i am .    the magistrate looked at his papers .   you are hari seldon  a professor and a scholar .  why should that make you subject to assault  particularly .     because of my views .     your views .  well   the magistrate shuffled some papers perfunctorily .  suddenly he stopped and looked up  peering at seldon .   wait hari seldon .   a look of recognition spread across his face .   you re the psychohistory buff  aren t you .     yes  magistrate .     i m sorry .  i don t know anything about it except the name and the fact that you go around predicting the end of the empire or something like that .     not quite  magistrate .  but my views have become unpopular because they are proving to be true .  i believe it is for that reason that there are those who want to assault me or  even more likely  are being paid to assault me .    the magistrate stared at seldon and then called over the arresting security officer .   did you check up on the man who was hurt .  does he have a record .    the security officer cleared her throat .   yes  sir .  he s been arrested several times .  assault  mugging .     oh  he s a repeat offender  is he .  and does the professor have a record .     no  sir .     so we have an old and innocent man fighting off a known mugger and you arrest the old and innocent man .  is that it .    the security officer was silent .   the magistrate said   you may go  professor .     thank you  sir .  may i have my cane .    the magistrate snapped his fingers at the officer  who handed over the cane .    but one thing  professor   said the magistrate .   if you use that cane again  you had better be absolutely certain you can prove it was in self defense .  otherwise     yes  sir .   and hari seldon left the magistrate s chambers  leaning heavily on his cane but with his head held high .       wanda was crying bitterly  her face wet with tears  her eyes red  her cheeks swollen .   hari seldon hovered over her  patting her on the back  not knowing quite how to comfort her .    grandpa  i m a miserable failure .  i thought i could push people and i could when they didn t mind being pushed too much  like mom and dad and even then it took a long time .  i even worked out a rating system of sorts  based on a ten point scale sort of a mental pushing power gauge .  only i assumed too much .  i assumed that i was a ten  or at least a nine .  but now i realize that  at most  i rate a seven .    wanda s crying had stopped and she sniffed occasionally as hari stroked her hand .   usually usually i have no trouble .  if i concentrate  i can hear people s thoughts and when i want  i push them .  but those muggers .  i could hear them all right  but there was nothing i could do to push them away .     i thought you did very well  wanda .     i didn t .  i had a fan fantasy .  i thought people would come up behind you and in one mighty push i d send them flying .  that way i was going to be your bodyguard .  that s why i offered to be your bod bodyguard .  only i wasn t .  those two guys came up and i couldn t do a thing .     but you could .  you made the first man hesitate .  that gave me a chance to turn and clobber him .     no no .  i had nothing to do with it .  all i could do was warn you he was there and you did the rest .     the second man ran away .     because you clobbered the first guy .  i had nothing to do with it .   she broke out again in tears of frustration .   and then the magistrate .  i insisted on the magistrate .  i thought i would push and he would let you go at once .     he did let me go and it was practically at once .     no .  he put you through a miserable routine and saw the light only when he realized who you were .  i had nothing to do with it .  i flopped everywhere .  i could have gotten you into so much trouble .     no  i refuse to accept that  wanda .  if your pushing didn t work quite as well as you had hoped it would  it was only because you were working under emergency conditions .  you couldn t have helped it .  but  wanda  look i have an idea .    catching the excitement in his voice  she looked up .   what kind of idea  grandpa .     well  it s like this  wanda .  you probably realize that i ve got to have credits .  psychohistory simply can t continue without it and i cannot bear the thought of having it all come to nothing after so many years of hard work .     i can t bear it  either .  but how can we get the credits .     well  i m going to request an audience with the emperor again .  i ve seen him once already and he s a good man and i like him .  but he s not exactly drowning in wealth .  however  if i take you with me and if you push him gently it may be that he will find a source of credits  some source somewhere  and keep me going for a while  till i can think of something else .     do you really think it will work  grandpa .     not without you .  but with you maybe .  come  isn t it worth trying .    wanda smiled .   you know i ll do anything you ask  grandpa .  besides  it s our only hope .        it was not difficult to see the emperor .  agis s eyes sparkled as he greeted hari seldon .   hello  old friend   he said .   have you come to bring me bad luck .     i hope not   said seldon .   agis unhooked the elaborate cloak he was wearing and  with a weary grunt  threw it into the corner of the room  saying   and you lie there .    he looked at seldon and shook his head .   i hate that thing .  it s as heavy as sin and as hot as blazes .  i always have to wear it when i m being smothered under meaningless words  standing there upright like a carved image .  it s just plain horrible .  cleon was born to it and he had the appearance for it .  i was not and i don t .  it s just my misery that i m a third cousin of his on my mother s side so that i qualified as emperor .  i d be glad to sell it for a very small sum .  would you like to be emperor  hari .     no no  i wouldn t dream of it  so don t get your hopes up   said seldon  laughing .    but tell me  who is this extraordinarily beautiful young woman you have brought with you today .    wanda flushed and the emperor said genially   you mustn t let me embarrass you  my dear .  one of the few perquisites an emperor possesses is the right to say anything he chooses .  no one can object or argue  bout it .  they can only say   sire .   however  i don t want any  sires  from you .  i hate that word .  call me agis .  that is not my birth name  either .  it s my imperial name and i ve got to get used to it .  so  .   .   .  tell me what s doing  hari .  what s been happening to you since the last time we met .    seldon said briefly   i ve been attacked twice .    the emperor didn t seem to be sure whether this was a joke or not .  he said   twice .  really .    the emperor s face darkened as seldon told the story of the assaults .   i suppose there wasn t a security officer around when those eight men threatened you .     not one .    the emperor rose from his chair and gestured at the other two to keep theirs .  he walked back and forth  as though he were trying to work off some anger .  then he turned and faced seldon .    for thousands of years   he began   whenever something like this happened  people would say   why don t we appeal to the emperor .   or  why doesn t the emperor do something .   and  in the end  the emperor can do something and does do something  even if it isn t always the intelligent thing to do .  but i  .   .   .  hari  i m powerless .  absolutely powerless .    oh yes  there is the so called commission of public safety  but they seem more concerned with my safety than that of the public .  it s a wonder we re having this audience at all  for you are not at all popular with the commission .    there s nothing i can do about anything .  do you know what s happened to the status of the emperor since the fall of the junta and the restoration of hah .  imperial power .     i think i do .     i ll bet you don t fully .  we ve got democracy now .  do you know what democracy is .     certainly .    agis frowned .  he said   i ll bet you think it s a good thing .     i think it can be a good thing .     well  there you are .  it isn t .  it s completely upset the empire .    suppose i want to order more officers onto the streets of trantor .  in the old days  i would pull over a piece of paper prepared for me by the imperial secretary and would sign it with a flourish and there would be more security officers .    now i can t do anything of the sort .  i have to put it before the legislature .  there are seventy five hundred men and women who instantly turn into uncounted gaggles of geese the instant a suggestion is made .  in the first place  where is the funding to come from .  you can t have  say  ten thousand more officers without having to pay ten thousand more salaries .  then  even if you agreed to something of the sort  who selects the new security officers .  who controls them .    the legislature shouts at each other  argues  thunders  and lightens  and in the end nothing is done .  hari  i couldn t even do as small a thing as fix the broken dome lights you noticed .  how much will it cost .  who s in charge .  oh  the lights will be fixed  but it can easily take a few months to do it .  that s democracy .    hari seldon said   as i recall  the emperor cleon was forever complaining that he could not do what he wished to do .     the emperor cleon   said agis impatiently   had two first class first ministers demerzel and yourself and you each labored to keep cleon from doing anything foolish .  i have seventy five hundred first ministers  all of whom are foolish from start to finish .  but surely  hari  you haven t come to complain to me about the attacks .     no  i haven t .  something much worse .  sire agis i need credits .    the emperor stared at him .   after what i ve been telling you  hari .  i have no credits .   oh yes  there re credits to run this establishment  of course  but in order to get them i have to face my seventy five hundred legislators .  if you think i can go to them and say   i want credits for my friend  hari seldon  and if you think i ll get one quarter of what i ask for in anything less than two years  you re crazy .  it won t happen .    he shrugged and said  more gently   don t get me wrong  hari .  i would like to help you if i could .  i would particularly like to help you for the sake of your granddaughter .  looking at her makes me feel as though i should give you all the credits you would like but it can t be done .    seldon said   agis  if i don t get funding  psychohistory will go down the drain after nearly forty years .     it s come to nothing in nearly forty years  so why worry .     agis   said seldon  there s nothing more i can do now .  the assaults on me were precisely because i m a psychohistorian .  people consider me a predictor of destruction .    the emperor nodded .   you re bad luck  raven seldon .  i told you this earlier .    seldon stood up wretchedly .   i m through  then .    wanda stood  too  next to seldon the top of her head reaching her grandfather s shoulder .  she gazed fixedly at the emperor .   as hari turned to go  the emperor said   wait .  wait .  there s a little verse i once memorized   ill fares the land  to hastening ills a prey  where wealth accumulates  and men decay .       what does it mean .   asked a dispirited seldon .    it means that the empire is steadily deteriorating and falling apart  but that doesn t keep some individuals from growing rich .  why not turn to some of our wealthy entrepreneurs .  they don t have legislators and can  if they wish  simply sign a credit voucher .    seldon stared .   i ll try that .         mr .  bindris   said hari seldon  reaching out his hand to shake the other s .   i am so glad to be able to see you .  it was good of you to agree to see me .     why not .   said terep bindris jovially .   i know you well .  or  rather  i know of you well .     that s pleasant .  i take it you ve heard of psychohistory  then .     oh yes  what intelligent person hasn t .  not that i understand anything about it  of course .  and who is this young lady you have with you .     my granddaughter  wanda .     a very pretty young woman .   he beamed .   somehow i feel i d be putty in her hands .    wanda said   i think you exaggerate  sir .     no  really .  now  please  sit down and tell me what it is i can do for you .   he gestured expansively with his arm  indicating that they be seated on two overstuffed  richly brocaded chairs in front of the desk at which he sat .  the chairs  like the ornate desk  the imposing carved doors which had slid back noiselessly at their arrival signal  and the gleaming obsidian floor of bindris s vast office  were of the finest quality .  and  although his surroundings were impressive and imposing bindris himself was not .  the slight cordial man would not be taken  at first glance  for one of trantor s leading financial powerbrokers .    we re here  sir  at the emperor s suggestion .     the emperor .     yes  he could not help us  but he thought a man like you might be able to do so .  the question  of course  is credits .    bindris s face fell .   credits .   he said .   i don t understand .     well   said seldon   for nearly forty years  psychohistory has been supported by the government .  however  times change and the empire is no longer what it was .     yes  i know that .      the emperor lacks the credits to support us or  even if he did have the credits  he couldn t get the request for funding past the legislature .  he recommends  therefore  that i see businesspeople who  in the first place  still have credits and  in the second place  can simply write out a credit voucher .    there was a longish pause and bindris finally said   the emperor  i m afraid  knows nothing about business .   how many credits do you want .     mr .  bindris  we re talking about an enormous task .  i m going to need several million .     several million .     yes  sir .    bindris frowned .   are we talking about a loan here .  when do you expect to be able to pay it back .     well  mr .  bindris  i can t honestly say i ever expect to be able to pay it back .  i m looking for a gift .     even if i wanted to give you the credits and let me tell you  for some strange reason i very much want to do so i couldn t .  the emperor may have his legislature  but i have my board members .  i can t make a gift of that sort without the board s permission and they ll never grant it .     why not .  your firm is enormously wealthy .  a few million would mean nothing to you .     that sounds good   said bindris   but i m afraid that the firm is in a state of decline right now .  not sufficiently to bring us into serious trouble  but enough to make us unhappy .  if the empire is in a state of decay  different individual parts of it are decaying  too .  we are in no position to land out a few million .   i m truly sorry .    seldon sat there silently and bindris seemed unhappy .  he shook his head at last and said   look  professor seldon  i would really like to help you out  particularly for the sake of the young lady you have with you .  it just can t be done .   however  we re not the only firm in trantor .  try others  professor .  you may have better luck elsewhere .     well   said seldon  raising himself to his feet with an effort   we shall try .        wanda s eyes were filled with tears  but the emotion they represented was not sorrow but fury .    grandpa   she said   i don t understand it .  i simply don t understand it .  we ve been to four different firms .  each one was ruder and nastier to us than the one before .  the fourth one just kicked us out .  and since then  no one will let us in .     it s no mystery  wanda   said seldon gently .   when we saw bindris  he didn t know what we were there for and he was perfectly friendly until i asked for a gift of a few million credits .  then he was a great deal less friendly .  i imagine the word went out as to what we wanted and each additional time there was less friendliness until now  when people won t receive us at all .  why should they .  they re not going to give us the credits we need  so why waste time with us .    wanda s anger turned on herself .   and what did i do .  i just sat there .  nothing .     i wouldn t say that   said seldon .   bindris was affected by you .  it seems to me that he really wanted to give me the credits  largely because of you .  you were pushing him and accomplishing something .     not nearly enough .  besides  all he cared about was that i was pretty .     not pretty   muttered seldon .   beautiful .  very beautiful .     so what do we do now  grandpa .   asked wanda .   after all these years  psychohistory will collapse .     i suppose that   said seldon  in a way  it s something that can t be helped .  i ve been predicting the breakdown of the empire for nearly forty years and now that it s come  psychohistory breaks down with it .     but psychohistory will save the empire  at least partly .     i know it will  but i can t force it to .     are you just going to let it collapse .    seldon shook his head .   i ll try to keep it from doing so  but i must admit that i don t know how i m going to do it .    wanda said   i m going to practice .  there must be some way i can strengthen my push  make it easier for me to force people to do what i want them to do .     i wish you could manage .     what are you going to do  grandpa .     well  nothing much .  two days ago  when i was on my way to see the chief librarian  i encountered three men in the library who were arguing about psychohistory .  for some reason  one of them impressed me very much .  i urged him to come see me and he agreed .  the appointment is for this afternoon at my office .     are you going to have him work for you .     i would like to if i have enough credits to pay him with .  but it can t hurt to talk with him .  after all  what can i lose .        the young man arrived at precisely   t . s . t .   trantorian standard time  and seldon smiled .  he loved punctual people .  he placed his hands on his desk and made ready to heave to his feet  but the young man said   please  professor  i know you have a bad leg .  you needn t stand up .    seldon said   thank you  young man .  however  that does not mean that you cannot sit down .  please do .    the young man removed his jacket and sat down .   seldon said   you must forgive me  .   .   .  when we met and set up this appointment  i neglected to learn your name which is  .   .   .   .    stettin palver   said the young man .    ah .  palver .  palver .  the name sounds familiar .     it should  professor .  my grandfather boasted frequently of having known you .     your grandfather .  of course .  joramis palver .  he was two years younger than i was  as i recall .  i tried to get him to join me in psychohistory  but he refused .  he said there was no chance of his ever learning enough mathematics to make it possible .  too bad .  how is joramis  by the way .    palver said solemnly   i m afraid that joramis has gone the way of old men generally .  he s dead .    seldon winced .  two years younger than he himself was and dead .  an old friend and they had lost touch to such a degree that  when death came  it did so unknowingly .   seldon sat there for a while and finally muttered   i m sorry .    the young man shrugged .   he had a good life .     and you  young man  where did you have your schooling .     langano university .    seldon frowned .   langano .  stop me if i m wrong  but that s not on trantor  is it .     no .  i wanted to try a different world .  the universities on trantor  as you undoubtedly know very well  are all overcrowded .  i wanted to find a place where i could study in peace .     and what did you study .     nothing much .  history .  not the sort of thing that would lead one to a good job .     another wince  even worse than the first .  dors venabili had been a historian .    seldon said   but you re back here on trantor .  why is that .     credits .  jobs .     as an historian .    palver laughed .   not a chance .  i run a device that pulls and hauls .  not exactly a professional occupation .    seldon looked at palver with a twinge of envy .  the contours of palver s arms and chest were highlighted by the thin fabric of his shirt .  he was well muscled .  seldon had never himself been quite that muscular .   seldon said   i presume that when you were at the university  you were on the boxing team .     who  me .  never .  i m a twister .     a twister .   seldon s spirits jumped .   are you from helicon .    palver said with a certain contempt   you don t have to come from helicon to be a good twister .    no  thought seldon  but that s where the best ones come from .   however  he said nothing .   he did say  though   well  your grandfather would not join me .  how about you .     psychohistory .     i heard you talking to the others when i first encountered you and it seemed to me that you were talking quite intelligently about psychohistory .  would you like to join me  then .     as i said  professor  i have a job .     pushing and hauling .  come  come .     it pays well .     credits aren t everything .     they re quite a bit .  now you  on the other hand  can t pay me much .  i m quite certain that you re short of credits .     why do you say that .     i m guessing  in a way  i suppose .   but am i wrong .    seldon s lips pressed together hard  then he said   no  you re not wrong and i can t pay you much .  i m sorry .  i suppose that ends our little interview .     wait  wait  wait .   palver held up his hands .   not quite so fast  please .  we re still talking about psychohistory .  if i work for you  i will be taught psychohistory  right .     of course .     in that case  credits aren t everything  after all .  i ll make you a deal .  you teach me all the psychohistory you can and you pay me whatever you can and i ll get by somehow .  how about it .     wonderful   said seldon joyously .   that sounds great .  now  one more thing .     oh .     yes .  i ve been attacked twice in recent weeks .  the first time my son came to my defense  but he has since gone to santanni .  the second time i made use of my lead filled walking stick .  it worked  but i was dragged before a magistrate and accused of assault and battery     why the attacks .   interjected palver .    i am not popular .  i have been preaching the fall of the empire for so long that  now that it is coming  i am blamed for it .     i see .  now then  what does all that have to do with the one more thing you mentioned .     i want you to be my bodyguard .  you re young  you re strong  and  most of all  you re a twister .  you re exactly what i need .     i suppose it can be managed   palver said with a smile .        see there  stettin   seldon said as the two were taking an early evening stroll in one of trantor s residential sectors near streeling .  the older man pointed to debris assorted refuse jettisoned from passing groundcars or dropped by careless pedestrians strewn along the walkway .   in the old days   seldon continued   you would never see litter like this .  the security officers were vigilant and municipal maintenance crews provided round the clock upkeep of all public areas .  but  most important  no one would even think of dumping his trash in such a manner .  trantor was our home  we took pride in it .  now  seldon shook his head sadly  resignedly  and sighed  it s   he broke off abruptly .    you there  young man .   seldon shouted at a ill kempt fellow who had moments before passed them  going in the opposite direction .  he was munching a treat just popped into his mouth  the wrapper had been tossed to the ground without so much as a downward glance .   pick that up and dispose of it properly   seldon admonished as the young man eyed him sullenly .    pick it up yourself   the boy snarled and then he turned and walked away .    it s another sign of society s breakdown  as predicted by your psychohistory  professor seldon   palver said .    yes  stettin .  all around us the empire is falling apart  piece by piece .  in fact  it s already smashed there s no turning back now .  apathy  decay  and greed have all played their parts in destroying the once glorious empire .  and what will take its place .  why    here seldon broke off at the sight of palver s face .  the younger man seemed to be listening intently but not to seldon s voice .  his head was cocked to one side and his face had a far off look .  it was as if palver were straining to hear some sound inaudible to everyone but himself .   suddenly he snapped back to the here and now .  with an urgent glance around them  palver took hold of seldon s arm .   hari  quick  we must get away .  they re coming  .   .   .   and then the still evening was broken by the harsh sound of rapidly approaching footsteps .  seldon and palver spun around  but it was too late  a band of attackers was upon them .  this time  however  hari seldon was prepared .  he immediately swung his cane in a wide arc around palver and himself .  at this  the three attackers two boys and a girl  all teenage ruffians laughed .    so  you re not goin  to make it easy  are you  old man .   snorted the boy who appeared to be the group s ringleader .   why  me and my buddies  we ll take you out in two seconds flat .  we ll   all of a sudden  the ringleader was down  the victim of a perfectly placed twist kick to his abdomen .  the two ruffians who were still standing quickly dropped to a crouch in preparation for attack .  but palver was quicker .  they  too  were felled almost before they knew what hit them .   and then it was over almost as soon as it started .  seldon stood off to the side  leaning heavily on his cane  shaking at the thought of his narrow escape .  palver  panting slightly from exertion  surveyed the scene .  the three attackers were out cold on the deserted walkway under the darkening dome .    come on  let s get out of here quickly .   palver urged again  only this time it was not the attackers they would be fleeing .    stettin  we can t leave   protested seldon .  he gestured toward the unconscious would be muggers .   they re really nothing more than children .  they may be dying .  how can we just walk away .  it s inhumane that   s what it is and humanity is exactly what i ve been working all these years to protect .   seldon struck the ground with his cane for emphasis and his eyes gleamed with conviction .    nonsense   retorted palver .   what s inhumane is the way muggers like that prey on innocent citizens like you .  do you think they d have given you a second thought .  they d just as soon stick a knife in your gut to steal your last credit and then kick you as they ran .  they ll come to soon enough and slink away to lick their wounds .  or someone will find them and call the central office .    but  hari  you must think .  after what happened last time  you stand to lose everything if you re linked to another beating .  please  hari  we must run .   with this  palver grabbed seldon s arm and seldon after a list backward glance  allowed himself to be led away .   as the footsteps of the rapidly departing seldon and palver diminished in the distance  another figure emerged from his hiding place behind some trees .  chuckling to himself  the sullen eyed youth muttered    you re a fine one to tell me what s right and what s wrong  professor .   with that  he spun on his heel and headed off to summon the security officers .        order .  i will have order .   bellowed judge tejan popjens lih .  the public hearing of professor raven seldon and his young associate  stettin palver  had generated a hue and cry among the populace of trantor .  here was the man who had predicted the fall of the empire  the decay of civilization  who exhorted others to harken back to the golden age of civility and order here was he who  according to an eyewitness  had ordered the brutal beating of three young trantorians for no apparent provocation .  ah yes  it promised to be a spectacular hearing  one which would lead  no doubt  to an even more spectacular trial .   the judge pressed a contact set into a recessed panel on her bench and a sonorous gong resounded through the packed courtroom .   i will have order   she repeated to the now hushed throng .   if need be  the courtroom will be cleared .  that is a warning .  it will not be repeated .    the judge cut an imposing figure in her scarlet robe .  originally from the outer world of lystena  lih s complexion had a slight bluish cast  which turned darker when she became exercised  practically purple when she was really angry .  it was rumored that  for all her years on the bench  in spite of her reputation as a top judicial mind  notwithstanding her position as one of the most revered interpreters of imperial law  lih was ever so slightly vain about the colorful appearance she gave  the way in which the bright red robes set off her soft turquoise skin .   nevertheless  lih had a reputation for coming down hard on those who brooked imperial law  she was one of the few judges left who upheld the civil code without wavering .    i have heard of you  professor seldon  and your theories about our imminent destruction .  and i have spoken with the magistrate who recently heard another case in which you were involved  one in which you struck a man with your lead filled cane .  in that instance  too  you claimed to be the victim of assault .  your reasoning stemmed  i believe  from a previous unreported incident in which you and your son allegedly were assaulted by eight hoodlums .  you were able to convince my esteemed colleague  professor seldon of your plea of self defense  even though an eyewitness testified otherwise .  this time  professor  you will have to be much more convincing .    the three hoodlums who were bringing charges against seldon and palver snickered in their seats at the plaintiff s table .  they presented a much different appearance today than they had the evening of the attack .  the young men were sporting clean loose fitting unisuits  the young lady was wearing a crisply pleated tunic .  all in all  if one didn t look  or listen  too closely  the three presented a reassuring picture of trantorian youth .   seldon s lawyer  civ novker  who was representing palver as well   approached the bench .   your honor  my client is an upstanding member of the trantorian community .  he is a former first minister of stellar repute .  he is a personal acquaintance of our emperor agis xiv .  what possible benefit could professor seldon derive from attacking innocent young people .  he is one of the most vocal proponents of stimulating the intellectual creativity of trantorian youth his psychohistory project employs numerous student volunteers  he is a beloved member of the streeling university faculty .    further   here novker paused  sweeping his gaze around the packed courtroom  as if to say  wait till you hear this you ll be ashamed that you ever for a second doubted the veracity of my client s claims   professor seldon is one of the very few private individuals officially allied with the prestigious galactic library .  he has been granted unlimited use of library facilities for work on what he calls the encyclopedia galactica  a veritable paean to imperial civilization .    i ask you  how can this man even be questioned in such a matter .    with a flourish of his arm  novker gestured toward seldon who was sitting at the defendant s table with stettin palver  looking decidedly uncomfortable .  hari s cheeks were flushed from the unaccustomed praise  after all  lately his name was the subject of derisive snickers rather than flowery plaudits  and his hand shook slightly on the carved dandle of his trusty cane .   judge lih gazed down at seldon clearly unimpressed .   what benefit  indeed  counselor .  i have been asking myself that very question .  i ve lain make these past nights  racking my brains for a plausible reason .  why should a man of professor seldon s stature commit unprovoked assault and battery when he himself is one of our most outspoken critics of the so called  breakdown  of civil order .    and then it dawned on me .  perhaps  in his frustration at not being believed  professor seldon feels he must prove to the worlds that his predictions of doom and gloom really are coming to pass .  after all  here is a man who has spent his entire career foretelling the fall of the empire and all he can really point to are a few burned out bulbs in the dome  an occasional glitch in public transport  a budget cut here or there  nothing very dramatic .  but an attack or two or three now  that would be something .    lih sat back and folded her hands in front of her  a satisfied expression on her face .  seldon stood  leaning heavily on the table for support .  with great effort  he approached the bench  waving off his lawyer  walking headlong into the steely gaze of the judge .    your honor  please permit me to say a few words in my defense .     of course  professor seldon .  after all  this is not a trial  only a hearing to air all allegations  facts  and theories pertinent to   a case before deciding whether or not to go ahead with a trial .  i have merely expressed a theory  i am most interested to hear what you have to say .    seldon cleared his throat before beginning .   i have devoted my life to the empire .  i have faithfully served the emperors .  my science of psychohistory  rather than being a harbinger of destruction  is intended to be used as an agent for rejuvenation .  with it we can be prepared for whatever course civilization takes .  if  as i believe  the empire continues to break down  psychohistory will help us put into place building blocks for a new and better civilization founded on all that is good from the old .  i love our worlds  our peoples  our empire what would it behoove me to contribute to the lawlessness that saps its strength daily .    i can say no more .  you must believe me .  i  a man of intellect  of equations  of science i am speaking from my heart .   seldon turned and made his way slowly back to his chair beside palver .  before sitting  his eyes sought wanda  sitting in the spectators  gallery .  she smiled wanly and winked at him .    from the heart or not  professor seldon  this decision will require much thought on my part .  we have heard from your accusers  we have heard from you and mr .  palver .  there is one more party whose testimony i need .  i d like to hear from rial nevas  who has come forward as an eyewitness to this incident .    as nevas approached the bench  seldon and palver looked at each other in alarm .  it was the boy whom hari had admonished just before the attack .   lih was asking the youth a question .   would you describe  mr .  nevas  exactly what you witnessed on the night in question .     well   started nevas  fixing seldon with his sullen stare   i was walkin  along  mindin  my own business  when i saw those two   he turned and pointed at seldon and palver  on the other side of the walkway  comin  toward me .  and then i saw those three kids .    another point of the finger  this time toward the three sitting at the plaintiff s table .    the two older guys were walkin  behind the kids .  they didn t see me  though  on account of i was on the other side of the walkway and besides  they were concentratin  on their victims .  then wham .  just like that  that old guy swings at  em with his stick  then the younger guy jumps  em and kicks  em and before you know it  they re all down on the ground .  then the old guy and his pal  they just took off  just like that .  i couldn t believe it .     that s a lie .   seldon exploded .   young man  you re playing with our lives here .   nevas only stared back at seldon impassively .    judge   seldon implored   can t you see that he is lying .  i remember this fellow .  i scolded him for littering just minutes before we were attacked .  i pointed it out to stettin as another instance of the breakdown of our society  the apathy of the citizenry  the     enough  professor seldon   commanded the judge .   another outburst like that and i will have you ejected from this courtroom .  now  mr .  nevas   she said  turning back to the witness .   what did you do throughout the sequence of events you just described .     i  uh  i hid .  behind some trees .  i hid .  i was afraid they d come after me if they saw me  so i hid .  and when they were gone  well  i ran and called the security officers .    nevas had started to sweat and he inserted a finger into the constricting collar of his unisuit .  he fidgeted  shifting his weight from one foot to the other as he stood on the raised speaker s platform .  he was uncomfortably aware of the crowd s eyes upon him  he tried to avoid looking into the audience  but each time he did  he found himself drawn to the   toady gaze of a pretty blond girl sitting in the first row .  it was as if she was asking him a question  pressing him for an answer  willing him to   peak .    mr .  nevas  what do you have to say about professor seldon s allegation that he and mr .  palver did see you prior to the attack  that the professor actually exchanged words with you .     well  uh  no  you see  it was just like i said  .   .   .  i was walkin  along and   and now nevas looked over at seldon s table .  seldon looked at the young man sadly  as if he realized all was lost .  but seldon s companion  stettin palver  turned a fierce gaze on nevas and nevas jumped  startled  at the words he heard  tell the truth .  it was as if palver had spoken  but palver s lips hadn t moved .  and then  confused  nevas snapped his head in the direction of the blond girl  he thought he heard her speak tell the truth .  but her lips were still as well .    mr .  nevas  mr .  nevas   the judge s voice broke in on the youth s jumbled thoughts .   mr .  nevas  if professor seldon and mr .  palver were walking toward you  behind the three plaintiffs  how is it that you noticed seldon and palver first .  that is how you put it in your statement  is it not .    nevas glanced around the courtroom wildly .  he couldn t seem to escape the eyes  all the eyes screaming at him to tell the truth .  looking over at hari seldon  rial nevas said simply   i m sorry  and  to the amazement of the entire courtroom assemblage  the fourteen year old boy started to cry .       it was a lovely day  neither too warm nor too cold  not too bright nor too gray .  even though the groundskeeping budget had given out years ago  the few straggly perennials lining the steps leading up to the galactic library managed to add a cheerful note to the morning .   the library  having been built in the classical style of antiquity  was fronted with one of the grandest stairways to be found in the entire empire  second only to the steps at the imperial palace itself .  most library visitors  however  preferred to enter via the gliderail  seldon had high hopes for the day .   since he and stettin palver had been cleared of all charges in their recent assault and battery case  hari seldon felt like a new man .  although the experience had been painful  its very public nature had advanced seldon s cause .  judge tejan popjens lih  who was considered one of  if not the most influential judge on trantor  had been quite vociferous in her opinion  delivered the day following rial nevas s emotional testimony .    when we come to such a crossroads in our  civilized  society   the judge intoned from her bench   that a man of professor hari seldon s standing is made to bear the humiliation  abuse  and lies of his peers simply because of who he is and what he stands for  it is truly a dark day for the empire .  i admit that i  too  was taken in at first .   why wouldn t professor seldon   i reasoned   resort to such trickery in an attempt to prove his predictions .   but  as i came to see  i was most grievously wrong .   here the judge s brow furrowed  a dark blue flush began creeping up her neck and into her cheeks .   for i was ascribing to professor seldon motives born of our new society  a society in which honesty  decency  and goodwill are likely to get one killed  a society in which it appears one must resort to dishonesty and trickery merely to survive .    how far we have strayed from our founding principles .  we were lucky this time  fellow citizens of trantor .  we owe a debt of thanks to professor hari seldon for showing us our true selves  let us take his example to heart and resolve to be vigilant against the baser forces of our human nature .    following the hearing  the emperor had sent seldon a congratulatory bolo disc .  on it he expressed the hope that perhaps now seldon would find renewed funding for his project .   as seldon slid up the entrance gliderail  he reflected on the current status of his psychohistory project .  his good friend the former chief librarian las zenow had retired .  during his tenure  zenow had been a strong proponent of seldon and his work .  more often than not  however  zenow s hands had been tied by the library board .  but  he had assured seldon  the affable new chief librarian  tryma acarnio  was as progressive as he himself  and was popular with many factions among the board membership .    hari  my friend   zenow had said before leaving trantor for his home world of wencory   acarnio is a good man  a person of deep intellect and an open mind .  i m sure he ll do all that he can to help you and the project .  i ve left him the entire data file on you and your encyiopedia  i know he ll be as excited as i about the contribution to humanity it represents .  take care  my friend i ll remember you fondly .    and so today hari seldon was to have his first official meeting with the new chief librarian .  he was cheered by the reassurances las zenow had left with him and he was looking forward to sharing his plans for the future of the project and the encyclopedia .   tryma acarnio stood as hari entered the chief librarian s office .   already he had made his mark on the place  whereas zenow had stuffed every nook and cranny of the room with holo discs and tridijournals from the different sectors of trantor  and a dizzying array of visiglobes representing various worlds of the empire had spun in midair  acarnio had swept clear the mounds of data and images that zenow had liked to keep at his fingertips .  a large holoscreen now dominated one wall on which  seldon presumed  acarnio could view any publication or broadcast that he desired .   acarnio was short and stocky  with a slightly distracted look from a childhood corneal correction that had gone awry that belied a fearsome intelligence and constant awareness of everything going on around him at all times .    well  well .  professor seldon .  come in .  sit down .   acarnio gestured to a straight backed chair facing the desk at which he sat .   it was  i felt  quite fortuitous that you requested this meeting .  you see  i had intended to get in touch with you as soon as i settled in .    seldon nodded  pleased that the new chief librarian had considered him enough of a priority to plan to seek him out in the hectic early days of his tenure .    but  first  professor  please let me know why you wanted to see me before we move on to my  most likely  more prosaic concerns .    seldon cleared his throat and leaned forward .   chief librarian  las zenow has no doubt told you of my work here and of my idea for an encyclopedia galactica .  las was quite enthusiastic  and a great help  providing a private office for me here and unlimited access to the library s vast resources .  in fact  it was he who located the eventual home of the encyclopedia project  a remote outer world called terminus .    there was one thing  however  that las could not provide .  in order to keep the project on schedule  i must have office space and unlimited access granted to a number of my colleagues  as well .  it is an enormous undertaking  just gathering the information to be copied and transferred to terminus before we can begin the actual work of compiling the encyclopedia .    las was not popular with the library board  as you undoubtedly are aware .  you  however  are .  and so i ask you  chief librarian  will you see to it that my colleagues are granted insiders  privileges so that we may continue our most vital work .    here hari stopped  almost out of breath .  he was sure that his speech  which he had gone over and over in his mind the night before  would have the desired effect .  he waited  confident in acarnio s response .    professor seldon   acarnio began .  seldon s expectant smile faded .  there was an edge to the chief librarian s voice that seldon had not expected .   my esteemed predecessor provided me in exhaustive detail  an explication of your work here at the library .  he was quite enthusiastic about your research and committed to the idea of your colleagues joining you here .  as was i  professor seldon  at acarnio s pause  seldon looked up sharply  at first .  i was prepared to call a special meeting of the board to propose that a larger suite of offices be prepared for you and your encyclopedists .  but  professor seldon  all that has now changed .     changed .  but why .     professor seldon  you have just finished serving as principal defendant in a most sensational assault and battery case .     but i was acquitted   seldon broke in .   the case never even made it to trial .     nonetheless  professor  your latest foray into the public eye has given you an undeniable how shall i say it .  tinge of ill repute .  oh yes  you were acquitted of all charges .  but in order to get to that acquittal  your name  your past  your beliefs  and your work were paraded before the eyes of all the worlds .  and even if one progressive right thinking judge has proclaimed you faultless  what of the millions perhaps billions of other average citizens who see not a pioneering psychohistorian striving to preserve his civilization s glory but a raving lunatic shouting doom and gloom for the great and mighty empire .    you  by the very nature of your work  are threatening the essential fabric of the empire .  i don t mean the huge  nameless  faceless  monolithic empire .  no  i am referring to the heart and soul of the empire its people .  when you tell them the empire is failing  you are saying that they are failing .  and this  my dear professor  the average citizen cannot face .    seldon  like it or not  you have become an object of derision  a subject of ridicule  a laughingstock .     pardon me  chief librarian  but for years now i have been  to some circles  a laughingstock .     yes  but only to some circles .  but this latest incident and the very public forum in which it was played out has opened you up to ridicule not only here on trantor but throughout the worlds .  and  professor  if  by providing you an office  we  the galactic library  give tacit approval to your work  then  by inference  we  the library  also become a laughingstock throughout the worlds .  and no matter how strongly i may personally believe in your theory and your encyclopedia  as chief librarian of the galactic library on trantor  i must think of the library first .    and so  professor seldon  your request to bring in your colleagues is denied .    hari seldon jerked back in his chair as if struck .    further   acarnio continued   i must advise you of a two week temporary suspension of all library privileges effective immediately .  the board has called that special meeting  professor seldon .  in two weeks  time we will notify you whether or not we ve decided that our association with you must be terminated .    here  acarnio stopped speaking and  placing his palms on the glossy  spotless surface of his desk  stood up .   that is all  professor seldon for now .    hari seldon stood as well  although his upward movement was not as smooth  nor as quick  as tryma acarnio   s .  .    may i be permitted to address the board .   asked seldon .   perhaps if i were able to explain to them the vital importance of psychohistory and the encyclopedia     i m afraid not  professor   said acarnio softly and seldon caught a brief glimmer of the man las zenow had told him about .  but  just as quickly  the icy bureaucrat was back as acarnio guided seldon to the door .   as the portals slid open  acarnio said   two weeks  professor seldon .  till then .   hari stepped through to his waiting skitter and the doors slid shut .   what am i going to do now .  wondered seldon disconsolately .  is this the end of my work .        wanda dear  what is it that has you so engrossed .   asked hari seldon as he entered his granddaughter s office at streeling university .  the room had been the office of the brilliant mathematician yugo amaryl  whose death had impoverished the psychohistory project .  fortunately   wanda had gradually taken over yugo s role in recent years  further refining and adjusting the prime radiant .    why  i m working on an equation in section   a d   .  see  i ve recalibrated this section  she gestured to a glowing violet patch suspended in midair in front of her face   taking into consideration the standard quotient and  there .  just what i thought i think .   she stepped back and rubbed her eyes .    what is it  wanda .   hari moved in closer to study the equation .   why  this looks like the terminus equation and yet  .   .   .  wanda  this is an inverse of the terminus equation  isn t it .     yes  grandpa .  see  the numbers weren t working quite right in the terminus equation look .   wanda touched a contact in a recessed wallstrip and another patch sprang to life in vivid red on the other side of the room .  seldon and wanda walked over to inspect it .   you see how it s all hanging together fine now  grandpa .  it s taken me weeks to get it this way .     how did you do it .   asked hari  admiring the equation s lines  its logic  its elegance .    at first  i concentrated on it from over here only .  i blocked out all else .  in order to get terminus to work  work on terminus  stands to reason  doesn t it .  but then i realized that i couldn t just introduce this equation into the prime radiant system and expect it to blend right in smoothly  as if nothing happened .  a placement means a displacement somewhere else .  a weight needs a counterweight .     i think the concept to which you are referring is what the ancients called din and yang .        yes  more or less .  yin and yang .  so  you see  i realized that to perfect the yin of terminus  i had to locate its yang .  which i did  over there .   she moved back to the violet patch  tucked away at the other edge of the prime radiant sphere .   and once i adjusted the figures here  the terminus equation fell into place as well .  harmony .   wanda looked pleased with herself  as if she d solved all the problems of the empire .    fascinating  wanda  and later on you must tell me what you think it all means for the project .   but right now you must come with me to the holoscreen .  i received an urgent message from santanni a few minutes ago .  your father wants us to call him immediately .    wanda s smile faded .  she had been alarmed at the recent reports of fighting on santanni .  as imperial budget cutbacks went into effect  the citizens of the outer worlds suffered most .  they had limited access to the richer  more populous inner worlds and it became more and more difficult to trade their worlds  products for much needed imports .  imperial hyperships going in and out of santanni were few and the distant world felt isolated from the rest of the empire .  pockets of rebellion had erupted throughout the planet .    grandfather  i hope everything s all right   said wanda  her fear revealed by her voice .    don t worry  dear .  after all  they must be safe if raych was able to send us a message .    in seldon s office  he and wanda stood before the holoscreen as it activated .  seldon punched a code on the keypad alongside the screen and they waited a few seconds for the intragalactic connection to be established .  slowly the screen seemed to stretch back into the wall  as if it were the entrance to a tunnel and out of the tunnel  dimly at first  came the familiar figure of a stocky powerfully built man .  as the connection sharpened  the man s features became clearer .  when seldon and wanda were able to make out raych s bushy dahlite mustache  the figure sprang to life .    dad .  wanda .   said raych s three dimensional hologram  projected to trantor from santanni .   listen  i don t have much time .   he flinched  as if startled by a loud noise .   things have gotten pretty bad here .  the government has fallen and a provisional party has taken over .  things are a mess  as you can imagine .  i just put manella and bellis on a hypership to anacreon .  i told them to get in touch with you from there .  the name of the ship is the arcadia vii .    you should have seen manella  dad .  mad as anything that she had to go .  the only way i was able to convince her to leave was to point out that it was for bellis s sake .    i know what you re thinking  dad and wanda .  of course i would have gone with them if i could have .  but there wasn t enough room .  you should ve seen what i had to go through just to get them onto the ship .   raych flashed one of his lopsided grins that seldon and wanda loved so much  then continued .   besides  since i m here  i have to help guard the university we may be part of the imperial university system  but we re a place of learning and building  not of destruction .  i tell you  if one of those hot headed santanni rebels comes near our stuff     raych   hari broke in   how bad is it .  are you close to the fighting .     dad  are you in danger .   asked wanda .   they waited a few seconds for their message to travel the nine thousand parsecs across the galaxy to raych .    i i   couldn t quite make out what you said   the hologram replied .   there s a bit of fighting going on .  it s sort of exciting  actually   raych said  breaking into that grin again .   so i m going to sign off now .  remember  find out what happened to the arcadia iii going to anacreon .  i ll be back in touch as soon as i m able .  remember  i   the transmission broke off and the hologram faded .  the holoscreen tunnel collapsed in on itself so that seldon and wanda were left staring at a blank wall .    grandpa   said wanda   what do you think he was going to say .     i have no idea  dear .  but there is one thing i do know and that is that your father can take care of himself .  i pity any rebel who gets near enough for a well placed twist kick from your dad .   come  let s get back to that equation and in a few hours we ll check on the arcadia hi .        commander  have you no idea what happened to the ship .   hari seldon was again engaged in intragalactic conversation  but this time it was with an imperial navy commander stationed at anacreon .  for this communication  seldon was making use of the visiscreen much less realistic than the holoscreen but also much simpler .    i m telling you  professor  that we have no record of that hypership requesting permission to enter the anacreonic atmosphere .  of course  communications with santanni have been broken for several hours and sporadic at best for the last week .  it is possible that the ship tried to reach us on a santanni based channel and could not get through  but i doubt it .    no  it s more likely that the arcadia      changed destination .  voreg  perhaps  or sarip .  have you tried either of those worlds  professor .     no   said seldon wearily   but i see no reason if the ship was bound for anacreon that it would not go to anacreon .  commander  it is vital that i locate that ship .     of course   the commander ventured   the arcadia      might not have made it .  out safely  i mean .  there s a lot of fighting going on .  those rebels don t care who they blow up .  they just train their lasers and pretend it s the emperor agis they re blasting .  i tell you  it s a whole different game out here on the fringe  professor .     my daughter in law and granddaughter are on that ship  commander   seldon said in a tight voice .    oh  i m sorry  professor   said an abashed commander .   i ll be in touch with you as soon as i hear anything .    dispiritedly hari closed the visiscreen contact .  how tired i am  he thought .  and  he mused  i m not surprised i ve known that this would come for nearly forty years .   seldon chuckled bitterly to himself .  perhaps that commander had thought he was shocking seldon  impressing him with the vivid detail of life  on the fringe .   but seldon knew all about the fringe .  and as the fringe came apart  like a piece of knitting with one loose thread  the whole piece would unravel to the core  trantor .   seldon became aware of a soft buzzing sound .  it was the door signal .   yes .     grandpa   said wanda  entering the office   i m scared .     why  dear .   asked seldon with concern .  he didn t want to tell her yet what he had learned or hadn t learned from the commander on anacreon .    usually  although they re so far away  i feel dad and mom and bellis  feel them in here  she pointed to her head   and in here  she placed her hand over her heart .   but now  today  i don t feel them it feels less  as if they re fading  like one of the dome bulbs .  and i want to stop it .  i want to pull them back  but i can t .     wanda  i really think this is merely a product of your concern for your family in light of the rebellion .  you know that uprisings occur all over the empire all the time little eruptions to let off steam .  come now  you know that chances of anything happening to raych  manella  or bellis are vanishingly small .  your dad will call any day to say all is well  your mom and bellis will land on anacreon at any moment and enjoy a little vacation .  we are the ones to be pitied we re stuck here up to our ears in work .  so  sweetheart  go to bed and think only good thoughts .  i promise you  tomorrow  under the sunny dome  things will look much better .     all right  grandpa   said wanda  not sounding entirely convinced .   but tomorrow if we haven t heard by tomorrow we ll have to to     wanda  what can we do  except wait .   asked hari  his voice gentle .   wanda turned and left  the weight of her worries showing in the slope of her shoulders .  hari watched her go  finally allowing his own worries to come to the surface .   it had been three days since the hologram transmission from raych .  since then nothing .  and today the naval commander at anacreon denied ever having heard of a ship called arcadia vii  hari had tried earlier to get through to raych on santanni  but all communication beams were down .  it was as if santanni and the arcadia vii had simply broken off from the empire  like a petal from a flower .   seldon knew what he had to do now .  the empire might be down  but it was not out .  its power  when properly wielded  was still awesome .  seldon placed an emergency transmission to emperor agis xiv .        what a surprise my friend hari .   agis s visage beamed at seldon through the holoscreen .   i am glad to hear from you  although you usually request the more formal personal audience .  come  you ve piqued my interest .  why the urgency .     sire   began seldon   my son  raych  and his wife and daughter live on santanni .     ah  santanni   the emperor said as his smile faded .   a bunch of misguided wretches if i ever     sire  please   broke in seldon  surprising both the emperor and himself with this flagrant breach of imperial protocol .   my son was able to get manella and bellis onto a hypership  the arcadia vii  bound for anacreon .  he  however  had to remain .  that was three days ago .  the ship has not landed at anacreon .  and my son seems to have disappeared .  my calls to santanni have gone unanswered and now the communication beams are broken .    please  sire  can you help me .     hari  as you know  officially all ties between santanni and trantor have been severed .  however  i still hold some influence in selected areas of santanni .  that is  there are still a few loyal to me who have not yet been found out .  although i cannot make direct contact with any of my operatives on that world  i can share with you any reports i receive from there .  these are  of course  highly confidential  but considering your situation and our relationship  i will allow you access to those pieces that might interest you .    i am expecting another dispatch within the hour .  if you like  i ll recontact you when it arrives .  in the meantime  i ll have one of my aides go over all transmissions from santanni for the past three days to look for anything pertaining to raych  manella  or bellis seldon .     thank you  sire .  i thank you most humbly .   and hari seldon dipped his head as the emperor s image faded from the holoscreen .   sixty minutes later hari seldon was still sitting at his desk  waiting to hear from the emperor .  the past hour had been one of the most difficult he had ever spent  second only to the hours after dors s destruction .   it was the not knowing that did hari in .  he had made a career of knowing the future as well as the present .  and now he had no idea at all about three of the people most precious to him .   the holoscreen buzzed softly and hari pressed a contact in response .  agis appeared .    hari   began the emperor .  from the soft slow sadness in his voice  hari knew this call brought bad news .    my son   said hari .    yes   replied the emperor .   raych was killed  earlier today  in a bombardment on santanni university .  i ve learned from my sources that raych knew the attack was coming but refused to desert his post .  you see  a good number of the rebels are students and raych felt that if they knew that he was still there  they would never .   .   .  but hate overcame all reason .    the university is  you see  an imperial university .  the rebels feel they must destroy all things imperial before rebuilding anew .  the fools .  why   and here agis stopped  as if suddenly realizing that seldon did not care about santanni university or the plans of the rebels not right now  at least .    hari  if it makes you feel any better  remember that your son died in defense of knowledge .  it was not the empire raych fought and died for but humanity itself .    seldon looked up out of tear filled eyes .  weakly he asked   and manella and little bellis .  what of them .  have you found the arcadia hl .     that search has proved fruitless  hari .  the arcadia vii left santanni  as you were told .  but it seems to have disappeared .  it may have been hijacked by rebels or it may have made an emergency detour at this point  we just don t know .    seldon nodded .   thank you  agis .  although you have brought me tragic news  at least you have brought it .  not knowing was worse .  you are a true friend .     and so  my friend   said the emperor   i ll leave you to yourself now and your memories .   the emperor s image faded from the screen as hari seldon folded his arms in front of him on his desk  put his head down  and wept .       wanda seldon adjusted the waistband of her unisuit  pulling it a little tighter around her middle .  taking up a hand hoe  she attacked some weeds that had sprung up in her small flower garden outside the psychohistory building at streeling .  generally wanda spent the bulk of her time in her office  working with her prime radiant .  she found solace in its precise statistical elegance  the unvarying equations were somehow reassuring in this empire gone so crazy .  but when thoughts of her beloved father  mother  and baby sister became too much to bear  when even her research could not keep her mind off the horrible losses she d so recently undergone  wanda invariably found herself out here  scratching at the terraformed ground  as if coaxing a few plants to life might somehow  in some tiny measure  ameliorate her pain .   since her father s death a month ago and the disappearance of manella and bellis  wanda  who had always been slim  had been losing weight .  whereas a few months ago hari seldon would have been concerned over his darling granddaughter s loss of appetite  now he  stuck in his own grief  seemed not to notice .   a profound change had come over hari and wanda seldon and the few remaining members of the psychohistory project .  hari seemed to have given up .  he now spent most of his days sitting in an armchair in the streeling solarium  staring out at the university grounds  warmed by the bright bulbs overhead .  occasionally project members told wanda that his bodyguard  a man named stettin palver  would badger seldon into a walk out under the dome or try to engage him in a discussion of the future direction of the project .   wanda retreated deeper into her study of the prime radiant s fascinating equations .  she could feel the future her grandfather had worked so hard to achieve finally taking shape  and he was right  the encyclopedists must be established on terminus  they would be the foundation .   and section   a d   in it wanda could see what seldon referred to as the second  or secret  foundation .  but how .  without seldon s active interest  wanda was at a loss as to how to proceed .  and her sorrow over the destruction of her family cut so deep that she didn t seem to have the strength to figure it out .   the members of the project itself  those fifty or so hardy souls who remained  continued their work as well as possible .  the majority were encyclopedists  researching the source materials they would need to copy and catalogue for their eventual move to terminus when and if they gained full access to the galactic library .  at this point  they were working on faith alone .  professor seldon had lost his private office at the library  so the prospects of any other project member gaining special access were slim .   the remaining project members  other than the encyclopedists  were historical analysts and mathematicians .  the historians interpreted past and current human actions and events  turning their findings over to the mathematicians  who in turn fit those pieces into the great psychohistorical equation .  it was long painstaking work .   many project members had left because the rewards were so few psychohistorians were the butt of many jokes on trantor and limited funds had forced seldon to enact drastic pay cuts .  but the constant reassuring presence of hari seldon had till now overcome the difficult working conditions of the project .  indeed  the project members who had stayed on had  to a person  done so out of respect and devotion to professor seldon .   now  thought wanda seldon bitterly  what reason is left for them to stay .  a light breeze blew a piece of her blond hair across her eyes  she pushed it back absentmindedly and continued her weeding .    miss seldon  may i have a moment of your time .   wanda turned and looked up .  a young man she judged him to be in his early twenties  stood on the gravel path next to her .  she immediately sensed him to be strong and fearsomely intelligent .  her grandfather had chosen wisely .  wanda rose to speak with him .    i recognize you .  you are my grandfather s bodyguard  are you not .  stettin palver  i believe .     yes  that s correct  miss seldon   palver said and his cheeks reddened slightly  as if he were pleased that so pretty a girl should have given him any notice .   miss seldon  it is your grandfather i d like to talk to you about .  i m very worried about him .  we must do something .     do what  mr .  palver .  i am at a loss .  since my father  she swallowed hard  as if she were having difficulty speaking  died and my mother and sister disappeared  it is all i can do to get him out of bed in the morning .  and to tell you the truth  it has affected me very deeply as well .  you understand  don t you .   she looked into his eyes and knew that he did .    miss seldon   palver said softly   i am terribly sorry about your losses .  but you and professor seldon are alive and you must keep working at psychohistory .  the professor seems to have given up .  i was hoping that maybe you we could come up with something to give him hope again .  you know  a reason to go on .    ah  mr .  palver  thought wanda  maybe grandpa has it right .    wonder if there truly is any reason to go on .  but she said   i m sorry  mr .  palver  i can think of nothing .   she gestured toward the ground with her hoe .   and now  as you can see  i must get back to these pesky weeds .     i don t think your grandfather has got it right .  i think there truly is a reason to go on .  we just have to find it .    the words struck her with full force .  how had he known what she had been thinking .  unless   you can handle minds  can t you .   wanda asked  holding her breath  as if afraid to hear palver s response .    yes  i can   the young man replied .   i always have  i think .  at least  i can t remember not doing it .  half the time i m not even consciously aware of it i just know what people are thinking or have thought .    sometimes   he continued  encouraged by the understanding he felt emanating from wanda   i get flashes of it coming from someone else .  it s always in a crowd  though  and i can t locate whoever it is .  but i know there are others like me us around .    wanda grabbed palver s hand excitedly  her gardening tool tossed to the ground  forgotten .   have you any idea what this might mean .  for grandpa  for psychohistory .  one of us alone can do only so much  but both of us together   wanda started walking into the psychohistory building  leaving palver standing on the gravel path .  almost to the entrance she stopped and turned .  come  mr .  palver  we must tell my grandfather  wanda said without opening her mouth .  yes    suppose we should  answered palver as he joined her .        do you mean to say i have been searching trantor wide for someone with your powers  wanda  and he s been here with us for the past few months and we never knew it .   hari seldon was incredulous .  he had been dozing in the solarium when wanda and palver shook him awake to give him their amazing news .    yes  grandpa .  think about it .  i ve never had occasion to meet stettin .  your time with him has primarily been away from the project and i spend the majority of my time closeted in my office  working with the prime radiant .  when would we have met .  in fact  the one time our paths did cross  the results were most significant .     when was that .   asked seldon  searching his memory .    your last hearing before judge lih   wanda replied immediately .   remember the eyewitness who swore that you and stettin had attacked those three muggers .  remember how he broke down and told the truth  and even he didn t seem to know why .  but stettin and i have pieced it together .  we were both pushing rial nevas to come clean .  he had been very steadfast in his original claim  i doubt that either one of us would have been able to push him alone .  but together  she stole a shy glance at palver  who was standing off to the side  our power is awesome .    hari seldon took all this in and then made as if to speak .  but wanda continued .   in fact  we plan to spend the afternoon testing our mentalic abilities  separately and together .  from the little we ve discovered so far  it seems as if stettin s power is slightly lower than mine perhaps a five on my rating scale .  but his five  combined with my seven  gives us a twelve .  think of it  grandpa .  awesome .     don t you see  professor .   palver spoke up .   wanda and i are that breakthrough you re looking for .  we can help you convince the worlds of the validity of psychohistory  we can help find others like us  we can help put psychohistory back on track .    hari seldon gazed up at the two young people standing in front of him .  their faces were aglow with youth and vigor and enthusiasm and he realized it did his old heart good .  perhaps all was not lost  after all .  he had not thought he would survive this latest tragedy  the death of his son and the disappearance of his son s wife and child  but now he could see that raych lived on in wanda .  and in wanda and stettin  he now knew  lived the future of the foundation .    yes  yes   agreed seldon nodding forcefully .   come you two  help me up .  i must get back to my office to plan our next step .         professor seldon come in   said chief librarian tryma acarnio in an icy tone of voice .  hari seldon accompanied by wanda and palver  entered the chief librarian s imposing office .    thank you  chief librarian   said seldon as he settled into a chair and faced acarnio across the vast desk .   may i introduce my granddaughter wanda and my friend stettin palver .  wanda is a most valuable member of the psychohistory project  her specialty being in the field of mathematics .  and stettin  well  stettin is turning into a first rate general psychohistorian when he s not performing his duties as my bodyguard  that is .   seldon chuckled amiably .    yes  well  that s all well and good  professor   said acarnio  baffled by seldon s good humor .  he had expected the professor to come in groveling  begging for another chance at special library privileges .    but i don t understand what it is you wanted to see me about .  i assume you realize that our position is firm  we cannot allow a library association with someone so extremely unpopular with the general population .  we are  after all  a public library and we must keep the public s sentiments in mind .   acarnio settled back perhaps now the groveling would begin .    i realize that i have not been able to sway you .  however  i thought that if you heard from a couple of the project s younger members the psychohistorians of tomorrow  as it were that perhaps you d get a better feel about what a vital role the project and the encyclopedia  in particular will play in our future .  please hear wanda and stettin out .    acarnio cast a cold eye toward the two young people flanking seldon .   very well  then   he said  pointedly eyeing the timestrip on the wall .   five minutes and no more .  i have a library to run .     chief librarian   began wanda   as my grandfather has undoubtedly explained to you  psychohistory is a most valuable tool to be used for the preservation of our culture .  yes  preservation    she repeated  upon seeing acarnio s eyes widen at the word .   undue emphasis has been placed on the destruction of the empire .  by doing so  the true value of psychohistory has been overlooked .  for  with psychohistory  as we are able to predict the inevitable decline of our civilization  so are we able to take steps toward its preservation .  that is what the encyclopedia galactica is all about .  and that is why we need your help  and the help of your great library .    acarnio could not resist smiling .  the young lady had an undeniable charm .  she was so earnest  so well spoken .  he gazed at her sitting in front of him  her blond hair pulled back in a rather severe scholarly style  one which could not hide her attractive features but  rather  showed them off .  what she was saying was starting to make sense .  maybe wanda seldon was right maybe he had been looking at this problem from the wrong angle .  if it were actually a matter of preservation  rather than destruction  .   .   .    chief librarian   began stettin palver   this great library has stood for millennia .  it  perhaps even more than the imperial palace  represents the vast power of the empire .  for  the palace houses only the empire s leader  while the library is home to the sum total of imperial knowledge  culture  and history .  its value is incalculable .    does it not make sense to prepare a tribute to this great repository .  the encyclopedia galactica will be just that a giant summary of all the knowledge contained within these very walls .  think of it .    all of a sudden it seemed so very clear to acarnio .  how could he have let the board  especially that sourpuss gennaro mummery  convince him to rescind seldon s privileges .  las zenow  a person whose judgment he greatly esteemed  had been a wholehearted supporter of seldon s encyclopedia .   he glanced again at the three in front of him  waiting for his decision .  the board would be hard pressed to find anything to complain about with the project members if the young people now in his office were a representative sample of the kind of persons involved with seldon .   acarnio rose and walked across his office  his brow furrowed  as if framing his thoughts .  he picked up a milky crystal sphere from a table and hefted it in his palm .    trantor   acarnio began thoughtfully   seat of the empire  center of all the galaxy .  quite amazing  when you think of it .   we have  perhaps  been too quick to judge professor seldon .  now that your project  this encyclopedia galactica  has been presented to me in such a light  he gave a brief nod to wanda and palver  i realize how important it would be to allow you to continue your work here .  and  of course  to grant access to a number of your colleagues .    seldon smiled gratefully and squeezed wanda s hand .    it is not only for the greater glory of the empire that i am recommending this   continued acarnio  apparently warming to the idea  and the sound of his own voice  .   you are famous  professor seldon .  whether people think of you as a crackpot or a genius  everyone seems to have an opinion .  if an academic of your stature is allied with the galactic library  it can only increase our prestige as a bastion of intellectual pursuit of the highest order .  why  the luster of your presence can be used to raise much needed funds to update our collections  increase our staff  keep our doors open to the public longer  .   .   .    and the prospect of the encyclopedia galactica itself what a monumental project .  imagine the reaction when the public learns that the galactic library is involved with such an undertaking designed to highlight the splendor of our civilization our glorious history  our brilliant achievements  our magnificent cultures .  and to think that i  chief librarian tryma acarnio  is responsible for making sure that this great project gets its start   acarnio gazed intently into the crystal sphere  lost in reverie .    yes  professor seldon   acarnio pulled himself back to the here and now .   you and your colleagues will be granted full insiders  privileges and a suite of offices in which to work .   he placed the crystal sphere back on its table and  with a swish of robes  moved back to his desk .    it might take a little doing  of course  to persuade the board but i am confident that i can handle them .  just leave it to me .    seldon  wanda  and palver looked at each other in triumph  with small smiles playing at the corner of their mouths .  tryma acarnio gestured that they could go and so they did  leaving the chief librarian settled in his chair  dreaming of the glory and honor that would come to the library under his aegis .    amazing   said seldon when the three were safely ensconced in their ground car .   if you could have seen him at our last meeting .  he said i was  threatening the essential fabric of our empire  or some such rot .  and today  after just a few minutes with you two     it wasn t too hard  grandpa   wanda said as she pressed a contact  moving the ground car out into traffic .  she sat back as the auto propel took over  wanda had punched their destination coordinates into the control panel .   he is a man with a strong sense of self importance .  all we had to do was play up the positive aspects of the encyclopedia and his ego took over from there .     he was a goner the minute wanda and i walked in   palver said from the back .   with both of us pushing him  it was a piece of cake .   palver reached forward and squeezed wanda s shoulder affectionately .  she smiled  reached up  and patted his hand .    i must alert the encyclopedists as soon as possible   seldon said .   although there are only thirty two left  they are good and dedicated workers .  i ll get them installed at the library and then i ll tackle the next hurdle credits .  perhaps this alliance with the library is what i need to convince people to give us funding .  let s see  i ll call upon terep bindris again and i ll take you two with me .  he was kindly disposed toward me  at least at first .  but how will he be able to resist us now .    the ground car eventually came to a halt outside the psychohistory building at streeling .  the side panels slid open  but seldon did not immediately move to disembark .  he turned to face wanda .    wanda  you know what you and stettin were able to accomplish with acarnio  i m sure you both can push some credits out of a few financial benefactors as well .    i know how you hate to leave your beloved prime radiant  but these visits will give you two a chance to practice  to hone your skills  to get an idea of just what you can do .     all right  grandpa  although i m sure that  now that you have the library s imprimatur  you will find that resistance to your requests has lessened .     there s another reason i think it s important for the two of you to get out and around together .   stettin  i believe you said that on certain occasions you ve  felt  another mind like yours but haven t been able to identify it .     yes   answered palver   i ve had flashes  but each time i was in a crowd .  and  in my twenty four years  i can remember feeling such a flash just four or five times .     but  stettin   said seldon  his voice low with intensity   each flash was  potentially  the mind of another person like you and wanda another mentalic .  wanda s never felt these flashes because  frankly  she s been sheltered all her life .  the few times she s been out in a crowd there must not have been any other mentalics around .    that s one reason perhaps the most important reason for you two to get out with me or without me .  we must find other mentalics .  the two of you alone are strong enough to push a single person .  a large group of you  all pushing together  will have the power to move an empire .    with that .  hari seldon swung his legs around and hoisted himself out of the ground car .  as wanda and palver watched him limp up the pathway to the psychohistory building  they were only dimly aware of the enormous responsibility seldon had just placed on their young shoulders .       it was midafternoon and the trantorian sun glinted on the metal skin covering the great planet .  hari seldon stood at the edge of the streeling university observation deck  attempting to shield his eyes from the harsh glare with his hand .  it had been years since he d been out from under the dome  save for his few visits to the palace  and somehow those didn t count  one was still very much enclosed on the imperial grounds .   seldon no longer traveled around only if accompanied .  in the first place  palver spent the majority of his time with wanda  either working on the prime radiant  absorbed in mentalic research  or searching for others like them .  but if he had wanted  seldon could have found another young man a university student or a project member to act as his bodyguard .   however  seldon knew that a bodyguard was no longer necessary .  since the much publicized hearing and the reestablishment of ties with the galactic library  the commission for public safety had taken a keen interest in seldon .  seldon knew that he was being followed  he had caught sight of his  shadow  on a number of occasions in the past few months .  he also had no doubt that his home and office had been infiltrated by listening devices  but he himself activated a static shield whenever he engaged in sensitive communications .   seldon was not sure what the commission thought of him perhaps they were not yet sure themselves .  regardless of whether they believed him to be a prophet or a crackpot  they made it their business to know where he was at all times and that meant that  until the commission deemed otherwise  at all times seldon was safe .   a light breeze billowed the deep blue cloak seldon had draped over his unisuit and ruffed the few wispy white hairs remaining on his head .  he glanced down over the railing  taking in the seamless steel blanket below .  beneath that blanket  seldon knew  rumbled the machinery of a vastly complicated world .  if the dome were transparent  one would see ground cars racing  gravicabs swooshing through an intricate network of interconnecting tunnels  space hyperships being loaded and unloaded with grain and chemicals and jewels bound for and from practically every world of the empire .   below the gleaming metal cover  the lives of forty billion people were being conducted  with all the attendant pain  joy  and drama of human life .  it was an image he loved dearly this panorama of human achievement and it pierced his heart to know that  in just a few centuries  all that now lay before him would be in ruins .  the great dome would be ripped and scarred  torn away to reveal the desolate wasteland of what was once the seat of a thriving civilization .  he shook his head in sadness  for he knew there was nothing he could do to prevent that tragedy .  but  as seldon foresaw the ruined dome  he also knew that from the ground laid bare by the last battles of the empire living shoots would spring and somehow trantor would reemerge as a vital member of the new empire .  the plan saw to that .   seldon lowered himself onto one of the benches ringing the deck s perimeter .  his leg was throbbing painfully  the exertion of the trip had been a bit much .  but it had been worth it to gaze once again at trantor  to feel the open air around him and see the vast sky above .   seldon thought wistfully of wanda .  he rarely saw his granddaughter at all anymore and invariably stettin palver was present when he did .  in the three months since wanda and palver had met  they seemed to be inseparable .  wanda assured seldon that the constant involvement was necessary for the project  but seldon suspected it went deeper than mere devotion to one s job .   he remembered the telltale signs from his early days with dors .  it was there in the way the two young people looked at each other  with an intensity born not only of intellectual stimulation but emotional motivation as well .   further  by their very natures  wanda and palver seemed to be more comfortable with each other than with other people .  in fact  seldon had discovered that when no one else was around  wanda and palver didn t even talk to each other  their mentalic abilities were sufficiently advanced that they had no need of words to communicate .   the other project members were not aware of wanda s and palver s unique talents .  seldon had felt it best to keep the mentalics  work quiet  at least until their role in the plan was firmly defined .  actually the plan itself was firmly defined but solely in seldon s mind .  as a few more pieces fell into place  he would reveal his plan to wanda and palver and someday  of necessity  to one or two others .   seldon stood slowly  stiffly .  he was due back at streeling in an hour to meet wanda and palver .  they had left word for him that they were bringing a great surprise .  another piece for the puzzle  seldon hoped .  he looked out one last time over trantor and  before turning to make his way back to the gravitic repulsion elevator  smiled and softly said   foundation .        hari seldon entered his office to find that wanda and palver had already arrived and were seated around the conference table at the far end of the room .  as was usual with those two  the room was completely silent .   then seldon stopped short  noticing that a new fellow was sitting with them .  how strange out of politeness  wanda and palver usually reverted to standard speech when in the company of other people  yet none of the three was speaking .   seldon studied the stranger an odd looking man  about thirty five years old  with the myopic look of one caught up for too long in his studies .  if it weren t for a certain determined set to the stranger s jaw  seldon thought he might be dismissed as ineffectual  but that would obviously be a mistake .  there was both strength and kindness in the man s face .  a trustworthy face  seldon decided .    grandfather   wanda said  rising gracefully from her chair .  seldon s heart ached as he looked at his granddaughter .  she d changed so much in the past few months  since the loss of her family .  whereas before she had always called him grandpa  now it was the more formal grandfather .  in the past it seemed she could barely refrain from grins and giggles  lately her serene gaze was lightened only occasionally by a beatific smile .  but now as always she was beautiful and that beauty was surpassed only by her stunning intellect .    wanda  palver   seldon said  kissing the former on the cheek and slapping the latter on the shoulder .    hello   seldon said  turning to the stranger  who had also stood .   i am hari seldon .     i am most honored to meet you  professor   the man replied .   i am bor alurin .   alurin offered a hand to seldon in the archaic and  hence  most formal mode of greeting .    bor is a psychologist  hari   said palver   and a great fan of your work .     more important  grandfather   said wanda   bor is one of us .     one of you .   seldon looked searchingly from one to the other .   do you mean  .   .   .   .   seldon s eyes sparkled .    yes  grandfather .  yesterday stettin and i were walking through ery sector  getting out and around  as you d suggested  probing for others .  all of a sudden wham .  there it was .     we recognized the thought patterns immediately and began to look around  trying to establish a link   palver said  taking up the story .   we were in a commercial area  near the spaceport  so the walkways were clogged with shoppers and tourists and outworld traders .  it seemed hopeless  but then wanda simply stopped and signaled come here and out of the crowd bor appeared .  he just walked up to us and signaled yes .     amazing   seldon said  beaming at his granddaughter .   and dr .  it is doctor  isn t it .  alurin  what do you make of all this .     well   began the psychologist thoughtfully   i am pleased .  i ve always felt different somehow and now i know why .  and if i can be of any help to you  why   the psychologist looked down at his feet  as if all of a sudden he realized he was being presumptuous .   what i mean is  wanda and stettin said i may be able to contribute in some way to your psychohistory project .  professor  nothing would please me more .     yes yes .  that s quite true  dr .  alurin .  in fact  i think you may make a great contribution to the project if you ll join me .  of course  you ll have to give up whatever it is you do now  whether it is teaching or private practice .  can you manage that .     why  yes  professor  of course .  i may need a little help convincing my wife   at this he chuckled slightly  glancing shyly at each of his three companions in turn .   but i seem to have a way with that .     so it s set  then   said seldon briskly .   you will join the psychohistory project .  i promise you  dr .  alurin  this is a decision you will not regret .       wanda  stettin   seldon said later  after bor alurin had left .   this is a most welcome breakthrough .  how quickly do you think you can find more mentalics .     grandfather  it took us over a month to locate bor we cannot predict with what frequency others will be found .    to tell you the truth  all this  out and around  takes us away from our work on the prime radiant and it is distracting as well .  now that i have stettin to  talk  to  verbal communication is somewhat too harsh  too loud .     seldon s smile faded .  he had been afraid of this .  as wanda and palver had been honing their mentalic skills  so their tolerance for  ordinary  life had diminished .  it only made sense  their mentalic manipulations set them apart .    wanda  stettin  i think it may be time for me to tell you more about the idea yugo amaryl had years ago and about the plan i ve devised as a result of that idea .  i haven t been ready to elaborate upon it until now  because until this moment  all the pieces have not been in place .    as you know  yugo felt we must establish two foundations each as a fail safe measure for the other .  it was a brilliant idea  one which i wish yugo could have lived long enough to see realized .   here seldon paused  heaving a regretful sigh .    but i digress .   six years ago  when i was certain that wanda had mentalic  or mind touching  capabilities  it came to me that not only should there be two foundations but that they should be distinct in nature  as well .  one would be made up of physical scientists the encyclopedists will be their pioneer group on terminus .  the second would be made up of true psychohistorians  mentalists you .  that is why i ve been so eager for you to find others like you .    finally  though  is this  the second foundation must be secret .  its strength will lie in its seclusion  in its telepathic omnipresence and omnipotence .    you see  a few years ago  when it became apparent that i would require the services of a bodyguard  i realized that the second foundation must be the strong  silent  secret bodyguard of the primary foundation .    psychohistory is not infallible its predictions are  however  highly probable .  the foundation  especially in its infancy  will have many enemies  as do i today .    wanda  you and palver are the pioneers of the second foundation  the guardians of the terminus foundation .     but how  grandfather .   demanded wanda .   we are just two well  three  if you count bor .  to guard the entire foundation  we would need     hundreds .  thousands .  find however many it takes  granddaughter .  you can do it .  and you know how .    earlier  when relating the story of finding dr .  alurin  stettin said you simply stopped and communicated out to the mentalic presence you felt and he came to you .  don t you see .  all along i ve been urging you to go out and find others like you .  but this is difficult  almost painful for you .  i realize now that you and stettin must seclude yourselves  in order to form the nucleus of the second foundation .  from there you will cast your nets into the ocean of humanity .     grandfather  what are you saying .   wanda asked in a whisper .  she had left her seat and was kneeling next to seldon s chair .   do you want me to leave .     no  wanda   seldon replied  his voice choked with emotion .   i don t want you to leave  but it is the only way .  you and stettin must isolate yourselves from the crude physicality of trantor .  as your mentalic abilities grow stronger  you will attract others to you the silent and secret foundation will grow .    we will be in touch occasionally  of course .  and each of us has a prime radiant .  you see  don t you  the truth and the absolute necessity  of what i am saying  don t you .     yes  i do  grandfather   said wanda .   more important  i feel the brilliance of it as well .  rest assured  we won t let you down .     i know you won t  dear   seldon said wearily .   how could he do this how could he send his darling granddaughter away .  she was his last link to his happiest days  to dors  yugo  and raych .  she was the only other seldon in the galaxy .    i shall miss you terribly  wanda   seldon said as a tear worked its way down his finely creased cheek .    but  grandfather   wanda said as she stood with palver  preparing to leave .   where shall we go .  where is the second foundation .    seldon looked up and said   the prime radiant has already told you  wanda .    wanda looked at seldon blankly  searching her memory .   seldon reached out and clutched at his granddaughter s hand .    touch my mind  wanda .  it is there .   wanda s eyes widened as she reached into seldon s mind .    i see   wanda whispered to seldon .   section   a d   .   star s end .       part v    epilogue      i am hari seldon .  former first minister to emperor cleon i .  professor emeritus of psychohistory at streeling university on trantor .  director of the psychohistory research project .  executive editor of the encyclopedia galactica .  creator of the foundation .   it all sounds quite impressive  i know .  i have done a great deal in my eighty one years and i am tired .  looking back over my life  i wonder if i could have should have done certain things differently .  for instance  was i so concerned with the grand sweep of psychohistory that the people and events that intersected my life sometimes seemed inconsequential by comparison .   perhaps i neglected to make some small incidental adjustments here or there that would have in no way compromised the future of humanity but might have dramatically improved the life of an individual dear to me .   yugo  raych  .   .   .  i can t help but wonder  .   .   .  was there something i could have done to save my beloved dors .   last month i finished recording the crisis holograms .  my assistant  gaal dornick  has taken them to terminus to oversee their installation in the seldon vault .  he will make sure that the vault is sealed and that the proper instructions are left for the eventual openings of the vault  during the crises .   i ll be dead by then  of course .   what will they think  those future foundationers  when they see me  or  more accurately  my hologram  during the first crisis  almost fifty years from now .  will they comment on how old i look or how weak my voice is or how small i seem  bundled in this wheelchair .  will they understand appreciate the message i ve left for them .   ah well  there s really no point in speculating .  as the ancients would say  the die is cast .   i heard from gaal yesterday .  all is going well on terminus .  bor alurin and the project members are flourishing in  exile .   i shouldn t gloat  but i can t help but chuckle when i recall the self satisfied look on the face of that pompous idiot linge chen when he banished the project to terminus two years ago .  although ultimately the exile was couched in terms of an imperial charter   a state supported scientific institution and part of the personal domain of his august majesty  the emperor  the chief commissioner wanted us off trantor and out of his hair  but he could not bear the thought of giving up complete control   it is still a source of secret delight to know that it was las zenow and i who chose terminus as foundation s home .   my one regret where linge chen is concerned is that we were not able to save agis .  that emperor was a good man and a noble leader  even if he was imperial in name only .  his mistake was to believe in his title and the commission of public safety would not tolerate the burgeoning imperial independence .   i often wonder what they did to agis was he exiled to some remote outer world or assassinated like cleon .   the boy child who sits on the throne today is the perfect puppet emperor .  he obeys every word linge chen whispers in his ear and fancies himself a budding statesman .  the palace and trappings of imperial life are but toys to him in some vast fantastical game .   what will i do now .  with gaal finally gone to join the terminus group  i am utterly alone .  i hear from wanda occasionally .  the work at star s end continues on course  in the past decade she and stettin have added dozens of mentalics to their number .  they increasingly grow in power .  it was the star s end contingent my secret foundation who pushed linge chen into sending the encyclopedists to terminus .   i miss wanda .  it has been many years since i ve seen her  sat with her quietly  holding her hand .  when wanda left  even though i had asked her to go  i thought i would die of heartbreak .  that was  perhaps  the most difficult decision i ever had to make and  although i never told her  i almost decided against it .  but for the foundation to succeed  it was necessary for wanda and stettin to go to star s end .  psychohistory decreed it   so perhaps it wasn t really my decision  after all .   i still come here every day  to my office in the psychohistory building .  i remember when this structure was filled with people  day and night .  sometimes i feel as if it s filled with voices  those of my long departed family  students  colleagues but the offices are empty and silent .  the hallways echo with the whirr of my wheelchair motor .   i suppose i should vacate the building  return it to the university to allocate to another department .  but somehow it s hard to let go of this place .  there are so many memories  .   .   .   all i have now is this  my prime radiant .  this is the means by which psychohistory can be computed  through which every equation in my plan may be analyzed  all here in this amazing  small black cube .  as i sit here  this deceptively simple looking tool in the palm of my hand  i wish i could show it to r .  daneel olivaw  .   .   .   but i am alone  and need only to close a contact for the office lights to dim .  as i settle back in my wheelchair  the prime radiant activates  its equations spreading around me in three dimensional splendor .  to the untrained eye  this multicolored swirl would be merely a jumble of shapes and numbers  but for me and yugo  wanda  gaal this is psychohistory  come to life .   what i see before me  around me  is the future of humanity .  thirty thousand years of potential chaos  compressed into a single millennium  .   .   .   that patch  glowing more strongly day by day  is the terminus equation .  and there skewed beyond repair are the trantor figures .  but i can see  .   .   .  yes  softly beaming  a steady light of hope  .   .   .  star s end .   this this was my life s work .  my past humanity s future .  foundation .  so beautiful  so alive .  and nothing can  .   .   .   dors .       seldon  hari   .   .   .  found dead  slumped over his desk in his office at streeling university in        g . e .     f . e .   .  apparently seldon had been working up to his last moments on psychohistorical equations  his activated prime radiant was discovered clutched in his hand  .   .   .   .   according to seldon s instructions  the instrument was shipped to his colleague gaal dornick who had recently emigrated to terminus  .   .   .   .   seldon s body was jettisoned into space  also in accordance with instructions he d left .  the official memorial service on trantor was simple  though well attended .  it is worth noting that seldon s old friend former first minister eto demerzel attended the event .  demerzel had not been seen since his mysterious disappearance immediately following the joranumite conspiracy during the reign of emperor cleon i .  attempts by the commission of public safety to locate demerzel in the days following the seldon memorial proved to be unsuccessful  .   .   .   .   wanda seldon  hari seldon s granddaughter  did not attend the ceremony .  it was rumored that she was grief stricken and had refused all public appearances .  to this day  her whereabouts from then on remain unknown  .   .   .   .   it has been said that hari seldon left this life as he lived it  for he died with the future he created unfolding all around him  .   .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica
