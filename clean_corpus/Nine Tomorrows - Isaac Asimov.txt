just frightful   ly delightful  and with merits all a shine .   it meant a quite full  night  full   friend  of tension  then relief  and attended  with full measure  of the pleasure  of suspended  disbelief .   it is triteful   scarcely rightful   almost spiteful  to declare  that some tiny faults are there .   nothing much   perhaps a touch   and over such  you shouldn t pine .   so let me say  without delay   my pal  my friend   your story s end  has left me gay  and joyfully composed .   p .  s .   oh  yes   i must confess   with some distress   your story is regretfully enclosed .       profession     george platen could not conceal the longing in his voice .  it was too much to suppress .  he said   tomorrow s the first of may .  olympics .    he rolled over on his stomach and peered over the foot of his bed at his roommate .  didn t he feel it  too .  didn t this make some impression on him .   george s face was thin and had grown a trifle thinner in the nearly year and a half that he had been at the house .  his figure was slight but the look in his blue eyes was as intense as it had ever been  and right now there was a trapped look in the way his fingers curled against the bedspread .   george s roommate looked up briefly from his book and took the opportunity to adjust the light level of the stretch of wall near his chair .  his name was hali omani and he was a nigerian by birth .  his dark brown skin and massive features seemed made for calmness  and mention of the olympics did not move him .   he said   i know  george .    george owed much to hali s patience and kindness when it was needed  but even patience and kindness could be overdone .  was this a time to sit there like a statue built of some dark  warm wood .   george wondered if he himself would grow like that after ten years here and rejected the thought violently .  no .   he said defiantly   i think you ve forgotten what may means .    the other said   i remember very well what it means .  it means nothing .  you re the one who s forgotten that .  may means nothing to you  george platen  and   he added softly   it means nothing to me  hali omani .    george said   the ships are coming in for recruits .  by june  thousands and thousands will leave with millions of men and women heading for any world you can name  and all that means nothing .     less than nothing .  what do you want me to do about it  anyway .   omani ran his finger along a difficult passage in the book he was reading and his lips moved soundlessly .   george watched him .  damn it  he thought  yell  scream  you can do that much .  kick at me  do anything .   it was only that he wanted not to be so alone in his anger .  he wanted not to be the only one so filled with resentment  not to be the only one dying a slow death .   it was better those first weeks when the universe was a small shell of vague light and sound pressing down upon him .  it was better before omani had wavered into view and dragged him back to a life that wasn t worth living .   omani .  he was old .  he was at least thirty .  george thought  will i be like that at thirty .  will i be like that in twelve years .   and because he was afraid he might be  he yelled at omani   will you stop reading that fool book .    omani turned a page and read on a few words  then lifted his head with its skullcap of crisply curled hair and said   what .     what good does it do you to read the book .   he stepped forward  snorted  more electronics   and slapped it out of omani s hands .   omani got up slowly and picked up the book .  he smoothed a crumpled page without visible rancor .   call it the satisfaction of curiosity   he said .   i understand a little of it today  perhaps a little more tomorrow .  that s a victory in a way .     a victory .  what kind of a victory .  is that what satisfies you in life .  to get to know enough to be a quarter of a registered electronician by the time you re sixty five .     perhaps by the time i m thirty five .     and then who ll want you .  who ll use you .  where will you go .     no one .  no one .  nowhere .  i ll stay here and read other books .     and that satisfies you .  tell me .  you ve dragged me to class .  you ve got me to reading and memorizing  too .  for what .  there s nothing in it that satisfies me .     what good will it do you to deny yourself satisfaction .     it means i ll quit the whole farce .  i   ll do as i planned to do in the beginning before you dovey lovied me out of it .  i m going to force them to   to      omani put down his book .  he let the other run down and then said   to what  george .     to correct a miscarriage of justice .  a frame up .  i ll get that antonelli and force him to admit he   he      omani shook his head .   everyone who comes here insists it s a mistake .  i thought you d passed that stage .     don t call it a stage   said george violently .   in my case  it s a fact .  i ve told you       you ve told me  but in your heart you know no one made any mistake as far as you were concerned .     because no one will admit it .  you think any of them would admit a mistake unless they were forced to .    well  i ll force them .    it was may that was doing this to george  it was olympics month .  he felt it bring the old wildness back and he couldn t stop it .  he didn t want to stop it .  he had been in danger of forgetting .   he said   i was going to be a computer programmer and i can be one .  i could be one today  regardless of what they say analysis shows .   he pounded his mattress .   they re wrong .  they must be .     the analysts are never wrong .     they must be .  do you doubt my intelligence .     intelligence hasn t one thing to do with it .  haven t you been told that often enough .  can t you understand that .    george rolled away  lay on his back  and stared somberly at the ceiling .    what did you want to be  hali .     i had no fixed plans .  hydroponicist would have suited me  i suppose .     did you think you could make it .     i wasn t sure .    george had never asked personal questions of omani before .  it struck him as queer  almost unnatural  that other people had had ambitions and ended here .  hydroponicist .   he said   did you think you d make this .     no  but here i am just the same .     and you re satisfied .  really  really satisfied .  you re happy .  you love it .  you wouldn t be anywhere else .    slowly  omani got to his feet .  carefully  he began to unmake his bed .  he said   george  you re a hard case .  you re knocking yourself out because you won t accept the facts about yourself .  george  you re here in what you call the house  but i ve never heard you give it its full title .  say it  george  say it .  then go to bed and sleep this off .    george gritted his teeth and showed them .  he chocked out   no .     then i will   said omani  and he did .  he shaped each syllable carefully .   george was bitterly ashamed at the sound of it .  he turned his head away .   for most of the first eighteen years of his life  george platen had headed firmly in one direction  that of registered computer programmer .  there were those in his crowd who spoke wisely of spationautics  refrigeration technology  transportation control  and even administration .  but george held firm .   he argued relative merits as vigorously as any of them  and why not .  education day loomed ahead of them and was the great fact of their existence .  it approached steadily  as fixed and certain as the calendar   the first day of november of the year following one s eighteenth birthday .   after that day  there were other topics of conversation .  one could discuss with others some detail of the profession  or the virtues of one s wife and children  or the fate of one s space polo team  or one s experiences in the education day  however  there was only one topic that unfailingly and unwearyingly held everyone s interest  and that was education day .    what are you going for .  think you ll make it .  heck  that s no good .  look at the records  quota s been cut .  logistics now      or hypermechanics now   or communications now   or gravities now     especially gravities at the moment .  everyone had been talking about gravities in the few years just before george s education day because of the development of the gravitic power engine .   any world within ten light years of a dwarf star  everyone said  would give its eyeteeth for any kind of registered gravities engineer .   the thought of that never bothered george .  sure it would  all the eyeteeth it could scare up .  but george had also heard what had happened before in a newly developed technique .  rationalization and simplification followed in a flood .  new models each year  new types of gravitic engines  new principles .  then all those eyeteeth gentlemen would find themselves out of date and superseded by later models with later educations .  the first group would then have to settle down to unskilled labor or ship out to some backwoods world that wasn t quite caught up yet .   now computer programmers were in steady demand year after year  century after century .  the demand never reached wild peaks  there was never a howling bull market for programmers  but the demand climbed steadily as new worlds opened up and as older words grew more complex .   he had argued with stubby trevelyan about that constantly .  as best friends  their arguments had to be constant and vitriolic and  of course  neither ever persuaded or was persuaded .   but then trevelyan had had a father who was a registered metallurgist and had actually served on one of the outworlds  and a grandfather who had also been a registered metallurgist .  he himself was intent on becoming a registered metallurgist almost as a matter of family right and was firmly convinced that any other profession was a shade less than respectable .    there ll always be metal   he said   and there s an accomplishment in molding alloys to specification and watching structures grow .  now what s a programmer going to be doing .  sitting at a coder all day long  feeding some fool mile long machine .    even at sixteen  george had learned to be practical .  he said simply   there ll be a million metallurgists put out along with you .     because it s good .  a good profession .  the best .     but you get crowded out  stubby .  you can be way back in line .  any world can tape out its own metallurgists  and the market for advanced earth models isn t so big .  and it s mostly the small worlds that want them .  you know what per cent of the turn out of registered metallurgists get tabbed for worlds with a grade a rating .  i looked it up .  it s just    .   per cent .  that means you ll have seven chances in eight of being stuck in some world that just about has running water .  you may even be stuck on earth    .   per cent are .    trevelyan said belligerently   there s no disgrace in staying on earth .  earth needs technicians  too .  good ones .   his grandfather had been an earth bound metallurgist  and trevelyan lifted his finger to his upper lip and dabbed at an as yet nonexistent mustache .   george knew about trevelyan s grandfather and  considering the earth bound position of his own ancestry  was in no mood to sneer .  he said diplomatically   no intellectual disgrace .  of course not .  but it s nice to get into a grade a world  isn t it .    now you take programmers .  only the grade a worlds have the kind of computers that really need first class programmers so they re the only ones in the market .  and programmer tapes are complicated and hardly any one fits .  they need more programmers than their own population can supply .  it s just a matter of statistics .  there s one first class programmer per million  say .  a world needs twenty and has a population of ten million  they have to come to earth for five to fifteen programmers .  right .    and you know how many registered computer programmers went to grade a planets last year .  i ll tell you .  every last one .  if you re a programmer  you re a picked man .  yes  sir .    trevelyan frowned .   if only one in a million makes it  what makes you think you ll make it .    george said guardedly   i ll make it .    he never dared tell anyone  not trevelyan  not his parents  of exactly what he was doing that made him so confident .  but he wasn t worried .  he was simply confident  that was the worst of the memories he had in the hopeless days afterward  .  he was as blandly confident as the average eight year old kid approaching reading day    that childhood preview of education day .   of course  reading day had been different .  partly  there was the simple fact of childhood .  a boy of eight takes many extraordinary things in stride .  one day you can t read and the next day you can .  that s just the way things are .  like the sun shining .   and then not so much depended upon it .  there were no recruiters just ahead  waiting and jostling for the lists and scores on the coming olympics .  a boy or girl who goes through the reading day is just someone who has ten more years of undifferentiated living upon earth s crawling surface  just someone who returns to his family with one new ability .   by the time education day came  ten years later  george wasn t even sure of most of the details of his own reading day .   most clearly of all  he remembered it to be a dismal september day with a mild rain falling .   september for reading day  november for education day  may for olympics .  they made nursery rhymes out of it .   george had dressed by the wall lights  with his parents far more excited than he himself was .  his father was a registered pipe fitter and had found his occupation on earth .  this fact had always been a humiliation to him  although  of course  as anyone could see plainly  most of each generation must stay on earth in the nature of things .   there had to be farmers and miners and even technicians on earth .  it was only the late model  high specialty professions that were in demand on the outworlds  and only a few millions a year out of earth s eight billion population could be exported .  every man and woman on earth couldn t be among that group .   but every man and woman could hope that at least one of his children could be one  and platen  senior  was certainly no exception .  it was obvious to him  and  to be sure  to others as well  that george was notably intelligent and quick minded .  he would be bound to do well and he would have to  as he was an only child .  if george didn t end on an outworld  they would have to wait for grandchildren before a next chance would come along  and that was too far in the future to be much consolation .   reading day would not prove much  of course  but it would be the only indication they would have before the big day itself .  every parent on earth would be listening to the quality of reading when his child came home with it  listening for any particularly easy flow of words and building that into certain omens of the future .  there were few families that didn t have at least one hopeful who  from reading day on  was the great hope because of the way he handled his trisyllabics .   dimly  george was aware of the cause of his parents  tension  and if there was any anxiety in his young heart that drizzly morning  it was only the fear that his father s hopeful expression might fade out when he returned home with his reading .   the children met in the large assembly room of the town s education hall .  all over earth  in millions of local halls  throughout that month  similar groups of children would be meeting .  george felt depressed by the grayness of the room and by the other children  strained and stiff in unaccustomed finery .   automatically  george did as all the rest of the children did .  he found the small clique that represented the children on his floor of the apartment house and joined them .   trevelyan  who lived immediately next door  still wore his hair childishly long and was years removed from the sideburns and thin  reddish mustache that he was to grow as soon as he was physiologically capable of it .   trevelyan  to whom george was then known as jaw jee  said   bet you re scared .     i am not   said george .  then  confidentially   my folks got a hunk of printing up on the dresser in my room  and when i come home  i m going to read it for them .    george s main suffering at the moment lay in the fact that he didn t quite know where to put his hands .  he had been warned not to scratch his head or rub his ears or pick his nose or put his hands into his pockets .  this eliminated almost every possibility .    trevelyan put his hands in his pockets and said   my father isn t worried .    trevelyan  senior  had been a metallurgist on diporia for nearly seven years  which gave him a superior social status in his neighborhood even though he had retired and returned to earth .   earth discouraged these re immigrants because of population problems  but a small trickle did return .  for one thing the cost of living was lower on earth  and what was a trifling annuity on diporia  say  was a comfortable income on earth .  besides  there were always men who found more satisfaction in displaying their success before the friends and scenes of their childhood than before all the rest of the universe besides .   trevelyan  senior  further explained that if he stayed on diporia  so would his children  and diporia was a one spaceship world .  back on earth  his kids could end anywhere  even novia .   stubby trevelyan had picked up that item early .  even before reading day  his conversation was based on the carelessly assumed fact that his ultimate home would be in novia .   george  oppressed by thoughts of the other s future greatness and his own small time contrast  was driven to belligerent defense at once .    my father isn t worried either .  he just wants to hear me read because he knows i   ll be good .  i suppose your father would just as soon not hear you because he knows you ll be all wrong .     i will not be all wrong .  reading is nothing .  on novia  i ll hire people to read to me .     because you won t be able to read yourself  on account of you re dumb .     then how come i ll be on novia .    and george  driven  made the great denial   who says you ll be on novia .  bet you don t go anywhere .    stubby trevelyan reddened .   i won t be a pipe fitter like your old man .     take that back  you dumbhead .     you take that back .    they stood nose to nose  not wanting to fight but relieved at having something familiar to do in this strange place .  furthermore  now that george had curled his hands into fists and lifted them before his face  the problem of what to do with his hands was  at least temporarily  solved .  other children gathered round excitedly .   but then it all ended when a woman s voice sounded loudly over the public address system .  there was instant silence everywhere .  george dropped his fists and forgot trevelyan .    children   said the voice   we are going to call out your names .  as each child is called  he or she is to go to one of the men waiting along the side walls .  do you see them .  they are wearing red uniforms so they will be easy to find .  the girls will go to the right .  the boys will go to the left .  now look about and see which man in red is nearest to you      george found his man at a glance and waited for his name to be called off .  he had not been introduced before this to the sophistications of the alphabet  and the length of time it took to reach his own name grew disturbing .   the crowd of children thinned  little rivulets made their way to each of the red clad guides .   when the name  george platen  was finally called  his sense of relief was exceeded only by the feeling of pure gladness at the fact that stubby trevelyan still stood in his place  uncalled .   george shouted back over his shoulder as he left   yay  stubby  maybe they don t want you .    that moment of gaiety quickly left .  he was herded into a line and directed down corridors in the company of strange children .  they all looked at one another  large eyed and concerned  but beyond a snuffling   quitcher pushing  and  hey  watch out  there was no conversation .  they were handed little slips of paper which they were told must remain with them .  george stared at his curiously .  little black marks of different shapes .  he knew it to be printing but how could anyone make words out of it .  he couldn t imagine .   he was told to strip  he and four other boys who were all that now remained together .  all the new clothes came shucking off and four eight year olds stood naked and small  shivering more out of embarrassment than cold .  medical technicians came past  probing them  testing them with odd instruments  pricking them for blood .  each took the little cards and made additional marks on them with little black rods that produced the marks  all neatly lined up  with great speed .  george stared at the new marks  but they were no more comprehensible than the old .  the children were ordered back into their clothes .   they sat on separate little chairs then and waited again .  names were called again and  george platen  came third .   he moved into a large room  filled with frightening instruments with knobs and glassy panels in front .  there was a desk in the very center  and behind it a man sat  his eyes on the papers piled before him .   he said   george platen .     yes  sir   said george  in a shaky whisper .  all this waiting and all this going here and there was making him nervous .  he wished it were over .   the man behind the desk said   i am dr .  lloyd  george .  how are you .    the doctor didn t look up as he spoke .  it was as though he had said those words over and over again and didn t have to look up any more .    i m all right .     are you afraid  george .     n   no  sir   said george  sounding afraid even in his own ears .    that s good   said the doctor   because there s nothing to be afraid of  you know .  let s see  george .  it says here on your card that your father is named peter and that he s a registered pipe fitter and your mother is named amy and is a registered home technician .  is that right .     y   yes  sir .     and your birthday is february     and you had an ear infection about a year ago .  right .     yes  sir .     do you know how i know all these things .     it s on the card  i think  sir .     that s right .   the doctor looked up at george for the first time and smiled .  he showed even teeth and looked much younger than george s father .  some of george s nervousness vanished .   the doctor passed the card to george .   do you know what all those things there mean  george .    although george knew he did not he was startled by the sudden request into looking at the card as though he might understand now through some sudden stroke of fate .  but they were just marks as before and he passed the card back .   no  sir .     why not .    george felt a sudden pang of suspicion concerning the sanity of this doctor .  didn t he know why not .   george said   i can t read  sir .     would you like to read .     yes  sir .     why  george .    george stared  appalled .  no one had ever asked him that .  he had no answer .  he said falteringly   i don t know  sir .     printed information will direct you all through your life .  there is so much you ll have to know even after education day .  cards like this one will tell you .  books will tell you .  television screens will tell you .  printing will tell you such useful things and such interesting things that not being able to read would be as bad as not being able to see .  do you understand .     yes  sir .     are you afraid  george .     no  sir .     good .  now i ll tell you exactly what we ll do first .  i m going to put these wires on your forehead just over the corners of your eyes .  they ll stick there but they won t hurt at all .  then  i ll turn on something that will make a buzz .  it will sound funny and it may tickle you  but it won t hurt .  now if it does hurt  you tell me  and i ll turn it off right away  but it won t hurt .  all right .    george nodded and swallowed .    are you ready .    george nodded .  he closed his eyes while the doctor busied himself .  his parents had explained this to him .  they  too  had said it wouldn t hurt  but then there were always the older children .  there were the ten  and twelve year olds who howled after the eight year olds waiting for reading day   watch out for the needle .   there were the others who took you off in confidence and said   they got to cut your head open .  they use a sharp knife that big with a hook on it   and so on into horrifying details .   george had never believed them but he had had nightmares  and now he closed his eyes and felt pure terror .   he didn t feel the wires at his temple .  the buzz was a distant thing  and there was the sound of his own blood in his ears  ringing hollowly as though it and he were in a large cave .  slowly he chanced opening his eyes .   the doctor had his back to him .  from one of the instruments a strip of paper unwound and was covered with a thin  wavy purple line .  the doctor tore off pieces and put them into a slot in another machine .  he did it over and over again .  each time a little piece of film came out  which the doctor looked at .  finally  he turned toward george with a queer frown between his eyes .   the buzzing stopped .   george said breathlessly   is it over .    the doctor said   yes   but he was still frowning .    can i read now .   asked george .  he felt no different .   the doctor said   what .   then smiled very suddenly and briefly .  he said   it works fine  george .  you ll be reading in fifteen minutes .  now we re going to use another machine this time and it will take longer .  i m going to cover your whole head  and when i turn it on you won t be able to see or hear anything for a while  but it won t hurt .  just to make sure i m going to give you a little switch to hold in your hand .  if anything hurts  you press the little button and everything shuts off .  all right .    in later years  george was told that the little switch was strictly a dummy  that it was introduced solely for confidence .  he never did know for sure  however  since he never pushed the button .   a large smoothly curved helmet with a rubbery inner lining was placed over his head and left there .  three or four little knobs seemed to grab at him and bite into his skull  but there was only a little pressure that faded .  no pain .   the doctor s voice sounded dimly .   everything all right  george .    and then  with no real warning  a layer of thick felt closed down all about him .  he was disembodied  there was no sensation  no universe  only himself and a distant murmur at the very ends of nothingness telling him something   telling him   telling him     he strained to hear and understand but there was all that thick felt between .   then the helmet was taken off his head  and the light was so bright that it hurt his eyes while the doctor s voice drummed at his ears .   the doctor said   here s your card  george .  what does it say .    george looked at his card again and gave out a strangled shout .  the marks weren t just marks at all .  they made up words .  they were words just as clearly as though something were whispering them in his ears .  he could hear them being whispered as he looked at them .    what does it say  george .     it says   it says    platen  george .  born    february      of peter and amy platen in  .  .  .    he broke off .    you can read  george   said the doctor .   it s all over .     for good .  i won t forget how .     of course not .   the doctor leaned over to shake hands gravely .   you will be taken home now .    it was days before george got over this new and great talent of his .  he read  for his father with such facility that platen  senior  wept and called relatives to tell the good news .   george walked about town  reading every scrap of printing he could find and wondering how it was that none of it had ever made sense to him before .   he tried to remember how it was not to be able to read and he couldn t .  as far as his feeling about it was concerned  he had always been able to read .  always .   at eighteen  george was rather dark  of medium height  but thin enough to look taller .  trevelyan  who was scarcely an inch shorter  had a stockiness of build that made  stubby  more than ever appropriate  but in this last year he had grown self conscious .  the nickname could no longer be used without reprisal .  and since trevelyan disapproved of his proper first name even more strongly  he was called trevelyan or any decent variant of that .  as though to prove his manhood further  he had most persistently grown a pair of sideburns and a bristly mustache .   he was sweating and nervous now  and george  who had himself grown out of  jaw jee  and into the curt monosyllabic gutturability of  george   was rather amused by that .   they were in the same large hall they had been in ten years before  and not since  .  it was as if a vague dream of the past had come to sudden reality .  in the first few minutes george had been distinctly surprised at finding everything seem smaller and more cramped than his memory told him  then he made allowance for his own growth .   the crowd was smaller than it had been in childhood .  it was exclusively male this time .  the girls had another day assigned them .   trevelyan leaned over to say   beats me the way they make you wait .     red tape   said george .   you can t avoid it .    trevelyan said   what makes you so damned tolerant about it .     i ve got nothing to worry about .     oh  brother  you make me sick .  i hope you end up registered manure spreader just so i can see your face when you do .   his somber eyes swept the crowd anxiously .   george looked about  too .  it wasn t quite the system they used on the children .  matters went slower  and instructions had been given out at the start in print  an advantage over the pre readers  .  the names platen and trevelyan were well down the alphabet still  but this time the two knew it .   young men came out of the education rooms  frowning and uncomfortable  picked up their clothes and belongings  then went oft to analysis to learn the results .   each  as he come out  would be surrounded by a clot of the thinning crowd .   how was it .    how d it feel .    whacha think ya made .    ya feel any different .    answers were vague and noncommittal .   george forced himself to remain out of those clots .  you only raised your own blood pressure .  everyone said you stood the best chance if you remained calm .  even so  you could feel the palms of your hands grow cold .  funny that new tensions came with the years .   for instance  high specialty professionals heading out for an outworld were accompanied by a wife  or husband  .  it was important to keep the sex ratio in good balance on all worlds .  and if you were going out to a grade a world  what girl would refuse you .  george had no specific girl in mind yet  he wanted none .  not now .  once he made programmer  once he could add to his name  registered computer programmer  he could take his pick  like a sultan in a harem .  the thought excited him and he tried to put it away .  must stay calm .   trevelyan muttered   what s it all about anyway .  first they say it works best if you re relaxed and at ease .  then they put you through this and make it impossible for you to be relaxed and at ease .     maybe that s the idea .  they re separating the boys from the men to begin with .  take it easy  trev .     shut up .    george s turn came .  his name was not called .  it appeared in glowing letters on the notice board .   he waved at trevelyan .   take it easy .  don t let it get you .    he was happy as he entered the testing chamber .  actually happy .   the man behind the desk said   george platen .    for a fleeting instant there was a razor sharp picture in george s mind of another man  ten years earlier  who had asked the same question  and it was almost as though this were the same man and he  george  had turned eight again as he had stepped across the threshold .   but the man looked up and  of course  the face matched that of the sudden memory not at all .  the nose was bulbous  the hair thin and stringy  and the chin wattled as though its owner had once been grossly overweight and had reduced .   the man behind the desk looked annoyed .   well .    george came to earth .   i m george platen  sir .     say so  then .  i m dr .  zachary antonelli  and we re going to be intimately acquainted in a moment .    he stared at small strips of film  holding them up to the light owlishly .   george winced inwardly .  very hazily  he remembered that other doctor  he had forgotten the name  staring at such film .  could these be the same .  the other doctor had frowned and this one was looking at him now as though he were angry .   his happiness was already just about gone .   dr .  antonelli spread the pages of a thickish file out before him now and put the films carefully to one side .   it says here you want to be a computer programmer .     yes  doctor .     still do .    .    yes  sir .     it s a responsible and exacting position .  do you feel up to it .     yes  sir .     most pre educates don t put down any specific profession .  i believe they are afraid of queering it .     i think that s right  sir .     aren t you afraid of that .     i might as well be honest  sir .    dr .  antonelli nodded  but without any noticeable lightening of his expression .   why do you want to be a programmer .     it s a responsible and exacting position as you said  sir .  it s an important job and an exciting one .  i like it and i think i can do it .    dr .  antonelli put the papers away  and looked at george sourly .  he said   how do you know you like it .  because you think you ll be snapped up by some grade a planet .    george thought uneasily  he s trying to rattle you .  stay calm and stay frank .   he said   i think a programmer has a good chance  sir  but even if i were left on earth  i know i d like it .    that was true enough .  i m not lying  thought george .     all right  how do you know .    he asked it as though he knew there was no decent answer and george almost smiled .  he had one .   he said   i ve been reading about programming  sir .     you ve been what .   now the doctor looked genuinely astonished and george took pleasure in that .    reading about it  sir .  i bought a book on the subject and i ve been studying it .     a book for registered programmers .     yes  sir .     but you couldn t understand it .     not at first .  i got other books on mathematics and electronics .  i made out all i could .  i still don t know much  but i know enough to know i like it and to know i can make it .    even his parents never found that secret cache of books or knew why he spent so much time in his own .  room or exactly what happened to the sleep he missed .    the doctor pulled at the loose skin under his chin .   what was your idea in doing that  son .     i wanted to make sure i would be interested  sir .     surely you know that being interested means nothing .  you could be devoured by a subject and if the physical make up of your brain makes it more efficient for you to be something else  something else you will be .  you know that  don t you .     i ve been told that   said george cautiously .    well  believe it .  it s true .    george said nothing .   dr .  antonelli said   or do you believe that studying some subject will bend the brain cells in that direction  like that other theory that a pregnant woman need only listen to great music persistently to make a composer of her child .  do you believe that .    george flushed .  that had certainly been in his mind .  by forcing his intellect constantly in the desired direction  he had felt sure that he would be getting a head start .  most of his confidence had rested on exactly that point .    i never     he began  and found no way of finishing .    well  it isn t true .  good lord  youngster  your brain pattern is fixed at birth .  it can be altered by a blow hard enough to damage the cells or by a burst blood vessel or by a tumor or by a major infection   each time  of course  for the worse .  but it certainly can t be affected by your thinking special thoughts .   he stared at george thoughtfully  then said   who told you to do this .    george  now thoroughly disturbed  swallowed and said   no one  doctor .  my own idea .     who knew you were doing it after you started .     no one .  doctor  i meant to do no wrong .     who said anything about wrong .  useless is what i would say .  why did you keep it to yourself .     i   i thought they d laugh at me .    he thought abruptly of a recent exchange with trevelyan .  george had very cautiously broached the thought  as of something merely circulating distantly in the very outermost reaches of his mind  concerning the possibility of learning something by ladling it into the mind by hand  so to speak  in bits and pieces .  trevelyan had hooted   george  you ll be tanning your own shoes next and weaving your own shirts .   he had been thankful then for his policy of secrecy .    dr .  antonelli shoved the bits of film he had first looked at from position to position in morose thought .  then he said   let s get you analyzed .  this is getting me nowhere .    the wires went to george s temples .  there was the buzzing .  again there came a sharp memory of ten years ago .   george s hands were clammy  his heart pounded .  he should never have told the doctor about his secret reading .   it was his damned vanity  he told himself .  he had wanted to show how enterprising he was  how full of initiative .  instead  he had showed himself superstitious and ignorant and aroused the hostility of the doctor .   he could tell the doctor hated him for a wise guy on the make .    and now he had brought himself to such a state of nervousness  he was sure the analyzer would show nothing that made sense .   he wasn t aware of the moment when the wires were removed from his temples .  the sight of the doctor  staring at him thoughtfully  blinked into his consciousness and that was that  the wires were gone .  george dragged himself together with a tearing effort .  he had quite given up his ambition to be a programmer .  in the space of ten minutes  it had all gone .   he said dismally   i suppose no .     no what .     no programmer .    the doctor rubbed his nose and said   you get your clothes and whatever belongs to you and go to room    c .  your files will be waiting for you there .  so will my report .    george said in complete surprise   have i been educated already .  i thought this was just to      dr .  antonelli stared down at his desk .   it will all be explained to you .  you do as i say .    george felt something like panic .  what was it they couldn t tell him .  he wasn t fit for anything but registered laborer .  they were going to prepare him for that  adjust him to it .   he was suddenly certain of it and he had to keep from screaming by main force .   he stumbled back to his place of waiting .  trevelyan was not there  a fact for which he would have been thankful if he had had enough self possession to be meaningfully aware of his surroundings .  hardly anyone was left  in fact  and the few who were looked as though they might ask him questions were it not that they were too worn out by their tail of the alphabet waiting to buck the fierce  hot look of anger and hate he cast at them .   what right had they to be technicians and he  himself  a laborer .  laborer .  he was certain .   he was led by a red uniformed guide along the busy corridors lined with separate rooms each containing its groups  here two  there five  the motor mechanics  the construction engineers  the agronomists   there were hundreds of specialized professions and most of them would be represented in this small town by one or two anyway .   he hated them all just then  the statisticians  the accountants  the lesser breeds and the higher .  he hated them because they owned their smug knowledge now  knew their fate  while he himself  empty still  had to face some kind of further red tape .   he reached    c  was ushered in and left in an empty room .  for one moment  his spirits bounded .  surely  if this were the labor classification room  there would be dozens of youngsters present .   a door sucked into its recess on the other side of a waist high partition and an elderly  white haired man stepped out .  he smiled and showed even teeth that were obviously false  but his face was still ruddy and unlined and his voice had vigor .   he said   good evening  george .  our own sector has only one of you this time  i see .     only one .   said george blankly .    thousands over the earth  of course .  thousands .  you re not alone .    george felt exasperated .  he said   i don t understand  sir .  what s my classification .  what s happening .     easy  son .  you re all right .  it could happen to anyone .   he held out his hand and george took it mechanically .  it was warm and it pressed george s hand firmly .   sit down  son .  i m sam ellenford .    george nodded impatiently .   i want to know what s going on  sir .     of course .  to begin with  you can t be a computer programmer  george .  you ve guessed that  i think .     yes  i have   said george bitterly .   what will i be  then .     that s the hard part to explain  george .   he paused  then said with careful distinctness   nothing .     what .     nothing .     but what does that mean .  why can t you assign me a profession .     we have no choice in the matter  george .  it s the structure of your mind that decides that .    george went a sallow yellow .  his eyes bulged .   there s something wrong with my mind .     there s something about it .  as far as professional classification is concerned  i suppose you can call it wrong .     but why .    ellenford shrugged .   i m sure you know how earth runs its educational program  george .  practically any human being can absorb practically any body of knowledge  but each individual brain pattern is better suited to receiving some types of knowledge than others .  we try to match mind to knowledge as well as we can within the limits of the quota requirements for each profession .    george nodded .   yes  i know .     every once in a while  george  we come up against a young man whose mind is not suited to receiving a superimposed knowledge of any sort .     you mean i can t be educated .     that is what i mean .     but that s crazy .  i m intelligent .  i can understand      he looked helplessly about as though trying to find some way of proving that he had a functioning brain .    don t misunderstand me  please   said ellenford gravely .   you re intelligent .  there s no question about that .  you re even above average in intelligence .  unfortunately that has nothing to do with whether the mind ought to be allowed to accept superimposed knowledge or not .  in fact  it is almost always the intelligent person who comes here .     you mean i can t even be a registered laborer .   babbled george .  suddenly even that was better than the blank that faced him .   what s there to know to be a laborer .     don t underestimate the laborer  young man .  there are dozens of subclassifications and each variety has its own corpus of fairly detailed knowledge .  do you think there s no skill in knowing the proper manner of lifting a weight .  besides  for the laborer  we must select not only minds suited to it  but bodies as well .  you re not the type  george  to last long as a laborer .    george was conscious of his slight build .  he said   but i ve never heard of anyone without a profession .     there aren t many   conceded ellenford .   and we protect them .     protect them .   george felt confusion and fright grow higher inside him .    you re a ward of the planet  george .  from the time you walked through that door  we ve been in charge of you .   and he smiled .   it was a fond smile .  to george it seemed the smile of ownership  the smile of a grown man for a helpless child .   he said   you mean  i m going to be in prison .     of course not .  you will simply be with others of your kind .    your kind .  the words made a kind of thunder in george s ear .   ellenford said   you need special treatment .  we ll take care of you .    to george s own horror  he burst into tears .  ellenford walked to the other end of the room and faced away as though in thought .   george fought to reduce the agonized weeping to sobs and then to strangle those .  he thought of his father and mother  of his friends  of trevelyan  of his own shame     he said rebelliously   i learned to read .     everyone with a whole mind can do that .  we ve never found exceptions .  it is at this stage that we discover    exceptions .  and when you learned to read  george  we were concerned about your mind pattern .  certain peculiarities were reported even then by the doctor in charge .     can t you try educating me .  you haven t even tried .  i m willing to take the risk .     the law forbids us to do that  george .  but look  it will not be bad .  we will explain matters to your family so they will not be hurt .  at the place to which you ll be taken  you ll be allowed privileges .  we ll get you books and you can learn what you will .     dab knowledge in by hand   said george bitterly .   shred by shred .  then  when i die i ll know enough to be a registered junior office boy  paper clip division .     yet i understand you ve already been studying books .    george froze .  he was struck devastatingly by sudden understanding .   that s it .  .  .     what is .     that fellow antonelli .  he s knifing me .     no  george .  you re quite wrong .     don t tell me that .   george was in an ecstasy of fury .   that lousy bastard is selling me out because he thought i was a little too wise for him .  i read books and tried to get a head start toward programming .  well  what do you want to square things .  money .  you won t get it .  i m getting out of here and when i finish broadcasting this      he was screaming .   ellenford shook his head and touched a contact .   two men entered on catfeet and got on either side of george .  they pinned his arms to his sides .  one of them used an air spray hypodermic in the hollow of his right elbow and the hypnotic entered his vein and had an almost immediate effect .   his screams cut off and his head fell forward .  his knees buckled and only the men on either side kept him erect as he slept .   they took care of george as they said they would  they were good to him and unfailingly kind   about the way  george thought  he himself would be to a sick kitten he had taken pity on .   they told him that he should sit up and take some interest in life  and then told him that most people who came there had the same attitude of despair at the beginning and that he would snap out of it .   he didn t even hear them .   dr .  ellenford himself visited him to tell him that his parents had been informed that he was away on special assignment .   george muttered   do they know      ellenford assured him at once   we gave no details .    at first george had refused to eat .  they fed him intravenously .  they hid sharp objects and kept him under guard .  hali omani came to be his roommate and his stolidity had a calming effect .   one day  out of sheer desperate boredom  george asked for a book .  omani  who himself read books constantly  looked up  smiling broadly .  george almost withdrew the request then  rather than give any of them satisfaction  then thought  what do i care .   he didn t specify the book and omani brought one on chemistry .  it was in big print  with small words and many illustrations .  it was for teen agers .  he threw the book violently against the wall .   that s what he would be always .  a teen ager all his life .  a pre educate forever and special books would have to be written for him .  he lay smoldering in bed  staring at the ceiling  and after an hour had passed  he got up sulkily  picked up the book  and began reading .   it took him a week to finish it and then he asked for another .    do you want me to take the first one back .   asked omani .   george frowned .  there were things in the book he had not understood  yet he was not so lost to shame as to say so .   but omani said   come to think of it  you d better keep it .  books are meant to be read and reread .    it was that same day that he finally yielded to omani s invitation that he tour the place .  he dogged at the nigerian s feet and took in his surroundings with quick hostile glances .   the place was no prison certainly .  there were no walls  no locked doors  no guards .  but it was a prison in that the inmates had no place to go outside .   it was somehow good to see others like himself by the dozen .  it was so easy to believe himself to be the only one in the world so   maimed .   he mumbled   how many people here anyway .     two hundred and five  george  and this isn t the only place of the sort in the world .  there are thousands .    men looked up as he passed  wherever he went  in the gymnasium  along the tennis courts  through the library  he had never in his life imagined books could exist in such numbers  they were stacked  actually stacked  along long shelves  .  they stared at him curiously and he returned the looks savagely .  at least they were no better than he  no call for them to look at him as though he were some sort of curiosity .   most of them were in their twenties .  george said suddenly   what happens to the older ones .    omani said   this place specializes in the younger ones .   then  as though he suddenly recognized an implication in george s question that he had missed earlier  he shook his head gravely and said   they re not put out of the way  if that s what you mean .  there are other houses for older ones .     who cares .   mumbled george  who felt he was sounding too interested and in danger of slipping into surrender .    you might .  as you grow older  you will find yourself in a house with occupants of both sexes .    that surprised george somehow .   women  too .     of course .  do you suppose women are immune to this sort of thing .    george thought of that with more interest and excitement than he had felt for anything since before that day when   he forced his thought away from that .   omani stopped at the doorway of a room that contained a small closed circuit television set and a desk computer .  five or six men sat about the television .  omani said   this is a classroom .    george said   what s that .     the young men in there are being educated .  not   he added  quickly   in the usual way .     you mean they re cramming it in bit by bit .     that s right .  this is the way everyone did it in ancient times .    this was what they kept telling him since he had come to the house but what of it .  suppose there had been a day when mankind had not known the diatherm oven .  did that mean he should be satisfied to eat meat raw in a world where others ate it cooked .   he said   why do they want to go through that bit by bit stuff .     to pass the time  george  and because they re curious .     what good does it do them .     it makes them happier .    george carried that thought to bed with him .   the next day he said to omani ungraciously   can you get me into a classroom where i can find out something about programming .    omani replied heartily   sure .    it was slow and he resented it .  why should someone have to explain something and explain it again .  why should he have to read and reread a passage  then stare at a mathematical relationship and not understand it at once .  that wasn t how other people had to be .   over and over again  he gave up .  once he refused to attend classes for a week .   but always he returned .  the official in charge  who assigned reading  conducted the television demonstrations  and even explained difficult passages and concepts  never commented on the matter .   george was finally given a regular task in the gardens and took his turn in the various kitchen and cleaning details .  this was represented to him as being an advance  but he wasn t fooled .  the place might have been far more mechanized than it was  but they deliberately made work for the young men in order to give them the illusion of worth while occupation  of usefulness .  george wasn t fooled .   they were even paid small sums of money out of which they could buy certain specified luxuries or which they could put aside for a problematical use in a problemical old age .  george kept his money in an open jar  which he kept on a closet shelf .  he had no idea how much he had accumulated .  nor did he care .   he made no real friends though he reached the stage where a civil good day was in order .  he even stopped brooding  or almost stopped  on the miscarriage of justice that had placed him there .  he would go weeks without dreaming of antonelli  of his gross nose and wattled neck  of the leer with which he would push george into a boiling quicksand and hold him under  till he woke screaming with omani bending over him in concern .   omani said to him on a snowy day in february   it s amazing how you re adjusting .    but that was february  the thirteenth to be exact  his nineteenth birthday .  march came  then april  and with the approach of may he realized he hadn t adjusted at all .   the previous may had passed unregarded while george was still in his bed  drooping and ambitionless .  this may was different .   all over earth  george knew  olympics would be taking place and young men would be competing  matching their skills against one another in the fight for a place on a new world .  there would be the holiday atmosphere  the excitement  the news reports  the self contained recruiting agents from the worlds beyond space  the glory of victory or the consolations of defeat .   how much of fiction dealt with these motifs  how much of his own boyhood excitement lay in following the events of olympics from year to year  how many of his own plans     george platen could not conceal the longing in his voice .  it was too much to suppress .  he said   tomorrow s the first of may .  olympics .    and that led to his first quarrel with omani and to omani s bitter enunciation of the exact name of the institution in which george found himself .   omani gazed fixedly at george and said distinctly   a house for the feeble minded .      george platen flushed .  feeble minded .   he rejected it desperately .  he said in a monotone   i m leaving .   he said it on impulse .  his conscious mind learned it first from the statement as he uttered it .   omani  who had returned to his book  looked up .   what .    george knew what he was saying now .  he said it fiercely   i m leaving .     that s ridiculous .  sit down  george  calm yourself .     oh  no .  i m here on a frame up  i tell you .  this doctor  antonelli  took a dislike to me .  it s the sense of power these petty bureaucrats have .  cross them and they wipe out your life with a stylus mark on some card file .     are you back to that .     and staying there till it s all straightened out .  i m going to get to antonelli somehow  break him  force the truth out of him .   george was breathing heavily and he felt feverish .  olympics month was here and he couldn t let it pass .  if he did  it would be the final surrender and he would be lost for all time .   omani threw his legs over the side of his bed and stood up .  he was nearly six feet tall and the expression on his face gave him the look of a concerned saint bernard .  he put his arm about george s shoulder   if i hurt your feelings      george shrugged him off .   you just said what you thought was the truth  and i m going to prove it isn t the truth  that s all .  why not .  the door s open .  there aren t any locks .  no one ever said i couldn t leave .  i ll just walk out .     all right  but where will you go .     to the nearest air terminal  then to the nearest olympics center .  i ve got money .   he seized the open jar that held the wages he had put away .  some of the coins jangled to the floor .    that will last you a week maybe .  then what .     by then i ll have things settled .     by then you ll come crawling back here   said omani earnestly   with all the progress you ve made to do over again .  you re mad  george .     feeble minded is the word you used before .     well  i m sorry i did .  stay here  will you .     are you going to try to stop me .    omani compressed his full lips .   no  i guess i won t .  this is your business .  if the only way you can learn is to buck the world and come back with blood on your face  go ahead .     well  go ahead .    george was in the doorway now  looking back over his shoulder .   i m going    he came back to pick up his pocket grooming set slowly    i hope you don t object to my taking a few personal belongings .    omani shrugged .  he was in bed again reading  indifferent .   george lingered at the door again  but omani didn t look up .  george gritted his teeth  turned and walked rapidly down the empty corridor and out into the night shrouded grounds .   he had expected to be stopped before leaving the grounds .  he wasn t .  he had stopped at an all night diner to ask directions to an air terminal and expected the proprietor to call the police .  that didn t happen .  he summoned a skimmer to take him to the airport and the driver asked no questions .   yet he felt no lift at that .  he arrived at the airport sick at heart .  he had not realized how the outer world would be .  he was surrounded by professionals .  the diner s proprietor had had his name inscribed on the plastic shell over the cash register .  so and so  registered cook .  the man in the skimmer had his license up  registered chauffeur .  george felt the bareness of his name and experienced a kind of nakedness because of it  worse  he felt skinned .  but no one challenged him .  no one studied him suspiciously and demanded proof of professional rating .   george thought bitterly  who would imagine any human being without one .   he bought a ticket to san francisco on the   a . m .  plane .  no other plane for a sizable olympics center was leaving before morning and he wanted to wait as little as possible .  as it was  he sat huddled in the waiting room  watching for the police .  they did not come .   he was in san francisco before noon and the noise of the city struck him like a blow .  this was the largest city he had ever seen and he had been used to silence and calm for a year and a half now .   worse  it was olympics month .  he almost forgot his own predicament in his sudden awareness that some of the noise  excitement  confusion was due to that .   the olympics boards were up at the airport for the benefit of the incoming travelers  and crowds jostled around each one .  each major profession had its own board .  each listed directions to the olympics hall where the contest for that day for that profession would be given  the individuals competing and their city of birth  the outworld  if any  sponsoring it .   it was a completely stylized thing .  george had read descriptions often enough in the newsprints and films  watched matches on television  and even witnessed a small olympics in the registered butcher classification at the county seat .  even that  which had no conceivable galactic implication  there was no outworlder in attendance  of course  aroused excitement enough .   partly  the excitement was caused simply by the fact of competition  partly by the spur of local pride  oh  when there was a hometown boy to cheer for  though he might be a complete stranger   and  of course  partly by betting .  there was no way of stopping the last .   george found it difficult to approach the board .  he found himself looking at the scurrying  avid onlookers in a new way .   there must have been a time when they themselves were olympic material .  what had they done .  nothing .   if they had been winners  they would be far out in the galaxy somewhere  not stuck here on earth .  whatever they were  their professions must have made them earth bait from the beginning  or else they had made themselves earth bait by inefficiency at whatever high specialized professions they had had .   now these failures stood about and speculated on the chances of newer and younger men .  vultures .   how he wished they were speculating on him .   he moved down the line of boards blankly  clinging to the outskirts of the groups about them .  he had eaten breakfast on the strato and he wasn t hungry .  he was afraid  though .  he was in a big city during the confusion of the beginning of olympics competition .  that was protection  sure .  the city was full of strangers .  no one would question george .  no one would care about george .   no one would care .  not even the house  thought george bitterly .  they cared for him like a sick kitten  but if a sick kitten up and wanders off  well  too bad  what can you do .   and now that he was in san francisco  what did he do .  his thoughts struck blankly against a wall .  see someone .  whom .  how .  where would he even stay .  the money he had left seemed pitiful .   the first shamefaced thought of going back came to him .  he could go to the police    he shook his head violently as though arguing with a material adversary .   a word caught his eye on one of the boards  gleaming there  metallurgist .  in smaller letters  nonferrous .  at the bottom of a long list of names  in flowing script  sponsored by novia .   it induced painful memories  himself arguing with trevelyan  so certain that he himself would be a programmer  so certain that a programmer was superior to a metallurgist  so certain that he was following the right course  so certain that he was clever     so clever that he had to boast to that small minded  vindictive antonelli .  he had been so sure of himself that moment when he had been called and had left the nervous trevelyan standing there  so cocksure .   george cried out in a short  incoherent high pitched gasp .  someone turned to look at him  then hurried on .  people brushed past impatiently pushing him this way and that .  he remained staring at the board  openmouthed .   it was as though the board had answered his thought .  he was thinking  trevelyan  so hard that it had seemed for a moment that of course the board would say  trevelyan  back at him .   but that was trevelyan  up there .  and armand trevelyan  stubby s hated first name  up in lights for everyone to see  and the right hometown .  what s more  trev had wanted novia  aimed for novia  insisted on novia  and this competition was sponsored by novia .   this had to be trev  good old trev .  almost without thinking  he noted the directions for getting to the place of competition and took his place in line for a skimmer .   then he thought somberly  trev made it .  he wanted to be a metallurgist  and he made it .   george felt colder  more alone than ever .   there was a line waiting to enter the hall .  apparently  metallurgy olympics was to be an exciting and closely fought one .  at least  the illuminated sky sign above the hall said so  and the jostling crowd seemed to think so .   it would have been a rainy day  george thought  from the color of the sky  but san francisco had drawn the shield across its breadth from bay to ocean .  it was an expense to do so  of course  but all expenses were warranted where the comfort of outworlders was concerned .  they would be in town for the olympics .  they were heavy spenders .  and for each recruit taken  there would be a fee both to earth  and to the local government from the planet sponsoring the olympics .  it paid to keep outworlders in mind of a particular city as a pleasant place in which to spend olympics time .  san francisco knew what it was doing .   george  lost in thought  was suddenly aware of a gentle pressure on his shoulder blade and a voice saying   are you in line here  young man .    the line had moved up without george s having noticed the widening gap .  he stepped forward hastily and muttered   sorry  sir .    there was the touch of two fingers on the elbow of his jacket and he looked about furtively .   the man behind him nodded cheerfully .  he had iron gray hair  and under his jacket he wore an old fashioned sweater that buttoned down the front .  he said   i didn t mean to sound sarcastic .     no offense .     all right  then .   he sounded cozily talkative .   i wasn t sure you might not simply be standing there  entangled with the line  so to speak  only by accident .  i thought you might be a       a what .   said george sharply .    why  a contestant  of course .  you look young .    george turned away .  he felt neither cozy nor talkative  and bitterly impatient with busybodies .   a thought struck him .  had an alarm been sent out for him .  was his description known  or his picture .  was gray hair behind him trying to get a good look at his face .   he hadn t seen any news reports .  he craned his neck to see the moving strip of news headlines parading across one section of the city shield  somewhat lackluster against the gray of the cloudy afternoon sky .  it was no use .  he gave up at once .  the headlines would never concern themselves with him .  this was olympics time and the only news worth headlining was the comparative scores of the winners and the trophies won by continents  nations  and cities .   it would go on like that for weeks  with scores calculated on a per capita basis and every city finding some way of calculating itself into a position of honor .  his own town had once placed third in an olympics covering wiring technician  third in the whole state .  there was still a plaque saying so in town hall .   george hunched his head between his shoulders and shoved his hands in his pocket and decided that made him more noticeable .  he relaxed and tried to look unconcerned  and felt no safer .  he was in the lobby now  and no authoritative hand had yet been laid on his shoulder .  he filed into the hall itself and moved as far forward as he could .   it was with an unpleasant shock that he noticed gray hair next to him .  he looked away quickly and tried reasoning with himself .  the man had been right behind him in line after all .   gray hair  beyond a brief and tentative smile  paid no attention to him and  besides  the olympics was about to start .  george rose in his seat to see if he could make out the position assigned to trevelyan and at the moment that was all his concern .   the hall was moderate in size and shaped in the classical long oval  with the spectators in the two balconies running completely about the rim and the contestants in the linear trough down the center .  the machines were set up  the progress boards above each bench were dark  except for the name and contest number of each man .  the contestants themselves were on the scene  reading  talking together  one was checking his fingernails minutely .   it was  of course  considered bad form for any contestant to pay any attention to the problem before him until the instant of the starting signal .    george studied the program sheet he found in the appropriate slot in the arm of his chair and found trevelyan s name .  his number was twelve and  to george s chagrin  that was at the wrong end of the hall .  he could make out the figure of contestant twelve  standing with his hands in his pockets  back to his machine  and staring at the audience as though he were counting the house .  george couldn t make out the face .   still  that was trev .   george sank back in his seat .  he wondered if trev would do well .  he hoped  as a matter of conscious duty  that he would  and yet there was something within him that felt rebelliously resentful .  george  professionless  here  watching .  trevelyan  registered metallurgist  nonferrous  there  competing .   george wondered if trevelyan had competed in his first year .  sometimes men did  if they felt particularly confident   or hurried .  it involved a certain risk .  however efficient the educative process  a preliminary year on earth   oiling the stiff knowledge   as the expression went  insured a higher score .   if trevelyan was repeating  maybe he wasn t doing so well .  george felt ashamed that the thought pleased him just a bit .   he looked about .  the stands were almost full .  this would be a well attended olympics  which meant greater strain on the contestants   or greater drive  perhaps  depending on the individual .   why olympics  he thought suddenly .  he had never known .  why was bread called bread .   once he had asked his father   why do they call it olympics  dad .    and his father had said   olympics means competition .    george had said   is when stubby and i fight an olympics  dad .    platen  senior  had said   no .  olympics is a special kind of competition and don t ask silly questions  you ll know all you have to know when you get educated .    george  back in the present  sighed and crowded down into his seat  all you have to know .   funny that the memory should be so clear now .   when you get educated .   no one ever said   if you get educated .    he always had asked silly questions  it seemed to him now .  it was as though his mind had some instinctive foreknowledge of its inability to be educated and had gone about asking questions in order to pick up scraps here and there as best it could .   and at the house they encouraged him to do so because they agreed with his mind s instinct .  it was the only way .   he sat up suddenly .  what the devil was he doing .  falling for that lie .  was it because trev was there before him  an educee  competing in the olympics that he himself was surrendering .   he wasn t feeble minded .  no .   and the shout of denial in his mind was echoed by the sudden clamor in the audience as everyone got to his feet .  the box seat in the very center of one long side of the oval was filling with an entourage wearing the colors of novia  and the word  novia  went up above them on the main board .   novia was a grade a world with a large population and a thoroughly developed civilization  perhaps the best in the galaxy .  it was the kind of world that every earth man wanted to live in someday  or  failing that  to see his children live in .   george remembered trevelyan s insistence on novia as a goal   and there he was competing for it .    the lights went out in that section of the ceiling above the audience and so did the wall lights .  the central trough  in which the contestants waited  became floodlit .   again george tried to make out trevelyan .  too far .   the clear  polished voice of the announcer sounded .   distinguished novian sponsors .  ladies .  gentlemen .  the olympics competition for metallurgist  nonferrous  is about to begin .  the contestants are      carefully and conscientiously  he read off the list in the program .  names .  home towns .  educative years .  each name received its cheers  the san franciscans among them receiving the loudest .  when trevelyan s name was reached  george surprised himself by shouting and waving madly .  the gray haired man next to him surprised him even more by cheering likewise .   george could not help but stare in astonishment and his neighbor leaned over to say  speaking loudly in order to be heard over the hubbub    no one here from my home town  i ll root for yours .  someone you know .    george shrank back .   no .     i noticed you looking in that direction .  would you like to borrow my glasses .     no .  thank you .    why didn t the old fool mind his own business .    the announcer went on with other formal details concerning the serial number of the competition  the method of timing and scoring and so on .  finally  he approached the meat of the matter and the audience grew silent as it listened .    each contestant will be supplied with a bar of nonferrous alloy of unspecified composition .  he will be required to sample and assay the bar  reporting all results correctly to four decimals in per cent .  all will utilize for this purpose a beeman microspectrograph  model fx    each of which is  at the moment  not in working order .    there was an appreciative shout from the audience .    each contestant will be required to analyze the fault of his machine and correct it .  tools and spare parts are supplied .  the spare part necessary may not be present  in which case it must be asked for  and time of delivery thereof will be deducted from final time .  are all contestants ready .    the board above contestant five flashed a frantic red signal .  contestant five ran off the floor and returned a moment later .  the audience laughed good naturedly .    are all contestants ready .    the boards remained blank .    any questions .    still blank .    you may begin .    there was  of course  no way anyone in the audience could tell how any contestant was progressing except for whatever notations went up on the notice board .  but then  that didn t matter .  except for what professional metallurgists there might be in the audience  none would understand anything about the contest professionally in any case .  what was important was who won  who was second  who was third .  for those who had bets on the standings  illegal  but unpreventable  that was all important .  everything else might go hang .   george watched as eagerly as the rest  glancing from one contestant to the next  observing how this one had removed the cover from his microspectrograph with deft strokes of a small instrument  how that one was peering into the face of the thing  how still a third was setting his alloy bar into its holder  and how a fourth adjusted a vernier with such small touches that he seemed momentarily frozen .   trevelyan was as absorbed as the rest .  george had no wav of telling how he was doing .   the notice board over contestant seventeen flashed  focus plate out of adjustment .   the audience cheered wildly .   contestant seventeen might be right and he might  of course  be wrong .  if the latter  he would have to correct his diagnosis later and lose time .  or he might never correct his diagnosis and be unable to complete his analysis or  worse still  end with a completely wrong analysis .   never mind .  for the moment  the audience cheered .   other boards lit up .  george watched for board twelve .  that came on finally   .  sample holder off center .  new clamp depresser needed .    an attendant went running to him with a new part .  if trevelyan was wrong  it would mean useless delay .  nor would the time elapsed in waiting for the part be deducted .  george found himself holding his breath .   results were beginning to go up on board seventeen  in gleaming letters  aluminum     .       magnesium     .       copper     .      .   here and there  other boards began sprouting figures .   the audience was in bedlam .   george wondered how the contestants could work in such pandemonium  then wondered if that were not even a good thing .  a first class technician should work best under pressure .   seventeen rose from his place as his board went red rimmed to signify completion .  four was only two seconds behind him .  another  then another .   trevelyan was still working  the minor constituents of his alloy bar still unreported .  with nearly all contestants standing  trevelyan finally rose  also .  then  tailing off  five rose  and received an ironic cheer .   it wasn t over .  official announcements were naturally delayed .  time elapsed was something  but accuracy was just as important .  and not all diagnoses were of equal difficulty .  a dozen factors had to be weighed .   finally  the announcer s voice sounded   winner in the time of four minutes and twelve seconds  diagnosis correct  analysis correct within an average of zero point seven parts per hundred thousand  contestant number    seventeen  henry anton schmidt of      what followed was drowned in the screaming .  number eight was next and then four  whose good time was spoiled by a five part in ten thousand error in the niobium figure .  twelve was never mentioned .  he was an also ran .   george made his way through the crowd to the contestant s door and found a large clot of humanity ahead of him .  there would be weeping relatives  joy or sorrow  depending  to greet them  newsmen to interview the top scorers  or the home town boys  autograph hounds  publicity seekers and the just plain curious .  girls  too  who might hope to catch the eye of a top scorer  almost certainly headed for novia  or perhaps a low scorer who needed consolation and had the cash to afford it  .   george hung back .  he saw no one he knew .  with san francisco so far from home  it seemed pretty safe to assume that there would be no relatives to condole with trev on the spot .   contestants emerged  smiling weakly  nodding at shouts of approval .  policemen kept the crowds far enough away to allow a lane for walking .  each high scorer drew a portion of the crowd off with him  like a magnet pushing through a mound of iron filings .   when trevelyan walked out  scarcely anyone was left   george felt somehow that he had delayed coming out until just that had come to pass .   there was a cigarette in his dour mouth and he turned  eyes downcast  to walk off .   it was the first hint of home george had had in what was almost a year and a half and seemed almost a decade and a half .  he was almost amazed that trevelyan hadn t aged  that he was the same trev he had last seen .   george sprang forward .   trev .    trevelyan spun about  astonished .  he stared at george and then his hand shot out  george platen  what the devil      and almost as soon as the look of pleasure had crossed his face  it left .  his hand dropped before george had quite the chance of seizing it .    were you in there .   a curt jerk of trev s head indicated the hall .    i was .     to see me .     yes .     didn t do so well  did i .   he dropped his cigarette and stepped on it  staring off to the street  where the emerging crowd was slowly eddying and finding its way into skimmers  while new lines were forming for the next scheduled olympics .   trevelyan said heavily   so what .  it s only the second time i missed .  novia can go shove after the deal i got today .  there are planets that would jump at me fast enough    but  listen  i haven t seen you since education day .  where did you go .  your folks said you were on special assignment but gave no details and you never wrote .  you might have written .     i should have   said george uneasily .   anyway  i came to say i was sorry the way things went just now .     don t be   said trevelyan .   i told you .  novia can go shove   at that i should have known .  they ve been saying for weeks that the beeman machine would be used .  all the wise money was on beeman machines .  the damned education tapes they ran through me were for henslers and who uses henslers .  the worlds in the go man cluster if you want to call them worlds .  wasn t that a nice deal they gave me .     can t you complain to         don t be a fool .  they ll tell me my brain was built for henslers .  go argue .  everything went wrong .  i was the only one who had to send out for a piece of equipment .  notice that .     they deducted the time for that  though .     sure  but i lost time wondering if i could be right in my diagnosis when i noticed there wasn t any clamp depresser in the parts they had supplied .  they don t deduct for that .  if it had been a hensler  i would have known i was right .  how could i match up then .  the top winner was a san franciscan .  so were three of the next four .  and the fifth guy was from los angeles .  they get big city educational tapes .  the best available .  beeman spectrographs and all .  how do i compete with them .  i came all the way out here just to get a chance at a novian sponsored olympics in my classification and i might just as well have stayed home .  i knew it  i tell you  and that settles it .  novia isn t the only chunk of rock in space .  of all the damned      he wasn t speaking to george .  he wasn t speaking to anyone .  he was just uncorked and frothing .  george realized that .   george said   if you knew in advance that the beemans were going to be used  couldn t you have studied up on them .     they weren t in my tapes  i tell you     you could have read   books .    the last word had tailed off under trevelyan s suddenly sharp look .   trevelyan said   are you trying to make a big laugh out of this .  you think this is funny .  how do you expect me to read some book and try to memorize enough to match someone else who knows .     i thought       you try it .  you try     then  suddenly   what s your profession  by the way .   he sounded thoroughly hostile .    well       come on  now .  if you re going to be a wise guy with me  let s see what you ve done .  you re still on earth  i notice  so you re not a computer programmer and your special assignment can t be much .    george said   listen  trev  i m late for an appointment .   he backed away  trying to smile .    no  you don t .   trevelyan reached out fiercely  catching hold of george s jacket .   you answer my question .  why are you afraid to tell me .  what is it with you .  don t come here rubbing a bad showing in my face  george  unless you can take it  too .  do you hear me .    he was shaking george in frenzy and they were struggling and swaying across the floor  when the voice of doom struck george s ear in the form of a policeman s outraged call .    all right now .  all right .  break it up .    george s heart turned to lead and lurched sickeningly .  the policeman would be taking names  asking to see identity cards  and george lacked one .  he would be questioned and his lack of profession would show at once  and before trevelyan  too  who ached with the pain of the drubbing he had taken and would spread the news back home as a salve for his own hurt feelings .   george couldn t stand that .  he broke away from trevelyan and made to run  but the policeman s heavy hand was on his shoulder .   hold on  there .  let s see your identity card .    trevelyan was fumbling for his  saying harshly   i m armand trevelyan  metallurgist  nonferrous .  i was just competing in the olympics .  you better find out about him  though  officer .    george faced the two  lips dry and throat thickened past speech .   another voice sounded  quiet  well mannered .   officer .  one moment .    the policeman stepped back .   yes  sir .     this young man is my guest .  what is the trouble .    george looked about in wild surprise .  it was the gray haired man who had been sitting next to him .  gray hair nodded benignly at george .   guest .  was he mad .   the policeman was saying   these two were creating a disturbance  sir .     any criminal charges .  any damages .     no  sir .     well  then  i ll be responsible .   he presented a small card to the policeman s view and the latter stepped back at once .   trevelyan began indignantly   hold on  now     but the policeman turned on him .    all right  now .  got any charges .     i just       on your way .  the rest of you   move on .   a sizable crowd had gathered  which now  reluctantly  unknotted itself and raveled away .   george let himself be led to a skimmer but balked at entering .   he said   thank you  but i m not your guest .    could it be a ridiculous case of mistaken identity .    but gray hair smiled and said   you weren t but you are now .  let me introduce myself  i m ladislas ingenescu  registered historian .     but       come  you will come to no harm  i assure you .  after all  i only wanted to spare you some trouble with a policeman .     but why .     do you want a reason .  well  then  say that we re honorary towns mates  you and i .  we both shouted for the same man  remember  and we townspeople must stick together  even if the tie is only honorary .  eh .    and george  completely unsure of this man  ingenescu  and of himself as well  found himself inside the skimmer .  before he could make up his mind that he ought to get off again  they were off the ground .   he thought confusedly  the man has some status .  the policeman deferred to him .   he was almost forgetting that his real purpose here in san francisco was not to find trevelyan but to find some person with enough influence to force a reappraisal of his own capacity of education .   it could be that ingenescu was such a man .  and right in george s lap .   everything could be working out fine   fine .  yet it sounded hollow in his thought .  he was uneasy .   during the short skimmer hop  ingenescu kept up an even flow of small talk  pointing out the landmarks of the city  reminiscing about past olympics he had seen .  george  who paid just enough attention to make vague sounds during the pauses  watched the route of flight anxiously .   would they head for one of the shield openings and leave the city altogether .   the skimmer landed at the roof entry of a hotel and  as he alighted  ingenescu said   i hope you ll eat dinner with me in my room .    george said   yes   and grinned unaffectedly .  he was just beginning to realize the gap left within him by a missing lunch .   ingenescu let george eat in silence .  night closed in and the wall lights went on automatically .   george thought  i ve been on my own almost twenty four hours .    and then over the coffee  ingenescu finally spoke again .  he said   you ve been acting as though you think i intend you harm .    george reddened  put down his cup and tried to deny it  but the older man laughed and shook his head .    it s so .  i ve been watching you closely since i first saw you and i think i know a great deal about you now .    george half rose in horror .   ingenescu said   but sit down .  i only want to help you .    george sat down but his thoughts were in a whirl .  if the old man knew who he was  why had he not left him to the policeman .  on the other hand  why should he volunteer help .   ingenescu said   you want to know why i should want to help you .  oh  don t look alarmed .  i can t read minds .  it s just that my training enables me to judge the little reactions that give minds away  you see .  do you understand that .    george shook his head .   ingenescu said   consider my first sight of you .  you were waiting in line to watch an olympics  and your micro reactions didn t match what you were doing .  the expression of your face was wrong  the action of your hands was wrong .  it meant that something  in general  was wrong  and the interesting thing was that  whatever it was  it was nothing common  nothing obvious .  perhaps  i thought  it was something of which your own conscious mind was unaware .    i couldn t help but follow you  sit next to you .  i followed you again when you left and eavesdropped on the conversation between your friend and yourself .  after that  well  you were far too interesting an object of study   i m sorry if that sounds cold blooded   for me to allow you to be taken off by a policeman .     now tell me  what is it that troubles you .    george was in an agony of indecision .  if this was a trap  why should it be such an indirect  roundabout one .  and he had to turn to someone .  he had come to the city to find help and here was help being offered .  perhaps what was wrong was that it was being offered .  it came too easy .   ingenescu said   of course  what you tell me as a social scientist is a privileged communication .  do you know what that means .     no  sir .     it means  it would be dishonorable for me to repeat what you say to anyone for any purpose .  moreover no one has the legal right to compel me to repeat it .    george said  with sudden suspicion   i thought you were a historian .     so i am .     just now you said you were a social scientist .    ingenescu broke into loud laughter and apologized for it when he could talk .   i m sorry  young man  i shouldn t laugh  and i wasn t really laughing at you .  i was laughing at earth and its emphasis on physical science  and the practical segments of it at that .  i ll bet you can rattle off every subdivision of construction technology or mechanical engineering and yet you re a blank on social science .     well  then what is social science .     social science studies groups of human beings and there are many high specialized branches to it  just as there are to zoology  for instance .  for instance  there are culturists  who study the mechanics of cultures  their growth  development  and decay .  cultures   he added  forestalling a question   are all the aspects of a way of life .  for instance it includes the way we make our living  the things we enjoy and believe  what we consider good and bad and so on .  do you understand .     i think i do .     an economist   not an economic statistician  now  but an economist   specializes in the study of the way a culture supplies the bodily needs of its individual members .  a psychologist specializes in the individual member of a society and how he is affected by the society .  a futurist specializes in planning the future course of a society  and a historian    that s where i come in  now .     yes  sir .     a historian specializes in the past development of our own society and of societies with other cultures .    george found himself interested .   was it different in the past .     i should say it was .  until a thousand years ago  there was no education  not what we call education  at least .    george said   i know .  people learned in bits and pieces out of books .     why  how do you know this .     i ve heard it said   said george cautiously .  then   is there any use in worrying about what s happened long ago .  i mean  it s all done with  isn t it .     it s never done with  my boy .  the past explains the present .  for instance  why is our educational system what it is .    george stirred restlessly .  the man kept bringing the subject back to that .  he said snappishly   because it s best .     ah  but why is it best .  now you listen to me for one moment and i ll explain .  then you can tell me if there is any use in history .  even before interstellar travel was developed     he broke off at the look of complete astonishment on george s face .   well  did you think we always had it .     i never gave it any thought  sir .     i m sure you didn t .  but there was a time  four or five thousand years ago when mankind was confined to the surface of earth .  even then  his culture had grown quite technological and his numbers had increased to the point where any failure in technology would have meant mass starvation and disease .  to maintain the technological level and advance it in the face of an increasing population  more and more technicians and scientists had to be trained  and yet  as science advanced  it took longer and longer to train them .    as first interplanetary and then interstellar travel was developed  the problem grew more acute .  in fact  actual colonization of extra solar planets was impossible for about fifteen hundred years because of lack of properly trained men .    the turning point came when the mechanics of the storage of knowledge within the brain was worked out .  once that had been done  it became possible to devise educational tapes that would modify the mechanics in such a way as to place within the mind a body of knowledge ready made so to speak .  but you know about that .    once that was done  trained men could be turned out by the thousands and millions  and we could begin what someone has since called the    filling of the universe .   there are now fifteen hundred inhabited planets in the galaxy and there is no end in sight .    do you see all that is involved .  earth exports education tapes for low specialized professions and that keeps the galactic culture unified .  for instance  the reading tapes insure a single language for all of us .     don t look so surprised  other languages are possible  and in the past were used .  hundreds of them .    earth also exports high specialized professionals and keeps its own population at an endurable level .  since they are shipped out in a balanced sex ratio  they act as self reproductive units and help increase the populations on the outworlds where an increase is needed .  furthermore  tapes and men are paid for in material which we much need and on which our economy depends .  now do you understand why our education is the best way .     yes  sir .     does it help you to understand  knowing that without it  interstellar colonization was impossible for fifteen hundred years .     yes  sir .     then you see the uses of history .   the historian smiled .   and now i wonder if you see why i m interested in you .    george snapped out of time and space back to reality .  ingenescu  apparently  didn t talk aimlessly .  all this lecture had been a device to attack him from a new angle .   he said  once again withdrawn  hesitating   why .     social scientists work with societies and societies are made up of people .     all right .     but people aren t machines .  the professionals in physical science work with machines .  there is only a limited amount to know about a machine and the professionals know it all .  furthermore  all machines of a given sort are just about alike so that there is nothing to interest them in any given individual machine .  but people  ah    they are so complex and so different one from another that a social scientist never knows all there is to know or even a good part of what there is to know .  to understand his own specialty  he must always be ready to study people  particularly unusual specimens .     like me   said george tonelessly .    i shouldn t call you a specimen  i suppose  but you are unusual .  you re worth studying  and if you will allow me that privilege then  in return  i will help you if you are in trouble and if i can .    there were pin wheels whirring in george s mind .      all this talk about people and colonization made possible by education .  it was as though caked thought within him were being broken up and strewn about mercilessly .   he said   let me think   and clamped his hands over his ears .   he took them away and said to the historian   will you do something for me  sir .     if i can   said the historian amiably .    and everything i say in this room is a privileged communication .  you said so .     and i meant it .     then get me an interview with an outworld official  with   with a novian .    ingenescu looked startled .   well  now       you can do it   said george earnestly .   you re an important official .  i saw the policeman s look when you put that card in front of his eyes .  if you refuse  i   i won t let you study me .    it sounded a silly threat in george s own ears  one without force .  on ingenescu  however  it seemed to have a strong effect .   he said   that s an impossible condition .  a novian in olympics month       all right  then  get me a novian on the phone and i   ll make my own arrangements for an interview .     do you think you can .     i know i can .  wait and see .    ingenescu stared at george thoughtfully and then reached for the visiphone .   george waited  half drunk with this new outlook on the whole problem and the sense of power it brought .  it couldn t miss .  it couldn t miss .  he would be a novian yet .  he would leave earth in triumph despite antonelli and the whole crew of fools at the house for the  he almost laughed aloud  feeble minded .   george watched eagerly as the visiplate lit up .  it would open up a window into a room of novians  a window into a small patch of novia transplanted to earth .  in twenty four hours  he had accomplished that much .   there was a burst of laughter as the plate unmisted and sharpened  but for the moment no single head could be seen but rather the fast passing of the shadows of men and women  this way and that .  a voice was heard  clear worded over a background of babble .   ingenescu .  he wants me .    then there he was  staring out of the plate .  a novian .   a genuine novian  george had not an atom of doubt .  there was something completely outworldly about him .  nothing that could be completely defined  or even momentarily mistaken .    he was swarthy in complexion with a dark wave of hair combed rigidly back from his forehead .  he wore a thin black mustache and a pointed beard  just as dark  that scarcely reached below the lower limit of his narrow chin  but the rest of his face was so smooth that it looked as though it had been depilated permanently .   he was smiling .   ladislas  this goes too far .  we fully expect to be spied on  within reason  during our stay on earth  but mind reading is out of bounds .     mind reading  honorable .     confess .  you knew i was going to call you this evening .  you knew i was only waiting to finish this drink .   his hand moved up into view and his eye peered through a small glass of a faintly violet liqueur .   i can t offer you one  i m afraid .    george  out of range of ingenescu s transmitter could not be seen by the novian .  he was relieved at that .  he wanted time to compose himself and he needed it badly .  it was as though he were made up exclusively of restless fingers  drumming  drumming     but he was right .  he hadn t miscalculated .  ingenescu was important .  the novian called him by his first name .   good .  things worked well .  what george had lost on antonelli  he would make up  with advantage  on ingenescu .  and someday  when he was on his own at last  and could come back to earth as powerful a novian as this one who could negligently joke with ingenescu s first name and be addressed as  honorable  in turn   when he came back  he would settle with antonelli .  he had a year and a half to pay back and he     he all but lost his balance on the brink of the enticing daydream and snapped back in sudden anxious realization that he was losing the thread of what was going on .   the novian was saying      doesn t hold water .  novia has a civilization as complicated and advanced as earth s .  we re not zeston  after all .  it s ridiculous that we have to come here for individual technicians .    ingenescu said soothingly   only for new models .  there is never any certainty that new models will be needed .  to buy the educational tapes would cost you the same price as a thousand technicians and how do you know you would need that many .    the novian tossed off what remained of his drink and laughed .   it displeased george  somehow  that a novian should be this frivolous .  he wondered uneasily if perhaps the novian ought not to have skipped that drink and even the one or two before that .    the novian said   that s typical pious fraud  ladislas .  you know we can make use of all the late models we can get .  i collected five metallurgists this afternoon       i know   said ingenescu .   i was there .     watching me .  spying .   cried the novian .   i ll tell you what it is .  the new model metallurgists i got differed from the previous model only in knowing the use of beeman spectrographs .  the tapes couldn t be modified that much  not that much   he held up two fingers close together   from last year s model .  you introduce the new models only to make us buy and spend and come here hat in hand .     we don t make you buy .     no  but you sell late model technicians to landonum and so we have to keep pace .  it s a merry go round you have us on  you pious earthmen  but watch out  there may be an exit somewhere .   there was a sharp edge to his laugh  and it ended sooner than it should have .   ingenescu said   in all honesty  i hope there is .  meanwhile  as to the purpose of my call       that s right  you called .  oh  well  i ve said my say and i suppose next year there ll be a new model of metallurgist anyway for us to spend goods on  probably with a new gimmick for niobium assays and nothing else altered and the next year   but go on  what is it you want .     i have a young man here to whom i wish you to speak .     oh .   the novian looked not completely pleased with that .   concerning what .     i can t say .  he hasn t told me .  for that matter he hasn t even told me his name and profession .    the novian frowned .   then why take up my time .     he seems quite confident that you will be interested in what he has to say .     i dare say .     and   said ingenescu   as a favor to me .    the novian shrugged .   put him on and tell him to make it short .    ingenescu stepped aside and whispered to george   address him as  honorable .     george swallowed with difficulty .  this was it .   george felt himself going moist with perspiration .  the thought had come so recently  yet it was in him now so certainly .  the beginnings of it had come when he had spoken to trevelyan  then everything had fermented and billowed into shape while ingenescu had prattled  and then the novian s own remarks had seemed to nail it all into place .   george said   honorable  i ve come to show you the exit from the merry go round .   deliberately  he adopted the novian s own metaphor .   the novian stared at him gravely .   what merry go round .     you yourself mentioned it  honorable .  the merry go round that novia is on when you come to earth to   to get technicians .    he couldn t keep his teeth from chattering  from excitement  not fear .    the novian said   you re trying to say that you know a way by which we can avoid patronizing earth s mental super market .  is that it .     yes  sir .  you can control your own educational system .     umm .  without tapes .     y   yes  honorable .    the novian  without taking his eyes from george  called out   ingenescu  get into view .    the historian moved to where he could be seen over george s shoulder .   the novian said   what is this .  i don t seem to penetrate .     i assure you solemnly   said ingenescu   that whatever this is it is being done on the young man s own initiative  honorable .  i have not inspired this .  i have nothing to do with it .     well  then  what is the young man to you .  why do you call me on his behalf .    ingenescu said   he is an object of study  honorable .  he has value to me and i humor him .     what kind of value .     it s difficult to explain  a matter of my profession .    the novian laughed shortly .   well  to each his profession .   he nodded to an invisible person or persons outside plate range .   there s a young man here  a prot  g   of ingenescu or some such thing  who will explain to us how to educate without tapes .   he snapped his fingers  and another glass of pale liqueur appeared in his hand .   well  young man .    the faces on the plate were multiple now .  men and women  both  crammed in for a view of george  their faces molded into various shades of amusement and curiosity .   george tried to look disdainful .  they were all  in their own ways  novians as well as the earthman   studying  him as though he were a bug on a pin .  ingenescu was sitting in a corner  now  watching him owl eyed .   fools  he thought tensely  one and all .  but they would have to understand .  he would make them understand .   he said   i was at the metallurgist olympics this afternoon .     you  too .   said the novian blandly .   it seems all earth was there .     no  honorable  but i was .  i had a friend who competed and who made out very badly because you were using the beeman machines .  his education had included only the henslers  apparently an older model .  you said the modification involved was slight .   george held up two fingers close together in conscious mimicry of the other s previous gesture .   and my friend had known some time in advance that knowledge of the beeman machines would be required .     and what does that signify .     it was my friend s lifelong ambition to qualify for novia .  he already knew the henslers .  he had to know the beemans to qualify and he knew that .  to learn about the beemans would have taken just a few more facts  a bit more data  a small amount of practice perhaps .  with a life s ambition riding the scale  he might have managed this       and where would he have obtained a tape for the additional facts and data .  or has education become a private matter for home study here on earth .    there was dutiful laughter from the faces in the background .   george said   that s why he didn t learn  honorable .  he thought he needed a tape .  he wouldn t even try without one  no matter what the prize .  he refused to try without a tape .     refused  eh .  probably the type of fellow who would refuse to fly without a skimmer .   more laughter and the novian thawed into a smile and said   the fellow is amusing .  go on .  i ll give you another few moments .    george said tensely   don t think this is a joke .  tapes are actually bad .  they teach too much  they re too painless .  a man who learns that way doesn t know how to learn any other way .  he s frozen into whatever position he s been taped .  now if a person weren t given tapes but were forced to learn by hand  so to speak  from the start  why  then he d get the habit of learning  and continue to learn .  isn t that reasonable .  once he has the habit well developed he can be given just a small amount of tape knowledge  perhaps  to fill in gaps or fix details .  then he can make further progress on his own .  you can make beeman metallurgists out of your own hensler metallurgists in that way and not have to come to earth for new models .    the novian nodded and sipped at his drink .   and where does everyone get knowledge without tapes .  from interstellar vacuum .     from books .  by studying the instruments themselves .  by thinking .     books .  how does one understand books without education .     books are in words .  words can be understood for the most part .  specialized words can be explained by the technicians you already have .     what about reading .  will you allow reading tapes .     reading tapes are all right  i suppose  but there s no reason you can t learn to read the old way  too .  at least in part .    the novian said   so that you can develop good habits from the start .     yes  yes   george said gleefully .  the man was beginning to understand .    and what about mathematics .     that s the easiest of all  sir   honorable .  mathematics is different from other technical subjects .  it starts with certain simple principles and proceeds by steps .  you can start with nothing and learn .  it s practically designed for that then  once you know the proper types of mathematics  other technical books become quite understandable .  especially if you start with easy ones .     are there easy books .     definitely .  even if there weren t  the technicians you now have can try to write easy books .  some of them might be able to put some of their knowledge into words and symbols .     good lord   said the novian to the men clustered about him .   the young devil has an answer for everything .     i have .  i have   shouted george .   ask me .     have you tried learning from books yourself .  or is this just theory with you .    george turned to look quickly at ingenescu  but the historian was passive .  there was no sign of anything but gentle interest in his face .   george said   i have .     and do you find it works .     yes  honorable   said george eagerly .   take me with you to novia .  i can set up a program and direct       wait  i have a few more questions .  how long would it take  do you suppose  for you to become a metallurgist capable of handling a beeman machine  supposing you started from nothing and did not use educational tapes .    george hesitated .   well   years  perhaps .     two years .  five .  ten .     i can t say  honorable .     well  there s a vital question to which you have no answer  have you .  shall we say five years .  does that sound reasonable to you .     i suppose so .     all right .  we have a technician studying metallurgy according to this method of yours for five years .  he s no good to us during that time  you ll admit  but he must be fed and housed and paid all that time .     but       let me finish .  then when he s done and can use the beeman  five years have passed .  don t you suppose we ll have modified beemans then which he won t be able to use .     but by then hell be expert on learning .  he could learn the new details necessary in a matter of days .     so you say .  and suppose this friend of yours  for instance  had studied up on beemans on his own and managed to learn it  would he be as expert in its use as a competitor who had learned it off the tapes .     maybe not     began george .    ah   said the novian .    wait  let me finish .  even if he doesn t know something as well  it s the ability to learn further that s important .  he may be able to think up things  new things that no tape educated man would .  you ll have a reservoir of original thinkers       in your studying   said the novian   have you thought up any new things .     no  but i m just one man and i haven t studied long         yes .     well  ladies  gentlemen  have we been sufficiently amused .     wait   cried george  in sudden panic .   i want to arrange a personal interview .  there are things i can t explain over the visiphone .  there are details      the novian looked past george .   ingenescu .  i think i have done you your favor .  now  really  i have a heavy schedule tomorrow .  be well .    the screen went blank .   george s hands shot out toward the screen  as though in a wild impulse to shake life back into it .  he cried out   he didn t believe me .  he didn t believe me .    ingenescu said   no  george .  did you really think he would .    george scarcely heard him .   but why not .  it s all true .  it s all so much to his advantage .  no risk .  i and a few men to work with    a dozen men training for years would cost less than one technician .     he was drunk .  drunk .  he didn t understand .    george looked about breathlessly .   how do i get to him .  i ve got to .  this was wrong .  shouldn t have used the visiphone .  i need time .  face to face .  how do i      ingenescu said   he won t see you  george .  and if he did  he wouldn t believe you .     he will  i tell you .  when he isn t drinking .  he      george turned squarely toward the historian and his eyes widened .   why do you call me george .     isn t that your name .  george platen .     you know me .     all about you .    george was motionless except for the breath pumping his chest wall up and down .   ingenescu said   i want to help you  george .  i told you that .  i ve been studying you and i want to help you .    george screamed   i don t need help .  i m not feebleminded .  the whole world is  but i m not .   he whirled and dashed madly for the door .   he flung it open and two policemen roused themselves suddenly from their guard duty and seized him .   for all george s straining  he could feel the hypo spray at the fleshy point just under the corner of his jaw  and that was it .  the last thing he remembered was the face of ingenescu  watching with gentle concern .   george opened his eyes to the whiteness of a ceiling .  he remembered what had happened .  he remembered it distantly as though it had happened to somebody else .  he stared at the ceiling till the whiteness filled his eyes and washed his brain clean  leaving room  it seemed  for new thought and new ways of thinking .   he didn t know how long he lay there so  listening to the drift of his own thinking .   there was a voice in his ear .   are you awake .    and george heard his own moaning for the first tune .  had he been moaning .  he tried to turn his head .   the voice said   are you in pain  george .    george whispered   funny .  i was so anxious to leave earth .  i didn t understand .     do you know where you are .     back in the   the house .   george managed to turn .  the voice belonged to omani .   george said   it s funny i didn t understand .    omani smiled gently   sleep again      and woke again .  his mind was clear .   omani sat at the bedside reading  but he put down the book as george s eyes opened .   george struggled to a sitting position .  he said   hello .     are you hungry .     you bet .   he stared at omani curiously .   i was followed when i left  wasn t i .    omani nodded .   you were under observation at all times .  we were going to maneuver you to antonelli and let you discharge your aggressions .  we felt that to be the only way you could make progress .  your emotions were clogging your advance .    george said  with a trace of embarrassment   i was all wrong about him .     it doesn t matter now .  when you stopped to stare at the metallurgy notice board at the airport  one of our agents reported back the list of names .  you and i had talked about your past sufficiently so that i caught the significance of trevelyan s name there .  you asked for directions to the olympics  there was the possibility that this might result in the kind of crisis we were hoping for  we sent ladislas ingenescu to the hall to meet you and take over .     he s an important man in the government  isn t he .     yes  he is .     and you had him take over .  it makes me sound important .     you are important  george .    a thick stew had arrived  steaming  fragrant .  george grinned wolfishly and pushed his sheets back to free his arms .  omani helped arrange the bed table .  for a while  george ate silently .   then george said   i woke up here once before just for a short time .    omani said   i know .  i was here .     yes  i remember .  you know  everything was changed .  it was as though i was too tired to feel emotion .  i wasn t angry any more .  i could just think .  it was as though i had been drugged to wipe out emotion .     you weren t   said omani .   just sedation .  you had rested .     well  anyway  it was all clear to me  as though i had known it all the time but wouldn   t listen to myself .  i thought  what was it i had wanted novia to let me do .  i had wanted to go to novia and take a batch of un educated youngsters and teach them out of books .  i had wanted to establish a house for the feeble minded   like here   and earth already has them   many of them .    omani s white teeth gleamed as he smiled .   the institute of higher studies is the correct name for places like this .     now i see it   said george   so easily i am amazed at my blindness before .  after all  who invents the new instrument models that require new model technicians .  who invented the beeman spectrographs  for instance .  a man called beeman  i suppose  but he couldn t have been tape educated or how could he have made the advance .     exactly .     or who makes educational tapes .  special tape making technicians .  then who makes the tapes to train them .  more advanced technicians .  then who makes the tapes    you see what i mean .  somewhere there has to be an end .  somewhere there must be men and women with capacity for original thought .     yes  george .    george leaned back  stared over omani s head  and for a moment there was the return of something like restlessness to his eyes .    why wasn t i told all this at the beginning .     oh  if we could   said omani   the trouble it would save us .  we can analyze a mind  george  and say this one will make an adequate architect and that one a good woodworker .  we know of no way of detecting the capacity for original  creative thought .  it is too subtle a thing .  we have some rule of thumb methods that mark out individuals who may possibly or potentially have such a talent .    on reading day  such individuals are reported .  you were  for instance .  roughly speaking  the number so reported comes to one in ten thousand .  by the time education day arrives  these individuals are checked again  and nine out of ten of them turn out to have been false alarms .  those who remain are sent to places like this .    george said   well  what s wrong with telling people that one out of   of a hundred thousand will end at places like these .  then it won t be such a shock to those who do .     and those who don t .  the ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine that don t .  we can t have all those people considering themselves failures .  they aim at the professions and one way or another they all make it .  everyone can place after his or her name  registered something or other .  in one fashion or another every individual has his or her place in society and this is necessary .     but we .   said george .   the one in ten thousand exception .     you can t be told .  that s exactly it .  it s the final test .  even after we ve thinned out the possibilities on education day  nine out of ten of those who come here are not quite the material of creative genius  and there s no way we can distinguish those nine from the tenth that we want by any form of machinery .  the tenth one must tell us himself .     how .     we bring you here to a house for the feeble minded and the man who won t accept that is the man we want .  it s a method that can be cruel  but it works .  it won t do to say to a man   you can create .  do so .   it is much safer to wait for a man to say   i can create  and i will do so whether you wish it or not .   there are ten thousand men like you  george  who support the advancing technology of fifteen hundred worlds .  we can t allow ourselves to miss one recruit to that number or waste our efforts on one member who doesn t measure up .    george pushed his empty plate out of the way and lifted a cup of coffee to his lips .    what about the people here who don t   measure up .     they are taped eventually and become our social scientists .  ingenescu is one .  i am a registered psychologist .  we are second echelon  so to speak .    george finished his coffee .  he said   i still wonder about one thing .     what is that .    george threw aside the sheet and stood up .   why do they call them olympics .        the feeling of power     jehan shuman was used to dealing with the men in authority on long embattled earth .  he was only a civilian but he originated programming patterns that resulted in self directing war computers of the highest sort .  generals consequently listened to him .  heads of congressional committees  too .   there was one of each in the special lounge of new pentagon .  general weider was space burnt and had a small mouth puckered almost into a cipher .  congressman brant was smooth cheeked and clear eyed .  he smoked denebian tobacco with the air of one whose patriotism was so notorious  he could be allowed such liberties .   shuman  tall  distinguished  and programmer first class  faced them fearlessly .   he said   this  gentlemen  is myron aub .     the one with the unusual gift that you discovered quite by accident   said congressman brant placidly .   ah .   he inspected the little man with the egg bald head with amiable curiosity .   the little man  in return  twisted the fingers of his hands anxiously .  he had never been near such great men before .  he was only an aging low grade technician who had long ago failed all tests designed to smoke out the gifted ones among mankind and had settled into the rut of unskilled labor .  there was just this hobby of his that the great programmer had found out about and was now making such a frightening fuss over .   general weider said   i find this atmosphere of mystery childish .     you won t in a moment   said shuman .   this is not something we can leak to the firstcomer .    aub .   there was something imperative about his manner of biting off that one syllable name  but then he was a great programmer speaking to a mere technician .   aub .  how much is nine times seven .    aub hesitated a moment .  his pale eyes glimmered with a feeble anxiety .   sixty three   he said .   congressman brant lifted his eyebrows .   is that right .     check it for yourself  congressman .    the congressman took out his pocket computer  nudged the milled edges twice  looked at its face as it lay there in the palm of his hand  and put it back .  he said   is this the gift you brought us here to demonstrate .  an illusionist .     more than that  sir .  aub has memorized a few operations and with them he computes on paper .     a paper computer .   said the general .  he looked pained .    no  sir   said shuman patiently .   not a paper computer .  simply a sheet of paper .  general  would you be so kind as to suggest a number .     seventeen   said the general .    and you  congressman .     twenty three .     good .  aub  multiply those numbers and please show the gentlemen your manner of doing it .     yes  programmer   said aub  ducking his head .  he fished a small pad out of one shirt pocket and an artist s hairline stylus out of the other .  his forehead corrugated as he made painstaking marks on the paper .   general weider interrupted him sharply .   let s see that .    aub passed him the paper  and weider said   well  it looks like the figure seventeen .    congressman brant nodded and said   so it does  but i suppose anyone can copy figures off a computer .  i think i could make a passable seventeen myself  even without practice .     if you will let aub continue  gentlemen   said shuman without heat .   aub continued  his hand trembling a little .  finally he said in a low voice   the answer is three hundred and ninety one .    congressman brant took out his computer a second time and nicked it   by godfrey  so it is .  how did he guess .     no guess  congressman   said shuman .   he computed that result .  he did it on this sheet of paper .     humbug   said the general impatiently .   a computer is one thing and marks on paper are another .     explain  aub   said shuman .    yes  programmer .     well  gentlemen  i write down seventeen and just underneath it  i write twenty three .  next  i say to myself  seven times three      the congressman interrupted smoothly   now  aub  the problem is seventeen times twenty three .     yes  i know   said the little technician earnestly   but i start by saying seven times three because that s the way it works .  now seven times three is twenty one .     and how do you know that .   asked the congressman .    i just remember it .  it s always twenty one on the computer .  i ve checked it any number of times .     that doesn t mean it always will be  though  does it .   said the congressman .    maybe not   stammered aub .   i m not a mathematician .  but i always get the right answers  you see .     go on .     seven times three is twenty one  so i write down twenty one .  then one times three is three  so i write down a three under the two of twenty one .     why under the two .   asked congressman brant at once .    because     aub looked helplessly at his superior for support .   it s difficult to explain .    shuman said   if you will accept his work for the moment  we can leave the details for the mathematicians .    brant subsided .   aub said   three plus two makes five  you see  so the twenty one become a fifty one .  now you let that go for a while and start fresh .  you multiply seven and two  that s fourteen  and one and two  that s two .  put them down like this and it adds up to thirty four .  now if you put the thirty four under the fifty one this way and add them  you get three hundred and ninety one and that s the answer .    there was an instant s silence and then general weider said   i don t believe it .  he goes through this rigmarole and makes up numbers and multiplies and adds them this way and that  but i don t believe it .  it s too complicated to be anything but hornswoggling .     oh no  sir   said aub hi a sweat   it only seems complicated because you re not used to it .  actually  the rules are quite simple and will work for any numbers .     any numbers  eh .   said the general .   come then .   he took out his own computer  a severely styled gi model  and struck it at random .   make a five seven three eight on the paper .  that s five thousand seven hundred and thirty eight .     yes  sir   said aub  taking a new sheet of paper .    now    more punching of his computer    seven two three nine .  seven thousand two hundred and thirty nine .     yes  sir .     and now multiply those two .     it will take some time   quavered aub .    take the time   said the general .    go ahead  aub   said shuman crisply .   aub set to work  bending low .  he took another sheet of paper and another .  the general took out his watch finally and stared at it .   are you through with your magic making  technician .     i m almost done  sir .     here it is  sir .  forty one million  five hundred and thirty seven thousand  three hundred and eighty two .   he showed the scrawled figures of the result .   general weider smiled bitterly .  he pushed the multiplication contact on his computer and let the numbers whirl to a halt .  and then he stared and said in a surprised squeak   great galaxy  the fella s right .      the president of the terrestrial federation had grown haggard in office and  in private  he allowed a look of settled melancholy to appear on his sensitive features .  the denebian war  after its early start of vast movement matter of maneuver and countermaneuver  with discontent rising steadily on earth .  possibly  it was rising on deneb  too .   and now congressman brant  head of the important committee on military appropriations was cheerfully and smoothly spending his half hour appointment spouting nonsense .    computing without a computer   said the president impatiently   is a contradiction in terms .     computing   said the congressman   is only a system for handling data .  a machine might do it  or the human brain might .  let me give you an example .   and  using the new skills he had learned  he worked out sums and products until the president  despite himself  grew interested .    does this always work .     every time  mr .  president .  it is foolproof .     is it hard to learn .     it took me a week to get the real hang of it .  i think you would do better .     well   said the president  considering   it s an interesting parlor game  but what is the use of it .     what is the use of a newborn baby  mr .  president .  at the moment there is no use  but don t you see that this points the way toward liberation from the machine .  consider  mr .  president   the congressman rose and his deep voice automatically took on some of the cadences he used in public debate   that the denebian war is a war of computer against computer .  their computers forge an impenetrable shield of counter missiles against our missiles  and ours forge one against theirs .  if we advance the efficiency of our computers  so do they theirs  and for five years a precarious and profitless balance has existed .    now we have in our hands a method for going beyond the computer  leapfrogging it  passing through it .  we will combine the mechanics of computation with human thought  we will have the equivalent of intelligent computers  billions of them .  i can t predict what the consequences will be in detail but they will be incalculable .  and if deneb beats us to the punch  they may be unimaginably catastrophic .    the president said  troubled   what would you have me do .       put the power of the administration behind the establishment of a secret project on human computation .  call it project number  if you like .  i can vouch for my committee  but i will need the administration behind me .     but how far can human computation go .     there is no limit .  according to programmer shuman  who first introduced me to this discovery       i ve heard of shuman  of course .     yes .  well  dr .  shuman tells me that in theory there is nothing the computer can do that the human mind can not do .  the computer merely takes a finite amount of data and performs a finite number of operations upon them .  the human mind can duplicate the process .    the president considered that .  he said   if shuman says this  i am inclined to believe him   in theory .  but  in practice  how can anyone know how a computer works .    brant laughed genially .   well  mr .  president  i asked the same question .  it seems that at one time computers were designed directly by human beings .  those were simple computers  of course  this being before the time of the rational use of computers to design more advanced computers had been established .     yes  yes .  go on .     technician aub apparently had  as his hobby  the reconstruction of some of these ancient devices and in so doing he studied the details of their workings and found he could imitate them .  the multiplication i just performed for you is an imitation of the workings of a computer .     amazing .    the congressman coughed gently   if i may make another point  mr .  president    the further we can develop this thing  the more we can divert our federal effort from computer production and computer maintenance .  as the human brain takes over  more of our energy can be directed into peacetime pursuits and the impingement of war on the ordinary man will be less .  this will be most advantageous for the party in power  of course .     ah   said the president   i see your point .  well  sit down  congressman  sit down .  i want some time to think about this .     but meanwhile  show me that multiplication trick again .  let s see if i can t catch the point of it .    programmer shuman did not try to hurry matters .  loesser was conservative  very conservative  and liked to deal with computers as his father and grandfather had .   still  he controlled the west european computer combine  and if he could be persuaded to join project number in full enthusiasm  a great deal would be accomplished .   but loesser was holding back .  he said   i m not sure i like the idea of relaxing our hold on computers .  the human mind is a capricious thing .  the computer will give the same answer to the same problem each time .  what guarantee have we that the human mind will do the same .     the human mind  computer loesser  only manipulates facts .  it doesn t matter whether the human mind or a machine does it .  they are just tools .     yes  yes .  i ve gone over your ingenious demonstration that the mind can duplicate the computer but it seems to me a little in the air .  i ll grant the theory but what reason have we for thinking that theory can be converted to practice .     i think we have reason  sir .  after all  computers have not always existed .  the cave men with their triremes  stone axes  and railroads had no computers .     and possibly they did not compute .     you know better than that .  even the building of a railroad or a ziggurat called for some computing  and that must have been without computers as we know them .     do you suggest they computed in the fashion you demonstrate .     probably not .  after all  this method   we call it  graphitics   by the way  from the old european word  graph     meaning  to write    is developed from the computers themselves so it cannot have antedated them .  still  the cave men must have had some method  eh .     lost arts .  if you re going to talk about lost arts       no  no .  i m not a lost art enthusiast  though i don t say there may not be some .  after all  man was eating grain before hydroponics  and if the primitives ate grain  they must have grown it in soil .  what else could they have done .     i don t know  but i ll believe in soil growing when i see someone grow grain in soil .  and i ll believe in making fire by rubbing two pieces of flint together when i see that  too .    shuman grew placative .   well  let s stick to graphitics .  it s just part of the process of etherealization .  transportation by means of bulky contrivances is giving way to direct mass transference .  communications devices become less massive and more efficient constantly .  for that matter  compare your pocket computer with the massive jobs of a thousand years ago .  why not  then  the last step of doing away with computers altogether .  come  sir  project number is a going concern  progress is already headlong .  but we want your help .  if patriotism doesn t move you  consider the intellectual adventure involved .    loesser said skeptically   what progress .  what can you do beyond multiplication .  can you integrate a transcendental function .     in time  sir .  in time .  in the last month i have learned to handle division .  i can determine  and correctly  integral quotients and decimal quotients .     decimal quotients .  to how many places .    programmer shuman tried to keep his tone casual .   any number .    loesser s lower jaw dropped .   without a computer .     set me a problem .     divide twenty seven by thirteen .  take it to six places .    five minutes later  shuman said   two point oh seven six nine two three .    loesser checked it .   well  now  that s amazing .  multiplication didn t impress me too much because it involved integers after all  and i thought trick manipulation might do it .  but decimals       and that is not all .  there is a new development that is  so far  top secret and which  strictly speaking  i ought not to mention .  still    we may have made a breakthrough on the square root front .     square roots .     it involves some tricky points and we haven t licked the bugs yet  but technician aub  the man who invented the science and who has an amazing intuition in connection with it  maintains he has the problem almost solved .  and he is only a technician .  a man like yourself  a trained and talented mathematician ought to have no difficulty .     square roots   muttered loesser  attracted .    cube roots  too .  are you with us .    loesser s hand thrust out suddenly   count me in .    general weider stumped his way back and forth at the head of the room and addressed his listeners after the fashion of a savage teacher facing a group of recalcitrant students .  it made no difference to the general that they were the civilian scientists heading project number .  the general was the over all head  and he so considered himself at every waking moment .   he said   now square roots are all fine .  i can t do them myself and i don t understand the methods  but they re fine .  still  the project will not be sidetracked into what some of you call the fundamentals .  you can play with graphitics any way you want to after the war is over  but right now we have specific and very practical problems to solve .    in a far corner  technician aub listened with painful attention .  he was no longer a technician  of course  having been relieved of his duties and assigned to the project  with a fine sounding title and good pay .  but  of course  the social distinction remained and the highly placed scientific leaders could never bring themselves to admit him to their ranks on a footing of equality .  nor  to do aub justice  did he  himself  wish it .  he was as uncomfortable with them as they with him .   the general was saying   our goal is a simple one  gentlemen  the replacement of the computer .  a ship that can navigate space without a computer on board can be constructed in one fifth the time and at one tenth the expense of a computer laden ship .  we could build fleets five times  ten times  as great as deneb could if we could but eliminate the computer .    and i see something even beyond this .  it may be fantastic now  a mere dream  but in the future i see the manned missile .    there was an instant murmur from the audience .   the general drove on .   at the present time  our chief bottleneck is the fact that missiles are limited in intelligence .  the computer controlling them can only be so large  and for that reason they can meet the changing nature of anti missile defenses in an unsatisfactory way .  few missiles  if any  accomplish their goal and missile warfare is coming to a dead end  for the enemy  fortunately  as well as for ourselves .    on the other hand  a missile with a man or two within  controlling flight by graphitics  would be lighter  more mobile  more intelligent .  it would give us a lead that might well mean the margin of victory .  besides which  gentlemen  the exigencies of war compel us to remember one thing .  a man is much more dispensable than a computer .  manned missiles could be launched in numbers and under circumstances that no good general would care to undertake as far as computer directed missiles are concerned      he said much more but technician aub did not wait .   technician aub  in the privacy of his quarters  labored long over the note he was leaving behind .  it read finally as follows    when i began the study of what is now called graphitics  it was no more than a hobby .  i saw no more in it than an interesting amusement  an exercise of mind .    when project number began  i thought that others were wiser than i  that graphitics might be put to practical use as a benefit to mankind  to aid in the production of really practical mass transference devices perhaps .  but now i see it is to be used only for death and destruction .    i cannot face the responsibility involved in having invented graphitics .    he then deliberately turned the focus of a protein depolarizer on himself and fell instantly and painlessly dead .   they stood over the grave of the little technician while tribute was paid to the greatness of his discovery .   programmer shuman bowed his head along with the rest of them  but remained unmoved .  the technician had done his share and was no longer needed  after all .  he might have started graphitics  but now that it had started  it would carry on by itself overwhelmingly  triumphantly  until manned missiles were possible with who knew what else .   nine times seven  thought shuman with deep satisfaction  is sixty three  and i don t need a computer to tell me so .  the computer is in my own head .   and it was amazing the feeling of power that gave him .       the dying night     part      it was almost a class reunion  and though it was marked by joylessness  there was no reason as yet to think it would be marred by tragedy .   edward talliaferro  fresh from the moon and without his gravity legs yet  met the other two in stanley kaunas s room .  kaunas rose to greet him in a subdued manner .  battersley ryger merely sat and nodded .   talliaferro lowered his large body carefully to the couch  very aware of its unusual weight .  he grimaced a little  his plump lips twisting inside the rim of hair that surrounded his mouth on lip  chin  and cheek .   they had seen one another earlier that day under more formal conditions .  now for the first time they were alone  and talliaferro said   this is a kind of occasion .  we re meeting for the first time in ten years .  first time since graduation  in fact .    ryger s nose twitched .  it had been broken shortly before that same graduation and he had received his degree in astronomy with a bandage disfiguring his face .  he said grumpily   anyone ordered champagne .  or something .    talliaferro said   come on .  first big interplanetary astronomical convention in history is no place for glooming .  and among friends  too .    kaunas said suddenly   it s earth .  it doesn t feel right .  i can t get used to it .   he shook his head but his look of depression was not detachable .  it remained .   talliaferro said   i know .  i m so heavy .  it takes all the energy out of me .  at that  you re better off than i am  kaunas .  mercurian gravity is   .   normal .  on the moon  it s only   .    .   he interrupted ryger s beginning of a sound by saying   and on ceres they use pseudo grav fields adjusted to   .   .  you have no problems at all  ryger .    the cerian astronomer looked annoyed   it s the open air .  going outside without a suit gets me .     right   agreed kaunas   and letting the sun beat down on you .  just letting it    talliaferro found himself insensibly drifting back in time .  they had not changed much .  nor  he thought  had he himself .  they were all ten years older  of course .  ryger had put on some weight and kaunas s thin face had grown a bit leathery  but he would have recognized either if he had met him without warning .   he said   i don t think it s earth getting us .  let s face it .    kaunas looked up sharply .  he was a little fellow with quick  nervous movements of his hands .  he habitually wore clothes that looked a shade too large for him .   he said   villiers .  i know .  i think about him sometimes .   then  with an air of desperation   i got a letter from him .    ryger sat upright  his olive complexion darkening further and said with energy   you did .  when .     a month ago .    ryger turned to talliaferro .   how about you .    talliaferro blinked placidly and nodded .   ryger said   he s gone crazy .  he claims he s discovered a practical method of mass transference through space .      he told you two also .     that s it  then .  he was always a little bent .  now he s broken .    he rubbed his nose fiercely and talliaferro thought of the day villiers had broken it .   for ten years  villiers had haunted them like the vague shadow of a guilt that wasn t really theirs .  they had gone through their graduate work together  four picked and dedicated men being trained for a profession that had reached new heights in this age of interplanetary travel .   the observatories were opening on the other worlds  surrounded by vacuum  unblurred by air .   there was the lunar observatory  from which earth and the inner planets could be studied  a silent world in whose sky the home planet hung suspended .   mercury observatory  closest to the sun  perched at mercury s north pole  where the terminator moved scarcely at all  and the sun was fixed on the horizon and could be studied in the minutest detail .   ceres observatory  newest  most modern  with its range extending from jupiter to the outermost galaxies .   there were disadvantages  of course .  with interplanetary travel still difficult  leaves would be few  anything like normal life virtually impossible  but this was a lucky generation .  coming scientists would find the fields of knowledge well reaped and  until the invention of an interstellar drive  no new horizon as capacious as this one would be opened .   each of these lucky four  talliaferro  ryger  kaunas  and villiers  was to be in the position of a galileo  who by owning the first real telescope  could not point it anywhere in the sky without making a major discovery .   but then romero villiers had fallen sick and it was rheumatic fever .  whose fault was that .  his heart had been left leaking and limping .   he was the most brilliant of the four  the most hopeful  the most intense   and he could not even finish his schooling and get his doctorate .   worse than that  he could never leave earth  the acceleration of a spaceship s take off would kill him .   talliaferro was marked for the moon  ryger for ceres  kaunas for mercury .  only villiers stayed behind  a life prisoner of earth .   they had tried telling their sympathy and villiers had rejected it with something approaching hate .  he had railed at them and cursed them .  when ryger lost his temper and lifted his fist  villiers had sprung at him  screaming  and had broken ryger s nose .   obviously ryger hadn t forgotten that  as he caressed his nose gingerly with one finger .   kaunas s forehead was an uncertain washboard of wrinkles .   he s at the convention  you know .  he s got a room in the hotel       .     i won t see him   said ryger .    he s coming up here .  he said he wanted to see us .  i thought   he said nine .  he ll be here any minute .     in that case   said ryger   if you don t mind  i m leaving .   he rose .   talliaferro said   oh  wait a while .  what s the harm in seeing him .     because there s no point .  he s mad .     even so .  let s not be petty about it .  are you afraid of him .     afraid .   ryger looked contemptuous .    nervous  then .  what is there to be nervous about .     i m not nervous   said ryger .    sure you are .  we all feel guilty about him  and without real reason .  nothing that happened was our fault .   but he was speaking defensively and he knew it .   and when  at that point  the door signal sounded  all three jumped and turned to stare uneasily at the barrier that stood between themselves and villiers .   the door opened and romero villiers walked in .  the others rose stiffly to greet him  then remained standing in embarrassment  without one hand being raised .   he stared them down sardonically .   he s changed  thought talliaferro .   he had .  he had shrunken in almost every dimension .  a gathering stoop made him seem even shorter .  the skin of his scalp glistened through thinning hair  the skin on the back of his hands was ridged crookedly with bluish veins .  he looked ill .  there seemed nothing to link him to the memory of the past except for his trick of shading his eyes with one hand when he stared intently and  when he spoke  the even  controlled baritone of his voice .   he said   my friends .  my space trotting friends .  we ve lost touch .    talliaferro said   hello  villiers .    villiers eyed him .   are you well .     well enough .     and you two .    kaunas managed a weak smile and a murmur .  ryger snapped   all right  villiers .  what s up .     ryger  the angry man   said villiers .   how s ceres .     it was doing well when i left .  how s earth .     you can see for yourself   but villiers tightened as he said that .   he went on   i am hoping that the reason all three of you have come to the convention is to hear my paper day after tomorrow .     your paper .  what paper .   asked talliaferro .    i wrote you all about it .  my method of mass transference .    ryger smiled with one corner of his mouth .   yes  you did .  you didn t say anything about a paper  though  and i don t recall that you re listed as one of the speakers .  i would have noticed it if you had been .     you re right .  i m not listed .  nor have i prepared an abstract for publication .    villiers had flushed and taliaferro said soothingly   take it easy  villiers .  you don t look well .    villiers whirled on him  lips contorted .   my heart s holding out  thank you .    kaunas said   listen  villiers  if you re not listed or abstracted       you listen .  i ve waited ten years .  you have the jobs in space and i have to teach school on earth  but i m a better man than any of you or all of you .     granted     began talliaferro .    and i don t want your condescension either .  mandel witnessed it .  i suppose you ve heard of mandel .  well  he s chairman of the astronautics division at the convention and i demonstrated mass transference for him .  it was a crude device and it burnt out after one use but   are  you listening .     we re listening   said ryger coldly   for what that counts .     he ll let me talk about it my way .  you bet he will .  no warning .  no advertisement .  i m going to spring it at them like a bombshell .  when i give them the fundamental relationships involved it will break up the convention .  they ll scatter to their home labs to check on me and build devices .  and they ll find it works .  i made a live mouse disappear at one spot in my lab and appear in another .  mandel witnessed it .    he stared at them  glaring first at one face  then at another .  he said   you don t believe me  do you .    ryger said   if you don t want advertisement  why do you tell us .     you re different .  you re my friends  my classmates .  you went out into space and left me behind .     that wasn t a matter of choice   objected kaunas in a thin  high voice .   villiers ignored that .  he said   so i want you to know now .  what will work for a mouse will work for a human .  what will move something ten feet across a lab will move it a million miles across space .  i ll be on the moon  and on mercury  and on ceres and anywhere i want to go .  i ll match every one of you and more .  and i ll have done more for astronomy just teaching school and thinking  than all of you with your observatories and telescopes and cameras and spaceships .     well   said talliaferro   i m pleased .  more power to you .  may i see a copy of the paper .     oh  no .   villiers  hands clenched close to his chest as though he were holding phantom sheets and shielding them from observation .   you wait like everyone else .  there s only one copy and no one will see it till i m ready .  not even mandel .     one copy   cried talliaferro .   if you misplace it       i won t .  and if i do  it s all in my head .     if you     talliaferro almost finished that sentence with  die  but stopped himself .  instead  he went on after an almost imperceptible pause      have any sense  you ll scan it at least .  for safety s sake .     no   said villiers  shortly .   you ll hear me day after tomorrow .  you ll see the human horizon expanded at one stroke as it never has been before .    again he stared intently at each face .   ten years   he said .   good by .     he s mad   said ryger explosively  staring at the door as though villiers were still standing before it .    is he .   said talliaferro thoughtfully .   i suppose he is  in a way .  he hates us for irrational reasons .  and  then  not even to scan his paper as a precaution      talliaferro fingered his own small scanner as he said that .  it was just a neutrally colored  undistinguished cylinder  somewhat thicker and somewhat shorter than an ordinary pencil .  in recent years  it had become the hallmark of the scientist  much as the stethoscope was that of the physician and the micro computer that of the statistician .  the scanner was worn in a jacket pocket  or clipped to a sleeve  or slipped behind the ear  or swung at the end of a string .   talliaferro sometimes  in his more philosophical moments  wondered how it was in the days when research men had to make laborious notes of the literature or file away full sized reprints .  how unwieldy .   now it was only necessary to scan anything printed or written to have a micro negative which could be developed at leisure .  talliaferro had already recorded every abstract included in the program booklet of the convention .  the other two  he assumed with full confidence  had done likewise .   talliaferro said   under the circumstances  refusal to scan is mad .     space .   said ryger hotly .   there is no paper .  there is no discovery .  scoring one on us would be worth any lie to him .     but then what will he do day after tomorrow .   asked kaunas .    how do i know .  he s a madman .    talliaferro still played with his scanner and wondered idly if he ought to remove and develop some of the small slivers of film that lay stored away in its vitals .  he decided against it .  he said   don t underestimate villiers .  he s a brain .     ten years ago  maybe   said ryger .   now he s a nut .  i propose we forget him .    he spoke loudly  as though to drive away villiers and all that concerned him by the sheer force with which he discussed other things .  he talked about ceres and his work   the radio plotting of the milky way with new radioscopes capable of the resolution of single stars .   kaunas listened and nodded  then chimed in with information concerning the radio emissions of sunspots and his own paper  in press  on the association of proton storms with the gigantic hydrogen flares on the sun s surface .   talliaferro contributed little .  lunar work was unglamorous in comparison .  the latest information on long scale weather forecasting through direct observation of terrestrial jet streams would not compare with radioscopes and proton storms .   more than that  his thoughts could not leave villiers .  villiers was the brain .  they all knew it .  even ryger  for all his bluster  must feel that if mass transference were at all possible then villiers was a logical discoverer .   the discussion of their own work amounted to no more than an uneasy admission that none of them had come to much .  talliaferro had followed the literature and knew .  his own papers had been minor .  the others had authored nothing of great importance .   none of them   face the fact   had developed into space shakers .  the colossal dreams of school days had not come true and that was that .  they were competent routine workmen .  no less .  unfortunately  no more .  they knew that .   villiers would have been more .  they knew that  too .  it was that knowledge  as well as guilt  which kept them antagonistic .   talliaferro felt uneasily that villiers  despite everything  was yet to be more .  the others must be thinking so  too  and mediocrity could grow quickly unbearable .  the mass transference paper would come to pass and villiers would be the great man after all  as he was always fated to be apparently  while his classmates  with all their advantages  would be forgotten .  their role would be no more than to applaud from the crowd .   he felt his own envy and chagrin and was ashamed of it  but felt it none the less .   conversation died  and kaunas said  his eyes turning away   listen  why don t we drop in on old villiers .    there was a false heartiness about it  a completely unconvincing effort at casualness .  he added   no use leaving bad feelings   unnecessarily      talliaferro thought  he wants to make sure about the mass transference .  he s hoping it is only a madman s nightmare so he can sleep tonight .   but he was curious himself  so he made no objection  and even ryger shrugged with ill grace and said   hell  why not .    it was a little before eleven then .   talliaferro was awakened by the insistent ringing of his door signal .  he hitched himself to one elbow in the darkness and felt distinctly outraged .  the soft glow of the ceiling indicator showed it to be not quite four in the morning .   he cried out   who is it .   the ringing continued in short  insistent spurts .  growling  talliaferro slipped into his bathrobe .  he opened the door and blinked in the corridor light .  he recognized the man who faced him from the trimensionals he had seen often enough .   nevertheless  the man said in an abrupt whisper   my name is hubert mandel .     yes  sir   said talliaferro .  mandel was one of the names in astronomy  prominent enough to have an important executive position with the world astronomical bureau  active enough to be chairman of the astronautics section here at the convention .   it suddenly struck talliaferro that it was mandel for whom villiers claimed to have demonstrated mass transference .  the thought of villiers was somehow a sobering one .   mandel said   you are dr .  edward talliaferro .     yes  sir .     then dress and come with me .  it is very important .  it concerns a mutual acquaintance .     dr .  villiers .    mandel s eyes flickered a bit .  his brows and lashes were so fair as to give those eyes a naked  unfringed appearance .  his hair was silky thin  his age about fifty .  he said   why villiers .     he mentioned you last evening .  i don t know any other mutual acquaintance .    mandel nodded  waited for talliaferro to finish slipping into his clothes  then turned and led the way .  ryger and kaunas were waiting in a room one floor above talliaferro s .  kaunas s eyes were red and troubled .  ryger was smoking a cigarette with impatient puffs .   talliaferro said   we re all here .  another reunion .   it fell flat .   he took a seat and the three stared at one another .  ryger shrugged .   mandel paced the floor  hands keep in his pockets .  he said   i apologize for any inconvenience  gentlemen  and i thank you for your co operation .  i would like more of it .  our friend  romero villiers  is dead .  about an hour ago  his body was removed from the hotel .  the medical judgment is heart failure .    there was a stunned silence .  ryger s cigarette hovered halfway to his lips  then sank slowly without completing its journey .    poor devil   said talliaferro .    horrible   whispered kaunas hoarsely .   he was      his voice played out .   ryger shook himself .   well  he had a bad heart .  there s nothing to be done .     one little thing   corrected mandel quietly .   recovery .     what does that mean .   asked ryger sharply .   mandel said   when did you three see him last .    talliaferro spoke .   last evening .  it turned out to be a reunion .  we all met for the first time in ten years .  it wasn t a pleasant meeting  i m sorry to say .  villiers felt he had cause for anger with us  and he was angry .     that was   when .     about nine  the first time .     the first time .     we saw him again later in the evening .    kaunas looked troubled .   he had left angrily .  we couldn t leave it at that .  we had to try .  it wasn t as if we hadn t all been friends at one time .  so we went to his room and      mandel pounced on that .   you were all in his room .     yes   said kaunas  surprised .    about when .     eleven  i think .   he looked at the others .  talliaferro nodded .    and how long did you stay .     two minutes   put in ryger .   he ordered us out as though we were after his paper .   he paused as though expecting mandel to ask what paper  but mandel said nothing .  he went on .   i think he kept it under his pillow .  at least he lay across the pillow as he yelled at us to leave .     he may have been dying then   said kaunas  in a sick whisper .    not then   said mandel shortly .   so you probably all left fingerprints .     probably   said talliaferro .  he was losing some of his automatic respect for mandel and a sense of impatience was returning .  it was four in the morning  mandel or no .  he said   now what s all this about .     well  gentlemen   said mandel   there s more to villiers  death than the fact of death .  villiers  paper  the only copy of it as far as i know  was stuffed into the cigarette flash disposal unit and only scraps of it were left .  i ve never seen or read the paper  but i knew enough about the matter to be willing to swear in court if necessary that the remnants of unflashed paper in the disposal unit were of the paper he was planning to give at this convention .     you seem doubtful  dr .  ryger .    ryger smiled sourly .   doubtful that he was going to give it .  if you want my opinion  sir  he was mad .  for ten years he was a prisoner of earth and he fantasied mass transference as escape .  it was all that kept him alive probably .  he rigged up some sort of fraudulent demonstration .  i don t say it was deliberate fraud .  he was probably madly sincere  and sincerely mad .  last evening was the climax .  he came to our rooms   he hated us for having escaped earth   and triumphed over us .  it was what he had lived for for ten years .  it may have shocked him back to some form of sanity .  he knew he couldn t actually give the paper  there was nothing to give .  so he burnt it and his heart gave out .  it is too bad .    mandel listened to the cerian astronomer  wearing a look of sharp disapproval .  he said   very glib  dr .  ryger  but quite wrong .  i am not as easily fooled by fraudulent demonstrations as you may believe .  now according to the registration data  which i have been forced to check rather hastily  you three were his classmates at college .  is that right .    they nodded .    are there any other classmates of yours present at the convention .     no   said kaunas .   we were the only four qualifying for a doctorate in astronomy that year .  at least he would have qualified except       yes  i understand   said mandel .   well  then  in that case one of you three visited villiers in his room one last time at midnight .    there was a short silence .  then ryger said coldly   not i .   kaunas  eyes wide  shook his head .   talliaferro said   what are you implying .     one of you came to him at midnight and insisted on seeing his paper .  i don t know the motive .  conceivably  it was with the deliberate intention of forcing him into heart failure .  when villiers collapsed  the criminal  if i may call him so  was ready .  he snatched the paper which  i might add  probably was kept under his pillow  and scanned it .  then he destroyed the paper itself in the flash disposal  but he was in a hurry and destruction wasn t complete .    ryger interrupted .   how do you know all this .  were you a witness .     almost   said mandel .   villiers was not quite dead at the moment of his first collapse .  when the criminal left  he managed to reach the phone and call my room .  he choked out a few phrases  enough to outline what had occurred .  unfortunately i was not in my room  a late conference kept me away .  however  my recording attachment taped it .  i always play the recording tape back whenever i return to my room or office .  bureaucratic habit .  i called back .  he was dead .     well  then   said ryger   who did he say did it .     he didn t .  or if he did  it was unintelligible .  but one word rang out clearly .  it was  classmate .      talliaferro detached his scanner from its place in his inner jacket pocket and held it out toward mandel .  quietly he said   if you would like to develop the film in my scanner  you are welcome to do so .  you will not find villiers  paper there .    at once  kaunas did the same  and ryger  with a scowl  joined .   mandel took all three scanners and said dryly   presumably  whichever one of you has done this has already disposed of the piece of exposed film with the paper on it .  however      talliaferro raised his eyebrows .   you may search my person or my room .    but ryger was still scowling   now wait a minute  wait one bloody minute .  are you the police .    mandel stared at him .   do you want the police .  do you want a scandal and a murder charge .  do you want the convention disrupted and the system press to make a holiday out of astronomy and astronomers .  villiers  death might well have been accidental .  he did have a bad heart .  whichever one of you was there may well have acted on impulse .  it may not have been a premeditated crime .  if whoever it is will return the negative  we can avoid a great deal of trouble .     even for the criminal .   asked talliaferro .   mandel shrugged .   there may be trouble for him .  i will not promise immunity .  but whatever the trouble  it won t be public disgrace and life imprisonment  as it might be if the police are called in .    silence .   mandel said   it is one of you three .    silence .   mandel went on   i think i can see the original reasoning of the guilty person .  the paper would be destroyed .  only we four knew of the mass transference and only i had ever seen a demonstration .  moreover you had only his word  a madman s word perhaps  that i had seen it .  with villiers dead of heart failure and the paper gone  it would be easy to believe dr .  ryger s theory that there was no mass transference and never had been .  a year or two might pass and our criminal  in possession of the mass transference data  could reveal it little by little  rig experiments  publish careful papers  and end as the apparent discoverer with all that would imply in terms of money and renown .  even his own classmates would suspect nothing .  at most they would believe that the long past affair with villiers had inspired him to begin investigations in the field .  no more .    mandel looked sharply from one face to another .   but none of that will work now .  any of the three of you who comes through with mass transference is proclaiming himself the criminal .  i ve seen the demonstration  i know it is legitimate  i know that one of you possesses a record of the paper .  the information is therefore useless to you .  give it up then .    silence .   mandel walked to the door and turned again   i d appreciate it if you would stay here till i return .  i won t be long .  i hope the guilty one will use the interval to consider .  if he s afraid a confession will lose him his job  let him remember that a session with the police may lose him his liberty and cost him the psychic probe .   he hefted the three scanners  looked grim and somewhat in need of sleep .   i ll develop these .    kaunas tried to smile .   what if we make a break for it while you re gone .     only one of you has reason to try   said mandel .   i think i can rely on the two innocent ones to control the third  if only out of self protection .    he left  it was five in the morning .  ryger looked at his watch indignantly .   a hell of a thing .  i want to sleep .     we can curl up here   said talliaferro philosophically .   is anyone planning a confession .    kaunas looked away and ryger s lip lifted .    i didn t think so .   talliaferro closed his eyes  leaned his large head back against the chair and said in a tired voice   back on the moon  they re in the slack season .  we ve got a two week night and then it s busy  busy .  then there s two weeks of sun and there s nothing but calculations  correlations and bull sessions .  that s the hard time .  i hate it .  if there were more women  if i could arrange something permanent      in a whisper  kaunas talked about the fact that it was still impossible to get the entire sun above the horizon and in view of the telescope on mercury .  but with another two miles of track soon to be laid down for the observatory   move the whole thing  you know  tremendous forces involved  solar energy used directly   it might be managed .  it would be managed .   even ryger consented to talk of ceres after listening to the low murmur of the other voices .  there was the problem there of the two hour rotation period  which meant the stars whipped across the sky at an angular velocity twelve times that in earth s sky .  a net of three light scopes  three radio scopes  three of everything  caught the fields of study from one another as they whirled past .    could you use one of the poles .   asked kaunas .    you re thinking of mercury and the sun   said ryger impatiently .   even at the poles  the sky would still twist  and half of it would be forever bidden .  now if ceres showed only one face to the sun  the way mercury does  we could have a permanent night sky with the stars rotating slowly once in three years .    the sky lightened and it dawned slowly .   talliaferro was half asleep  but he kept hold of half consciousness firmly .  he would not fall asleep and leave the others awake .  each of the three  he thought  was wondering   who .  who .     except the guilty one  of course .   talliaferro s eyes snapped open as mandel entered again .  the sky  as seen from the window  had grown blue .  talliaferro was glad the window was closed .  the hotel was air conditioned  of course  but windows could be opened during the mild season of the year by those earth men who fancied the illusion of fresh air .  talliaferro  with moon vacuum on his mind  shuddered at the thought with real discomfort .   mandel said   have any of you anything to say .    they looked at him steadily .  ryger shook his head .   mandel said   i have developed the film in your scanners  gentlemen  and viewed the results .   he tossed scanners and developed slivers of film on to the bed .   nothing .  you ll have trouble sorting out the film  i m afraid .  for that i m sorry .  and now there is still the question of the missing film .     if any   said ryger  and yawned prodigiously .   mandel said   i would suggest we come down to villiers  room  gentlemen .    kaunas looked startled .   why .    talliaferro said   is this psychology .  bring the criminal to the scene of the crime and remorse will wring a confession from him .    mandel said   a less melodramatic reason is that i would like to have the two of you who are innocent help me find the missing film of villiers  paper .     do you think it s there .   asked ryger challengingly .    possibly .  it s a beginning .  we can then search each of your rooms .  the symposium on astronautics doesn t start till tomorrow at    a . m .  we have till then .     and after that .     it may have to be the police .    they stepped gingerly into villiers  room .  ryger was red  kaunas pale .  talliaferro tried to remain calm .   last night they had seen it under artificial lighting with a scowling  disheveled villiers clutching his pillow  staring them down  ordering them away .  now there was the scentless odor of death about it .   mandel fiddled with the window polarizer to let more light in  and adjusted it too far  so that the eastern sun slipped in .   kaunas threw his arm up to shade his eyes and screamed   the sun .   so that all the others froze .   kaunas s face showed a kind of terror  as though it were his mercurian sun that he had caught a blinding glimpse of .   talliaferro thought of his own reaction to the possibility of open air and his teeth gritted .  they were all bent crooked by their ten years away from earth .   kaunas ran to the window  fumbling for the polarizer  and then the breath came out of him in a huge gasp .   mandel stepped to his side .   what s wrong .   and the other two joined them .   the city lay stretched below them and outward to the horizon in broken stone and brick  bathed in the rising sun  with the shadowed portions toward them .  talliaferro cast it all a furtive and uneasy glance .   kaunas  his chest seemingly contracted past the point where he could cry out  stared at something much closer .  there  on the outer window sill  one corner secured in a trifling imperfection  a crack in the cement  was an inch long strip of milky gray film  and on it were the early rays of the rising sun .   mandel  with an angry  incoherent cry  threw up the window and snatched it away .  he shielded it in one cupped hand  staring out of hot and reddened eyes .   he said   wait here .    there was nothing to say .  when mandel left  they sat down and stared stupidly at one another .   mandel was back in twenty minutes .  he said quietly  in a voice that gave the impression  somehow  that it was quiet only because its owner had passed far beyond the raving stage    the corner in the crack wasn t overexposed .  i could make out a few words .  it is villiers  paper .   the rest is ruined  nothing can be salvaged .  it s gone .     what next .   said talliaferro .   mandel shrugged wearily .   right now  i don t care .  mass transference is gone until someone as brilliant as villiers works it out again .  i shall work on it but i have no illusions as to my own capacity .  with it gone  i suppose you three don t matter  guilty or not .  what s the difference .   his whole body seemed to have loosened and sunk into despair .   but talliaferro s voice grew hard .   now  hold on .  in your eyes  any of the three of us might be guilty .  i  for instance .  you are a big man in the field and you will never have a good word to say for me .  the general idea may arise that i am incompetent or worse .  i will not be ruined by the shadow of guilt .  now let s solve this thing .     i am no detective   said mandel wearily .    then call in the police  damn it .    ryger said   wait a while  tal .  are you implying that i m guilty .     i m saying that i m innocent .    kaunas raised his voice in fright .   it will mean the psychic probe for each of us .  there may be mental damage      mandel raised both arms high in the air .   gentlemen .  gentlemen .  please .  there is one thing we might do short of the police  and you are right  dr .  talliaferro  it would be unfair to the innocent to leave this matter here .    they turned to him in various stages of hostility .  ryger said   what do you suggest .     i have a friend named wendell urth .  you may have heard of him  or you may not  but perhaps i can arrange to see him tonight .     what if you can .   demanded talliaferro .   where does that get us .     he s an odd man   said mandel hesitantly   very odd .  and very brilliant in his way .  he has helped the police before this and he may be able to help us now .      part      edward talliaferro could not forbear staring at the room and its occupant with the greatest astonishment .  it and he seemed to exist in isolation  and to be part of no recognizable world .  the sounds of earth were absent in this well padded  windowless nest .  the light and air of earth had been blanked out in artificial illumination and conditioning .   it was a large room  dim and cluttered .  they had picked their way across a littered floor to a couch from which book films had been brusquely cleared and dumped to one side in a tangle .   the man who owned the room had a large  round face on a stumpy  round body .  he moved quickly about on his short legs  jerking his head as he spoke until his thick glasses all but bounced off the thoroughly inconspicuous nubble that served as a nose .  his thick lidded  somewhat protuberant eyes gleamed in myopic good nature at them all  as he seated himself in his own chair desk combination  lit directly by the one bright light hi the room .    so good of you to come  gentlemen .  pray excuse the condition of my room .   he waved stubby fingers in a wide sweeping gesture .   i am engaged in cataloguing the many objects of extraterrological interest i have accumulated .  it is a tremendous job .  for instance      he dodged out of his seat and burrowed in a heap of objects beside the desk till he came up with a smoky gray object  semi translucent and roughly cylindrical .   this   he said   is a callistan object that may be a relic of intelligent nonhuman entities .  it is not decided .  not more than a dozen have been discovered and this is the most perfect single specimen i know of .    he tossed it to one side and talliaferro jumped .  the plump man stared in his direction and said   it s not breakable .   he sat down again  clasped his pudgy fingers tightly over his abdomen and let them pump slowly in and out as he breathed .   and now what can i do for you .    hubert mandel had carried through the introductions and talliaferro was considering deeply .  surely it was a man named wendell urth who had written a recent book entitled comparative evolutionary processes on water oxygen planets  and surely this could not be the man .   he said   are you the author of comparative evolutionary processes  dr .  urth .    a beatific smile spread across urth s face   you ve read it .     well  no  i haven t  but      urth s expression grew instantly censorious .   then you should .  right now .  here  i have a copy      he bounced out of his chair again and mandel cried at once   now wait  urth  first things first .  this is serious .    he virtually forced urth back into his chair and began speaking rapidly as though to prevent any further side issues from erupting .  he told the whole story with admirable word economy .   urth reddened slowly as he listened .  he seized his glasses and shoved them higher up on his nose .   mass transference .   he cried .    i saw it with my own eyes   said mandel .    and you never told me .     i was sworn to secrecy .  the man was   peculiar .  i explained that .    urth pounded the desk .   how could you allow such a discovery to remain the property of an eccentric  mandel .  the knowledge should have been forced from him by psychic probe  if necessary .     it would have killed him   protested mandel .   but urth was rocking back and forth with his hands clasped tightly to his cheeks .   mass transference .  the only way a decent  civilized man should travel .  the only possible way .  the only conceivable way .  if i had known .  if i could have been there .  but the hotel is nearly thirty miles away .    ryger  who listened with an expression of annoyance on his face  interposed   i understand there s a flitter line direct to convention hall .  it could have gotten you there in ten minutes .    urth stiffened and looked at ryger strangely .  his cheeks bulged .  he jumped to his feet and scurried out of the room .   ryger said   what the devil .    mandel muttered   damn it .  i should have warned you .     about what .     dr .  urth doesn t travel on any sort of conveyance .  it s a phobia .  he moves about only on foot .    kaunas blinked about in the dimness .   but he s an extraterrologist  isn t he .  an expert on life forms of other planets .    talliaferro had risen and now stood before a galactic lens on a pedestal .  he stared at the inner gleam of the star systems .  he had never seen a lens so large or so elaborate .   mandel said   he s an extraterrologist  yes  but he s never visited any of the planets on which he is expert and he never will .  in thirty years  i doubt if he s ever been more than a mile from this room .    ryger laughed .   mandel flushed angrily .   you may find it funny  but i d appreciate your being careful what you say when dr .  urth comes back .    urth sidled in a moment later .   my apologies  gentlemen   he said in a whisper .   and now let us approach our problem .  perhaps one of you wishes to confess .    talliaferro s lips quirked sourly .  this plump  self imprisoned extraterrologist was scarcely formidable enough to force a confession from anyone .  fortunately  there would be no need of his detective talents  if any  after all .   talliaferro said   dr .  urth  are you connected with the police .    a certain smugness seemed to suffuse urth s ruddy face .   i have no official connection  dr .  talliaferro  but my unofficial relationships are very good indeed .     in that case  i will give you some information which you can carry to the police .    urth drew in his abdomen and hitched at his shirttail .  it came free  and slowly he polished his glasses with it .  when he was quite through and had perched them precariously on his nose once more  he said   and what is that .     i will tell you who was present when villiers died and who scanned his paper .     you have solved the mystery .     i ve thought about it all day .  i think i ve solved it .   talliaferro rather enjoyed the sensation he was creating .    well  then .    talliaferro took a deep breath .  this was not going to be easy to do  though he had been planning it for hours .   the guilty man   he said   is obviously dr .  hubert mandel .    mandel stared at talliaferro in sudden  hard breathing indignation .   look here  doctor   he began  loudly   if you have any basis for such a ridiculous      urth s tenor voice soared above the interruption .   let him talk  hubert  let us hear him .  you suspected him and there is no law that forbids him to suspect you .    mandel fell angrily silent .   talliaferro  not allowing his voice to falter  said   it is more than just suspicion  dr .  urth .  the evidence is perfectly plain .  four of us knew about mass transference  but only one of us  dr .  mandel  had actually seen a demonstration .  he knew it to be a fact .  he knew a paper on the subject existed .  we three knew only that villiers was more or less unbalanced .  oh  we might have thought there was just a chance .  we visited him at eleven  i think  just to check on that  though none of us actually said so   but he just acted crazier than ever .     check special knowledge and motive then on dr .  mandel s side .  now  dr .  urth  picture something else .  whoever it was who confronted villiers at midnight  saw him collapse  and scanned his paper  let s keep him anonymous for a moment  must have been terribly startled to see villiers apparently come to life again and to hear him talking into the telephone .  our criminal  in the panic of the moment  realized one thing  he must get rid of the one piece of incriminating material evidence .    he had to get rid of the undeveloped film of the paper and he had to do it in such a way that it would be safe from discovery so that he might pick it up once more if he remained unsuspected .  the outer window sill was ideal .  quickly he threw up villiers  window  placed the strip of film outside  and left .  now  even if villiers survived or if his telephoning brought results  it would be merely villiers  word against his own and it would be easy to show that villiers was unbalanced .    talliaferro paused in something like triumph .  this would be irrefutable .   wendell urth blinked at him and wiggled the thumbs of his clasped hands so that they slapped against his ample shirt front .  he said   and the significance of all that .     the significance is that the window was thrown open and the film placed in open air .  now ryger has lived for ten years on ceres  kaunas on mercury  i on the moon    barring short leaves and not many of them .  we commented to one another several times yesterday on the difficulty of growing acclimated to earth .      our work worlds are each airless objects .  we never go out in the open without a suit .  to expose ourselves to unenclosed space is unthinkable .  none of us could have opened the window without a severe inner struggle .  dr .  mandel  however  has lived on earth exclusively .  opening a window to him is only a matter of a bit of muscular exertion .  he could do it .  we couldn t .  ergo  he did it .    talliaferro sat back and smiled a bit .    space  that s it .   cried ryger  with enthusiasm .    that s not it at all   roared mandel  half rising as though tempted to throw himself at talliaferro .   i deny the whole miserable fabrication .  what about the record i have of villiers  phone call .  he used the word  classmate .   the entire tape makes it obvious       he was a dying man   said talliaferro .   much of what he said you admitted was incomprehensible .  i ask you  dr .  mandel  without having heard the tape  if it isn t true that villiers  voice is distorted past recognition .     well     said mandel in confusion .    i m sure it is .  there is no reason to suppose  then  that you might not have rigged up the tape in advance  complete with the damning word  classmate .      mandel said   good lord  how would i know there were classmates at the convention .  how would i know they knew about the mass transference .     villiers might have told you .  i presume he did .     now  look   said mandel   you three saw villiers alive at eleven .  the medical examiner  seeing villiers  body shortly after   a . m .  declared he had been dead at least two hours .  that was certain .  the time of death  therefore  was between    p . m .  and   a . m .  i was at a late conference last night .  i can prove my whereabouts  miles from the hotel  between       and      by a dozen witnesses no one of whom anyone can possibly question .  is that enough for you .    talliaferro paused a moment .  then he went on stubbornly   even so .  suppose you got back to the hotel by      .  you went to villiers  room to discuss his talk .  you found the door open  or you had a duplicate key .  anyway  you found him dead .  you seized the opportunity to scan the paper       and if he were already dead  and couldn t make phone calls  why should i hide the film .     to remove suspicion .  you may have a second copy of the film safe in your possession .  for that matter  we have only your own word that the paper itself was destroyed .     enough .  enough   cried urth .   it is an interesting hypothesis  dr .  talliaferro  but it falls to the ground of its own weight .    talliaferro frowned .   that s your opinion  perhaps       it would be anyone s opinion .  anyone  that is  with the power of human thought .  don t you see that hubert mandel did too much to be the criminal .     no   said talliaferro .   wendell urth smiled benignly .   as a scientist  dr .  talliaferro  you undoubtedly know better than to fall in love with your own theories to the exclusion of facts or reasoning .  do me the pleasure of behaving similarly as a detective .    consider that if dr .  mandel had brought about the death of villiers and faked an alibi  or if he had found villiers dead and taken advantage of that  how little he would really have had to do .  why scan the paper or even pretend that anyone had done so .  he could simply have taken the paper .  who else knew of its existence .  nobody  really .  there is no reason to think villiers told anyone else about it .  villiers was pathologically secretive .  there would have been every reason to think that he told no one .    no one knew villiers was giving a talk  except dr .  mandel .  it wasn t announced .  no abstract was published .  dr .  mandel could have walked off with the paper in perfect confidence .    even if he had discovered that villiers had talked to his classmates about the matter  what of it .  what evidence would his classmates have except the word of one whom they are themselves half willing to consider a madman .    by announcing instead that villiers  paper had been destroyed  by declaring his death to be not entirely natural  by searching for a scanned copy of the film   in short by everything dr .  mandel has done   he has aroused a suspicion that only he could possibly have aroused when he need only have remained quiet to have committed a perfect crime .  if he were the criminal  he would be more stupid  more colossally obtuse than anyone i have ever known .  and dr .  mandel  after all  is none of that .    talliaferro thought hard but found nothing to say .   ryger said   then who did do it .     one of you three .  that s obvious .     but which .     oh  that s obvious  too .  i knew which of you was guilty the moment dr .  mandel had completed his description of events .    talliaferro stared at the plump extraterrologist with distaste .  the bluff did not frighten him  but it was affecting the other two .  ryger s lips were thrust out and kaunas s lower jaw had relaxed moronically .  they looked like fish  both of them .   he said   which one  then .  tell us .    urth blinked .   first  i want to make it perfectly plain that the important thing is mass transference .  it can still be recovered .    mandel  scowling still  said querulously   what the devil are you talking about  urth .     the man who scanned the paper probably looked at what he was scanning .  i doubt that he had the time or presence of mind to read it  and if he did  i doubt if he could remember it   consciously .  however  there is the psychic probe .  if he even glanced at the paper  what impinged on his retina could be probed .    there was an uneasy stir .   urth said at once   no need to be afraid of the probe .  proper handling is safe  particularly if a man offers himself voluntarily .  when damage is done  it is usually because of unnecessary resistance  a kind of mental tearing  you know .  so if the guilty man will voluntarily confess  place himself in my hands      talliaferro laughed .  the sudden noise rang out sharply in the dim quiet of the room .  the psychology was so transparent and artless .   wendell urth looked almost bewildered at the reaction and stared earnestly at talliaferro over his glasses .  he said   i have enough influence with the police to keep the probing entirely confidential .    ryger said savagely   i didn t do it .    kaunas shook his head .   talliaferro disdained any answer .   urth sighed .   then i will have to point out the guilty man .  it will be traumatic .  it will make things harder .   he tightened the grip on his belly and his fingers twitched .   dr .  talliaferro pointed out that the film was hidden on the outer window sill so that it might remain safe from discovery and from harm .  i agree with him .     thank you   said talliaferro dryly .    however  why should anyone think that an outer window sill is a particularly safe hiding place .  the police would certainly look there .  even in the absence of the police it was discovered .  who would tend to consider anything outside a building as particularly safe .  obviously  some person who has lived a long time on an airless world and has it drilled into him that no one goes outside an enclosed place without detailed precautions .    to someone on the moon  for instance  anything hidden outside a lunar dome would be comparatively safe .  men venture out only rarely and then only on specific business .  so he would overcome the hardship of opening a window and exposing himself to what he would subconsciously consider a vacuum for the sake of a safe hiding place .  the reflex thought   outside an inhabited structure is safe   would do the trick .    talliaferro said between clenched teeth   why do you mention the moon  dr .  urth .      urth said blandly   only as an example .  what i ve said so far applies to all three of you .  but now comes the crucial point  the matter of the dying night .    talliaferro frowned .   you mean the night villiers died .     i mean any night .  see here  even granted that an outer window sill was a safe hiding place  which of you would be mad enough to consider it a safe hiding place for a piece of unexposed film .  scanner film isn t very sensitive  to be sure  and is made to be developed under all sorts of hit and miss conditions .  diffuse night time illumination wouldn t seriously affect it  but diffuse daylight would ruin it in a few minutes  and direct sunlight would ruin it at once .  everyone knows that .    mandel said   go ahead  urth .  what is this leading to .     you re trying to rush me   said urth  with a massive pout .   i want you to see this clearly .  the criminal wanted  above all  to keep the film safe .  it was his only record of something of supreme value to himself and to the world .  why would he put it where it would inevitably be ruined by the morning sun .    only because he did not expect the morning sun ever to come .  he thought the night  so to speak  was immortal .    but nights aren t immortal .  on earth  they die and give way to daytime .  even the six month polar night is a dying night eventually .  the nights on ceres last only two hours  the nights on the moon last two weeks .  they are dying nights  too  and dr .  talliaferro and ryger know that day must always come .    kaunas was on his feet .   but wait      wendell urth faced him full .   no longer any need to wait  dr .  kaunas .  mercury is the only sizable object in the solar system that turns only one face to the sun .  even taking libration into account  fully three eighths of its surface is true dark side and never sees the sun .  the polar observatory is at the rim of that dark side .  for ten years  you have grown used to the fact that nights are immortal  that a surface in darkness remains eternally in darkness  and so you entrusted unexposed film to earth s night  forgetting in your excitement that nights must die      kaunas stumbled forward .   wait      urth was inexorable .   i am told that when mandel adjusted the polarizer in villiers  room  you screamed at the sunlight .  was that your ingrained fear of mercurian sun  or your sudden realization of what sunlight meant to your plans .  you rushed forward .  was that to adjust the polarizer or to stare at the ruined film .    kaunas fell to his knees .   i didn t mean it .  i wanted to speak to him  only to speak to him  and he screamed and collapsed .  i thought he was dead and the paper was under his pillow and it all just followed .  one thing led on to another and before i knew it  i couldn t get out of it anymore .  but i meant none of it .  i swear it .    they had formed a semicircle about him and wendell urth stared at the moaning kaunas with pity in his eyes .     an ambulance had come and gone .  talliaferro finally brought himself to say stiffly to mandel   i hope  sir  there will be no hard feelings for anything said here .    and mandel had answered  as stiffly   i think we had all better forget as much as possible of what has happened during the last twenty four hours .    they were standing in the doorway  ready to leave  and wendell urth ducked his smiling head  and said   there s the question of my fee  you know .    mandel looked startled .    not money   said urth at once .   but when the first mass transference setup for humans is established  i want a trip arranged for me .    mandel continued to look anxious .   now  wait .  trips through outer space are a long way off .    urth shook his head rapidly .   not outer space .  not at all .  i would like to step across to lower falls  new hampshire .     all right .  but why .    urth looked up .  to talliaferro s outright surprise  the extra terrologist s face wore an expression compounded of shyness and eagerness .   urth said   i once   quite a long time ago   knew a girl there .  it s been many years   but i sometimes wonder          i m in marsport without hilda     it worked itself out  to begin with  like a dream .  i didn t have to make any arrangement .  i didn t have to touch it .  i just watched things work out .     maybe that s when i should have first smelled catastrophe .   it began with my usual month s layoff between assignments .  a month on and a month off is the right and proper routine for the galactic service .  i reached marsport for the usual three day layover before the short hop to earth .   ordinarily  hilda  god bless her  as sweet a wife as any man ever had  would be there waiting for me and we d have a nice sedate time of it   a nice little interlude for the two of us .  the only trouble with that is that marsport is the rowdiest spot in the system  and a nice little interlude isn t exactly what fits in .  only  how do i explain that to hilda  hey .   well  this time  my mother in law  god bless her  for a change  got sick just two days before i reached marsport  and the night before landing  i got a spacegram from hilda saying she would stay on earth with her mother and wouldn t meet me this one time .   i  grammed back my loving regrets and my feverish anxiety concerning her mother and when i landed  there i was     i was in marsport without hilda .   that was still nothing  you understand .  it was the frame of the picture  the bones of the woman .  now there was the matter of the lines and coloring inside the frame  the skin and flesh outside the bones .   so i called up flora  flora of certain rare episodes in the past  and for the purpose i used a video booth .     damn the expense  full speed ahead .   i was giving myself ten to one odds she d be out  she d be busy with her videophone disconnected  she d be dead  even .   but she was in  with her videophone connected  and great galaxy  was she anything but dead .   she looked better than ever .  age cannot wither  as somebody or other once said  nor custom stale her infinite variety .   was she glad to see me .  she squealed   max .  it s been years .     i know  flora  but this is it  if you re available .  because guess what .  i m in marsport without hilda .    she squealed again   isn t that nice .  then come on over .    i goggled a bit .  this was too much .   you mean you are available .   you have to understand that flora was never available without plenty of notice .  well  she was that kind of knockout .   she said   oh  i ve got some quibbling little arrangement  max  but i ll take care of that .  you come on over .     i ll come   i said happily .   flora was the kind of girl   well  i tell you  she had her rooms under martian gravity    .   earth normal .  the gadget to free her of marsport s pseudo grav field was expensive of course  but if you ve ever held a girl in your arms at   .   gees  you need no explanation .  if you haven t  explanations will do no good .  i m also sorry for you .   talk about floating on clouds .   i closed connections  and only the prospect of seeing it all in the flesh could have made me wipe out the image with such alacrity .  i stepped out of the booth .   and at that point  that precise point  that very split instant of time  the first whiff of catastrophe nudged itself up to me .   that first whiff was the bald head of that lousy rog crinton of the mars offices  gleaming over a headful of pale blue eyes  pale yellow complexion  and pale brown mustache .  i didn t bother getting on all fours and beating my forehead against the ground because my vacation had started the minute i had gotten off the ship .   so i said with only normal politeness   what do you want and i m in a hurry .  i ve got an appointment .    he said   you ve got an appointment with me .  i was waiting for you at the unloading desk .    i said   i didn t see you      he said   you didn t see anything .    he was right at that  for  come to think of it  if he was at the unloading desk  he must have been spinning ever since because i went past that desk like halley s comet skimming the solar corona .   i said   all right .  what do you want .     i ve got a little job for you .    i laughed .   it s my month off  friend .    he said   red emergency alert  friend .    which meant  no vacation  just like that .  i couldn t believe it .  i said   nuts  rog .  have a heart .  i got an emergency alert of my own .     nothing like this .     rog   i yelled   can t you get someone else .  anyone else .     you re the only class a agent on mars .     send to earth  then .  they stack agents like micro pile units at headquarters .     this has got to be done before    p . m .  what s the matter .  you haven t got three hours .    i grabbed my head .  the boy just didn t know .  i said   let me make a call  will you .    i stepped back into the booth  glared at him  and said   private .    flora shone on the screen again  like a mirage on an asteroid .  she said   something wrong  max .  don t say something s wrong .  i canceled my other engagement .    i said   flora  baby  i ll be there .  i ll be there .  but something s come up .    she asked the natural question in a hurt tone of voice and i said   no .  not another girl .  with you in the same town they don t make any other girls .  females  maybe .  not girls .  baby .  honey .    i had a wild impulse but hugging  vision screen is no pastime for a grown man .    it s business .  just hold on .  it won t take long .    she said   all right   but she said it kind of like it was just enough not all right so that i got the shivers .   i stepped out of the booth and said   all right  rog  what kind of mess have you cooked up for me .    we went into the spaceport bar and got us an insulated booth .  he said   the antares giant is coming in from sirius in exactly half an hour  at   p . m .  local time .     okay .     three men will get out  among others  and will wait for the space eater coming in from earth at    p . m .  and leaving for capella some time thereafter .  the three men will get on the space eater and will then be out of our jurisdiction .     so .     so between      and        they will be in a special waiting room and you will be with them .  i have a trimensional image of each for you so you ll know which they are and which is which .  you have between      and       to decide which one of the three is carrying contraband .     what kind of contraband .     the worst kind .  altered spaceoline .     altered spaceoline .    he had thrown me .  i knew what spaceoline was .  if you ve been on a space hop you know  too .  and in case you re earth bound yourself the bare fact is that everyone needs it on the first space trip  almost everybody needs it for the first dozen trips  lots need it every trip .  without it  there is vertigo associated with free fall  screaming terrors  semi permanent psychoses .  with it  there is nothing  no one minds a thing .  and it isn t habit forming  it has no adverse side effects .  spaceoline is ideal  essential  unsubstitutable .  when in doubt  take spaceoline .   rog said   that s right  altered spaceoline .  it can be changed chemically by a very simple reaction that can be conducted in anyone s basement into a drug that will give one giant size charge and become your baby blue habit the first time .  it is on a par with the most dangerous alkaloids we know .     and we just found out about it .     no .  the service has known about it for years  and we ve kept others from knowing by squashing every discovery flat .  only now the discovery has gone too far .     in what way .     one of the men who will be stopping over at this spaceport is carrying some of the altered spaceoline on his person .  chemists in the capellan system  which is outside the federation  will analyze it and set up ways of synthesizing more .  after that  it s either fight the worst drug menace we ve ever seen or suppress the matter by suppressing the source .     you mean spaceoline .     right .  and if we suppress spaceoline  we suppress space travel .    i decided to put my finger on the point .   which one of the three has it .    rog smiled nastily   if we knew  would we need you .  you re to find out which of the three .     you re calling on me for a lousy frisk job .     touch the wrong one at the risk of a haircut down to the larynx .  every one of the three is a big man on his own planet .  one is edward harponaster  one is joaquin lipsky  and one is andiamo ferrucci .  well .    he was right .  i d heard of every one of them .  chances are you have  too  and not one was touchable without proof in advance  as you know .  i said   would one of them touch a dirty deal like       there are trillions involved   said rog   which means any one of the three would .  and one of them is  because jack hawk got that far before he was killed       jack hawk s dead .   for a minute  i forgot about the galactic drug menace .  for a minute  i nearly forgot about flora .    right  and one of those guys arranged the killing .  now you find out which .  you put the finger on the right one before       and there s a promotion  a raise in pay  a pay back for poor jack hawk  and a rescue of the galaxy .  you put the finger on the wrong one and there ll be a nasty interstellar situation and you ll be out on your ear and also on every black list from here to antares and back .    i said   suppose i don t finger anybody .     that would be like fingering the wrong one as far as the service is concerned .     i ve got to finger someone but only the right one or my head s handed to me .     in thin slices .  you re beginning to understand me  max .    in a long lifetime of looking ugly  rog crinton had never looked uglier .  the only comfort i got out of staring at him was the realization that he was married  too  and that he lived with his wife at marsport all year round .  and does he deserve that .  maybe i m hard on him  but he deserves it .   i put in a quick call to flora  as soon as rog was out of sight .   she said   well .    i said   baby  honey  it s something i can t talk about  but i ve got to do it  see .  now you hang on  i ll get it over with if i have to swim the grand canal to the icecap in my underwear  see .  if i have to claw phobos out of the sky .  if i have to cut myself in pieces and mail myself parcel post .     gee   she said   if i thought i was going to have to wait      i winced .  she just wasn t the type to respond to poetry .   actually  she was a simple creature of action   but after all  if i was going to be drifting through low gravity in a sea of jasmine perfume with flora  poetry response is not the type of qualification i would consider most indispensable .   i said urgently   just hold on  flora .  i won t be any time at all .  i ll make it up to you .    i was annoyed  sure  but i wasn t worried as yet .  rog hadn t more than left me when i figured out exactly how i was going to tell the guilty man from the others .   it was easy .  i should have called rog back and told him  but there s no law against wanting egg in your beer and oxygen in your air .  it would take me five minutes and then off i would go to flora  a little late  maybe  but with a promotion  a raise  and a slobbering kiss from the service on each cheek .   you see  it s like this .  big industrialists don t go space hopping much  they use trans video reception .  when they do go to some ultra high interstellar conference  as these three were probably going  they take spaceoline .  for one thing  they don t have enough hops under their belt to risk doing without .  for another  spaceoline is the expensive way of doing it and industrialists do things the expensive way .  i know their psychology .   now that would hold for two of them .  the one who carried contraband  however  couldn t risk spaceoline    even to prevent space sickness .  under spaceoline influence  he could throw the drug away  or give it away  or talk gibberish about it .  he would have to stay in control of himself .   it was as simple as that  so i waited .   the antares giant was on time and i waited with my leg muscles tense for a quick take off as soon as i collared the murdering drug toting rat and sped the two eminent captains of industry on their way .   they brought in lipsky first .  he had thick  ruddy lips  rounded jowls  very dark eyebrows  and graying hair .  he just looked at me and sat down .  nothing .  he was under spaceoline .   i said   good evening  sir .    he said  in a dreamy voice   surrealismus of panamy hearts in three quarter time for a cup of coffeedom of speech .    that was spaceoline all the way .  the buttons in the human mind were set free swing .  each syllable suggests the next in free association .   andiamo ferrucci came in next .  black mustache  long and waxed  olive complexion  pock marked face .  he took a seat in another chair  facing us .   i said   nice trip .    he said   trip the light fantastic tock the clock is crowings on the bird .    lipsky said   bird to the wise guyed book to all places every body .    i grinned .  that left harponaster .  i had my needle gun neatly palmed out of sight and the magnetic coil ready to grip him .   and then harponaster came in .  he was thin  leathery  near bald and rather younger than he seemed in his trimensional image .  and he was spaceolined to the gills .   i said   damn .    harponaster said   damyankee note speech to his last time i saw wood you say so .    ferrucci said   sow the seed the territory under dispute do well to come along long road to a nightingale .    lipsky said   gay lords hopping pong balls .    i stared from one to the other as the nonsense ran down in shorter and shorter spurts and then silence .   i got the picture  all right .  one of them was faking .  he had thought ahead and realized that omitting the spaceoline would be a giveaway .  he might have bribed an official into injecting saline or dodged it some other way .   one of them must be faking .  it wasn t hard to fake the thing .  comedians on sub etheric had a spaceoline skit regularly .  you ve heard them .   i stared at them and got the first prickle at the base of my skull that said  what if you don t finger the right one .   it was      and there was my job  my reputation  my head growing rickety upon my neck to be considered .  i saved it all for later and thought of flora .  she wasn t going to wait for me forever .  for that matter  chances were she wouldn t wait for half an hour .   i wondered .  could the faker keep up free association if nudged gently onto dangerous territory .   i said   the floor s covered with a nice solid rug  and ran the last two words together to make it  soli drug .    lipsky said   drug from underneath the dough re mi fa sol to be saved .    ferrucci said   saved and a haircut above the common herd something about younicorny as a harmonican the cheek by razor and shine .    harponaster said   shiner wind nor snow use trying to by four ever and effervescence and sensibilityter totter .    lipsky said   totters and rags .    ferrucci said   ragsactly .    harponaster said   actlymation .    a few grunts and they ran down .   i tried again and i didn t forget to be careful .  they would remember everything i said afterward and what i said had to be harmless .  i said   this is a darned good space line .    ferrucci said   lines and tigers through the prairie dogs do bark of the bough wough      i interrupted  looking at harponaster   a darned good space line .     line the bed and rest a little black sheepishion of wrong the clothes of a perfect day .    i interrupted again  glaring at lipsky   good space line .     liron is hot chocolate ain t gonna be the same on you vee and double the stakes and potatoes and heel .    some one else said   heel the sicknecessaryd and write will wincetance .     tance with mealtime .     i m comingle .     inglish .     ishter seals .     eels .    i tried a few more times and got nowhere .  the faker  whichever he was  had practiced or had natural talents at talking free association .  he was disconnecting his brain and letting the words come out any old way .  and he must be inspired by knowing exactly what i was after .  if  drug  hadn t given it away   space line  three times repeated must have .  i was safe with the other two  but he would know .      and he was having fun with me .  all three were saying phrases that might have pointed to a deep inner guilt   sol to be saved    little black sheepishion of wrong    drug from underneath   and so on  .  two were saying such things helplessly  randomly .  the third was amusing himself .   so how did i find the third .  i was in a feverish thrill of hatred against him and my fingers twitched .  the rat was subverting the galaxy .  more than that  he had killed my colleague and friend .  more than that  he was keeping me from flora .   i could go up to each of them and start searching .  the two who were really under spaceoline would make no move to stop me .  they could feel no emotion  no fear  no anxiety  no hate  no passion  no desire for self defense .  and if one made the slightest gesture of resistance i would have my man .   but the innocent ones would remember afterward .  they would remember a personal search while under spaceoline .   i sighed .  if i tried it  i would get the criminal all right but later i would be the nearest thing to chopped liver any man had ever been .  there would be a shake up in the service  a big stink the width of the galaxy  and in the excitement and disorganization  the secret of altered spaceoline would get out anyway and so what the hell .   of course  the one i wanted might be the first one i touched .  one chance out of three .  i d have one out and only god can make a three .   nuts  something had started them going while i was muttering to myself and spaceoline is contagioust a gigolo my  oh     i stared desperately at my watch and my line of sight focused on      .   where the devil was time going to .   oh  my  oh  nuts  oh  flora .   i had no choice .  i made my way to the booth for another quick call to flora .  just a quick one  you understand  to keep things alive  assuming they weren t dead already .   i kept saying to myself  she won t answer .   i tried to prepare myself for that .  there were other girls  there were other     what s the use  there were no other girls .   if hilda had been in marsport  i never would have had flora on my mind in the first place and it wouldn t have mattered .  but i was in marsport without hilda and i had made a date with flora .   the signal was signaling and signaling and i didn t dare break off .   answer .  answer .   she answered .  she said   it s you .     of course  sweetheart  who else would it be .     lots of people .  someone who would come .     there s just this little detail of business  honey .     what business .  plastons for who .    i almost corrected her grammar but i was too busy wondering what this plastons kick was .   then i remembered .  i told her once i was a plaston salesman .  that was the time i brought her a plaston nightgown that was a honey .   i said   look .  just give me another half hour      her eyes grew moist .   i m sitting here all by myself .     i ll make it up to you .   to show you how desperate i was getting  i was definitely beginning to think along paths that could lead only to jewelry even though a sizable dent in the bankbook would show up to hilda s piercing eye like the horsehead nebula interrupting the milky way .  but then i was desperate .   she said   i had a perfectly good date and i broke it off .    i protested   you said it was a quibbling little arrangement .    that was a mistake .  i knew it the minute i said it .   she shrieked   quibbling little arrangement .    it was what she had said .  it was what she had said .  but having the truth on your side just makes it worse in arguing with a woman .  don t i know .    you call a man who s promised me an estate on earth      she went on and on about that estate on earth .  there wasn t a gal in marsport who wasn t wangling for an estate on earth  and you could count the number who got one on the sixth finger of either hand .   i tried to stop her .  no use .   she finally said   and here i am all alone  with nobody   and broke off contact .   well  she was right .  i felt like the lowest heel in the galaxy .   i went back into the reception room .  a flunky outside the door saluted me in .   i stared at the three industrialists and speculated on the order in which i would slowly choke each to death if i could but receive choking orders .  harponaster first  maybe .  he had a thin  stringy neck that the fingers could go round neatly and a sharp adam s apple against which the thumbs could find purchase .   it cheered me up infinitesimally  to the point where i mustered   boy .   just out of sheer longing  though it was no boy i was longing for .   it started them off at once .  ferrucci said   boyl the watern the spout you goateeming rain over us  god savior pennies      harponaster of the scrawny neck added   nies and nephew don t like orporalley cat .    lipsky said   cattle corral go down off a ductilitease drunk .     drunkle aunterior passageway .  a while .     while beasts oh pray .     prayties grow .     grow way .     waiter .     terble .     ble .    then nothing .   they stared at me .  i stared at them .  they were empty of emotion  or two were  and i was empty of ideas .  and time passed .   i stared at them some more and thought about flora .  it occurred to me that i had nothing to lose that i had not already lost .  i might as well talk about her .   i said   gentlemen  there is a girl in this town whose name i will not mention for fear of compromising her .  let me describe her to you  gentlemen .    and i did .  if i say so myself  the last two hours had honed me to such a fine force field edge that the description of flora took on a kind of poetry that seemed to be coming from some wellspring of masculine force deep in the subbasement of my unconscious .   and they sat frozen  almost as though they were listening  and hardly ever interrupting .  people under spaceoline have a kind of politeness about them .  they won t speak when someone else is speaking .  that s why they take turns .   i kept it up with a kind of heartfelt sadness in my voice until the loud speaker announced in stirring tones the arrival of the space eater .   that was that .  i said in a loud voice   rise  gentlemen .     not you  you murderer   and my magnetic coil was on ferrucci s wrist before he could breathe twice .   ferrucci fought like a demon .  he was under no spaceoline influence .  they found the altered spaceoline in thin flesh colored plastic pads hugging the inner surface of his thighs .  you couldn t see it at all  you could only feel it  and even then it took a knife to make sure .   afterward  rog crinton  grinning and half insane with relief  held me by the lapel with a death grip .   how did you do it .  what gave it away .    i said  trying to pull loose   one of them was faking a spaceoline jag .  i was sure of it .  so i told them    i grew cautious   none of his business as to the details  you know    .  .  .  uh  about a girl  see  and two of them never reacted  so they were spaceolined .  but ferrucci s breathing speeded up and the beads of sweat came out on his forehead .  i gave a pretty dramatic rendition  and he reacted  so he was under no spaceoline .  now will you let me go .    he let go and i almost fell over backward .   i was set to take off .  my feet were pawing the ground without any instruction from me   but then i turned back .    hey  rog   i said   can you sign me a chit for a thousand credits without its going on the record   for services rendered to the service .    that s when i realized he was half insane with relief and very temporary gratitude  because he said   sure  max  sure .  ten thousand credits if you want .     i want   i said  grabbing him for a change .   i want .  i want .    he filled out an official service chit for ten thousand credits  good as cash anywhere in half the galaxy .  he was actually grinning as he gave it to me and you can bet i was grinning as i took it .   how he intended accounting for it was his affair  the point was that i wouldn t have to account for it to hilda .   i stood in the booth  one last time  signaling flora .  i didn t dare let matters go till i reached her place .  the additional half hour might just give her time to get someone else  if she hadn t already .   make her answer .  make her answer .  make her     she answered  but she was in formal clothes .  she was going out and i had obviously caught her by two minutes .    i am going out   she announced .   some men can be decent .  and i do not wish to see you in the henceforward .  i do not wish ever to find my eyes upon you .  you will do me a great favor  mister whoeveryouare  if you unhand my signal combination and never pollute it with      i wasn t saying anything .  i was just standing there holding my breath and also holding the chit up where she could see it .  just standing there .  just holding .   sure enough  at the word  pollute  she came in for a closer look .  she wasn t much on education  that girl  but she could read  ten thousand credits  faster than any college graduate in the solar system .   she said   max .  for me .     all for you  baby   i said   i told you i had a little business to do .  i wanted to surprise you .     oh  max  that s sweet of you .  i didn t really mind .  i was joking .  now you come right here to me .   she took off her coat .    what about your date .   i said .    i said i was joking   she said .    i m coming   i said faintly .    with every single one of those credits now   she said roguishly .    with every single one   i said .   i broke contact  stepped out of the booth  and now  finally  i was set   set     i heard my name called .   max .  max .   someone was running toward me .   rog crinton said i would find you here .  mamma s all right after all  so i got special passage on the space eater and what s this about ten thousand credits .    i didn t turn .  i said   hello  hilda .    and then i turned and did the hardest thing i ever succeeded in doing in all my good for nothing  space hopping life .   i managed to smile .       the gentle vultures     for fifteen years now  the hurrians had maintained their base on the other side of the moon .   it was unprecedented  unheard of .  no hurrian had dreamed it possible to be delayed so long .  the decontamination squads had been ready  ready and waiting for fifteen years  ready to swoop down through the radioactive clouds and save what might be saved for the remnant of survivors .    in return  of course  for fair payment .   but fifteen times the planet had revolved about its sun .  during each revolution  the satellite had rotated not quite thirteen times about the primary .  and in all that time the nuclear war had not come .   nuclear bombs were exploded by the large primate intelligences at various points on the planet s surface .  the planet s stratosphere had grown amazingly warm with radioactive refuse .  but still no war .   devi en hoped ardently that he would be replaced .  he was the fourth captain in charge of this colonizing expedition  if it could still be called so after fifteen years of suspended animation  and he was quite content that there should be a fifth .  now that the home world was sending an arch administrator to make a personal survey of the situation  his replacement might come soon .  good .   he stood on the surface of the moon  encased in his space suit  and thought of home  of hurria .  his long  thin arms moved restlessly with the thought  as though aching  through millions of years of instinct  for the ancestral trees .  he stood only three feet high .  what could be seen of him through the glass fronted head plate was a black and wrinkled face with the fleshy  mobile nose dead centered .  the little tuft of fine beard was a pure white in contrast .  in the rear of the suit  just below center  was the bulge within which the short and stubby hurrian tail might rest comfortably .   devi en took his appearance for granted  of course  but was well aware of the difference between the hurrians and all the other intelligences in the galaxy .  the hurrians alone were so small  they alone were tailed  they alone were vegetarians   they alone had escaped the inevitable nuclear war that had ruined every other known intelligent species .   he stood on the walled plain that extended for so many miles that the raised and circular rim  which on hurria would have been called a crater  if it were smaller  was invisible beyond the horizon .  against the southern edge of the rim  where there was always some protection against the direct rays of the sun  a city had grown .  it had begun as a temporary camp  of course  but with the years  women had been brought in  and children had been born in it .  now there were schools and elaborate hydroponics establishments  large water reservoirs  all that went with a city on an airless world .   it was ridiculous .  all because one planet had nuclear weapons and would not fight a nuclear war .   the arch administrator  who would be arriving soon  would undoubtedly ask  almost at once  the same question that devi en had asked himself a wearisome number of times .   why had there not been a nuclear war .   devi en watched the hulking mauvs preparing the ground now for the landing  smoothing out the unevennesses and laying down the ceramic bed designed to absorb the hyperatomic field thrusts with minimum discomfort to the passengers within the ship .   even in their space suits  the mauvs seemed to exude power  but it was the power of muscle only .  beyond them was the little figure of a hurrian giving orders  and the docile mauvs obeyed .  naturally .   the mauvian race  of all the large primate intelligences  paid their fees in the most unusual coin  a quota of themselves  rather than of material goods .  it was a surprisingly useful tribute  better than steel  aluminum  or fine drugs in many ways .   devi en s receiver stuttered to life .   the ship is sighted  sir   came the report .   it will be landing within the hour .     very good   said devi en .   have my car made ready to take me to the ship as soon as landing is initiated .    he did not feel that it was very good at all .   the arch administator came  flanked by a personal retinue of five mauvs .  they entered the city with him  one on each side  three following .  they helped him off with his space suit  then removed their own .   their thinly haired bodies  their large  coarse featured faces  their broad noses and flat cheekbones were repulsive but not frightening .  though twice the height of the hurrians and more than twice the breadth  there was a blankness about their eyes  something completely submissive about the way they stood  with their thick sinewed necks slightly bent  their bulging arms hanging listlessly .   the arch administrator dismissed them and they trooped out .  he did not really need their protection  of course  but his position required a retinue of five and that was that .   no business was discussed during the meal or during the almost endless ritual of welcome .  at a time that might have been more appropriate for sleeping  the arch administrator passed small fingers through his tuft of beard and said   how much longer must we wait for this planet  captain .    he was visibly advancing in age .  the hair on his upper arms was grizzled and the tufts at the elbows were almost as white as his beard .    i cannot say  your height   said devi en humbly .   they have not followed the path .     that is obvious .  the point is  why have they not followed the path .  it is clear to the council that your reports promise more than they deliver .  you talk of theories but you give no details .  now we are tired of all this back on hurria .  if you know of anything you have not told us  now is the time to talk of it .     the matter  your height  is hard to prove .  we have had no experience of spying on a people over such an extended period .  until recently  we weren t watching for the right things .  each year we kept expecting the nuclear war the year after and it is only in my time as captain that we have taken to studying the people more intensively .  it is at least one benefit of the long waiting time that we have learned some of their principal languages .     indeed .  without even landing on their planet .    devi en explained .   a number of radio messages were recorded by those of our ships that penetrated the planetary atmosphere on observation missions  particularly in the early years .  i set our linguistics computers to work on them  and for the last year i have been attempting to make sense out of it all .    the arch administrator stared .  his bearing was such that any outright exclamation of surprise would have been superfluous .   and have you learned anything of interest .     i may have  your height  but what i have worked out is so strange and the underpinning of actual evidence is so uncertain that i dared not speak of it officially in my reports .    the arch administrator understood .  he said  stiffly   would you object to explaining your views unofficially    to me .     i would be glad to   said devi en at once .   the inhabitants of this planet are  of course  large primate in nature .  and they are competitive .    the other blew out his breath in a kind of relief and passed his tongue quickly over his nose .    i had the queer notion   he muttered   that they might not be competitive and that that might   but go on  go on .     they are competitive   devi en assured him .   much more so than one would expect on the average .     then why doesn t everything else follow .     up to a point it does  your height .  after the usual long incubation period  they began to mechanize  and after that  the usual large primate killings became truly destructive warfare .  at the conclusion of the most recent large scale war  nuclear weapons were developed and the war ended at once .    the arch administrator nodded .   and then .    devi en said   what should have happened was that a nuclear war ought to have begun shortly afterward and in the course of the war  nuclear weapons would have developed quickly in destructiveness  have been used nevertheless in typical large primate fashion  and have quickly reduced the population to starving remnants in a ruined world .     of course  but that didn t happen .  why not .    devi en said   there is one point .  i believe these people  once mechanization started  developed at an unusually high rate .     and if so .   said the other .   does that matter .  they reached nuclear weapons the more quickly .     true .  but after the most recent general war  they continued to develop nuclear weapons at an unusual rate .  that s the trouble .  the deadly potential had increased before the nuclear war had a chance to start and now it has reached a point where even large primate intelligences dare not risk a war .    the arch administrator opened his small black eyes wide .   but that is impossible .  i don t care how technically talented these creatures are .  military science advances rapidly only during a war .     perhaps that is not true in the case of these particular creatures .  but even if it were  it seems they are having a war  not a real war  but a war .     not a real war  but a war   repeated the arch administrator blankly .   what does that mean .     i m not sure .   devi en wiggled his nose in exasperation .   this is where my attempts to draw logic out of the scattered material we have picked up is least satisfactory .  this planet has something called a cold war .  whatever it is  it drives them furiously onward in research and yet it does not involve complete nuclear destruction .    the arch administrator said   impossible .    devi en said   there is the planet .  here we are .  we have been waiting fifteen years .    the arch administrator s long arms came up and crossed over his head and down again to the opposite shoulders .   then there is only one thing to do .  the council has considered the possibilty that the planet may have achieved a stalemate  a kind of uneasy peace that balances just short of a nuclear war .  something of the sort you describe  though no one suggested the actual reasons you advance .  but it s something we can t allow .     no  your height .     no   he seemed almost in pain .   the longer the stalemate continues  the greater the possibility that large primate individuals may discover the methods of interstellar travel .  they will leak out into the galaxy  in full competitive strength .  you see .     then .    the arch administrator hunched his head deeper into his arms  as though not wishing to hear what he himself must say .  his voice was a little muffled .   if they are balanced precariously  we must push them a little  captain .  we must push them .    devi en s stomach churned and he suddenly tasted his dinner once more in the back of his throat .   push them  your height .   he didn t want to understand .   but the arch administrator put it bluntly   we must help them start their nuclear war .   he looked as miserably sick as devi en felt .  he whispered   we must .    devi en could scarcely speak .  he said  in a whisper   but how could such a thing be done  your height .     i don t know how .    and do not look at me so .  it is not my decision .  it is the decision of the council .  surely you understand what would happen to the galaxy if a large primate intelligence were to enter space in full strength without having been tamed by nuclear war .    devi en shuddered at the thought .  all that competitiveness loosed on the galaxy .  he persisted though .   but how does one start a nuclear war .  how is it done .     i don t know  i tell you .  but there must be some way  perhaps a   a message we might send or a   a crucial rainstorm we might start by cloud seeding .  we could manage a great deal with their weather conditions       how would that start a nuclear war .   said devi en  unimpressed   maybe it wouldn t .  i mention such a thing only as a possible example .  but large primates would know .  after all  they are the ones who do start nuclear wars in actual fact .  it is in their brain pattern to know .  that is the decision the council came to .    devi en felt the soft noise his tail made as it thumped slowly against the chair .  he tried to stop it and failed .   what decision  your height .     to trap a large primate from the planet s surface .  to kidnap one .     a wild one .     it s the only kind that exists at the moment on the planet .  of course  a wild one .     and what do you expect him to tell us .     that doesn t matter  captain .  as long as he says enough about anything  mentalic analysis will give us the answer .    devi en withdrew his head as far as he could into the space between his shoulder blades .  the skin just under his armpits quivered with repulsion .  a wild large primate being .  he tried to picture one  untouched by the stunning aftermath of nuclear war  unaltered by the civilizing influence of human eugenic breeding .   the arch administrator made no attempt to hide the fact that he shared the repulsion  but he said   you will have to lead the trapping expedition  captain .  it is for the good of the galaxy .    devi en had seen the planet a number of times before but each time a ship swung about the moon and placed the world in his line of sight a wave of unbearable homesickness swept him .   it was a beautiful planet  so like hurria itself in dimensions and characteristics but wilder and grander .  the sight of it  after the desolation of the moon  was like a blow .   how many other planets like it were on hurrian master listings at this moment  he wondered .  how many other planets were there concerning which meticulous observers had reported seasonal changes in appearance that could be interpreted only as being caused by artificial cultivation of food plants .  how many times in the future would a day come when the radioactivity in the stratosphere of one of these planets would begin to climb  when colonizing squadrons would have to be sent out at once .      as they were to this planet .   it was almost pathetic  the confidence with which the hurrians had proceeded at first .  devi en could have laughed as he read through those initial reports  if he weren t trapped in this project himself now .  the hurrian scoutships had moved close to the planet to gather geographical information  to locate population centers .  they were sighted  of course  but what did it matter .  any time  now  they thought  the final explosion .   any time   but useless years passed and the scoutships wondered if they ought not to be cautious .  they moved back .   devi en s ship was cautious now .  the crew was on edge because of the unpleasantness of the mission  not all devi en s assurances that there was no harm intended to the large primate could quite calm them .  even so  they could not hurry matters .  it had to be over a fairly deserted and uncultivated tract of uneven ground that they hovered .  they stayed at a height of ten miles for days  while the crew became edgier and only the ever stolid mauvs maintained calm .   then the scope showed them a creature  alone on the uneven ground  a long staff in one hand  a pack across the upper portion of his back .   they lowered silently  supersonically .  devi en himself  skin crawling  was at the controls .   the creature was heard to say two definite things before he was taken  and they were the first comments recorded for use in mentalic computing .   the first  when the large primate caught sight of the ship almost upon him  was picked up by the direction telemike .  it was   my god .  a flying saucer .    devi en understood the second phrase .  that was a term for the hurrian ships that had grown common among the large primates those first careless years .   the second remark was made when the wild creature was brought into the ship  struggling with amazing strength  but helpless in the iron grip of the unperturbed mauvs .   devi en  panting  with his fleshy nose quivering slightly  advanced to receive him  and the creature  whose unpleasantly hairless face had become oily with some sort of fluid secretion  yelled   holy toledo  a monkey .    again  devi en understood the second part .  it was the word for little primate in one of the chief languages of the planet .   the wild creature was almost impossible to handle .  he required infinite patience before he could be spoken to reasonably .  at first  there was nothing but a series of crises .  the creature realized almost at once that he was being taken off earth  and what devi en thought might prove an exciting experience for him  proved nothing of the sort .  he talked instead of his offspring and of a large primate female .    they have wives and children  thought devi en  compassionately  and  in their way  love them  for all they are large primate .    then he had to be made to understand that the mauvs who kept him under guard and who restrained him when his violence made that necessary would not hurt him  that he was not to be damaged in any way .    devi en was sickened at the thought that one intelligent being might be damaged by another .  it was very difficult to discuss the subject  even if only to admit the possibility long enough to deny it .  the creature from the planet treated the very hesitation with great suspicion .  it was the way the large primates were .    on the fifth day  when out of sheer exhaustion  perhaps  the creature remained quiet over a fairly extended period  they talked in devi en s private quarters  and suddenly he grew angry again when the human first explained  matter of factly  that they were waiting for a nuclear war    waiting .   cried the creature .   what makes you so sure there will be one .    devi en wasn t sure  of course  but he said   there is always a nuclear war .  it is our purpose to help you afterward .     help us afterward .   his words grew incoherent .  he waved his arms violently  and the mauvs who flanked him had to restrain him gently once again and lead him away .   devi en sighed .  the creature s remarks were building in quantity and perhaps mentalics could do something with them .  his own unaided mind could make nothing of them .   and meanwhile the creature was not thriving .  his body was almost completely hairless  a fact that long distance observation had not revealed owing to the artificial skins worn by them .  this was either for warmth or because of an instinctive repulsion even on the part of these particular large primates themselves for hairless skin .   it might be an interesting subject to take up .  mentalics computation could make as much out of one set of remarks as another .    strangely enough  the creature s face had begun to sprout hair  more  in fact  than the hurrian face had  and of a darker color .   but still  the central fact was that he was not thriving .  he had grown thinner because he was eating poorly  and if he was kept too long  his health might suffer .  devi en had no wish to feel responsible for that .   on the next day  the large primate seemed quite calm .  he talked almost eagerly  bringing the subject around to nuclear warfare almost at once .   it had a terrible attraction for the large primate mind  devi en thought .    the creature said   you said nuclear wars always happen .  does that mean there are other people than yours and mine   and theirs .   he indicated the near by mauvs .    there are thousands of intelligent species  living on thousands of worlds .  many thousands   said devi en .    and they all have nuclear wars .     all who have reached a certain stage of technology .  all but us .  we were different .  we lacked competitiveness .  we had the co operative instinct .     you mean you know that nuclear wars will happen and you do nothing about it .     we do  said devi en  pained .   of course  we do .  we try to help .  in the early history of my people  when we first developed space travel  we did not understand large primates .  they repelled our attempts at friendship and we stopped trying .  then we found worlds in radioactive ruins .  finally  we found one world actually in the process of a nuclear war .  we were horrified  but could do nothing .  slowly  we learned .  we are ready  now  at every world we discover to be at the nuclear stage .  we are ready with decontamination equipment and eugenic analyzers .     what are eugenic analyzers .    devi en had manufactured the phrase by analogy with what he knew of the wild one s language .  now he said carefully   we direct matings and sterilizations to remove  as far as possible  the competitive element in the remnant of the survivors .    for a moment  he thought the creature would grow violent again .   instead  the other said in a monotone   you make them docile  you mean  like these things .   once again he indicated the mauvs .    no .  no .  these are different .  we simply make it possible for the remnants to be content with a peaceful  nonexpanding  nonaggressive society under our guidance .  without this  they destroyed themselves  you see  and without it  they would destroy themselves again .     what do you get out of it .    devi en stared at the creature dubiously .  was it really necessary to explain the basic pleasure of life .  he said   don t you enjoy helping someone .     come on .  besides that .  what s in it for you .     of course  there are contributions to hurria .     ha .     payment for saving a species is only fair   protested devi en   and there are expenses to be covered .  the contribution is not much and is adjusted to the nature of the world .  it may be an annual supply of wood from a forested world  manganese salts from another .  the world of these mauvs is poor in physical resources and they themselves offered to supply us with a number of individuals to use as personal assistants .  they are extremely powerful even for large primates and we treat them painlessly with anticerebral drugs       to make zombies out of them .    devi en guessed at the meaning of the noun and said indignantly   not at all .  merely to make them content with their role as personal servant and forgetful of their homes .  we would not want them to be unhappy .  they are intelligent beings .     and what would you do with earth if we had a war .     we have had fifteen years to decide that   said devi en .   your world is very rich in iron and has developed a fine steel technology .  steel  i think  would be your contribution .   he sighed   but the contribution would not make up for our expense in this case  i think .  we have overwaited now by ten years at least .    the large primate said   how many races do you tax in this way .     i do not know the exact number .  certainly more than a thousand .     then you re the little landlords of the galaxy  are you .  a thousand worlds destroy themselves in order to contribute to your welfare .  you re something else  too  you know .   the wild one s voice was rising  growing shrill .   you re vultures .     vultures .   said devi en  trying to place the word .    carrion eaters .  birds that wait for some poor creature to die of thirst in the desert and then come down to eat the body .    devi en felt himself turn faint and sick at the picture conjured up for him .  he said weakly   no  no  we help the species .     you wait for the war to happen like vultures .  if you want to help  prevent the war .  don t save the remnants .  save them all .    devi en s tail twitched with sudden excitement .   how do we prevent a war .  will you tell me that .    what was prevention of war but the reverse of bringing about a war .  learn one process and surely the other would be obvious .    but the wild one faltered .  he said finally   get down there .  explain the situation .    devi en felt keen disappointment .  that didn t help .  besides    he said   land among you .  quite impossible .    his skin quivered in half a dozen places at the thought of mingling with the wild ones in their untamed billions .   perhaps the sick look on devi en s face was so pronounced and unmistakable that the wild one could recognize it for what it was even across the barrier of species .  he tried to fling himself at the hurrian and had to be caught virtually in mid air by one of the mauvs  who held him immobile with an effortless constriction of biceps .   the wild one screamed .   no .  just sit here and wait .  vulture .  vulture .  vulture .    it was days before devi en could bring himself to see the wild one again .  he was almost brought to disrespect of the arch administrator when the latter insisted that he lacked sufficient data for a complete analysis of the mental make up of these wild ones .   devi en said boldly   surely  there is enough to give some solution to our question .    the arch administrator s nose quivered and his pink tongue passed over it meditatively .   a solution of a kind  perhaps .  i can t trust this solution .  we are facing a very unusual species .  we know that already .  we can t afford to make mistakes .    one thing  at least .  we have happened upon a highly intelligent one .  unless   unless he is at his race s norm .   the arch administrator seemed upset at that thought .   devi en said   the creature brought up the horrible picture of that   that bird   that       vulture   said the arch administrator .    it put our entire mission into such a distorted light .  i have not been able to eat properly since  or sleep .  in fact  i am afraid i will have to ask to be relieved       not before we have completed what we have set out to do   said the arch administrator firmly .   do you think i enjoy the picture of   of carrion eat   you must collect more data .    devi en nodded finally .  he understood  of course .  the arch administrator was no more anxious to cause a nuclear war than any hurrian would be .  he was putting off the moment of decision as long as possible .   devi en settled himself for one more interview with the wild one .  it turned out to be a completely unbearable one  and the last .   the wild one had a bruise across his cheek as though he had been resisting the mauvs again .  in fact  it was certain he had .  he had done so numerous times before  and the mauvs  despite their most earnest attempts to do no harm  could not help but bruise him on occasion .  one would expect the wild one to see how intensely they tried not to hurt him and to quiet his behavior as a result .  instead  it was as though the conviction of safety spurred him on to additional resistance .    these large primate species were vicious  vicious  thought devi en sadly .    for over an hour  the interview hovered over useless small talk and then the wild one said with sudden belligerence   how long did you say you things have been here .     fifteen of your years   said devi en .    that figures .  the first flying saucers were sighted just after world war ii .  how much longer before the nuclear war .    with automatic truth  devi en said   we wish we knew   and stopped suddenly .   the wild one said   i thought nuclear war was inevitable .  last time you said you overstayed ten years .  you expected the war ten years ago  didn t you .    devi en said   i can t discuss this subject .     no .   the wild one was screaming .   what are you going to do about it .  how long will you wait .  why not nudge it a little .  don t just wait  vulture .  start one .    devi en jumped to his feet .   what are you saying .     why else are you waiting  you dirty     he choked on a completely incomprehensible expletive  then continued  breathlessly   isn t that what vultures do when some poor miserable animal  or man  maybe  is taking too long to die .  they can t wait .  they come swirling down and peck out his eyes .  they wait till he s helpless and just hurry him along the last step .    devi en ordered him away quickly and retired to his sleeping room  where he was sick for hours .  nor did he sleep then or that night .  the word  vulture  screamed in his ears and that final picture danced before his eyes .     devi en said firmly   your height  i can speak with the wild one no more .  if you need still more data  i cannot help you .    the arch administrator looked haggard .   i know .  this vulture business   very difficult to take .  yet you notice the thought didn t affect him .  large primates are immune to such things  hardened  calloused .  it is part of their way of thinking .  horrible .     i can get you no more data .     it s all right .  i understand .    besides  each additional item only strengthens the preliminary answer  the answer i thought was only provisional  that i hoped earnestly was only provisional .   he buried his head in his grizzled arms .   we have a way to start their nuclear war for them .     oh .  what need be done .     it is something very direct  very simple .  it is something i could never have thought of .  nor you .     what is it  your height .   he felt an anticipatory dread .    what keeps them at peace now is that neither of two nearly equal sides dares take the responsibility of starting a war .  if one side did  however  the other   well  let s be blunt about it   would retaliate in full .    devi en nodded .   the arch administrator went on .   if a single nuclear bomb fell on the territory of either of the two sides  the victims would at once assume the other side had launched it .  they would feel they could not wait for further attacks .  retaliation in full would follow within hours  the other side would retaliate in its turn .  within weeks it would be over .     but how do we make one of them drop that first bomb .     we don t  captain .  that is the point .  we drop the first bomb ourselves .     what .   devi en swayed .    that is it .  compute a large primate s mind and that answer thrusts itself at you .     but how can we .     we assemble a bomb .  that is easy enough .  we send it down by ship and drop it over some inhabited locality       inhabited .    the arch administrator looked away and said uneasily   the effect is lost otherwise .     i see   said devi en .  he was picturing vultures  he couldn t help it .  he visualized them as large  scaled bird  like the small harmless flying creatures on hurria  but immensely large   with rubber skinned wings and long razor bills  circling down  pecking at dying eyes .   his hands covered his eyes .  he said shakily   who will pilot the ship .  who will launch the bomb .    the arch administrator s voice was no stronger than devi en s .   i don t know .     i won t   said devi en .   i can t .  there is no hurrian who can  at any price .    the arch administrator rocked back and forth miserably .   perhaps the mauvs could be given orders       who could give them such orders .    the arch administrator sighed heavily .   i will call the council .  they may have all the data .  perhaps they will suggest something .      so after a little over fifteen years  the hurrians were dismantling their base on the other side of the moon .  nothing had been accomplished .  the large primates of the planet had not had their nuclear war  they might never have .   and despite all the future horror that might bring  devi en was in an agony of happiness .  there was no point in thinking of the future .  for the present  he was getting away from this most horrible of horrible worlds .   he watched the moon fall away and shrink to a spot of light  along with the planet  and the sun of the system itself  till the whole thing was lost among the constellations   it was only then that he could feel anything but relief .  it was only then that he felt a first tiny twinge of it might have been .   he said to the arch administrator   it might all have been well if we had been more patient .  they might yet have blundered into nuclear war .    the arch administrator said   somehow i doubt it .  the mentalic analysis of      he stopped and devi en understood .  the wild one had been replaced on his planet with minimal harm .  the events of the past weeks had been blanked out of his mind .  he had been placed near a small  inhabited locality not far from the spot where he had been first found .  his fellows would assume he had been lost .  they would blame his loss of weight  his bruises  his amnesia upon the hardships he had undergone .   but the harm done by him     if only they had not brought him up to the moon in the first place .  they might have reconciled themselves to the thought of starting a war .  they might somehow have thought of dropping a bomb  and worked out some indirect  long distance system for doing so .   it had been the wild one s word picture of the vulture that had stopped it all .  it had ruined devi en and the arch administrator .  when all data was sent back to hurria  the effect on the council itself had been notable .  the order to dismantle the base had come quickly .   devi en said   i will never take part in colonization again .    the arch administrator said mournfully   none of us may ever have to .  the wild ones of that planet will emerge and with large primates and large primate thinking loose in the galaxy  it will mean the end of   of      devi en s nose twitched .  the end of everything  of all the good hurria had done in the galaxy  all the good it might have continued to do in the future .   he said   we ought to have dropped     and did not finish .   what was the use of saying that .  they couldn t have dropped the bomb for all the galaxy .  if they could have  they would have been large primate themselves in their manner of thinking  and there are worse things than merely the end of everything .   devi en thought of the vultures .       all the troubles of the world     the greatest industry on earth centered about multivac   multivac  the giant computer that had grown in fifty years until its various ramifications had filled washington  d . c .  to the suburbs and had reached out tendrils into every city and town on earth .   an army of civil servants fed it data constantly and another army correlated and interpreted the answers it gave .  a corps of engineers patrolled its interior while mines and factories consumed themselves in keeping its reserve stocks of replacement parts ever complete  ever accurate  ever satisfactory in every way .   multivac directed earth s economy and helped earth s science .  most important of all  it was the central clearing house of all known facts about each individual earthman .   and each day it was part of multivac s duties to take the four billion sets of facts about individual human beings that filled its vitals and extrapolate them for an additional day of time .  every corrections department on earth received the data appropriate to its own area of jurisdiction  and the over all data was presented in one large piece to the central board of corrections in washington  d . c .   bernard gulliman was in the fourth week of his year term as chairman of the central board of corrections and had grown casual enough to accept the morning report without being frightened by it .  as usual  it was a sheaf of papers some six inches thick .  he knew by now  he was not expected to read it .   no human could .   still  it was amusing to glance through it .   there was the usual list of predictable crimes  frauds of all sorts  larcenies  riots  manslaughters  arsons .   he looked for one particular heading and felt a slight shock at finding it there at all  then another one at seeing two entries .  not one  but two .  two first degree murders .  he had not seen two in one day in all his term as chairman so far .   he punched the knob of the two way intercom and waited for the smooth face of his co ordinator to appear on the screen .    ali   said gulliman .   there are two first degrees this day .  is there any unusual problem .     no  sir .   the dark complexioned face with its sharp  black eyes seemed restless .   both cases are quite low probability .     i know that   said gulliman .   i observed that neither probability is higher than    per cent .  just the same  multivac has a reputation to maintain .  it has virtually wiped out crime  and the public judges that by its record on first degree murder which is  of course  the most spectacular crime .    ali othman nodded .   yes  sir .  i quite realize that .     you also realize  i hope   gulliman said   that i don t want a single consummated case of it during my term .  if any other crime slips through  i may allow excuses .  if a first degree murder slips through  i ll have your hide .  understand .     yes  sir .  the complete analyses of the two potential murders are already at the district offices involved .  the potential criminals and victims are under observation .  i have rechecked the probabilities of consummation and they are already dropping .     very good   said gulliman  and broke connection .   he went back to the list with an uneasy feeling that perhaps he had been overpompous .    but then  one had to be firm with these permanent civil service personnel and make sure they didn t imagine they were running everything  including the chairman .  particularly this othman  who had been working with multivac since both were considerably younger  and had a proprietary air that could be infuriating .   to gulliman  this matter of crime was the political chance of a lifetime .  so far  no chairman had passed through his term without a murder taking place somewhere on earth  some time .  the previous chairman had ended with a record of eight  three more  more  in fact  than under his predecessor .   now gulliman intended to have none .  he was going to be  he had decided  the first chairman without any murder at all anywhere on earth during his term .  after that  and the favorable publicity that would result     he barely skimmed the rest of the report .  he estimated that there were at least two thousand cases of prospective wife beatings listed .  undoubtedly  not all would be stopped in time .  perhaps thirty per cent would be consummated .  but the incidence was dropping and consummations were dropping even more quickly .   multivac had added wife beating to its list of predictable crimes only some five years earlier and the average man was not yet accustomed to the thought that if he planned to wallop his wife  it would be known in advance .  as the conviction percolated through society  woman would first suffer fewer bruises and then  eventually  none .   some husband beatings were on the list  too  gulliman noticed .   ali othman closed connections and stared at the screen from which gulliman s jowled and balding head had departed .  then he looked across at his assistant  rafe leemy and said   what do we do .     don t ask me .  he s worried about just a lousy murder or two .     it s an awful chance trying to handle this thing on our own .  still if we tell him  he ll have a first class fit .  these elective politicians have their skins to think of  so he s bound to get in our way and make things worse .    leemy nodded his head and put a thick lower lip between his teeth .   trouble is  though  what if we miss out .  it would just about be the end of the world  you know .     if we miss out  who cares what happens to us .  we ll just be part of the general catastrophe .   then he said in a more lively manner   but hell  the probability is only    .   per cent .  on anything else  except maybe murder  we d let the probabilities rise a bit before taking any action at all .  there could still be spontaneous correction .     i wouldn t count on it   said leemy dryly .    i don t intend to .  i was just pointing the fact out .  still  at this probability  i suggest we confine ourselves to simple observation for the moment .  no one could plan a crime like this alone  there must be accomplices .     multivac didn t name any .     i know .  still     his voice trailed off .   so they stared at the details of the one crime not included on the list handed out to gulliman  the one crime much worse than first degree murder  the one crime never before attempted in the history of multivac  and wondered what to do .     ben manners considered himself the happiest sixteen year old in baltimore .  this was  perhaps  doubtful .  but he was certainly one of the happiest  and one of the most excited .   at least  he was one of the handful admitted to the galleries of the stadium during the swearing in of the eighteen year olds .  his older brother was going to be sworn in so his parents had applied for spectator s tickets and they had allowed ben to do so  too .  but when multivac chose among all the applicants  it was ben who got the ticket .   two years later  ben would be sworn in himself  but watching big brother michael now was the next best thing .   his parents had dressed him  or supervised the dressing  at any rate  with all care  as representative of the family and sent him off with numerous messages for michael  who had left days earlier for preliminary physical and neurological examinations .   the stadium was on the outskirts of town and ben  just bursting with self importance  was shown to his seat .  below him  now  were rows upon rows of hundreds upon hundreds of eighteen year olds  boys to the right  girls to   the left   all from the second district of baltimore .  at various times in the year  similar meetings were going on all over the world  but this was baltimore  this was the important one .  down there  somewhere  was mike  ben s own brother .   ben scanned the tops of heads  thinking somehow he might recognize his brother .  he didn t  of course  but then a man came out on the raised platform in front of all the crowd and ben stopped looking to listen .   the man said   good afternoon  swearers and guests .  i am randolph t .  hoch  in charge of the baltimore ceremonies this year .  the swearers have met me several times now during the progress of the physical and neurological portions of this examination .  most of the task is done  but the most important matter is left .  the swearer himself  his personality  must go into multivac s records .    each year  this requires some explanation to the young people reaching adulthood .  until now   he turned to the young people before him and his eyes went no more to the gallery   you have not been adult  you have not been individuals in the eyes of multivac  except where you were especially singled out as such by your parents or your government .    until now  when the time for the yearly up dating of information came  it was your parents who filled in the necessary data on you .  now the time has come for you to take over that duty yourself .  it is a great honor  a great responsibility .  your parents have told us what schooling you ve had  what diseases  what habits  a great many things .  but now you must tell us a great deal more  your innermost thoughts  your most secret deeds .    this is hard to do the first time  embarrassing even  but it must be done .  once it is done  multivac will have a complete analysis of all of you in its files .  it will understand your actions and reactions .  it will even be able to guess with fair accuracy at your future actions and reactions .    in this way  multivac will protect you .  if you are in danger of accident  it will know .  if someone plans harm to you  it will know .  if you plan harm  it will know and you will be stopped in time so that it will not be necessary to punish you .    with its knowledge of all of you  multivac will be able to help earth adjust its economy and its laws for the good of all .  if you have a personal problem  you may come to multivac with it and with its knowledge of all of you  multivac will be able to help you .    now you will have many forms to fill out .  think carefully and answer all questions as accurately as you can .  do not hold back through shame or caution .  no one will ever know your answers except multivac unless it becomes necessary to learn the answers in order to protect you .  and then only authorized officials of the government will know .    it may occur to you to stretch the truth a bit here or there .  don t do this .  we will find out if you do .  all your answers put together form a pattern .  if some answers are false  they will not fit the pattern and multivac will discover them .  if all your answers are false  there will be a distorted pattern of a type that multivac will recognize .  so you must tell the truth .    eventually  it was all over  however  the form filling  the ceremonies and speeches that followed .  in the evening  ben  standing tiptoe  finally spotted michael  who was still carrying the robes he had worn in the  parade of the adults .   they greeted one another with jubilation .   they shared a light supper and took the expressway home  alive and alight with the greatness of the day .   they were not prepared  then  for the sudden transition of the home coming .  it was a numbing shock to both of them to be stopped by a cold faced young man in uniform outside their own front door  to have their papers inspected before they could enter their own house  to find their own parents sitting forlornly in the living room  the mark of tragedy on their faces .   joseph manners  looking much older than he had that morning  looked out of his puzzled  deep sunken eyes at his sons  one with the robes of new adulthood still over his arm  and said   i seem to be under house arrest .      bernard gulliman could not and did not read the entire report .  he read only the summary and that was most gratifying  indeed .   a whole generation  it seemed  had grown up accustomed to the fact that multivac could predict the commission of major crimes .  they learned that corrections agents would be on the scene before the crime could be committed .  they found out that consummation of the crime led to inevitable punishment .  gradually  they were convinced that there was no way anyone could outsmart multivac .   the result was  naturally  that even the intention of crime fell off .  and as such intentions fell off and as multivac s capacity was enlarged  minor crimes could be added to the list it would predict each morning  and these crimes  too  were now shrinking in incidence .   so gulliman had ordered an analysis made  by multivac naturally  of multivac s capacity to turn its attention to the problem of predicting probabilities of disease incidence .  doctors might soon be alerted to individual patients who might grow diabetic in the course of the next year  or suffer an attack of tuberculosis or grow a cancer .   an ounce of prevention     and the report was a favorable one .   after that  the roster of the day s possible crimes arrived and there was not a first degree murder on the list .   gulliman put in an intercom call to ali othman in high good humor .   othman  how do the numbers of crimes in the daily lists of the past week average compared with those in my first week as chairman .    it had gone down  it turned out  by   per cent and gulliman was happy indeed .  no fault of his own  of course  but the electorate would not know that .  he blessed his luck that he had come in at the right time  at the very climax of multivac  when disease  too  could be placed under its all embracing and protecting knowledge .   gulliman would prosper by this .   othman shrugged his shoulders .   well  he s happy .     when do we break the bubble .   said leemy .   putting manners under observation just raised the probabilities and house arrest gave it another boost .     don t i know it .   said othman peevishly .   what i don t know is why .     accomplices  maybe  like you said .  with manners in trouble  the rest have to strike at once or be lost .     just the other way around .  with our hand on one  the rest would scatter for safety and disappear .  besides  why aren t the accomplices named by multivac .     well  then  do we tell gulliman .     no  not yet .  the probability is still only    .   per cent .  let s get a bit more drastic first .      elizabeth manners said to her younger son   you go to your room  ben .     but what s it all about  mom .   asked ben  voice breaking at this strange ending to what had been a glorious day .    please .    he left reluctantly  passing through the door to the stairway  walking up it noisily and down again quietly .   and mike manners  the older son  the new minted adult and the hope of the family  said in a voice and tone that mirrored his brother s   what s it all about .    joe manners said   as heaven is my witness  son  i don t know .  i haven t done anything .     well  sure you haven t done anything .   mike looked at his small boned  mild mannered father in wonder .   they must be here because you re thinking of doing something .     i m not .    mrs .  manners broke in angrily   how can he be thinking of doing something worth all   all this .   she cast her arm about  in a gesture  toward the enclosing shell of government men about the house .   when i was a little girl  i remember the father of a friend of mine was working in a bank  and they once called him up and said to leave the money alone and he did .  it was fifty thousand dollars .  he hadn t really taken it .  he was just thinking about taking it .  they didn t keep those things as quiet in those days as they do now  the story got out .  that s how i know about it .    but i mean   she went on  rubbing her plump hands slowly together   that was fifty thousand dollars  fifty    thousand   dollars .  yet all they did was call him  one phone call .  what could your father be planning that would make it worth having a dozen men come down and close off the house .    joe manners said  eyes filled with pain   i am planning no crime  not even the smallest .  i swear it .    mike  filled with the conscious wisdom of a new adult  said   maybe it s something subconscious  pop .  some resentment against your supervisor .     so that i would want to kill him .  no .     won t they tell you what it is  pop .    his mother interrupted again   no  they won t .  we ve asked .  i said they were ruining our standing in the community just being here .  the least  they could do is tell us what it s all about so we could fight it  so we could explain .     and they wouldn t .     they wouldn t .    mike stood with his legs spread apart and his hands deep in his pockets .  he said  troubled   gee  mom  multivac doesn t make mistakes .    his father pounded his fist helplessly on the arm of the sofa .   i tell you i m not planning any crime .    the door opened without a knock and a man in uniform walked in with sharp  self possessed stride .  his face had a glazed  official appearance .  he said   are you joseph manners .    joe manners rose to his feet .   yes .  now what is it you want of me .     joseph manners  i place you under arrest by order of the government   and curtly he showed his identification as a corrections officer .   i must ask you to come with me .     for what reason .  what have i done .     i am not at liberty to discuss that .     but i can t be arrested just for planning a crime even if i were doing that .  to be arrested i must actually have done something .  you can t arrest me otherwise .  it s against the law .    the officer was impervious to the logic .   you will have to come with me .    mrs .  manners shrieked and fell on the couch  weeping hysterically .  joseph manners could not bring himself to violate the code drilled into him all his life by actually resisting an officer  but he hung back at least  forcing the corrections officer to use muscular power to drag him forward .   and manners called out as he went   but tell me what it is .  just tell me .  if i knew    is it murder .  am i supposed to be planning murder .    the door closed behind him and mike manners  white faced and suddenly feeling not the least bit adult  stared first at the door  then at his weeping mother .   ben manners  behind the door and suddenly feeling quite adult  pressed his lips tightly together and thought he knew exactly what to do .   if multivac took away  multivac could also give .  ben had been at the ceremonies that very day .  he had heard this man  randolph hoch  speak of multivac and all that multivac could do .  it could direct the government and it could also unbend and help out some plain person who came to it for help .   anyone could ask help of multivac and anyone meant ben .  neither his mother nor mike were in any condition to stop him now  and he had some money left of the amount they had given him for his great outing that day .  if afterward they found him gone and worried about it  that couldn t be helped .  right now  his first loyalty was to his father .   he ran out the back way and the officer at the door cast a glance at his papers and let him go .     harold quimby handled the complaints department of the baltimore substation of multivac .  he considered himself to be a member of that branch of the civil service that was most important of all .  in some ways  he may have been right  and those who heard him discuss the matter would have had to be made of iron not to feel impressed .   for one thing  quimby would say  multivac was essentially an invader of privacy .  in the past fifty years  mankind had had to acknowledge that its thoughts and impulses were no longer secret  that it owned no inner recess where anything could be hidden .  and mankind had to have something in return .   of course  it got prosperity  peace  and safety  but that was abstract .  each man and woman needed something personal as his or her own reward for surrendering privacy  and each one got it .  within reach of every human being was a multivac station with circuits into which he could freely enter his own problems and questions without control or hindrance  and from which  in a matter of minutes  he could receive answers .   at any given moment  five million individual circuits among the quadrillion or more within multivac might be involved in this question and answer program .  the answers might not always be certain  but they were the best available  and every questioner knew the answer to be the best available and had faith in it .  that was what counted .   and now an anxious sixteen year old had moved slowly up the waiting line of men and women  each in that line illuminated by a different mixture of hope with fear or anxiety or even anguish   always with hope predominating as the person stepped nearer and nearer to multivac  .   without looking up  quimby took the filled out form being handed him and said   booth   b .    ben said   how do i ask the question  sir .    quimby looked up then  with a bit of surprise .  preadults did not generally make use of the service .  he said kindly   have you ever done this before  son .     no  sir .    quimby pointed to the model on his desk .   you use this .  you see how it works .  just like a typewriter .  don t you try to write or print anything by hand .  just use the machine .  now you take booth   b  and if you need help  just press the red button and someone will come .  down that aisle  son  on the right .    he watched the youngster go down the aisle and out of view and smiled .  no one was ever turned away from multivac .  of course  there was always a certain percentage of trivia  people who asked personal questions about their neighbors or obscene questions about prominent personalities  college youths trying to outguess their professors or thinking it clever to stump multivac by asking it russell s class of all classes paradox and so on .   multivac could take care of all that .  it needed no help .   besides  each question and answer was filed and formed but another item in the fact assembly for each individual .  even the most trivial question and the most impertinent  insofar as it reflected the personality of the questioner  helped humanity by helping multivac know about humanity .   quimby turned his attention to the next person in line  a middle aged woman  gaunt and angular  with the look of trouble in her eye .     ali othman strode the length of his office  his heels thumping desperately on the carpet .   the probability still goes up .  it s    .   per cent now .  damnation .  we have joseph manners under actual arrest and it still goes up .   he was perspiring freely .   leemy turned away from the telephone .   no confession yet .  he s under psychic probing and there is no sign of crime .  he may be telling the truth .    othman said   is multivac crazy then .    another phone sprang to life .  othman closed connections quickly  glad of the interruption .  a corrections officer s face came to life in the screen .  the officer said   sir  are there any new directions as to manners  family .  are they to be allowed to come and go as they have been .     what do you mean  as they have been .      the original instructions were for the house arrest of joseph manners .  nothing was said of the rest of the family  sir .     well  extend it to the rest of the family until you are informed otherwise .     sir  that is the point .  the mother and older son are demanding information about the younger son .  the younger son is gone and they claim he is in custody and wish to go to headquarters to inquire about it .    othman frowned and said in almost a whisper   younger son .  how young .     sixteen  sir   said the officer .    sixteen and he s gone .  don t you know where .     he was allowed to leave  sir .  there were no orders to hold him .     hold the line .  don t move .   othman put the line into suspension  then clutched at his coal black hair with both lands and shrieked   fool .  fool .  fool .    leemy was startled .   what the hell .     the man has a sixteen year old son   choked out othman .   a sixteen year old is not an adult and he is not filed independently in multivac  but only as part of his father s file .   he glared at leemy .   doesn t everyone know that until eighteen a youngster does not file his own reports with multivac but that his father does it for him .  don t i know it .  don t you .     you mean multivac didn t mean joe manners .   said leemy .    multivac meant his minor son  and the youngster is gone  now .  with officers three deep around the house  he calmly walks out and goes on you know what errand .    he whirled to the telephone circuit to which the corrections officer still clung  the minute break having given othman just time enough to collect himself and to assume a cool and self possessed mien .   it would never have done to throw a fit before the eyes of the officer  however much good it did in purging his spleen .    he said   officer  locate the younger son who has disappeared .  take every man you have  if necessary .  take every man available in the district  if necessary .  i shall give the appropriate orders .  you must find that boy at all costs .     yes  sir .    connection was broken .  othman said   have another rundown on the probabilities  leemy .    five minutes later  leemy said   it s down to    .   per cent .  it s down .    othman drew a long breath .   we re on the right track at last .    ben manners sat in booth   b and punched out slowly   my name is benjamin manners  number mb          .  my father  joseph manners  has been arrested but we don t know what crime he is planning .  is there any way we can help him .    he sat and waited .  he might be only sixteen but he was old enough to know that somewhere those words were being whirled into the most complex structure ever conceived by man  that a trillion facts would blend and co ordinate into a whole  and that from that whole  multivac would abstract the best help .   the machine clicked and a card emerged .  it had an answer on it  a long answer .  it began   take the expressway to washington  d . c .  at once .  get off at the connecticut avenue stop .  you will find a special exit  labeled  multivac  with a guard .  inform the guard you are special courier for dr .  trumbull and he will let you enter .    you will be in a corridor .  proceed along it till you reach a small door labeled  interior .   enter and say to the men inside   message for doctor trumbull .   you will be allowed to pass .  proceed on      it went on in this fashion .  ben could not see the application to his question  but he had complete faith in multivac .  he left at a run  heading for the expressway to washington .   the corrections officers traced ben manners to the baltimore station an hour after he had left .  a shocked harold quimby found himself flabbergasted at the number and importance of the men who had focused on him in the search for a sixteen year old .    yes  a boy   he said   but i don t know where he went to after he was through here .  i had no way of knowing that anyone was looking for him .  we accept all comers here .  yes  i can get the record of the question and answer .    they looked at the record and televised it to central headquarters at once .   othman read it through  turned up his eyes  and collapsed .  they brought him to almost at once .  he said to leemy weakly   have them catch that boy .  and have a copy of multivac s answer made out for me .  there s no way any more  no way out .  i must see gulliman now .      bernard gulliman had never seen ali othman as much as perturbed before  and watching the coordinator s wild eyes now sent a trickle of ice water down his spine .   he stammered   what do you mean  othman .  what do you mean worse than murder .     much worse than just murder .    gulliman was quite pale .   do you mean assassination of a high government official .    it did cross his mind that he himself     .   othman nodded .   not just a government official .  the government official .     the secretary general .   gulliman said in an appalled whisper .    more than that  even .  much more .  we deal with a plan to assassinate multivac .     what .     for the first time in the history of multivac  the computer came up with the report that it itself was in danger .     why was i not at once informed .    othman half truthed out of it .   the matter was so unprecedented  sir  that we explored the situation first before daring to put it on official record .     but multivac has been saved  of course .  it s been saved .     the probabilities of harm have declined to under   per cent .  i am waiting for the report now .       message for dr .  trumbull   said ben manners to the man on the high stool  working carefully on what looked like the controls of a stratojet cruiser  enormously magnified .    sure  jim   said the man .   go ahead .    ben looked at his instructions and hurried on .  eventually  he would find a tiny control lever which he was to shift to a down position at a moment when a certain indicator spot would light up red .   he heard an agitated voice behind him  then another  and suddenly  two men had him by his elbows .  his feet were lifted off the floor .   one man said   come with us  boy .    all othman s face did not noticeably lighten at the news  even though gulliman said with great relief   if we have the boy  then multivac is safe .     for the moment .    gulliman put a trembling hand to his forehead .   what a half hour i ve had .  can you imagine what the destruction of multivac for even a short time would mean .  the government would have collapsed  the economy broken down .  it would have meant devastation worse     his head snapped up   what do you mean for the moment .     the boy  this ben manners  had no intention of doing harm .  he and his family must be released and compensation for false imprisonment given them .  he was only following multivac s instructions in order to help his father and it s done that .  his father is free now .     do you mean multivac ordered the boy to pull a lever under circumstances that would burn out enough circuits to require a month s repair work .  you mean multivac would suggest its own destruction for the comfort of one man .     it s worse than that  sir .  multivac not only gave those instructions but selected the manners family in the first place because ben manners looked exactly like one of dr .  trumbull s pages so that he could get into multivac without being stopped .     what do you mean the family was selected .     well  the boy would have never gone to ask the question if his father had not been arrested .  his father would never have been arrested if multivac had not blamed him for planning the destruction of multivac .  multivac s own action started the chain of events that almost led to multivac s destruction .     but there s no sense to that   gulliman said in a pleading voice .  he felt small and helpless and he was virtually on his knees  begging this othman  this man who had spent nearly a lifetime with multivac  to reassure him .   othman did not do so .  he said   this is multivac s first attempt along this line as far as i know .  in some ways  it planned well .  it chose the right family .  it carefully did not distinguish between father and son to send us off the track .  it was still an amateur at the game  though .  it could not overcome its own instructions that led it to report the probability of its own destruction as increasing with every step we took down the wrong road .  it could not avoid recording the answer it gave the youngster .  with further practice  it will probably learn deceit .  it will learn to hide certain facts  fail to record certain others .  from now on  every instruction it gives may have the seeds in it of its own destruction .  we will never know .  and however careful we are  eventually multivac will succeed .  i think  mr .  gulliman  you will be the last chairman of this organization .    gulliman pounded his desk in fury .   but why  why  why .  damn you  why .  what is wrong with it .  can t it be fixed .     i don t think so   said othman  in soft despair .   i ve never thought about this before .  i ve never had the occasion to until this happened  but now that i think of it  it seems to me we have reached the end of the road because multivac is too good .  multivac has grown so complicated  its reactions are no longer those of a machine  but those of a living thing .     you re mad  but even so .     for fifty years and more we have been loading humanity s troubles on multivac  on this living thing .  we ve asked it to care for us  all together and each individually .  we ve asked it to take all our secrets into itself  we ve asked it to absorb our evil and guard us against it .  each of us brings his troubles to it  adding his bit to the burden .  now we are planning to load the burden of human disease on multivac  too .    othman paused a moment  then burst out   mr .  gulliman  multivac bears all the troubles of the world on its shoulders and it is tired .     madness .  midsummer madness   muttered gulliman .    then let me show you something .  let me put it to the test .  may i have permission to use the multivac circuit line here in your office .     why .     to ask it a question no one has ever asked multivac before .     will you do it harm .   asked gulliman in quick alarm .    no .  but it will tell us what we want to know .    the chairman hesitated a trifle .  then he said   go ahead .    othman used the instrument on gulliman s desk .  his fingers punched out the question with deft strokes   multivac  what do you yourself want more than anything else .    the moment between question and answer lengthened unbearably  but neither othman nor gulliman breathed .   and there was a clicking and a card popped out .  it was a small card .  on it  in precise letters  was the answer    i want to die .        spell my name with an s     marshall zebatinsky felt foolish .  he felt as though there were eyes staring through the grimy store front glass and across the scarred wooden partition  eyes watching him .  he felt no confidence in the old clothes he had resurrected or the turned down brim of a hat he never otherwise wore or the glasses he had left in their case .   he felt foolish and it made the lines in his forehead deeper and his young old face a little paler .   he would never be able to explain to anyone why a nuclear physicist such as himself should visit a numerologist .   never  he thought .  never .   hell  he could not explain it to himself except that he had let his wife talk him into it .   the numerologist sat behind an old desk that must have been secondhand when bought .  no desk could get that old with only one owner .  the same might almost be said of his clothes .  he was little and dark and peered at zebatinsky with little dark eyes that were brightly alive .   he said   i have never had a physicist for a client before  dr .  zebatinsky .    zebatinsky flushed at once .   you understand this is confidential .    the numerologist smiled so that wrinkles creased about the corners of his mouth and the skin around his chin stretched .   all my dealings are confidential .    zebatinsky said   i think i ought to tell you one thing .  i don t believe in numerology and i don t expect to begin believing in it .  if that makes a difference  say so now .     but why are you here  then .     my wife thinks you may have something  whatever it is .  i promised her and i am here .   he shrugged and the feeling of folly grew more acute .    and what is it you are looking for .  money .  security .  long life .  what .    zebatinsky sat for a long moment while the numerologist watched him quietly and made no move to hurry his client .   zebatinsky thought  what do i say anyway .  that i m thirty four and without a future .   he said   i want success .  i want recognition .     a better job .     a different job .  a different kind of job .  right now  i m part of a team  working under orders .  teams .  that s all government research is .  you re a violinist lost in a symphony orchestra .     and you want to solo .     i want to get out of a team and into   into me .   zebatinsky felt carried away  almost lightheaded  just putting this into words to someone other than his wife .  he said   twenty five years ago  with my kind of training and my kind of ability  i would have gotten to work on the first nuclear power plants .  today i d be running one of them or i d be head of a pure research group at a university .  but with my start these days where will i be twenty five years from now .  nowhere .  still on the team .  still carrying my   per cent of the ball .  i m drowning in an anonymous crowd of nuclear physicists  and what i want is room on dry land  if you see what i mean .    the numerologist nodded slowly .   you realize  dr .  zebatinsky  that i don t guarantee success .    zebatinsky  for all his lack of faith  felt a sharp bite of disappointment .   you don t .  then what the devil do you guarantee .     an improvement in the probabilities .  my work is statistical in nature .  since you deal with atoms  i think you understand the laws of statistics .     do you .   asked the physicist sourly .    i do  as a matter of fact .  i am a mathematician and i work mathematically .  i don t tell you this in order to raise my fee .  that is standard .  fifty dollars .  but since you are a scientist  you can appreciate the nature of my work better than my other clients .  it is even a pleasure to be able to explain to you .    zebatinsky said   i d rather you wouldn t  if you don t mind .  it s no use telling me about the numerical values of letters  their mystic significance and that kind of thing .  i don t consider that mathematics .  let s get to the point      the numerologist said   then you want me to help you provided i don t embarrass you by telling you the silly nonscientific basis of the way in which i helped you .  is that it .     all right .  that s it .     but you still work on the assumption that i am a numerologist  and i am not .  i call myself that so that the police won t bother me and   the little man chuckled dryly   so that the psychiatrists won t either .  i am a mathematician  an honest one .    zebatinsky smiled .   the numerologist said   i build computers .  i study probable futures .     what .     does that sound worse than numerology to you .  why .  given enough data and a computer capable of sufficient number of operations in unit time  the future is predictable  at least in terms of probabilities .  when you compute the motions of a missile in order to aim an anti missile  isn t it the future you re predicting .  the missile and antimissile would not collide if the future were predicted incorrectly .  i do the same thing .  since i work with a greater number of variables  my results are less accurate .     you mean you ll predict my future .     very approximately .  once i have done that  i will modify the data by changing your name and no other fact about you .  i throw that modified datum into the operation program .  then i try other modified names .  i study each modified future and find one that contains a greater degree of recognition for you than the future that now lies ahead of you .  or no  let me put it another way .  i will find you a future in which the probability of adequate recognition is higher than the probability of that in your present future .     why change my name .     that is the only change i ever make  for several reasons .  number one  it is a simple change .  after all  if i make a great change or many changes  so many new variables enter that i can no longer interpret the result .  my machine is still crude .  number two  it is a reasonable change .  i can t change your height  can i  or the color of your eyes  or even your temperament .  number three  it is a significant change .  names mean a lot to people .  finally  number four  it is a common change that is done every day by various people .    zebatinsky said   what if you don t find a better future .     that is the risk you will have to take .  you will be no worse off than now  my friend .    zebatinsky stared at the little man uneasily   i don t believe any of this .  i d sooner believe numerology .    the numerologist sighed .   i thought a person like yourself would feel more comfortable with the truth .  i want to help you and there is much yet for you to do .  if you believed me a numerologist  you would not follow through .  i thought if i told you the truth you would let me help you .    zebatinsky said   if you can see the future       why am i not the richest man on earth .  is that it .  but i am rich   in all i want .  you want recognition and i want to be left alone .  i do my work .  no one bothers me .  that makes me a billionaire .  i need a little real money and this i get from people such as yourself .  helping people is nice and perhaps a psychiatrist would say it gives me a feeling of power and feeds my ego .  now   do you want me to help you .     how much did you say .     fifty dollars .  i will need a great deal of biographical information from you but i have prepared a form to guide you .  it s a little long  i m afraid .  still  if you can get it in the mail by the end of the week  i will have an answer for you by the      he put out his lower lip and frowned in mental calculation   the twentieth of next month .     five weeks .  so long .     i have other work  my friend  and other clients .  if i were a fake  i could do it much more quickly .  it is agreed then .    zebatinsky rose .   well  agreed .    this is all confidential  now .     perfectly .  you will have all your information back when i tell you what change to make and you have my word that i will never make any further use of any of it .    the nuclear physicist stopped at the door .   aren t you afraid i might tell someone you re not a numerologist .    the numerologist shook his head .   who would believe you  my friend .  even supposing you were willing to admit to anyone that you ve been here .    on the twentieth  marshall zebatinsky was at the paint peeling door  glancing sideways at the shop front with the little card up against the glass reading  numerology   dimmed and scarcely legible through the dust .  he peered in  almost hoping that someone else would be there already so that he might have an excuse to tear up the wavering intention in his mind and go home .   he had tried wiping the thing out of his mind several times .  he could never stick at filling out the necessary data for long .  it was embarrassing to work at it .  he felt incredibly silly filling out the names of his friends  the cost of his house  whether his wife had had any miscarriages  if so  when .  he abandoned it .   but he  . couldn t stick at stopping altogether either .  he returned to it each evening .   it was the thought of the computer that did it  perhaps  the thought of the infernal gall of the little man pretending he had a computer .  the temptation to call the bluff  see what would happen  proved irresistible after all .   he finally sent off the completed data by ordinary mail  putting on nine cents worth of stamps without weighing the letter .  if it comes back  he thought  i ll call it off .   it didn t come back .   he looked into the shop now and it was empty .  zebatinsky had no choice but to enter .  a bell tinkled .   the old numerologist emerged from a curtained door .    yes .    ah  dr .  zebatinsky .     you remember me .   zebatinsky tried to smile .    oh  yes .     what s the verdict .    the numerologist moved one gnarled hand over the other .   before that  sir  there s a little       a little matter of the fee .     i have already done the work  sir .  i have earned the money .    zebatinsky raised no objection .  he was prepared to pay .  if he had come this far  it would be silly to turn back just because of the money .   he counted out five ten dollar bills and shoved them across the counter .   well .    the numerologist counted the bills again slowly  then pushed them into a cash drawer in his desk .   he said   your case was very interesting .  i would advise you to change your name to sebatinsky .     seba   how do you spell that .     s e b a t i n s k y .    zebatinsky stared indignantly .   you mean change the initial .  change the z to an s .  that s all .     it s enough .  as long as the change is adequate  a small change is safer than a big one .     but how could the change affect anything .     how could any name .   asked the numerologist softly .   i can t say .  it may  somehow  and that s all i can say .  remember  i don t guarantee results .  of course  if you do not wish to make the change  leave things as they are .  but in that case i cannot refund the fee .    zebatinsky said   what do i do .  just tell everyone to spell my name with an   .     if you want my advice  consult a lawyer .  change your name legally .  he can advise you on little things .     how long will it all take .  i mean for things to improve for me .     how can i tell .  maybe never .  maybe tomorrow .     but you saw the future .  you claim you see it .     not as in a crystal ball .  no  no  dr .  zebatinsky .  all i get out of my computer is a set of coded figures .  i can recite probabilities to you  but i saw no pictures .    zebatinsky turned and walked rapidly out of the place .  fifty dollars to change a letter .  fifty dollars for sebatinsky .  lord  what a name .  worse than zebatinsky .   it took another month before he could make up his mind to see a lawyer  and then he finally went .   he told himself he could always change the name back .  give it a chance  he told himself .  hell  there was no law against it .     henry brand looked through the folder page by page  with the practiced eye of one who had been in security for fourteen years .  he didn t have to read every word .  anything peculiar would have leaped off the paper and punched him in the eye .   he said   the man looks clean to me .   henry brand looked clean  too  with a soft  rounded paunch and a pink and freshly scrubbed complexion .  it was as though continuous contact with all sorts of human failings  from possible ignorance to possible treason  had compelled him into frequent washings .   lieutenant albert quincy  who had brought him the folder  was young and filled with the responsibility of being security officer at the hanford station .   but why sebatinsky .   he demanded .    why not .     because it doesn t make sense .  zebatinsky is a foreign name and i d change it myself if i had it  but i d change it to something anglo saxon .  if zebatinsky had done that  it would make sense and i wouldn t give it a second thought .  but why change a z to an s .  i think we must find out what his reasons were .     has anyone asked him directly .     certainly .  in ordinary conversation  of course .  i was careful to arrange that .  he won t say anything more than that he s tired of being last in the alphabet .     that could be  couldn t it  lieutenant .     it could  but why not change his name to sands or smith  if he wants an s .  or if he s that tired of z  why not go the whole way and change it to an a .  why not a name like   uh   aarons .     not anglo saxon enough   muttered brand .  then   but there s nothing to pin against the man .  no matter how queer a name change may be  that alone can t be used against anyone .    lieutenant quincy looked markedly unhappy .   brand said   tell me  lieutenant  there must be something specific that bothers you .  something in your mind  some theory  some gimmick .  what is it .    the lieutenant frowned .  his light eyebrows drew together and his lips tightened .   well  damn it  sir  the man s a russian .    brand said   he s not that .  he s a third generation american .     i mean his name s russian .    brand s face lost some of its deceptive softness .   no  lieutenant  wrong again .  polish .    the lieutenant pushed his hands out impatiently  palms up .   same thing .    brand  whose mother s maiden name had been wiszewski  snapped   don t tell that to a pole  lieutenant .      then  more thoughtfully   or to a russian either  i suppose .     what i m trying to say  sir   said the lieutenant  reddening   is that the poles and russians are both on the other side of the curtain .     we all know that .     and zebatinsky or sebatinsky  whatever you want to call him  may have relatives there .     he s third generation .  he might have second cousins there  i suppose .  so what .     nothing in itself .  lots of people may have distant relatives there .  but zebatinsky changed his name .     go on .     maybe he s trying to distract attention .  maybe a second cousin over there is getting too famous and our zebatinsky is afraid that the relationship may spoil his own chances of advancement .     changing his name won t do any good .  he d still be a second cousin .     sure  but he wouldn t feel as though he were shoving the relationship in our face .     have you ever heard of any zebatinsky on the other side .     no  sir .     then he can t be too famous .  how would our zebatinsky know about him .     he might keep in touch with his own relatives .  that would be suspicious under the circumstances  he being a nuclear physicist .    methodically  brand went through the folder again .    this is awfully thin  lieutenant .  it s thin enough to be completely invisible .     can you offer any other explanation  sir  of why he ought to change his name in just this way .     no  i can t .  i admit that .     then i think  sir  we ought to investigate .  we ought to look for any men named zebatinsky on the other side and see if we can draw a connection .   the lieutenant s voice rose a trifle as a new thought occurred to him .   he might be changing his name to withdraw attention from them  i mean to protect them .     he s doing just the opposite  i think .     he doesn t realize that  maybe  but protecting them could be his motive .    brand sighed .   all right  well tackle the zebatinsky angle .    but if nothing turns up  lieutenant  we drop the matter .  leave the folder with me .    when the information finally reached brand  he had all but forgotten the lieutenant and his theories .  his first thought on receiving data that included a list of seventeen biographies of seventeen russian and polish citizens  all named zebatinsky  was  what the devil is this .   then he remembered  swore mildly  and began reading .   it started on the american side .  marshall zebatinsky  fingerprints  had been born in buffalo  new york  date  hospital statistics  .  his father had been born in buffalo as well  his mother in oswego  new york .  his paternal grandparents had both been born in bialystok  poland  date of entry into the united states  dates of citizenship  photographs  .   the seventeen russian and polish citizens named zebatinsky were all descendants of people who  some half century earlier  had lived in or near bialystok .  presumably  they could be relatives  but this was not explicitly stated in any particular case .   vital statistics in east europe during the aftermath of world war i were kept poorly  if at all .    brand passed through the individual life histories of the current zebatinsky men and women  amazing how thoroughly intelligence did its work  probably the russians  was as thorough  .  he stopped at one and his smooth forehead sprouted lines as his eyebrows shot upward .  he put that one to one side and went on .  eventually  he stacked everything but that one and returned it to its envelope .   staring at that one  he tapped a neatly kept fingernail on the desk .   with a certain reluctance  he went to call on dr .  paul kristow of the atomic energy commission .   dr .  kristow listened to the matter with a stony expression .  he lifted a little finger occasionally to dab at his bulbous nose and remove a nonexistent speck .  his hair was iron gray  thinning and cut short .  he might as well have been bald .   he said   no  i never heard of any russian zebatinsky .  but then  i never heard of the american one either .     well   brand scratched at his hairline over one temple and said slowly   i don t think there s anything to this  but i don t like to drop it too soon .  i have a young lieutenant on my tail and you know what they can be like .  i don t want to do anything that will drive him to a congressional committee .  besides  the fact is that one of the russian zebatinsky fellows  mikhail andreyevich zebatinsky  is a nuclear physicist .  are you sure you never heard of him .     mikhail andreyevich zebatinsky .  no   no  i never did .  not that that proves anything .     i could say it was coincidence  but you know that would be piling it a trifle high .  one zebatinsky here and one zebatinsky there  both nuclear physicists  and the one here suddenly changes his name to sebatinsky  and goes around anxious about it  too .  he won t allow misspelling .  he says  emphatically   spell my name with an s .   it all just fits well enough to make my spy conscious lieutenant begin to look a little too good .    and another peculiar thing is that the russian zebatinsky dropped out of sight just about a year ago .    dr .  kristow said stolidly   executed .     he might have been .  ordinarily  i would even assume so  though the russians are not more foolish than we are and don t kill any nuclear physicist they can avoid killing .  the thing is there s another reason why a nuclear physicist  of all people  might suddenly disappear .  i don t have to tell you .     crash research  top secret .  i take it that s what you mean .  do you believe that s it .     put it together with everything else  add in the lieutenant s intuition  and i just begin to wonder .     give me that biography .   dr .  kristow reached for the sheet of paper and read it over twice .  he shook his head .  then he said   i ll check this in nuclear abstracts .    nuclear abstracts lined one wall of dr .  kristow s study in neat little boxes  each filled with its squares of microfilm .   the a . e . c .  man used his projector on the indices while brand watched with what patience he could muster .   dr .  kristow muttered   a mikhail zebatinsky authored or co authored half a dozen papers in the soviet journals in the last half dozen years .  we ll get out the abstracts and maybe we can make something out of it .  i doubt it .    a selector nipped out the appropriate squares .  dr .  kristow lined them up  ran them through the projector  and by degrees an expression of odd intentness crossed his face .  he said   that s odd .    brand said   what s odd .    dr .  kristow sat back .   i d rather not say just yet .  can you get me a list of other nuclear physicists who have dropped out of sight in the soviet union hi the last year .     you mean you see something .     not really .  not if i were just looking at any one of these papers .  it s just that looking at all of them and knowing that this man may be on a crash research program and  on top of that  having you putting suspicions in my head     he shrugged .   it s nothing .    brand said earnestly   i wish you d say what s on your mind .  we may as well be foolish about this together .     if you feel that way   it s just possible this man may have been inching toward gamma ray reflection .     and the significance .     if a reflecting shield against gamma rays could be devised  individual shelters could be built to protect against fallout .  it s fallout that s the real danger  you know .  a hydrogen bomb might destroy a city but the fallout could slow kill the population over a strip thousands of miles long and hundreds wide .    brand said quickly   are we doing any work on this .     no .     and if they get it and we don t  they can destroy the united states in toto at the cost of  say  ten cities  after they have their shelter program completed .     that s far in the future .    and  what are we getting in a hurrah about .  all this is built on one man changing one letter in his name .     all right  i m insane   said brand .   but i don t leave the matter at this point .  not at this point .  i ll get you your list of disappearing nuclear physicists if i have to go to moscow to get it .    he got the list .  they went through all the research papers authored by any of them .  they called a full meeting of the commission  then of the nuclear brains of the nation .  dr .  kristow walked out of an all night session  finally  part of which the president himself had attended .   brand met him .  both looked haggard and in need of sleep .   brand said   well .    kristow nodded .   most agree .  some are doubtful even yet  but most agree .     how about you .  are you sure .     i m far from sure  but let me put it this way .  it s easier to believe that the soviets are working on a gamma ray shield than to believe that all the data we ve uncovered has no interconnection .     has it been decided that we re to go on shield research  too .     yes .   kristow s hand went back over his short  bristly hair  making a dry  whispery sound .   we re going to give it everything we ve got .  knowing the papers written by the men who disappeared  we can get right on their heels .   we may even beat them to it .     of course  they ll find out we re working on it .     let them   said brand .   let them .  it will keep them from attacking .  i don t see any percentage in selling ten of our cities just to get ten of theirs   if we re both protected and they re too dumb to know that    but not too soon .  we don t want them finding out too soon .  what about the american zebatinsky sebatinsky .    brand looked solemn and shook his head .   there s nothing to connect him with any of this even yet .  hell  we ve looked .  i agree with you  of course .  he s in a sensitive spot where he is now and we can t afford to keep him there even if he s in the clear .     we can t kick him out just like that  either  or the russians will start wondering .     do you have any suggestions .    they were walking down the long corridor toward the distant elevator in the emptiness of four in the morning .   dr .  kristow said   i ve looked into his work .  he s a good man  better than most  and not happy in his job  either .  he hasn t the temperament for teamwork .     so .     but he is the type for an academic job .  if we can arrange to have a large university offer him a chair in physics  i think he would take it gladly .  there would be enough nonsensitive areas to keep him occupied  we would be able to keep him in close view  and it would be a natural development .  the russians might not start scratching their heads .  what do you think .    brand nodded .   it s an idea .  even sounds good .  i ll put it up to the chief .    they stepped into the elevator and brand allowed himself to wonder about it all .  what an ending to what had started with one letter of a name .   marshall sebatinsky could hardly talk .  he said to his wife   i swear i don t see how this happened .  i wouldn t have thought they knew me from a meson detector .      good lord  sophie  associate professor of physics at princeton .  think of it .    sophie said   do you suppose it was your talk at the a . p . s .  meetings .     i don t see how .  it was a thoroughly uninspired paper once everyone in the division was done hacking at it .   he snapped his fingers .   it must have been princeton that was investigating me .  that s it .  you know all those forms i ve been filling out in the last six months  those interviews they wouldn t explain .  honestly  i was beginning to think i was under suspicion as a subversive .    it was princeton investigating me .  they re thorough .     maybe it was your name   said sophie .   i mean the change .     watch me now .  my professional life will be my own finally .  i ll make my mark .  once i have a chance to do my work without     he stopped and turned to look at his wife .   my name .  you mean the s .     you didn t get the offer till after you changed your name  did you .     not till long after .  no  that part s just coincidence .  i ve told you before sophie  it was just a case of throwing out fifty dollars to please you .  lord  what a fool i ve felt all these months insisting on that stupid s .    sophie was instantly on the defensive .   i didn t make you do it  marshall .  i suggested it but i didn t nag you about it .  don t say i did .  besides  it did turn out well .  i m sure it was the name that did this .    sebatinsky smiled indulgently .   now that s superstition .     i don t care what you call it  but you re not changing your name back .     well  no  i suppose not .  i ve had so much trouble getting them to spell my name with an s  that the thought of making everyone move back is more than i want to face .  maybe i ought to change my name to jones  eh .   he laughed almost hysterically .   but sophie didn t .   you leave it alone .     oh  all right  i m just joking .     tell you what .  i ll step down to that old fellow s place one of these days and tell him everything worked out and slip him another tenner .  will that satisfy you .    he was exuberant enough to do so the next week .  he assumed no disguise this time .  he wore his glasses and his ordinary suit and was minus a hat .   he was even humming as he approached the store front and stepped to one side to allow a weary  sour faced woman to maneuver her twin baby carriage past .   he put his hand on the door handle and his thumb on the iron latch .  the latch didn t give to his thumb s downward pressure .  the door was locked .   the dusty  dim card with  numerologist  on it was gone  now that he looked .  another sign  printed and beginning to yellow and curl with the sunlight  said  to let .    sebatinsky shrugged .  that was that .  he had tried to do the right thing .     haround  happily divested of corporeal excrescence  capered happily and his energy vortices glowed a dim purple over cubic hypermiles .  he said   have i won .  have i won .    mestack was withdrawn  his vortices almost a sphere of light in hyperspace .   i haven t calculated it yet .     well  go ahead .  you won t change the results any by taking a long time .    wowf  it s a relief to get back into clean energy .  it took me a microcycle of time as a corporeal body  a nearly used up one  too .  but it was worth it to show you .    mestack said   all right  i admit you stopped a nuclear war on the planet .     is that or is that not a class a effect .     it is a class a effect .  of course it is .     all right .  now check and see if i didn t get that class a effect with a class f stimulus .  i changed one letter of one name .     what .     oh  never mind .  it s all there .  i ve worked it out for you .    mestack said reluctantly   i yield .  a class f stimulus .     then i win .  admit it .     neither one of us will win when the watchman gets a look at this .    haround  who had been an elderly numerologist on earth and was still somewhat unsettled with relief at no longer being one  said   you weren t worried about that when you made the bet .     i didn t think you d be fool enough to go through with it .     heat waste .  besides  why worry .  the watchman will never detect a class f stimulus .     maybe not  but he ll detect a class a effect .  those corporeals will still be around after a dozen microcycles .  the watchman will notice that .     the trouble with you  mestack  is that you don t want to pay off .  you re stalling .     i ll pay .  but just wait till the watchman finds out we ve been working on an unassigned problem and made an unallowed for change .  of course  if we     he paused .   haround said   all right  we ll change it back .  he ll never know .    there was a crafty glow to mestack s brightening energy pattern .   you ll need another class f stimulus if you expect him not to notice .    haround hesitated .   i can do it .     i doubt it .     i could .     would you be willing to bet on that  too .   jubilation was creeping into mestack s radiations .    sure   said the goaded haround .   i ll put those corporeals right back where they were and the watchman will never know the difference .    mestack followed through his advantage .   suspend the first bet  then .  triple the stakes on the second .    the mounting eagerness of the gamble caught at haround  too .   all right  i m game .  triple the stakes .     done  then .     done .        the last question     the last question was asked for the first time  half in jest  on may           at a time when humanity first stepped into the light .  the question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs  and it happened this way   alexander adell and bertram lupov were two of the faithful attendants of multivac .  as well as any human beings could  they knew what lay behind the cold  clicking  flashing face   miles and miles of face   of that giant computer .  they had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole .   multivac was self adjusting and self correcting .  it had to be  for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough .     so adell and lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially  yet as well as any men could .  they fed it data  adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued .  certainly they  and all others like them  were fully entitled to share in the glory that was multivac s .   for decades  multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the moon  mars  and venus  but past that  earth s poor resources could not support the ships .  too much energy was needed for the long trips .  earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency  but there was only so much of both .   but slowly multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally  and on may           what had been theory  became fact .   the energy of the sun was stored  converted  and utilized directly on a planet wide scale .  all earth turned off its burning coal  its fissioning uranium  and nipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station  one mile in diameter  circling the earth at half the distance of the moon .  all earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower .   seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and adell and lupov finally managed to escape from the public function  and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them  in the deserted underground chambers  where portions of the mighty buried body of multivac showed .  unattended  idling  sorting data with contented lazy clickings  multivac  too  had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that .  they had no intention  originally  of disturbing it .   they had brought a bottle with them  and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle .    it s amazing when you think of it   said adell .  his broad face had lines of weariness in it  and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod  watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about .   all the energy we can possibly ever use for free .  enough energy  if we wanted to draw on it  to melt all earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron  and still never miss the energy so used .  all the energy we could ever use  forever and forever and forever .    lupov cocked his head sideways .  he had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary  and he wanted to be contrary now  partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware .   not forever   he said .    oh  hell  just about forever .  till the sun runs down  bert .     that s not forever .     all right  then .  billions and billions of years .  twenty billion  maybe .  are you satisfied .    lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink .   twenty billion years isn t forever .     well  it will last our time  won t it .     so would the coal and uranium .     all right  but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the solar station  and it can go to pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel .  you can t do that on coal and uranium .  ask multivac  if you don t believe me .     i don t have to ask multivac .  i know that .     then stop running down what multivac s done for us   said adell  blazing up .   it did all right .     who says it didn t .  what i say is that a sun won t last forever .  that s all i m saying .  we re safe for twenty billion years  but then what .   lupov pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other .   and don t say we ll switch to another sun .    there was silence for a while .  adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally  and lupov s eyes slowly closed .  they rested .   then lupov s eyes snapped open .   you re thinking we ll switch to another sun when ours is done  aren t you .     i m not thinking .     sure you are .  you re weak on logic  that s the trouble with you .  you re like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got under one .  he wasn t worried  you see  because he figured when one tree got wet through  he would just get under another one .     i get it   said adell .   don t shout .  when the sun is done  the other stars will be gone  too .     darn right they will   muttered lupov .   it all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion  whatever that was  and it ll all have an end when all the stars run down .  some run down faster than others .  hell  the giants won t last a hundred million years .  the sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are .  but just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark .  entropy has to increase to maximum  that s all .     i know all about entropy   said adell  standing on his dignity .    the hell you do .     i know as much as you do .     then you know everything s got to run down someday .     all right .  who says they won t .     you did  you poor sap .  you said we had all the energy we needed  forever .  you said  forever .     it was adell   s turn to be contrary .   maybe we can build things up again someday   he said .    never .     why not .  someday .     never .     ask multivac .     you ask multivac .  i dare you .  five dollars says it can t be done .    adell was just drunk enough to try  just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which  in words  might have corresponded to this  will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age .   or maybe it could be put more simply like this  how can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased .   multivac fell dead and silent .  the slow flashing of lights ceased  the distant sounds of clicking relays ended .   then  just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer  there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of multi vac .  five words were printed  insufficient data for meaningful answer .    no bet   whispered lupov .  they left hurriedly .  by next morning  the two  plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth  had forgotten the incident .     jerrodd  jerrodine  and jerrodette i and ii watched the starry picture in the visiplate change as the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non time lapse .  at once  the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright marble disk  centered .    that s x      said jerrodd confidently .  his thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened .   the little jerrodettes  both girls  had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self conscious over the momentary sensation of inside outness .  they buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about their mother  screaming   we ve reached x      we ve reached x      we ve       quiet  children   said jerrodine sharply .   are you sure  jerrodd .     what is there to be but sure .   asked jerrodd  glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling .  it ran the length of the room  disappearing through the wall at either end .  it was as long as the ship .   jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a microvac  that one asked it questions if one wished  that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination  of feeding on energies from the various sub galactic power stations  of computing the equations for the hyperspacial jumps .   jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship .   someone had once told jerrodd that the  ac  at the end of  microvac  stood for  analog computer  in ancient english  but he was on the edge of forgetting even that .   jerrodine s eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate .   i can t help it .  i feel funny about leaving earth .     why  for pete s sake .   demanded jerrodd .   we had nothing there .  we ll have everything on x    .  you won t be alone .  you won t be a pioneer .  there are over a million people on the planet already .  good lord  our great grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because x    will be overcrowded .   then  after a reflective pause   i tell you  it s a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing .     i know  i know   said jerrodine miserably .    jerrodette i said promptly   our microvac is the best microvac in the world .     i think so  too   said jerrodd  tousling her hair .   it was a nice feeling to have a microvac of your own and jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other .  in his father s youth  the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land .  there was only one to a planet .  planetary acs they were called .  they had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years  and then  all at once  came refinement .  in place of transistors had come molecular valves so that even the largest planetary ac could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship .   jerrodd felt uplifted  as he always did when he thought that his own personal microvac was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive multivac that had first tamed the sun  and almost as complicated as earth s planetary ac  the largest  that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible .    so many stars  so many planets   sighed jerrodine  busy with her own thoughts .   i suppose families will be going out to new planets forever  the way we are now .     not forever   said jerrodd  with a smile .   it will all stop someday  but not for billions of years .  many billions .  even the stars run down  you know .  entropy must increase .     what s entropy  daddy .   shrilled jerrodette ii .    entropy  little sweet  is just a word which means the amount of running down of the universe .  everything runs down  you know  like your little walkie talkie robot  remember .     can t you just put in a new power unit  like with my robot .     the stars are the power units  dear .  once they re gone  there are no more power units .    jerrodette i at once set up a howl .   don t let them  daddy .  don t let the stars run down .     now look what you ve done   whispered jerrodine  exasperated .    how was i to know it would frighten them .   jerrodd whispered back .    ask the microvac   wailed jerrodette i .   ask him how to turn the stars on again .     go ahead   said jerrodine .   it will quiet them down .    jerrodette ii was beginning to cry  also .    jerrodd shrugged .   now  now  honeys .  i ll ask microvac .  don t worry  he ll tell us .    he asked the microvac  adding quickly   print the answer .    jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully   see now  the microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so don t worry .    jerrodine said   and now  children  it s time for bed .  we ll be in our new home soon .    jerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it  insufficient data for a meaningful answer .   he shrugged and looked at the visiplate .  x    was just ahead .     vj   x of lameth stared into the black depths of the three dimensional  small scale map of the galaxy and said   are we ridiculous  i wonder  in being so concerned about the matter .    mq   j of nicron shook his head .   i think not .  you know the galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion .    both seemed in their early twenties  both were tall and perfectly formed .    still   said vj   x   i hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the galactic council .     i wouldn t consider any other kind of report .  stir them up a bit .  we ve got to stir them up .    vj   x sighed .   space is infinite .  a hundred billion galaxies are there for the taking .  more .     a hundred billion is not infinite and it s getting less infinite all the time .  consider .  twenty thousand years ago  mankind first solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy  and a few centuries later  interstellar travel became possible .  it took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the galaxy .  now the population doubles every ten years      vj   x interrupted .   we can thank immortality for that .     very well .  immortality exists and we have to take it into account .  i admit it has its seamy side  this immortality .  the galactic ac has solved many problems for us  but in solving the problem of preventing old age and death  it has undone all its other solutions .     yet you wouldn t want to abandon life  i suppose .     not at all   snapped mq   j  softening it at once to   not yet .  i m by no means old enough .  how old are you .     two hundred twenty three .  and you .     i m still under two hundred .    but to get back to my point .  population doubles every ten years .  once this galaxy is filled  well have filled another in ten years .  another ten years and we ll have filled two more .  another decade  four more .  in a hundred years  we ll have filled a thousand galaxies .  in a thousand years  a million galaxies .  in ten thousand years  the entire known universe .  then what .    vj   x said   as a side issue  there s a problem of transportation .  i wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move galaxies of individuals from one galaxy to the next .     a very good point .  already  mankind consumes two sunpower units per year .     most of it s wasted .  after all  our own galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those .     granted  but even with a hundred per cent efficiency  we only stave off the end .  our energy requirements are going up in a geometric progression even faster than our population .  we ll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of galaxies .  a good point .  a very good point .     we ll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas .     or out of dissipated heat .   asked mq   j  sarcastically .    there may be some way to reverse entropy .  we ought to ask the galactic ac .    vj   x was not really serious  but mq   j pulled out his ac contact from his pocket and placed it on the table before him .    i ve half a mind to   he said .   it s something the human race will have to face someday .    he stared somberly at his small ac contact .  it was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself  but it was connected through hyperspace with the great galactic ac that served all mankind .  hyperspace considered  it was an integral part of the galactic ac .   mq   j paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see the galactic ac .  it was on a little world of its own  a spider webbing of force beams holding the matter within which surges of sub mesons took the place of the old clumsy molecular valves .  yet despite its sub etheric workings  the galactic ac was known to be a full thousand feet across .   mq   j asked suddenly of his ac contact   can entropy ever be reversed .    vj   x looked startled and said at once   oh  say  i didn t really mean to have you ask that .     why not .     we both know entropy can t be reversed .  you can t turn smoke and ash back into a tree .     do you have trees on your world .   asked mq   j .   the sound of the galactic ac startled them into silence .  its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small ac contact on the desk .  it said  there is insufficient data for a meaningful answer .   vj   x said   see .    the two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the galactic council .     zee prime s mind spanned the new galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it he had never seen this one before .  would he ever see them all .  so many of them  each with its load of humanity .     but a load that was almost a dead weight .  more and more  the real essence of men was to be found out here  in space .   minds  not bodies .  the immortal bodies remained back on the planets  in suspension over the eons .  sometimes they roused for material activity but that was growing rarer .  few new individuals were coming into existence to join the incredibly mighty throng  but what matter .  there was little room in the universe for new individuals .   zee prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind .    i am zee prime   said zee prime .   and you .     i am dee sub wun .  your galaxy .     we call it only the galaxy .  and you .     we call ours the same .  all men call their galaxy their galaxy and nothing more .  why not .     true .  since all galaxies are the same .     not all galaxies .  on one particular galaxy the race of man must have originated .  that makes it different .    zee prime said   on which one .     i cannot say .  the universal ac would know .     shall we ask him .  i am suddenly curious .    zee prime s perceptions broadened until the galaxies themselves shrank and became a new  more diffuse powdering on a much larger background .  so many hundreds of billions of them  all with their immortal beings  all carrying their load of intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space .  and yet one of them was unique among them all in being the original galaxy .  one of them had  in its vague and distant past  a period when it was the only galaxy populated by man .   zee prime was consumed with curiosity to see this galaxy and he called out   universal ac .  on which galaxy did mankind originate .    the universal ac heard  for on every world and throughout space  it had its receptors ready  and each receptor lead through hyperspace to some unknown point where the universal ac kept itself aloof .   zee prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of universal ac  and he reported only a shining globe  two feet across  difficult to see .    but how can that be all of universal ac .   zee prime had asked .    most of it   had been the answer   is in hyperspace .  in what form it is there i cannot imagine .    nor could anyone  for the day had long since passed  zee prime knew  when any man had any part of the making of a universal ac .  each universal ac designed and constructed its successor .  each  during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate  more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged .   the universal ac interrupted zee prime s wandering thoughts  not with words  but with guidance .  zee prime s mentality was guided into the dim sea of galaxies and one in particular enlarged into stars .   a thought came  infinitely distant  but infinitely clear .    this is the original galaxy of man .    but it was the same after all  the same as any other  and zee prime stifled his disappointment .   dee sub wun  whose mind had accompanied the other  said suddenly   and is one of these stars the original star of man .    the universal ac said   man s original star has gone nova .  it is a white dwarf .     did the men upon it die .   asked zee prime  startled and without thinking .  the universal ac said   a new world  as in such cases  was constructed for their physical bodies in time .     yes  of course   said zee prime  but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so .  his mind released its hold on the original galaxy of man  let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points .  he never wanted to see it again .   dee sub wun said   what is wrong .     the stars are dying .  the original star is dead .     they must all die .  why not .     but when all energy is gone  our bodies will finally die  and you and i with them .     it will take billions of years .     i do not wish it to happen even after billions of years .  universal ac .  how may stars be kept from dying .    dee sub wun said in amusement   you re asking how entropy might be reversed in direction .    and the universal ac answered   there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer .    zee prime s thoughts fled back to his own galaxy .  he gave no further thought to dee sub wun  whose body might be waiting on a galaxy a trillion light years away  or on the star next to zee prime s own .  it didn t matter .   unhappily  zee prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own .  if the stars must someday die  at least some could yet be built .     man considered with himself  for in a way  man  mentally  was one .  he consisted of a trillion  trillion  trillion ageless bodies  each in its place  each resting quiet and incorruptible  each cared for by perfect automatons  equally incorruptible  while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other  indistinguishable .   man said   the universe is dying .    man looked about at the dimming galaxies .  the giant stars  spendthrifts  were gone long ago  back in the dimmest of the dim far past .  almost all stars were white dwarfs  fading to the end .   new stars had been built of the dust between the stars  some by natural processes  some by man himself  and those were going  too .  white dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released  new stars built  but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed  and those would come to an end  too .   man said   carefully husbanded  as directed by the cosmic ac  the energy that is even yet left in all the universe will last for billions of years .     but even so   said man   eventually it will all come to an end .  however it may be husbanded  however stretched out  the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored .  entropy must increase forever to the maximum .    man said   can entropy not be reversed .  let us ask the cosmic ac .    the cosmic ac surrounded them but not in space .  not a fragment of it was in space .  it was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy .  the question of its size and nature no longer had meaning in any terms that man could comprehend .    cosmic ac   said man   how may entropy be reversed .    the cosmic ac said   there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer .    man said   collect additional data .    the cosmic ac said   i will do so .  i have been doing so for a hundred billion years .  my predecessors and i have been asked this question many times .  all the data i have remains insufficient .     will there come a time   said man   when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances .    the cosmic ac said   no problem is insoluble in all conceivable circumstances .    man said   when will you have enough data to answer the question .    the cosmic ac said   there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer .     will you keep working on it .   asked man .   the cosmic ac said   i will .    man said   we shall wait .    the stars and galaxies died and snuffed out  and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down .   one by one man fused with ac  each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain .   man s last mind paused before fusion  looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter  agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out  asymptotically  to the absolute zero .   man said   ac  is this the end .  can this chaos not be reversed into the universe once more .  can that not be done .    ac said   there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer .    man s last mind fused and only ac existed   and that in hyperspace .   matter and energy had ended and with it space and time .  even ac existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to ac far less than was a man to man .   all other questions had been answered  and until this last question was answered also  ac might not release his consciousness .   all collected data had come to a final end .  nothing was left to be collected .   but all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships .   a timeless interval was spent in doing that .   and it came to pass that ac learned how to reverse the direction of entropy .   but there was now no man to whom ac might give the answer of the last question .  no matter .  the answer   by demonstration   would take care of that  too .   for another timeless interval  ac thought how best to do this .  carefully  ac organized the program .   the consciousness of ac encompassed all of what had once been a universe and brooded over what was now chaos .  step by step  it must be done .   and ac said   let there be light .    and there was light         the ugly little boy     edith fellowes smoothed her working smock as she always did before opening the elaborately locked door and stepping across the invisible dividing line between the is and the is not .  she carried her notebook and her pen although she no longer took notes except when she felt the absolute need for some report .   this time she also carried a suitcase .    games for the boy   she had said  smiling  to the guard   who had long since stopped even thinking of questioning her and who waved her on .    and  as always  the ugly little boy knew that she had entered and came running to her  crying   miss fellowes    miss fellowes     in his soft  slurring way .    timmie   she said  and passed her hand over the shaggy  brown hair on his misshapen little head .   what s wrong .    he said   will jerry be back to play again .  i m sorry about what happened .     never mind that now  timmie .  is that why you ve been crying .    he looked away .   not just about that  miss fellowes .  i dreamed again .     the same dream .   miss fellowes  lips set .  of course  the jerry affair would bring back the dream .   he nodded .  his too large teeth showed as he tried to smile and the lips of his forward thrusting mouth stretched wide .   when will i be big enough to go out there  miss fellowes .     soon   she said softly  feeling her heart break .   soon .    miss fellowes let him take her hand and enjoyed the warm touch of the thick dry skin of his palm .  he led her through the three rooms that made up the whole of stasis section one   comfortable enough  yes  but an eternal prison for the ugly little boy all the seven  was it seven .   years of his life .   he led her to the one window  looking out onto a scrubby woodland section of the world of is  now hidden by night   where a fence and painted instructions allowed no men to wander without permission .   he pressed his nose against the window .   out there  miss fellowes .     better places .  nicer places   she said sadly as she looked at his poor little imprisoned face outlined in profile against the window .  the forehead retreated flatly and his hair lay down in tufts upon it .  the back of his skull bulged and seemed to make the head overheavy so that it sagged and bent forward  forcing the whole body into a stoop .  already  bony ridges were beginning to bulge the skin above his eyes .  his wide mouth thrust forward more prominently than did his wide and flattened nose and he had no chin to speak of  only a jawbone that curved smoothly down and back .  he was small for his years and his stumpy legs were bowed .   he was a very ugly little boy and edith fellowes loved him dearly .   her own face was behind his line of vision  so she allowed her lips the luxury of a tremor .   they would not kill him .  she would do anything to prevent it .  anything .  she opened the suitcase and began taking out the clothes it contained .   edith fellowes had crossed the threshold of stasis  inc .  for the first time just a little over three years before .  she hadn t  at that time  the slightest idea as to what stasis meant or what the place did .  no one did then  except those who worked there .  in fact  it was only the day after she arrived that the news broke upon the world .   at the time  it was just that they had advertised for a woman with knowledge of physiology  experience with clinical chemistry  and a love for children .  edith fellowes had been a nurse in a maternity ward and believed she fulfilled those qualifications .   gerald hoskins  whose name plate on the desk included a ph . d .  after the name  scratched his cheek with his thumb and looked at her steadily .   miss fellowes automatically stiffened and felt her face  with its slightly asymmetric nose and its a trifle too heavy eyebrows  twitch .   he s no dreamboat himself  she thought resentfully .  he s getting fat and bald and he s got a sullen mouth .      but the salary mentioned had been considerably higher than she had expected  so she waited .   hoskins said   now do you really love children .     i wouldn t say i did if i didn t .     or do you just love pretty children .  nice chubby children with cute little button noses and gurgly ways .    miss fellowes said   children are children  dr .  hoskins  and the ones that aren t pretty are just the ones who may happen to need help most .     then suppose we take you on       you mean you re offering me the job now .    he smiled briefly  and for a moment  his broad face had an absentminded charm about it .  he said   i make quick decisions .  so far the offer is tentative  however .  i may make as quick a decision to let you go .  are you ready to take the chance .    miss fellowes clutched at her purse and calculated just as swiftly as she could  then ignored calculations and followed impulse .   all right .     fine .  we re going to form the stasis tonight and i think you had better be there to take over at once .  that will be at   p . m .  and i d appreciate it if you could be here at      .     but what       fine .  fine .  that will be all now .   on signal  a smiling secretary came in to usher her out .   miss fellowes stared back at dr .  hoskins  closed door for a moment .  what was stasis .  what had this large barn of a building   with its badged employees  its makeshift corridors  and its unmistakable air of engineering    to do with children .   she wondered if she should go back that evening or stay away and teach that arrogant man a lesson .  but she knew she would be back if only out of sheer frustration .  she would have to find out about the children .   she came back at      and did not have to announce herself .  one after another  men and women seemed to know her and to know her function .  she found herself all but placed on skids as she was moved inward .   dr .  hoskins was there  but he only looked at her distantly and murmured   miss fellowes .    he did not even suggest that she take a seat  but she drew one calmly up to the railing and sat down .   they were on a balcony  looking down into a large pit  filled with instruments that looked like a cross between the control panel of a spaceship and the working face of a computer .  on one side were partitions that seemed to make up an unceilinged apartment  a giant dollhouse into the rooms of which she could look from above .   she could see an electronic cooker and a freeze space unit in one room and a washroom arrangement off another .  and surely the object she made out in another room could only be part of a bed  a small bed .   hoskins was speaking to another man and  with miss fellowes  they made up the total occupancy of the balcony .  hoskins did not offer to introduce the other man  and miss fellowes eyed him surreptitiously .  he was thin and quite fine looking in a middle aged way .  he had a small mustache and keen eyes that seemed to busy themselves with everything .   he was saying   i won t pretend for one moment that i understand all this  dr .  hoskins  i mean  except as a layman  a reasonably intelligent layman  may be expected to understand it .  still  if there s one part i understand less than another  it s this matter of selectivity .  you can only reach out so far  that seems sensible  things get dimmer the further you go  it takes more energy .    but then  you can only reach out so near .  that s the puzzling part .     i can make it seem less paradoxical  deveney  if you will allow me to use an analogy .     miss fellowes placed the new man the moment she heard his name  and despite herself was impressed .  this was obviously candide deveney  the science writer of the telenews  who was notoriously at the scene of every major scientific break through .  she even recognized his face as one she saw on the news plate when the landing on mars had been announced .    so dr .  hoskins must have something important here .    by all means use an analogy   said deveney ruefully   if you think it will help .     well  then  you can t read a book with ordinary sized print if it is held six feet from your eyes  but you can read it if you hold it one foot from your eyes .  so far  the closer the better .  if you bring the book to within one inch of your eyes  however  you ve lost it again .  there is such a thing as being too close  you see .     hmm   said deveney .    or take another example .  your right shoulder is about thirty inches from the tip of your right forefinger and you can place your right forefinger on your right shoulder .  your right elbow is only half the distance from the tip of your right forefinger  it should by all ordinary logic be easier to reach  and yet you cannot place your right finger on your right elbow .  again  there is such a thing as being too close .    deveney said   may i use these analogies in my story .     well  of course .  only too glad .  i ve been waiting long enough for someone like you to have a story .  i ll give you anything else you want .  it is time  finally  that we want the world looking over our shoulder .  they ll see something .     miss fellowes found herself admiring his calm certainty despite herself .  there was strength there .    deveney said   how far out will you reach .     forty thousand years .    miss fellowes drew in her breath sharply .   years .   there was tension in the air .  the men at the controls scarcely moved .  one man at a microphone spoke into it in a soft monotone  in short phrases that made no sense to miss fellowes .   deveney  leaning over the balcony railing with an intent stare  said   will we see anything  dr .  hoskins .     what .  no .  nothing till the job is done .  we detect indirectly  something on the principle of radar  except that we use mesons rather than radiation .  mesons reach backward under the proper conditions .  some are reflected and we must analyze the reflections .     that sounds difficult .    hoskins smiled again  briefly as always .   it is the end product of fifty years of research  forty years of it before i entered the field .    yes  it s difficult .    the man at the microphone raised one hand .   hoskins said   we ve had the fix on one particular moment in time for weeks  breaking it  remaking it after calculating our own movements in time  making certain that we could handle time flow with sufficient precision .  this must work now .    but his forehead glistened .   edith fellowes found herself out of her seat and at the balcony railing  but there was nothing to see .   the man at the microphone said quietly   now .    there was a space of silence sufficient for one breath and then the sound of a terrified little boy s scream from the dollhouse rooms .  terror .  piercing terror .   miss fellowes  head twisted in the direction of the cry .  a child was involved .  she had forgotten .   and hoskins  fist pounded on the railing and he said in a tight voice  trembling with triumph   did it .    miss fellowes was urged down the short  spiral flight of steps by the hard press of hoskins  palm between her shoulder blades .  he did not speak to her .   the men who had been at the controls were standing about now  smiling  smoking  watching the three as they entered on the main floor .  a very soft buzz sounded from the direction of the dollhouse .   hoskins said to deveney   it s perfectly safe to enter stasis .  i ve done it a thousand times .  there s a queer sensation which is momentary and means nothing .    he stepped through an open door in mute demonstration  and deveney  smiling stiffly and drawing an obviously deep breath  followed him .   hoskins said   miss fellowes .  please .   he crooked his forefinger impatiently .   miss fellowes nodded and stepped stiffly through .  it was as though a ripple went through her  an internal tickle .   but once inside all seemed normal .  there was the smell of the fresh wood of the dollhouse and   of   of soil somehow .   there was silence now  no voice at last  but there was the dry shuffling of feet  a scrabbling as of a hand over wood   then a low moan .    where is it .   asked miss fellowes in distress .  didn t these fool men care .   the boy was in the bedroom  at least the room with the bed in it .     it was standing naked  with its small  dirt smeared chest heaving raggedly .  a bushel of dirt and coarse grass spread over the floor at his bare brown feet .  the smell of soil came from it and a touch of something fetid .   hoskins followed her horrified glance and said with annoyance   you can t pluck a boy cleanly out of time  miss fellowes .  we had to take some of the surroundings with it for safety .  or would you have preferred to have it arrive here minus a leg or with only half a head .     please .   said miss fellowes  in an agony of revulsion .   are we just to stand here .  the poor child is frightened .  and it s filthy .    she was quite correct .  it was smeared with encrusted dirt and grease and had a scratch on its thigh that looked red and sore .   as hoskins approached him  the boy  who seemed to be something over three years in age  hunched low and backed away rapidly .  he lifted his upper lip and snarled in a hissing fashion like a cat .  with a rapid gesture  hoskins seized both the child s arms and lifted him  writhing and screaming  from the floor .   miss fellowes said   hold him  now .  he needs a warm bath first .  he needs to be cleaned .  have you the equipment .  if so  have it brought here  and i ll need to have help in handling him just at first .  then  too  for heaven s sake  have all this trash and filth removed .    she was giving the orders now and she felt perfectly good about that .  and because now she was an efficient nurse  rather than a confused spectator  she looked at the child with a clinical eye   and hesitated for one shocked moment .  she saw past the dirt and shrieking  past the thrashing of limbs and useless twisting .  she saw the boy himself .   it was the ugliest little boy she had ever seen .  it was horribly ugly from misshapen head to bandy legs .   she got the boy cleaned with three men helping her and with others milling about in their efforts to clean the room .  she worked in silence and with a sense of outrage  annoyed by the continued strugglings and outcries of the boy and by the undignified drenchings of soapy water to which she was subjected .   dr .  hoskins had hinted that the child would not be pretty  but that was far from stating that it would be repulsively deformed .  and there was a stench about the boy that soap and water was only alleviating little by little .   she had the strong desire to thrust the boy  soaped as he was  into hoskins  arms and walk out  but there was the pride of profession .  she had accepted an assignment  after all .    and there would be the look in his eyes .  a cold look that would read  only pretty children  miss fellowes .   he was standing apart from them  watching coolly from a distance with a half smile on his face when he caught her eyes  as though amused at her outrage .   she decided she would wait a while before quitting .  to do so now would only demean her .   then  when the boy was a bearable pink and smelled of scented soap  she felt better anyway .  his cries changed to whimpers of exhaustion as he watched carefully  eyes moving in quick frightened suspicion from one to another of those in the room .  his cleanness accentuated his thin nakedness as he shivered with cold after his bath .   miss fellowes said sharply   bring me a nightgown for the child .    a nightgown appeared at once .  it was as though everything were ready and yet nothing were ready unless she gave orders  as though they were deliberately leaving this in her charge without help  to test her .   the newsman  deveney  approached and said   i ll hold him  miss .  you won t get it on yourself .     thank you   said miss fellowes .  and it was a battle indeed  but the nightgown went on  and when the boy made as though to rip it off  she slapped his hand sharply .   the boy reddened  but did not cry .  he stared at her and the splayed fingers of one hand moved slowly across the flannel of the nightgown  feeling the strangeness of it .   miss fellowes thought desperately  well  what next .   everyone seemed in suspended animation  waiting for her   even the ugly little boy .   miss fellowes said sharply   have you provided food .  milk .    they had .  a mobile unit was wheeled in  with its refrigeration compartment containing three quarts of milk  with a warming unit and a supply of fortifications in the form of vitamin drops  copper cobalt iron syrup and others she had no time to be concerned with .  there was a variety of canned self warming junior foods .   she used milk  simply milk  to begin with .  the radar unit heated the milk to a set temperature in a matter of ten seconds and clicked off  and she put some in a saucer .  she had a certainty about the boy s savagery .  he wouldn t know how to handle a cup .   miss fellowes nodded and said to the boy   drink .  drink .   she made a gesture as though to raise the milk to her mouth .  the boy s eyes followed but he made no move .   suddenly  the nurse resorted to direct measures .  she seized the boy s upper arm in one hand and dipped the other in the milk .  she dashed the milk across his lips  so that it dripped down cheeks and receding chin .   for a moment  the child uttered a high pitched cry  then his tongue moved over his wetted lips .  miss fellowes stepped back .   the boy approached the saucer  bent toward it  then looked up and behind sharply as though expecting a crouching enemy  bent again and licked at the milk eagerly  like a cat .  he made a slurping noise .  he did not use his hands to lift the saucer .   miss fellowes allowed a bit of the revulsion she felt show on her face .  she couldn t help it .   deveney caught that  perhaps .  he said   does the nurse know  dr .  hoskins .     know what .   demanded miss fellowes .   deveney hesitated  but hoskins  again that look of detached amusement on his face  said   well  tell her .    deveney addressed miss fellowes .   you may not suspect it  miss  but you happen to be the first civilized woman in history ever to be taking care of a neanderthal youngster .    she turned on hoskins with a kind of controlled ferocity .   you might have told me  doctor .     why .  what difference does it make .     you said a child .     isn t that a child .  have you ever had a puppy or a kitten  miss fellowes .  are those closer to the human .  if that were a baby chimpanzee  would you be repelled .  you re a nurse  miss fellowes .  your record places you in a maternity ward for three years .  have you ever refused to take care of a deformed infant .    miss fellowes felt her case slipping away .  she said  with much less decision   you might have told me .     and you would have refused the position .  well  do you refuse it now .   he gazed at her coolly  while deveney watched from the other side of the room  and the neanderthal child  having finished the milk and licked the plate  looked up at her with a wet face and wide  longing eyes .   the boy pointed to the milk and suddenly burst out in a short series of sounds repeated over and over  sounds made up of gutturals and elaborate tongue clickings .   miss fellowes said  in surprise   why  he talks .     of course   said hoskins .   homo neanderthalensis is not a truly separate species  but rather a subspecies of homo sapiens .  why shouldn t he talk .  he s probably asking for more milk .    automatically  miss fellowes reached for the bottle of milk  but hoskins seized her wrist .   now  miss fellowes  before we go any further  are you staying on the job .    miss fellowes shook free in annoyance   won t you feed him if i don t .  i ll stay with him   for a while .    she poured the milk .   hoskins said   we are going to leave you with the boy  miss fellowes .  this is the only door to stasis number one and it is elaborately locked and guarded .  i ll want you to learn the details of the lock which will  of course  be keyed to your fingerprints as they are already keyed to mine .  the spaces overhead   he looked upward to the open ceilings of the dollhouse   are also guarded and we will be warned if anything untoward takes place in here .    miss fellowes said indignantly   you mean i ll be under view .   she thought suddenly of her own survey of the room interiors from the balcony .    no  no   said hoskins seriously   your privacy will be respected completely .  the view will consist of electronic symbolism only  which only a computer will deal with .  now you will stay with him tonight  miss fellowes  and every night until further notice .  you will be relieved during the day according to some schedule you will find convenient .  we will allow you to arrange that .    miss fellowes looked about the dollhouse with a puzzled expression .   but why all this  dr .  hoskins .  is the boy dangerous .     it s a matter of energy  miss fellowes .  he must never be allowed to leave these rooms .  never .  not for an instant .  not for any reason .  not to save his life .  not even to save your life  miss fellowes .  is that clear .    miss fellowes raised her chin .   i understand the orders  dr .  hoskins  and the nursing profession is accustomed to placing its duties ahead of self preservation .     good .  you can always signal if you need anyone .   and the two men left .   miss fellowes turned to the boy .  he was watching her and there was still milk in the saucer .  laboriously  she tried to show him how to lift the saucer and place it to his lips .  he resisted  but let her touch him without crying out .   always  his frightened eyes were on her  watching  watching for the one false move .  she found herself soothing him  trying to move her hand very slowly toward his hair  letting him see it every inch of the way  see there was no harm in it .   and she succeeded in stroking his hair for an instant .   she said   i m going to have to show you how to use the bathroom .  do you think you can learn .    she spoke quietly  kindly  knowing he would not understand the words but hoping he would respond to the calmness of the tone .   the boy launched into a clicking phrase again .   she said   may i take your hand .    she held out hers and the boy looked at it .  she left it outstretched and waited .  the boy s own hand crept forward toward hers .    that s right   she said .   it approached within an inch of hers and then the boy s courage failed him .  he snatched it back .    well   said miss fellowes calmly   we ll try again later .  would you like to sit down here .   she patted the mattress of the bed .   the hours passed slowly and progress was minute .  she did not succeed either with bathroom or with the bed .  in fact  after the child had given unmistakable signs of sleepiness he lay down on the bare ground and then  with a quick movement  rolled beneath the bed .   she bent to look at him and his eyes gleamed out at her as he tongue clicked at her .    all right   she said   if you feel safer there  you sleep there .    she closed the door to the bedroom and retired to the cot that had been placed for her use in the largest room .  at her insistence  a make shift canopy had been stretched over it .  she thought  those stupid men will have to place a mirror in this room and a larger chest of drawers and a separate washroom if they expect me to spend nights here .   it was difficult to sleep .  she found herself straining to hear possible sounds in the next room .  he couldn t get out  could he .  the walls were sheer and impossibly high but suppose the child could climb like a monkey .  well  hoskins said there were observational devices watching through the ceiling .   suddenly she thought  can he be dangerous .  physically dangerous .   surely  hoskins couldn t have meant that .  surely  he would not have left her here alone  if     she tried to laugh at herself .  he was only a three  or four year old child .  still  she had not succeeded in cutting his nails .  if he should attack her with nails and teeth while she slept   her breath came quickly .  oh  ridiculous  and yet     she listened with painful attentiveness  and this time she heard the sound .   the boy was crying .   not shrieking in fear or anger  not yelling or screaming .  it was crying softly  and the cry was the heartbroken sobbing of a lonely  lonely child .   for the first time  miss fellowes thought with a pang  poor thing .   of course  it was a child  what did the shape of its head matter .  it was a child that had been orphaned as no child had ever been orphaned before .  not only its mother and father were gone  but all its species .  snatched callously out of time  it was now the only creature of its kind in the world .  the last .  the only .   she felt pity for it strengthen  and with it shame at her own callousness .  tucking her own nightgown carefully about her calves  incongruously  she thought  tomorrow i ll have to bring in a bathrobe  she got out of bed and went into the boy s room .    little boy   she called in a whisper .   little boy .    she was about to reach under the bed  but she thought of a possible bite and did not .  instead  she turned on the night light and moved the bed .   the poor thing was huddled in the corner  knees up against his chin  looking up at her with blurred and apprehensive eyes .   in the dim light  she was not aware of his repulsiveness .    poor boy   she said   poor boy .   she felt him stiffen as she stroked his hair  then relax .   poor boy .  may i hold you .    she sat down on the floor next to him and slowly and rhythmically stroked his hair  his cheek  his arm .  softly  she began to sing a slow and gentle song .   he lifted his head at that  staring at her mouth in the dimness  as though wondering at the sound .   she maneuvered him closer while he listened to her .  slowly  she pressed gently against the side of his head  until it rested on her shoulder .  she put her arm under his thighs and with a smooth and unhurried motion lifted him into her lap .   she continued singing  the same simple verse over and over  while she rocked back and forth  back and forth .   he stopped crying  and after a while the smooth burr of his breathing showed he was asleep .   with infinite care  she pushed his bed back against the wall and laid him down .  she covered him and stared down .  his face looked so peaceful and little boy as he slept .  it didn t matter so much that it was so ugly .  really .   she began to tiptoe out  then thought  if he wakes up .   she came back  battled irresolutely with herself  then sighed and slowly got into bed with the child .   it was too small for her .  she was cramped and uneasy at the lack of canopy  but the child s hand crept into hers and  somehow  she fell asleep in that position .   she awoke with a start and a wild impulse to scream .  the latter she just managed to suppress into a gurgle .  the boy was looking at her  wide eyed .  it took her a long moment to remember getting into bed with him  and now  slowly  without unfixing her eyes from his  she stretched one leg carefully and let it touch the floor  then the other one .   she cast a quick and apprehensive glance toward the open ceiling  then tensed her muscles for quick disengagement .   but at that moment  the boy s stubby fingers reached out and touched her lips .  he said something .   she shrank at the touch .  he was terribly ugly in the light of day .   the boy spoke again .  he opened his own mouth and gestured with his hand as though something were coming out .   miss fellowes guessed at the meaning and said tremulously   do you want me to sing .    the boy said nothing but stared at her mouth .   in a voice slightly off key with tension  miss fellowes began the little song she had sung the night before and the ugly little boy smiled .  he swayed clumsily in rough time to the music and made a little gurgly sound that might have been the beginnings of a laugh .   miss fellowes sighed inwardly .  music hath charms to soothe the savage breast .  it might help     she said   you wait .  let me get myself fixed up .  it will just take a minute .  then i ll make breakfast for you .    she worked rapidly  conscious of the lack of ceiling at all times .  the boy remained in bed  watching her when she was in view .  she smiled at him at those times and waved .  at the end  he waved back  and she found herself being charmed by that .   finally  she said   would you like oatmeal with milk .   it took a moment to prepare  and then she beckoned to him .   whether he understood the gesture or followed the aroma  miss fellowes did not know  but he got out of bed .   she tried to show him how to use a spoon but he shrank away from it in fright .   time enough  she thought .   she compromised on insisting that he lift the bowl in his hands .  he did it clumsily enough and it was incredibly messy but most of it did get into him .   she tried the drinking milk in a glass this time  and the little boy whined when he found the opening too small for him to get his face into conveniently .  she held his hand  forcing it around the glass  making him tip it  forcing his mouth to the rim .   again a mess but again most went into him  and she was used to messes .   the washroom  to her surprise and relief  was a less frustrating matter .  he understood what it was she expected him to do .   she found herself patting his head  saying   good boy .  smart boy .    and to miss fellowes  exceeding pleasure  the boy smiled at that .   she thought  when he smiles  he s quite bearable .  really .   later in the day  the gentlemen of the press arrived .   she held the boy in her arms and he clung to her wildly while across the open door they set cameras to work .  the commotion frightened the boy and he began to cry  but it was ten minutes before miss fellowes was allowed to retreat and put the boy in the next room .   she emerged again  flushed with indignation  walked out of the apartment  for the first time in eighteen hours  and closed the door behind her .   i think you ve had enough .  it will take me a while to quiet him .  go away .     sure  sure   said the gentleman from the times herald .   but is that really a neanderthal or is this some kind of gag .     i assure you   said hoskins  voice  suddenly  from the background   that this is no gag .  the child is authentic homo neanderthalensis .     is it a boy or a girl .     boy   said miss fellowes briefly .    ape boy   said the gentleman from the news .   that s what we ve got here .  ape boy .  how does he act  nurse .     he acts exactly like a little boy   snapped miss fellowes  annoyed into the defensive   and he is not an ape boy .  his name is   is timothy  timmie   and he is perfectly normal in his behavior .    she had chosen the name timothy at a venture .  it was the first that had occurred to her .    timmie the ape boy   said the gentleman from the news and  as it turned out  timmie the ape boy was the name under which the child became known to the world .   the gentleman from the globe turned to hoskins and said   doc  what do you expect to do with the ape boy .    hoskins shrugged .   my original plan was completed when i proved it possible to bring him here .  however  the anthropologists will be very interested  i imagine  and the physiologists .  we have here  after all  a creature which is at the edge of being human .  we should learn a great deal about ourselves and our ancestry from him .     how long will you keep him .     until such a time as we need the space more than we need him .  quite a while  perhaps .    the gentleman from the news said   can you bring it out into the open  so we can set up sub etheric equipment and put on a real show .     i m sorry  but the child cannot be removed from stasis .     exactly what is stasis .     ah .   hoskins permitted himself one of his short smiles .   that would take a great deal of explanation  gentlemen .  in stasis  time as we know it doesn t exist .  those rooms are inside an invisible bubble that is not exactly part of our universe .  that is why the child could be plucked out of time as it was .     well  wait now   said the gentleman from the news discontentedly   what are you giving us .  the nurse goes into the room and out of it .     and so can any of you   said hoskins matter of factly .   you would be moving parallel to the lines of temporal force and no great energy gain or loss would be involved .  the child  however  was taken from the far past .  it moved across the lines and gained temporal potential .  to move it into the universe and into our own time would absorb enough energy to burn out every line in the place and probably blank out all power in the city of washington .  we had to store trash brought with him on the premises and will have to remove it little by little .    the newsmen were writing down sentences busily as hoskins spoke to them .  they did not understand and they were sure their readers would not  but it sounded scientific and that was what counted .   the gentleman from the times herald said   would you be available for an all circuit interview tonight .     i think so   said hoskins at once  and they all moved off .   miss fellowes looked after them .  she understood all this about stasis and temporal force as little as the newsmen but she managed to get this much .  timmie s imprisonment  she found herself suddenly thinking of the little boy as timmie  was a real one and not one imposed by the arbitrary fiat of hoskins .  apparently  it was impossible to let him out of stasis at all  ever .   poor child .  poor child .   she was suddenly aware of his crying and she hastened in to console him .   miss fellowes did not have a chance to see hoskins on the all circuit hookup  and though his interview was beamed to every part of the world and even to the outpost on the moon  it did not penetrate the apartment in which miss fellowes and the ugly little boy lived .   but he was down the next morning  radiant and joyful .   miss fellowes said   did the interview go well .     extremely .  and how is   timmie .    miss fellowes found herself pleased at the use of the name .   doing quite well .  now come out here  timmie  the nice gentleman will not hurt you .    but timmie stayed in the other room  with a lock of his matted hair showing behind the barrier of the door and  occasionally  the corner of an eye .    actually   said miss fellowes   he is settling down amazingly .  he is quite intelligent .     are you surprised .    she hesitated just a moment  then said   yes  i am .  i suppose i thought he was an ape boy .     well  ape boy or not  he s done a great deal for us .  he s put stasis  inc .  on the map .  we re in  miss fellowes  we re in .   it was as though he had to express his triumph to someone  even if only to miss fellowes .    oh .   she let him talk .   he put his hands in his pockets and said   we ve been working on a shoestring for ten years  scrounging funds a penny at a time wherever we could .  we had to shoot the works on one big show .  it was everything  or nothing .  and when i say the works  i mean it .  this attempt to bring in a neanderthal took every cent we could borrow or steal  and some of it was stolen   funds for other projects  used for this one without permission .  if that experiment hadn t succeeded  i d have been through .    miss fellowes said abruptly   is that why there are no ceilings .     eh .   hoskins looked up .    was there no money for ceilings .     oh .  well  that wasn t the only reason .  we didn t really know in advance how old the neanderthal might be exactly .  we can detect only dimly in time  and he might have been large and savage .  it was possible we might have had to deal with him from a distance  like a caged animal .     but since that hasn t turned out to be so  i suppose you can build a ceiling now .     now  yes .  we have plenty of money  now .  funds have been promised from every source .  this is all wonderful  miss fellowes .   his broad face gleamed with a smile that lasted and when he left  even his back seemed to be smiling .   miss fellowes thought  he s quite a nice man when he s off guard and forgets about being scientific .   she wondered for an idle moment if he was married  then dismissed the thought in self embarrassment .    timmie   she called .   come here  timmie .    in the months that passed  miss fellowes felt herself grow to be an integral part of stasis  inc .  she was given a small office of her own with her name on the door  an office quite close to the dollhouse  as she never stopped calling timmie s stasis bubble  .  she was given a substantial raise .  the dollhouse was covered by a ceiling  its furnishings were elaborated and improved  a second washroom was added   and even so  she gained an apartment of her own on the institute grounds and  on occasion  did not stay with timmie during the night .  an intercom was set up between the dollhouse and her apartment and timmie learned how to use it .   miss fellowes got used to timmie .  she even grew less conscious of his ugliness .  one day she found herself staring at an ordinary boy in the street and finding something bulgy and unattractive in his high domed forehead and jutting chin .  she had to shake herself to break the spell .  it was more pleasant to grow used to hoskins  occasional visits .  it was obvious he welcomed escape from his increasingly harried role as head of stasis  inc .   and that he took a sentimental interest in the child who had started it all  but it seemed to miss fellowes that he also enjoyed talking to her .    she had learned some facts about hoskins  too .  he had invented the method of analyzing the reflection of the past penetrating mesonic beam  he had invented the method of establishing stasis  his coldness was only an effort to hide a kindly nature  and  oh yes  he was married .    what miss fellowes could not get used to was the fact that she was engaged in a scientific experiment .  despite all she could do  she found herself getting personally involved to the point of quarreling with the physiologists .   on one occasion  hoskins came down and found her in the midst of a hot urge to kill .  they had no right  they had no right    even if he was a neanderthal  he still wasn t an animal .   she was staring after them in a blind fury  staring out the open door and listening to timmie s sobbing  when she noticed hoskins standing before her .  he might have been there for minutes .   he said   may i come in .    she nodded curtly  then hurried to timmie  who clung to her  curling his little bandy legs   still thin  so thin    about her .   hoskins watched  then said gravely   he seems quite unhappy .    miss fellowes said   i don t blame him .  they re at him every day now with their blood samples and their probings .  they keep him on synthetic diets that i wouldn t feed a pig .     it s the sort of thing they can t try on a human  you know .       and they can t try it on timmie  either .  dr .  hoskins  i insist .  you told me it was timmie s coming that put stasis  inc .  on the map .  if you have any gratitude for that at all  you ve got to keep them away from the poor thing at least until he s old enough to understand a little more .  after he s had a bad session with them  he has nightmares  he can t sleep .  now i warn you    she reached a sudden peak of fury   i m not letting them in here any more .     she realized that she had screamed that  but she couldn t help it .    she said more quietly   i know he s neanderthal but there s a great deal we don t appreciate about neanderthals .  i ve read up on them .  they had a culture of their own .  some of the greatest human inventions arose in neanderthal times .  the domestication of animals  for instance  the wheel  various techniques in grinding stone .  they even had spiritual yearnings .  they buried their dead and buried possessions with the body  showing they believed in a life after death .  it amounts to the fact that they invented religion .  doesn t that mean timmie has a right to human treatment .    she patted the little boy gently on his buttocks and sent him off into his playroom .  as the door was opened  hoskins smiled briefly at the display of toys that could be seen .   miss fellowes said defensively   the poor child deserves his toys .  it s all he has and he earns them with what he goes through .     no  no .  no objections  i assure you .  i was just thinking how you ve changed since the first day  when you were quite angry i had foisted a neanderthal on you .    miss fellowes said in a low voice   i suppose i didn t     and faded off .   hoskins changed the subject   how old would you say he is  miss fellowes .    she said   i can t say  since we don t know how neanderthals develop .  in size  he d only be three but neanderthals are smaller generally and with all the tampering they do with him  he probably isn t growing .  the way he s learning english  though  i d say he was well over four .     really .  i haven t noticed anything about learning english in the reports .     he won t speak to anyone but me .  for now  anyway .  he s terribly afraid of others  and no wonder .  but he can ask for an article of food  he can indicate any need practically  and he understands almost anything i say .  of course    she watched him shrewdly  trying to estimate if this was the time    his development may not continue .     why not .     any child needs stimulation and this one lives a life of solitary confinement .  i do what i can  but i m not with him all the time and i m not all he needs .  what i mean  dr .  hoskins  is that he needs another boy to play with .    hoskins nodded slowly .   unfortunately  there s only one of him  isn t there .  poor child .    miss fellowes warmed to him at once .  she said   you do like timmie  don t you .   it was so nice to have someone else feel like that .    oh  yes   said hoskins  and with his guard down  she could see the weariness in his eyes .   miss fellowes dropped her plans to push the matter at once .  she said  with real concern   you look worn out  dr .  hoskins .     do i  miss fellowes .  i ll have to practice looking more lifelike then .     i suppose stasis  inc .  is very busy and that that keeps you very busy .    hoskins shrugged .   you suppose right .  it s a matter of animal  vegetable  and mineral in equal parts  miss fellowes .  but then  i suppose you haven t ever seen our displays .     actually  i haven t .     but it s not because i m not interested .  it s just that i ve been so busy .     well  you re not all that busy right now   he said with impulsive decision .   i ll call for you tomorrow at eleven and give you a personal tour .  how s that .    she smiled happily .   i d love it .    he nodded and smiled in his turn and left .   miss fellowes hummed at intervals for the rest of the day .  really   to think so was ridiculous  of course   but really  it was almost like   like making a date .   he was quite on time the next day  smiling and pleasant .  she had replaced her nurse s uniform with a dress .  one of conservative cut  to be sure  but she hadn t felt so feminine in years .   he complimented her on her appearance with staid formality and she accepted with equally formal grace .  it was really a perfect prelude  she thought .  and then the additional thought came  prelude to what .   she shut that off by hastening to say good by to timmie and to assure him she would be back soon .  she made sure he knew all about what and where lunch was .   hoskins took her into the new wing  into which she had never yet gone .  it still had the odor of newness about it and the sound of construction  softly heard  was indication enough that it was still being extended .    animal  vegetable  and mineral   said hoskins  as he had the day before .   animal right there  our most spectacular exhibits .    the space was divided into many rooms  each a separate stasis bubble .  hoskins brought her to the view glass of one and she looked in .  what she saw impressed her first as a scaled  tailed chicken .  skittering on two thin legs it ran from wall to wall with its delicate birdlike head  surmounted by a bony keel like the comb of a rooster  looking this way and that .  the paws on its small forelimbs clenched and unclenched constantly .   hoskins said   it s our dinosaur .  we ve had it for months .  i don t know when we ll be able to let go of it .     dinosaur .     did you expect a giant .    she dimpled .   one does  i suppose .  i know some of them are small .     a small one is all we aimed for  believe me .  generally  it s under investigation  but this seems to be an open hour .  some interesting things have been discovered .  for instance  it is not entirely cold blooded .  it has an imperfect method of maintaining internal temperatures higher than that of its environment .  unfortunately  it s a male .  ever since we brought it in we ve been trying to get a fix on another that may be female  but we ve had no luck yet .     why female .    he looked at her quizzically .   so that we might have a fighting chance to obtain fertile eggs  and baby dinosaurs .     of course .    he led her to the trilobite section .   that s professor dwayne of washington university   he said .   he s a nuclear chemist .  if i recall correctly  he s taking an isotope ratio on the oxygen of the water .     why .     it s primeval water  at least half a billion years old .  the isotope ratio gives the temperature of the ocean at that time .  he himself happens to ignore the trilobites  but others are chiefly concerned in dissecting them .  they re the lucky ones because all they need are scalpels and microscopes .  dwayne has to set up a mass spectrograph each time he conducts an experiment .     why s that .  can t he       no  he can t .  he can t take anything out of the room as far as can be helped .    there were samples of primordial plant life too and chunks of rock formations .  those were the vegetable and mineral .  and every specimen had its investigator .  it was like a museum  a museum brought to life and serving as a superactive center of research .    and you have to supervise all of this  dr .  hoskins .     only indirectly  miss fellowes .  i have subordinates  thank heaven .  my own interest is entirely in the theoretical aspects of the matter  the nature of time  the technique of mesonic intertemporal detection and so on .  i would exchange all this for a method of detecting objects closer in time than ten thousand years ago .  if we could get into historical times      he was interrupted by a commotion at one of the distant booths  a thin voice raised querulously .  he frowned  muttered hastily   excuse me   and hastened off .   miss fellowes followed as best she could without actually running .   an elderly man  thinly bearded and red faced  was saying   i had vital aspects of my investigations to complete .  don t you understand that .    a uniformed technician with the interwoven si monogram  for stasis  inc .   on his lab coat  said   dr .  hoskins  it was arranged with professor ademewski at the beginning that the specimen could only remain here two weeks .     i did not know then how long my investigations would take .  i m not a prophet   said ademewski heatedly .   dr .  hoskins said   you understand  professor  we have limited space  we must keep specimens rotating .  that piece of chalcopyrite must go back  there are men waiting for the next specimen .     why can t i have it for myself  then .  let me take it out of there .     you know you can t have it .     a piece of chalcopyrite  a miserable five kilogram piece .  why not .     we can t afford the energy expense .   said hoskins brusquely .   you know that .    the technician interrupted .   the point is  dr .  hoskins  that he tried to remove the rock against the rules and i almost punctured stasis while he was in there  not knowing he was in there .    there was a short silence and dr .  hoskins turned on the investigator with a cold formality .   is that so  professor .    professor ademewski coughed .   i saw no harm      hoskins reached up to a hand pull dangling just within reach  outside the specimen room in question .  he pulled it .   miss fellowes  who had been peering in  looking at the totally undistinguished sample of rock that occasioned the dispute  drew in her breath sharply as its existence flickered out .  the room was empty .   hoskins said   professor  your permit to investigate matters in stasis will be permanently voided .  i am sorry .     but wait       i am sorry .  you have violated one of the stringent rules .     i will appeal to the international association       appeal away .  in a case like this  you will find i can t be overruled .    he turned away deliberately  leaving the professor still protesting and said to miss fellowes  his face still white with anger    would you care to have lunch with me  miss fellowes .    he took her into the small administration alcove of the cafeteria .  he greeted others and introduced miss fellowes with complete ease  although she herself felt painfully self conscious .   what must they think  she thought  and tried desperately to appear businesslike .   she said   do you have that kind of trouble often  dr .  hoskins .  i mean like that you just had with the professor .   she took her fork in hand and began eating .    no   said hoskins forcefully .   that was the first time .  of course i m always having to argue men out of removing specimens but this is the first time one actually tried to do it .     i remember you once talked about the energy it would consume .     that s right .  of course  we ve tried to take it into account .  accidents will happen and so we ve got special power sources designed to stand the drain of accidental removal from stasis  but that doesn t mean we want to see a year s supply of energy gone in half a second   or can afford to without having our plans of expansion delayed for years .    besides  imagine the professor s being in the room while stasis was about to be punctured .     what would have happened to him if it had been .     well  we ve experimented with inanimate objects and with mice and they ve disappeared .  presumably they ve traveled back in time  carried along  so to speak  by the pull of the object simultaneously snapping back into its natural time .  for that reason  we have to anchor objects within stasis that we don t want to move and that s a complicated procedure .  the professor would not have been anchored and he would have gone back to the pliocene at the moment when we abstracted the rock    plus  of course  the two weeks it had remained here in the present .     how dreadful it would have been .     not on account of the professor  i assure you .  if he were fool enough to do what he did  it would serve him right .  but imagine the effect it would have on the public if the fact came out .  all people would need is to become aware of the dangers involved and funds could be choked off like that .   he snapped his fingers and played moodily with his food .   miss fellowes said   couldn t you get him back .  the way you got the rock in the first place .     no  because once an object is returned  the original fix is lost unless we deliberately plan to retain it and there was no reason to do that in this case .  there never is .  finding the professor again would mean relocating a specific fix and that would be like dropping a line into the oceanic abyss for the purpose of dredging up a particular fish .    my god  when i think of the precautions we take to prevent accidents  it makes me mad .  we have every individual stasis unit set up with its own puncturing device   we have to  since each unit has its separate fix and must be collapsible independently .  the point is  though  none of the puncturing devices is ever activated until the last minute .  and then we deliberately make activation impossible except by the pull of a rope carefully led outside the stasis .  the pull is a gross mechanical motion that requires a strong effort  not something that is likely to be done accidentally .    miss fellowes said   but doesn t it   change history to move something in and out of time .    hoskins shrugged .   theoretically  yes  actually  except in unusual cases  no .  we move objects out of stasis all the time .  air molecules .  bacteria .  dust .  about    percent of our energy consumption goes to make up micro losses of that nature .  but moving even large objects in time sets up changes that damp out .  take that chalcopyrite from the pliocene .  because of its absence for two weeks some insect didn t find the shelter it might have found and is killed .  that could initiate a whole series of changes  but the mathematics of stasis indicates that this is a converging series .  the amount of change diminishes with time and then things are as before .     you mean  reality heals itself .     in a manner of speaking .  abstract a human from time or send one back  and you make a larger wound .  if the individual is an ordinary one  that wound still heals itself .  of course  there are a great many people who write to us each day and want us to bring abraham lincoln into the present  or mohammed  or lenin .  that can t be done  of course .  even if we could find them  the change in reality in moving one of the history molders would be too great to be healed .  there are ways of calculating when a change is likely to be too great and we avoid even approaching that limit .    miss fellowes said   then  timmie       no  he presents no problem in that direction .  reality is safe .  but     he gave her a quick  sharp glance  then went on   but never mind .  yesterday you said timmie needed companionship .     yes   miss fellowes smiled her delight .   i didn t think you paid that any attention .     of course i did .  i m fond of the child .  i appreciate your feelings for him and i was concerned enough to want to explain to you .  now i have  you ve seen what we do  you ve gotten some insight into the difficulties involved  so you know why  with the best will in the world  we can t supply companionship for timmie .     you can t .   said miss fellowes  with sudden dismay .    but i ve just explained .  we couldn t possibly expect to find another neanderthal his age without incredible luck  and if we could  it wouldn t be fair to multiply risks by having another human being in stasis .    miss fellowes put down her spoon and said energetically   but  dr .  hoskins  that is not at all what i meant .  i don t want you to bring another neanderthal into the present .  i know that s impossible .  but it isn t impossible to bring another child to play with timmie .    hoskins stared at her in concern .   a human child .     another child   said miss fellowes  completely hostile now .   timmie is human .     i couldn t dream of such a thing .     why not .  why couldn t you .  what is wrong with the notion .  you pulled that child out of time and made him an eternal prisoner .  don t you owe him something .  dr .  hoskins  if there is any man who  in this world  is that child s father in every sense but the biological  it is you .  why can t you do this little thing for him .    hoskins said   his father .   he rose  somewhat unsteadily  to his feet .   miss fellowes  i think i ll take you back now  if you don t mind .    they returned to the dollhouse in a complete silence that neither broke .   it was a long time after that before she saw hoskins again  except for an occasional glimpse in passing .  she was sorry about that at times  then  at other times  when timmie was more than usually woebegone or when he spent silent hours at the window with its prospect of little more than nothing  she thought  fiercely  stupid man .   timmie s speech grew better and more precise each day .  it never entirely lost a certain soft  slurriness that miss fellowes found rather endearing .  in times of excitement  he fell back into tongue clicking but those times were becoming fewer .  he must be forgetting the days before he came into the present   except for dreams .   as he grew older  the physiologists grew less interested and the psychologists more so .  miss fellowes was not sure that she did not like the new group even less than the first .  the needles were gone  the injections and withdrawals of fluid  the special diets .  but now timmie was made to overcome barriers to reach food and water .  he had to lift panels  move bars  reach for cords .  and the mild electric shocks made him cry and drove miss fellowes to distraction .   she did not wish to appeal to hoskins  she did not wish to have to go to him  for each time she thought of him  she thought of his face over the luncheon table that last time .  her eyes moistened and she thought  stupid  stupid man .   and then one day hoskins  voice sounded unexpectedly  calling into the dollhouse   miss fellowes .    she came out coldly  smoothing her nurse s uniform  then stopped in confusion at finding herself in the presence of a pale woman  slender and of middle height .  the woman s fair hair and complexion gave her an appearance of fragility .  standing behind her and clutching at her skirt was a round faced  large eyed child of four .   hoskins said   dear  this is miss fellowes  the nurse in charge of the boy .  miss fellowes  this is my wife .     was this his wife .  she was not as miss fellowes had imagined her to be .  but then  why not .  a man like hoskins would choose a weak thing to be his foil .  if that was what he wanted      she forced a matter of fact greeting .   good afternoon  mrs .  hoskins .  is this your   your little boy .     that was a surprise .  she had thought of hoskins as a husband  but not as a father  except  of course    she suddenly caught hoskins  grave eyes and flushed .    hoskins said   yes  this is my boy  jerry .  say hello to miss fellowes  jerry .    .    had he stressed the word  this  just a bit .  was he saying this was his son and not      jerry receded a bit further into the folds of the maternal skirt and muttered his hello .  mrs .  hoskins  eyes were searching over miss fellowes  shoulders  peering into the room  looking for something .   hoskins said   well  let s go in .  come  dear .  there s a trifling discomfort at the threshold  but it passes .    miss fellowes said   do you want jerry to come in  too .     of course .  he is to be timmie s playmate .  you said that timmie needed a playmate .  or have you forgotten .     but     she looked at him with a colossal  surprised wonder .   your boy .    he said peevishly   well  whose boy  then .  isn t this what you want .  come on in  dear .  come on in .    mrs .  hoskins lifted jerry into her arms with a distinct effort and  hesitantly  stepped over the threshold .  jerry squirmed as she did so  disliking the sensation .   mrs .  hoskins said in a thin voice   is the creature here .  i don t see him .    miss fellowes called   timmie .  come out .    timmie peered around the edge of the door  staring up at the little boy who was visiting him .  the muscles in mrs .  hoskins  arms tensed visibly .   she said to her husband   gerald  are you sure it s safe .    miss fellowes said at once   if you mean is timmie safe  why  of course he is .  he s a gentle little boy .     but he s a sa   savage .     the ape boy stories in the newspapers .   miss fellowes said emphatically   he is not a savage .  he is just as quiet and reasonable as you can possibly expect a five and a half year old to be .  it is very generous of you  mrs .  hoskins  to agree to allow your boy to play with timmie but please have no fears about it .    mrs .  hoskins said with mild heat   i m not sure that i agree .     we ve had it out  dear   said hoskins .   let s not bring up the matter for new argument .  put jerry down .    mrs .  hoskins did so and the boy backed against her  staring at the pair of eyes which were staring back at him from the next room .    come here  timmie   said miss fellowes .   don t be afraid .    slowly  timmie stepped into the room .  hoskins bent to disengage jerry s fingers from his mother s skirt .   step back  dear .  give the children a chance .    the youngsters faced one another .  although the younger  jerry was nevertheless an inch taller  and in the presence of his straightness and his high held  well proportioned head  timmie s grotesqueries were suddenly almost as pronounced as they had been in the first days .   miss fellowes  lips quivered .   it was the little neanderthal who spoke first  in childish treble .   what s your name .   and timmie thrust his face suddenly forward as though to inspect the other s features more closely .   startled jerry responded with a vigorous shove that sent timmie tumbling .  both began crying loudly and mrs .  hoskins snatched up her child  while miss fellowes  flushed with repressed anger  lifted timmie and comforted him .   mrs .  hoskins said   they just instinctively don t like one another .     no more instinctively   said her husband wearily   than any two children dislike each other .  now put jerry down and let him get used to the situation .  in fact  we had better leave .  miss fellowes can bring jerry to my office after a while and i ll have him taken home .    the two children spent the next hour very aware of each other .  jerry cried for his mother  struck out at miss fellowes and  finally  allowed himself to be comforted with a lollipop .  timmie sucked at another  and at the end of an hour  miss fellowes had them playing with the same set of blocks  though at opposite ends of the room .   she found herself almost maudlinly grateful to hoskins when she brought jerry to him .   she searched for ways to thank him but his very formality was a rebuff .  perhaps he could not forgive her for making him feel like a cruel father .  perhaps the bringing of his own child was an attempt  after all  to prove himself both a kind father to timmie and  also  not his father at all .  both at the same time .   so all she could say was   thank you .  thank you very much .    and all he could say was   it s all right .  don t mention it .    it became a settled routine .  twice a week  jerry was brought in for an hour s play  later extended to two hours  play .  the children learned each other s names and ways and played together .   and yet  after the first rush of gratitude  miss fellowes found herself disliking jerry .  he was larger and heavier and in all things dominant  forcing timmie into a completely secondary role .  all that reconciled her to the situation was the fact that  despite difficulties  timmie looked forward with more and more delight to the periodic appearances of his playfellow .   it was all he had  she mourned to herself .   and once  as she watched them  she thought  hoskins  two children  one by his wife and one by stasis .   while she herself     heavens  she thought  putting her fists to her temples and feeling ashamed  i m jealous .    miss fellowes   said timmie  carefully  she had never allowed him to call her anything else   when will i go to school .    she looked down at those eager brown eyes turned up to hers and passed her hand softly through his thick  curly hair .  it was the most disheveled portion of his appearance  for she cut his hair herself while he sat restlessly under the scissors .  she did not ask for professional help  for the very clumsiness of the cut served to mask the retreating fore part of the skull and the bulging hinder part .   she said   where did you hear about school .     jerry goes to school .  kin der gar ten .   he said it carefully .   there are lots of places he goes .  outside .  when can i go outside  miss fellowes .    a small pain centered in miss fellowes  heart .  of course  she saw  there would be no way of avoiding the inevitability of timmie s hearing more and more of the outer world he could never enter .   she said  with an attempt at gaiety   why  whatever would you do in kindergarten  timmie .     jerry says they play games  they have picture tapes .  he says there are lots of children .  he says   he says     a thought  then a triumphant upholding of both small hands with the fingers splayed apart .   he says this many .    miss fellowes said   would you like picture tapes .  i can get you picture tapes .  very nice ones .  and music tapes too .    so that timmie was temporarily comforted .   he pored over the picture tapes in jerry s absence and miss fellowes read to him out of ordinary books by the hours .   there was so much to explain in even the simplest story  so much that was outside the perspective of his three rooms .  timmie took to having his dreams more often now that the outside was being introduced to him .   they were always the same  about the outside .  he tried haltingly to describe them to miss fellowes .  in his dreams  he was outside  an empty outside  but very large  with children and queer indescribable objects half digested in his thought out of bookish descriptions half understood  or out of distant neanderthal memories half recalled .   but the children and objects ignored him and though he was in the world  he was never part of it  but was as alone as though he were in his own room   and would wake up crying .   miss fellowes tried to laugh at the dreams  but there were nights in her own apartment when she cried  too .   one day  as miss fellowes read  timmie put his hand under her chin and lifted it gently so that her eyes left the book and met his .   he said   how do you know what to say  miss fellowes .    she said   you see these marks .  they tell me what to say .  these marks make words .    he stared at them long and curiously  taking the book out of her hands .   some of these marks are the same .    she laughed with pleasure at this sign of his shrewdness and said   so they are .  would you like to have me show you how to make the marks .     all right .  that would be a nice game .    it did not occur to her that he could learn to read .  up to the very moment that he read a book to her  it did not occur to her that he could learn to read .   then  weeks later  the enormity of what had been done struck her .  timmie sat in her lap  following word by word the printing in a child s book  reading to her .  he was reading to her .   she struggled to her feet in amazement and said   now timmie  i ll be back later .  i want to see dr .  hoskins .    excited nearly to frenzy  it seemed to her she might have an answer to timmie s unhappiness .  if timmie could not leave to enter the world  the world must be brought into those three rooms to timmie   the whole world in books and film and sound .  he must be educated to his full capacity .  so much the world owed him .   she found hoskins in a mood that was oddly analogous to her own  a kind of triumph and glory .  his offices were unusually busy  and for a moment  she thought she would not get to see him  as she stood abashed in the anteroom .   but he saw her  and a smile spread over his broad face .   miss fellowes  come here .   he spoke rapidly into the intercom  then shut it off .    have you heard .    no  of course  you couldn t have .  we ve done it .  we ve actually done it .  we have intertemporal detection at close range .     you mean   she tried to detach her thought from her own good news for a moment   that you can get a person from historical times into the present .     that s just what i mean .  we have a fix on a fourteenth century individual right now .  imagine .  imagine .  if you could only know how glad i ll be to shift from the eternal concentration on the mesozoic  replace the paleontologists with the historians   but there s something you wish to say to me  eh .  well  go ahead  go ahead .  you find me in a good mood .  anything you want you can have .    miss fellowes smiled .   i m glad .  because i wonder if we might not establish a system of instruction for timmie .     instruction .  in what .     well  in everything .  a school .  so that he might learn .     but can he learn .     certainly  he is learning .  he can read .  i ve taught him so much myself .    hoskins sat there  seeming suddenly depressed .   i don t know  miss fellowes .    she said   you just said that anything i wanted       i know and i should not have .  you see  miss fellowes  i m sure you must realize that we cannot maintain the timmie experiment forever .    she stared at him with sudden horror  not really understanding what he had said .  how did he mean  cannot maintain  .  with an agonizing flash of recollection  she recalled professor ademewski and his mineral specimen that was taken away after two weeks .  she said   but you re talking about a boy .  not about a rock      dr .  hoskins said uneasily   even a boy can t be given undue importance  miss fellowes .  now that we expect individuals out of historical time  we will need stasis space  all we can get .    she didn t grasp it .   but you can t .  timmie   timmie       now  miss fellowes  please don t upset yourself .  timmie won t go right away  perhaps not for months .  meanwhile we ll do what we can .    she was still staring at him .    let me get you something  miss fellowes .     no   she whispered .   i don t need anything .   she arose in a kind of nightmare and left .   timmie  she thought  you will not die .  you will not die .   it was all very well to hold tensely to the thought that timmie must not die  but how was that to be arranged .  in the first weeks  miss fellowes clung only to the hope that the attempt to bring forward a man from the fourteenth century would fail completely .  hoskins  theories might be wrong or his practice defective .  then things could go on as before .   certainly  that was not the hope of the rest of the world and  irrationally  miss fellowes hated the world for it .   project middle ages  reached a climax of white hot publicity .  the press and the public had hungered for something like this .  stasis  inc .  had lacked the necessary sensation for a long time now .  a new rock or another ancient fish failed to stir them .  but this was it .   a historical human  an adult speaking a known language  someone who could open a new page of history to the scholar .   zero time was coming and this time it was not a question of three onlookers from the balcony .  this time there would be a world wide audience .  this time the technicians of stasis  inc .  would play their role before nearly all of mankind .   miss fellowes was herself all but savage with waiting .  when young jerry hoskins showed up for his scheduled playtime with timmie  she scarcely recognized him .  he was not the one she was waiting for .    the secretary who brought him left hurriedly after the barest nod for miss fellowes .  she was rushing for a good place from which to watch the climax of project middle ages .     and so ought miss fellowes with far better reason  she thought bitterly  if only that stupid girl would arrive .    jerry hoskins sidled toward her  embarrassed .   miss fellowes .   he took the reproduction of a news strip out of his pocket .    yes .  what is it  jerry .     is this a picture of timmie .    miss fellowes stared at him  then snatched the strip from jerry s hand .  the excitement of project middle ages had brought about a pale revival of interest in timmie on the part of the press .   jerry watched her narrowly  then said   it says timmie is an ape boy .  what does that mean .    miss fellowes caught the youngster s wrist and repressed the impulse to shake him .   never say that  jerry  never  do you understand .  it is a nasty word and you mustn t use it .    jerry struggled out of her grip  frightened .   miss fellowes tore up the news strip with a vicious twist of the wrist .   now go inside and play with timmie .  he s got a new book to show you .    and then  finally  the girl appeared .  miss fellowes did not know her .  none of the usual stand ins she had used when businesss took her elsewhere was available now  not with project middle ages at climax  but hoskins  secretary had promised to find someone and this must be the girl .   miss fellowes tried to keep querulousness out of her voice .   are you the girl assigned to stasis section one .     yes  i m mandy terris .  you re miss fellowes  aren t you .     that s right .     i m sorry i m late .  there s just so much excitement .     i know .  now i want you      mandy said   you ll be watching  i suppose .   her thin  vacuously pretty face filled with envy .    never mind that .  now i want you to come inside and meet timmie and jerry .  they will be playing for the next two hours so they ll be giving you no trouble .  they ve got milk handy and plenty of toys .  in fact  it will be better if you leave them alone as much as possible .  now i ll show you where everything is located and       is it timmie that s the ape b       timmie is the stasis subject   said miss fellowes firmly .    i mean  he s the one who s not supposed to get out  is that right .     yes .  now  come in .  there isn t much time .    and when she finally left  mandy terris called after her shrilly   i hope you get a good seat and  golly  i sure hope it works .    miss fellowes did not trust herself to make a reasonable response .  she hurried on without looking back .   but the delay meant she did not get a good seat .  she got no nearer than the wall viewing plate in the assembly hall .  bitterly  she regretted that .  if she could have been on the spot  if she could somehow have reached out for some sensitive portion of the instrumentations  if she were in some way able to wreck the experiment     she found the strength to beat down her madness .  simple destruction would have done no good .  they would have rebuilt and reconstructed and made the effort again .  and she would never be allowed to return to timmie .   nothing would help .  nothing but that the experiment itself fail  that it break down irretrievably .   so she waited through the countdown  watching every move on the giant screen  scanning the faces of the technicians as the focus shifted from one to the other  watching for the look of worry and uncertainty that would mark something going unexpectedly wrong  watching  watching     there was no such look .  the count reached zero  and very quietly  very unassumingly  the experiment succeeded .   in the new stasis that had been established there stood a bearded  stoop shouldered peasant of indeterminate age  in ragged dirty clothing and wooden shoes  staring in dull horror at the sudden mad change that had flung itself over him .   and while the world went mad with jubilation  miss fellowes stood frozen in sorrow  jostled and pushed  all but trampled  surrounded by triumph while bowed down with defeat .   and when the loud speaker called her name with strident force  it sounded it three times before she responded .    miss fellowes .  miss fellowes .  you are wanted in stasis section one immediately .  miss fellowes .  miss fell       let me through .   she cried breathlessly  while the loud speaker continued its repetitions without pause .  she forced her way through the crowds with wild energy  beating at it  striking out with closed fists  flailing  moving toward the door in a nightmare slowness .   mandy terris was in tears .   i don t know how it happened .  i just went down to the edge of the corridor to watch a pocket viewing plate they had put up .  just for a minute .  and then before i could move or do anything     she cried out in sudden accusation   you said they would make no trouble  you said to leave them alone      miss fellowes  disheveled and trembling uncontrollably  glared at her .   where s timmie .    a nurse was swabbing the arm of a wailing jerry with disinfectant and another was preparing an anti tetanus shot .  there was blood on jerry s clothes .    he bit me  miss fellowes   jerry cried in rage .   he bit me .    but miss fellowes didn t even see him .    what did you do with timmie .   she cried out .    i locked him in the bathroom   said mandy .   i just threw the little monster in there and locked him in .    miss fellowes ran into the dollhouse .  she fumbled at the bathroom door .  it took an eternity to get it open and to find the ugly little boy cowering in the corner .    don t whip me  miss fellowes   he whispered .  his eyes were red .  his lips were quivering .   i didn t mean to do it .     oh  timmie  who told you about whips .   she caught him to her  hugging him wildly .   he said tremulously   she said  with a long rope .  she said you would hit me and hit me .     you won t be .  she was wicked to say so .  but what happened .  what happened .     he called me an ape boy .  he said i wasn t a real boy .  he said i was an animal .   timmie dissolved in a flood of tears .   he said he wasn t going to play with a monkey anymore .  i said i wasn t a monkey  i wasn t a monkey .   he said i was all funny looking .  he said i was horrible ugly .  he kept saying and saying and i bit him .    they were both crying now .  miss fellowes sobbed   but it isn t true .  you know that  timmie .  you re a real boy .  you re a dear real boy and the best boy in the world .  and no one  no one will ever take you away from me .    it was easy to make up her mind  now  easy to know what to do .  only it had to be done quickly .  hoskins wouldn t wait much longer  with his own son mangled     no  it would have to be done this night  this night  with the place four fifths asleep and the remaining fifth intellectually drunk over project middle ages .   it would be an unusual time for her to return but not an unheard of one .  the guard knew her well and would not dream of questioning her .  he would think nothing of her carrying a suitcase .  she rehearsed the noncommittal phrase   games for the boy   and the calm smile .   why shouldn t he believe that .   he did .  when she entered the dollhouse again  timmie was still awake  and she maintained a desperate normality to avoid frightening him .  she talked about his dreams with him and listened to him ask wistfully after jerry .   there would be few to see her afterward  none to question the bundle she would be carrying .  timmie would be very quiet and then it would be a fait accompli .  it would be done and what would be the use of trying to undo it .  they would leave her be .  they would leave them both be .   she opened the suitcase  took out the overcoat  the woolen cap with the ear flaps and the rest .   timmie said  with the beginning of alarm   why are you putting all these clothes on me  miss fellowes .    she said   i am going to take you outside  timmie .  to where your dreams are .     my dreams .   his face twisted in sudden yearning  yet fear was there  too .    you won t be afraid .  you ll be with me .  you won t be afraid if you re with me  will you  timmie .     no  miss fellowes .   he buried his little misshapen head against her side  and under her enclosing arm she could feel his small heart thud .   it was midnight and she lifted him into her arms .  she disconnected the alarm and opened the door softly .   and she screamed  for facing her across the open door was hoskins .   there were two men with him and he stared at her  as astonished as she .   miss fellowes recovered first by a second and made a quick attempt to push past him  but even with the second s delay he had time .  he caught her roughly and hurled her back against a chest of drawers .  he waved the men in and confronted her  blocking the door .    i didn t expect this .  are you completely insane .    she had managed to interpose her shoulder so that it  rather than timmie  had struck the chest .  she said pleadingly   what harm can it do if i take him  dr .  hoskins .  you can t put energy loss ahead of a human life .    firmly  hoskins took timmie out of her arms .   an energy loss this size would mean millions of dollars lost out of the pockets of investors .  it would mean a terrible setback for stasis  inc .  it would mean eventual publicity about a sentimental nurse destroying all that for the sake of an ape boy .     ape boy .   said miss fellowes  in helpless fury .    that s what the reporters would call him   said hoskins .   one of the men emerged now  looping a nylon rope through eyelets along the upper portion of the wall .   miss fellowes remembered the rope that hoskins had pulled outside the room containing professor ademewski s rock specimen so long ago .   she cried out   no .    but hoskins put timmie down and gently removed the overcoat he was wearing .   you stay here  timmie .  nothing will happen to you .  we re just going outside for a moment .  all right .    timmie  white and wordless  managed to nod .   hoskins steered miss fellowes out of the dollhouse ahead of himself .  for the moment  miss fellowes was beyond resistance .  dully  she noticed the hand pull being adjusted outside the dollhouse .    i m sorry  miss fellowes   said hoskins .   i would have spared you this .  i planned it for the night so that you would know only when it was over .    she said in a weary whisper   because your son was hurt .  because he tormented this child into striking out at him .     no .  believe me .  i understand about the incident today and i know it was jerry s fault .  but the story has leaked out .  it would have to with the press surrounding us on this day of all days .  i can t risk having a distorted story about negligence and savage neanderthalers  so called  distract from the success of project middle ages .  timmie has to go soon anyway  he might as well go now and give the sensationalists as small a peg as possible on which to hang their trash .     it s not like sending a rock back .  you ll be killing a human being .     not killing .  there ll be no sensation .  he ll simply be a neanderthal boy in a neanderthal world .  he will no longer be a prisoner and alien .  he will have a chance at a free life .     what chance .  he s only seven years old  used to being taken care of  fed  clothed  sheltered .  he will be alone .  his tribe may not be at the point where he left them now that four years have passed .  and if they were  they would not recognize him .  he will have to take care of himself .  how will he know how .    hoskins shook his head in hopeless negative .   lord  miss fellowes  do you think we haven t thought of that .  do you think we would have brought in a child if it weren t that it was the first successful fix of a human or near human we made and that we did not dare to take the chance of unfixing him and finding another fix as good .  why do you suppose we kept timmie as long as we did  if it were not for our reluctance to send a child back into the past .  it s just    his voice took on a desperate urgency     that we can wait no longer .  timmie stands in the way of expansion .  timmie is a source of possible bad publicity  we are on the threshold of great things  and i m sorry  miss fellowes  but we can t let timmie block us .  we cannot .  we cannot .  i m sorry  miss fellowes .     well  then   said miss fellowes sadly .   let me say good by .  give me five minutes to say good by .  spare me that much .    hoskins hesitated .   go ahead .    timmie ran to her .  for the last time he ran to her and for the last time miss fellowes clasped him in her arms .   for a moment  she hugged him blindly .  she caught at a chair with the toe of one foot  moved it against the wall  sat down .   don t be afraid  timmie .     i m not afraid if you re here  miss fellowes .  is that man mad at me  the man out there .     no  he isn t .  he just doesn t understand about us .     timmie  do you know what a mother is .     like jerry s mother .     did he tell you about his mother .     sometimes .  i think maybe a mother is a lady who takes care of you and who s very nice to you and who does good things .     that s right .  have you ever wanted a mother  timmie .    timmie pulled his head away from her so that he could look into her face .  slowly  he put his hand to her cheek and hair and stroked her  as long  long ago she had stroked him .  he said   aren t you my mother .     oh  timmie .     are you angry because i asked .     no .  of course not .     because i know your name is miss fellowes  but   but sometimes  i call you  mother  inside .  is that all right .     yes .  yes .  it s all right .  and i won t leave you any more and nothing will hurt you .  i ll be with you to care for you always .  call me mother  so i can hear you .     mother   said timmie contentedly  leaning his cheek against hers .   she rose  and  still holding him  stepped up on the chair .  the sudden beginning of a shout from outside went unheard and  with her free hand  she yanked with all her weight at the cord where it hung suspended between two eyelets .   and stasis was punctured and the room was empty .
