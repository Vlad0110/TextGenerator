ever since they had called him to washington and there calmly told him he was being reassigned .  the call to washington had been disturbing enough in itself .  it came without details  a mere summons  and that made it worse .  it included travel slips directing round trip by plane and that made it still worse .  partly it was the sense of urgency introduced by any order for plane travel .  partly it was the thought of the plane  simply that .  still  that was just the beginning of uneasiness and  as yet  easy to suppress .  after all  lije baley had been in a plane four times before .  once he had even crossed the continent .  so  while plane travel is never pleasant  it would  at least  not be a complete step into the unknown .  and then  the trip from new york to washington would take only an hour .  the take off would be from new york runway number    which  like all official runways  was decently enclosed  with a lock opening to the unprotected atmosphere only after air speed had been achieved .  the arrival would be at washington runway number    which was similarly protected .  furthermore  as baley well knew  there would be no windows on the plane .  there would be good lighting  decent food  all necessary conveniences .  the radio controlled flight would be smooth  there would scarcely be any sensation of motion once the plane was airborne .  he explained all this to himself  and to jessie  his wife  who had never been air borne and who approached such matters with terror .  she said     but i don   t like you to take a plane  lije .  it isn   t natural .  why can   t you take the expressways .        because that would take ten hours     baley   s long face was set in dour lines     and because i   m a member of the city police force and have to follow the orders of my superiors .  at least  i do if i want to keep my c   rating .     there was no arguing with that .   baley took the plane and kept his eyes firmly on the news strip that unreeled smoothly and continuously from the eye level dispenser .  the city was proud of that service  news  features  humorous articles  educational bits  occasional fiction .  someday the strips would be converted to film  it was said  since enclosing the eyes with a viewer would be an even more efficient way of distracting the passenger from his surroundings .  baley kept his eyes on the unreeling strip  not only for the sake of distraction  but also because etiquette required it .  there were five other passengers on the plane  he could not help noticing that much  and each one of them had his private right to whatever degree of fear and anxiety his nature and upbringing made him feel .  baley would certainly resent the intrusion of anyone else on his own uneasiness .  he wanted no strange eyes on the whiteness of his knuckles where his hands gripped the armrest  or the dampish stain they would leave when he took them away .  he told himself  i   m enclosed .  this plane is just a little city .  but he didn   t fool himself .  there was an inch of steel at his left  he could feel it with his elbow .  past that  nothing   well  air .  but that was nothing  really .  a thousand miles of it in one direction .  a thousand in another .  one mile of it  maybe two  straight down .  he almost wished he could see straight down  glimpse the top of the buried cities he was passing over  new york  philadelphia  baltimore  washington .  he imagined the rolling  low slung cluster complexes of domes he had never seen but knew to be there .  and under them  for a mile underground and dozens of miles in every direction  would be the cities .  the endless  hiving corridors of the cities  he thought  alive with people  apartments  community kitchens  factories  expressways  all comfortable and warm with the evidence of man .  and he himself was isolated in the cold and featureless air in a small bullet of metal  moving through emptiness .  his hands trembled  and he forced his eyes to focus on the strip of paper and read a bit .  it was a short story dealing with galactic exploration and it was quite obvious that the hero was an earthman .  baley muttered in exasperation  then held his breath momentarily in dismay at his boorishness in making a sound .  it was completely ridiculous  though .  it was pandering to childishness  this pretense that earthmen could invade space .  galactic exploration .  the galaxy was closed to earthmen .  it was pre empted by the spacers  whose ancestors had been earthmen centuries before .  those ancestors had reached the outer worlds first  found themselves comfortable  and their descendants had lowered the bars to immigration .  they had penned in earth and their earthman cousins .  and earth   s city civilization completed the task  imprisoning earthmen within the cities by a wall of fear of open spaces that barred them from the robot run farming and mining areas of their own planet  from even that .  baley thought bitterly  jehoshaphat .  if we don   t like it  let   s do something about it .  let   s not just waste time with fairy tales .  but there was nothing to do about it  and he knew it .  then the plane landed .  he and his fellow passengers emerged and scattered away from one another  never looking .  baley glanced at his watch and decided there was time for freshening before taking the expressway to the justice department .  he was glad there was .  the sound and clamor of life  the huge vaulted chamber of the airport with city corridors leading off on numerous levels  everything else he saw and heard  gave him the feeling of being safely and warmly enclosed in the bowels and womb of the city .  it washed away anxiety and only a shower was necessary to complete the job .  he needed a transient   s permit to make use of one of the community bathrooms  but presentation of his travel orders eliminated any difficulties .  there was only the routine stamping  with private stall privileges  the date carefully marked to prevent abuse  and a slim strip of directions for getting to the assigned spot .  baley was thankful for the feel of the strips beneath his feet .  it was with something amounting to luxury that he felt himself accelerate as he moved from strip to moving strip inward toward the speeding expressway .  he swung himself aboard lightly  taking the seat to which his rating entitled him .  it wasn   t a rush hour  seats were available .  the bathroom  when he reached it  was not unduly crowded either .  the stall assigned to him was in decent order with a launderette that worked well .  with his water ration consumed to good purpose and his clothing freshened he felt ready to tackle the justice department .  ironically enough  he even felt cheerful .  undersecretary albert minnim was a small  compact man  ruddy of skin  and graying  with the angles of his body smoothed down and softened .  he exuded an air of cleanliness and smelled faintly of tonic .  it all spoke of the good things of life that came with the liberal rations obtained by those high in administration .  baley felt sallow and rawboned in comparison .  he was conscious of his own large hands  deep set eyes  a general sense of cragginess .  minnim said cordially     sit down  baley .  do you smoke .        only a pipe  sir     said baley .  he drew it out as he spoke  and minnim thrust back a cigar he had half drawn .  baley was instantly regretful .  a cigar was better than nothing and he would have appreciated the gift .  even with the increased tobacco ration that went along with his recent promotion from c   to c   he wasn   t exactly swimming in pipe fixings .     please light up  if you care to     said minnim  and waited with a kind of paternal patience while baley measured out a careful quantity of tobacco and affixed the pipe baffle .  baley said  his eyes on his pipe     i have not been told the reason for my being called to washington  sir .        i know that     said minnim .  he smiled    i can fix that right now .  you are being reassigned temporarily .        outside new york city .        quite a distance .     baley raised his eyebrows and looked thoughtful .     how temporarily  sir .        i   m not sure .     baley was aware of the advantages and disadvantages of reassignment .  as a transient in a city of which he was not a resident  be would probably live on a scale better than his official rating entitled him to .  on the other hand  it would be very unlikely that jessie and their son  bentley  would be allowed to travel with him .  they would be taken care of  to be sure  there in new york  but baley was a domesticated creature and he did not enjoy the thought of separation .  then  too  a reassignment meant a specific job of work  which was good  and a responsibility greater than that ordinarily expected of the individual detective  which could be uncomfortable .  baley had  not too many months earlier  survived the responsibility of the investigation of the murder of a spacer just outside new york .  he was not overjoyed at the prospect of another such detail  or anything approaching it .  he said     would you tell me where i   m going .  the nature of the reassignment .  what it   s all about .     he was trying to weigh the undersecretary   s    quite a distance    and make little bets with himself as to his new base of operations .  the    quite a distance    had sounded emphatic and baley thought  calcutta .  sydney .  then he noticed that minnim was taking out a cigar after all and was lighting it carefully .  baley thought  jehoshaphat .  he   s having trouble telling me .  he doesn   t want to say .  minnim withdrew his cigar from between his lips .  he watched the smoke and said     the department of justice is assigning you to temporary duty on solaria .     for a moment baley   s mind groped for an illusive identification  solaria  asia  solaria  australia .   .   .  then he rose from his seat and said tightly     you mean  one of the outer worlds .     minnim didn   t meet baley   s eyes .     that is right .     baley said     but that   s impossible .  they wouldn   t allow an earthman on an outer world .        circumstances do alter cases  plainclothesman baley .  there has been a murder on solaria .     baley   s lips quirked into a sort of reflex smile .     that   s a little out of our jurisdiction  isn   t it .        they   ve requested help .        from us .  from earth .     baley was torn between confusion and disbelief .  for an outer world to take any attitude other than contempt toward the despised mother planet or  at best  a patronizing social benevolence was unthinkable .  to come for help .     from earth .     he repeated .     unusual     admitted minnim     but there it is .  they want a terrestrial detective assigned to the case .  it   s been handled through diplomatic channels on the highest levels .     baley sat down again .     why me .  i   m not a young man .  i   m forty three .  i   ve got a wife and child .  i couldn   t leave earth .        that   s not our choice  plainclothesman .  you were specifically asked for .        i .        plainclothesman elijah baley  c    of the new york city police force .  they knew what they wanted .  surely you see why .     baley said stubbornly     i   m not qualified .        they think you are .  the way you handled the spacer murder has apparently reached them .        they must have got it all mixed up .  it must have seemed better than it was .     minnim shrugged .     in any case  they   ve asked for you and we have agreed to send you .  you are reassigned .  the papers have all been taken care of and you must go .  during your absence  your wife and child will be taken care of at a c   level since that will be your temporary rating during your discharge of this assignment .     he paused significantly .     satisfactory completion of the assignment may make the rating permanent .     it was happening too quickly for baley .  none of this could be so .  he couldn   t leave earth .  didn   t they see that .  he heard himself ask in a level voice that sounded unnatural in his own ears .        what kind of a murder .  what are the circumstances .  why can   t they handle it themselves .     minnim rearranged small objects on his desk with carefully kept fingers .  he shook his head .     i don   t know anything about the murder .  i don   t know the circumstances .        then who does  sir .  you don   t expect me to go there cold  do you .     and again a despairing inner voice  but i can   t leave earth .     nobody knows anything about it .  nobody on earth .  the solarians didn   t tell us .  that will be your job  to find out what is so important about the murder that they must have an earthman to solve it .  or  rather  that will be part of your job .     baley was desperate enough to say     what if i refuse .     he knew the answer  of course .  he knew exactly what declassification would mean to himself and  more than that  to his family .  minnim said nothing about declassification .  he said softly     you can   t refuse  plainclothesman .  you have a job to do .        for solaria .  the hell with them .        for us  baley .  for us .     minnim paused .  then he went on     you know the position of earth with respect to the spacers .  i don   t have to go into that .     baley knew the situation and so did every man on earth .  the fifty outer worlds  with a far smaller population  in combination  than that of earth alone  nevertheless maintained a military potential perhaps a hundred times greater .  with their underpopulated worlds resting on a positronic robot economy  their energy production per human was thousands of times that of earth .  and it was the amount of energy a single human could produce that dictated military potential  standard of living  happiness  and all besides .  minnim said     one of the factors that conspires to keep us in that position is ignorance .  just that .  ignorance .  the spacers know all about us .  they send missions enough to earth  heaven knows .  we know nothing about them except what they tell us .  no man on earth has ever as much as set foot on an outer world .  you will  though .     baley began     i can   t .   .   .     but minnim repeated     you will .  your position will be unique .  you will be on solaria on their invitation  doing a job to which they will assign you .  when you return  you will have information useful to earth .     baley watched the undersecretary through somber eyes .     you mean i   m to spy for earth .        no question of spying .  you need do nothing they don   t ask you to do .  just keep your eyes and mind open .  observe .  there will be specialists on earth when you return to analyze and interpret your observations .     baley said     i take it there   s a crisis  sir .        why do you say that .        sending an earthman to an outer world is risky .  the spacers hate us .  with the best will in the world and even though i   m there on invitation  i could cause an interstellar incident .  the terrestrial government could easily avoid sending me if they chose .  they could say i was ill .  the spacers are pathologically afraid of disease .  they wouldn   t want me for any reason if they thought i were ill .        do you suggest     said minnim     we try that trick .        no .  if the government had no other motive for sending me  they would think of that or something better without my help .  so it follows that it is the question of spying that is the real essential .  and if that is so  there must be more to it than just a see what you can see to justify the risk .     baley half expected an explosion and would have half welcomed one as a relief of pressure  but minnim only smiled frostily and said     you can see past the non essentials  it seems .  but then  i expected no less .     the undersecretary leaned across his desk toward baley .     here is certain information which you will discuss with no one  not even with other government officials .  our sociologists have been coming to certain conclusions concerning the present galactic situation .  fifty outer worlds  underpopulated  roboticized  powerful  with people that are healthy and long lived .  we ourselves  crowded  technologically underdeveloped  short lived  under their domination .  it is unstable .        everything is in the long run .        this is unstable in the short run .  a hundred years is the most we   re allowed .  the situation will last our time  to be sure  but we have children .  eventually we will become too great a danger to the outer worlds to be allowed to survive .  there are eight billions on earth who hate the spacers .     baley said     the spacers exclude us from the galaxy  handle our trade to their own profit  dictate to our government  and treat us with contempt .  what do they expect .  gratitude .        true  and yet the pattern is fixed .  revolt  suppression  revolt  suppression  and within a century earth will be virtually wiped out as a populated world .  so the sociologists say .     baley stirred uneasily .  one didn   t question sociologists and their computers .     but what do you expect me to accomplish if all this is so .        bring us information .  the big flaw in sociological forecast is our lack of data concerning the spacers .  we   ve had to make assumptions on the basis of the few spacers they sent out here .  we   ve had to rely on what they choose to tell us of themselves  so it follows we know their strengths and only their strengths .  damn it  they have their robots and their low numbers and their long lives .  but do they have weaknesses .  is there some factor or factors which  if we but knew  would alter the sociologic inevitability of destruction  something that could guide our actions and better the chance of earth   s survival .        hadn   t you better send a sociologist  sir .     minnim shook his head .     if we could send whom we pleased  we would have sent someone out ten years ago  when these conclusions were first being arrived at .  this is our first excuse to send someone and they ask for a detective and that suits us .  a detective is a sociologist  too  a rule of thumb  practicing sociologist  or he wouldn   t be a good detective .  your record proves you a good one .        thank you  sir     said baley mechanically .     and if i get into trouble .     minriim shrugged .     that   s the risk of a policeman   s job .     he dismissed the point with a wave of his hand and added     in any case  you must go .  your rime of departure is set .  the ship that will take you is waiting .     baley stiffened .     waiting .  when do i leave .        in two days .        i   ve got to get back to new york then .  my wife         we will see your wife .  she can   t know the nature of your job  you know .  she will be told not to expect to hear from you .        but this is inhuman .  i must see her .  i may never see her again .     minnim said     what i say now may sound even more inhuman  but isn   t it true that there is never a day you set about your duties on which you cannot tell yourself she may never see you again .  plainclothesman baley  we must all do our duty .     baley   s pipe had been out for fifteen minutes .  he had never noticed it .   no one had more to tell him .  no one knew anything about the murder .  official after official simply hurried him on to the moment when he stood at the base of a spaceship  all unbelieving still .  it was like a gigantic cannon aimed at the heavens  and baley shivered spasmodically in the raw  open air .  the night closed in  for which baley was thankful  like dark black walls melting into a black ceiling overhead .  it was cloudy  and though he had been to planetaria  a bright star  stabbing through a rift in the cloud  startled him when it caught his eyes .  a little spark  far  far away .  he stared curiously  almost unafraid of it .  it looked quite close  quite insignificant  and yet around things like that circled planets of which the inhabitants were lords of the galaxy .  the sun was a thing like that  he thought  except much closer  shining now on the other side of the earth .  he thought of the earth suddenly as a ball of stone with a film of moisture and gas  exposed to emptiness on every side  with its cities barely dug into the outer rim  clinging precariously between rock and air .  his skin crawled .  the ship was a spacer vessel  of course .  interstellar trade was entirely in spacer hands .  he was alone now  just outside the rim of the city .  he had been bathed and scraped and sterilized until he was considered safe  by spacer standards  to board the ship .  even so  they sent only a robot out to meet him  bearing as he did a hundred varieties of disease germs from the sweltering city to which he himself was resistant but to which the eugenically hot housed spacers were not .  the robot bulked dimly in the night  its eyes a dull red glow .     plainclothesman elijah baley .        that   s right     said baley crisply  the hair on the nape of his neck stirring a bit .  he was enough of an earthman to get angry goose flesh at the sight of a robot doing a man   s job .  there had been r .  daneel olivaw  who had partnered with him in the spacer murder affair  but that had been different .  daneel had been      you will follow me  please     said the robot  and a white light flooded a path toward the ship .  baley followed .  up the ladder and into the ship he went  along corridors  and into a room .  the robot said     this will be your room  plainclothesman baley .  it is requested that you remain in it for the duration of the trip .     baley thought  sure  seal me off .  keep me safe .  insulated .  the corridors along which he had traveled had been empty .  robots were probably disinfecting them now .  the robot facing him would probably step through a germicidal bath when it left .  the robot said     there is a water supply and plumbing .  food will be supplied .  you will have viewing matter .  the ports are controlled from this panel .  they are closed now but if you wish to view space      baley said with some agitation     that   s all right  boy .  leave the ports closed .     he used the    boy    address that earthmen always used for robots  but the robot showed no adverse response .  it couldn   t  of course .  its responses were limited and controlled by the laws of robotics .  the robot bent its large metal body in the travesty of a respectful bow and left .  baley was alone in his room and could take stock .  it was better than the plane  at least .  he could see the plane from end to end .  he could see its limits .  the spaceship was large .  it had corridors  levels  rooms .  it was a small city in itself .  baley could almost breathe freely .  then lights flashed and a robot   s metallic voice sounded over the communo and gave him specific instructions for guarding himself against take off acceleration .  there was the push backward against webbing and a yielding hydraulic system  a distant rumble of force jets heated to fury by the proton micro pile .  there was the hiss of tearing atmosphere  growing thinner and high pitched and fading into nothingness after an hour .  they were in space .   it was as though all sensation had numbed  as though nothing were real .  he told himself that each second found him thousands of miles farther from the cities  from jessie  but it didn   t register .  on the second day  the third .   there was no way of telling time except by the intervals of eating and sleeping  there was a queer momentary sensation of being turned inside out .  it lasted an instant and baley knew it was a jump  that oddly incomprehensible  almost mystical  momentary transition through hyperspace that transferred a ship and all it contained from one point in space to another  light years away .  another lapse of time and another jump  still another lapse  still another jump .  baley told himself now that he was light years away  tens of light years  hundreds  thousands .  he didn   t know how many .  no one on earth as much as knew solaria   s location in space .  he would bet on that .  they were ignorant  every one of them .  he felt terribly alone .   there was the feel of deceleration and the robot entered .  its somber  ruddy eyes took in the details of baley   s harness .  efficiently it tightened a wing nut  quickly it surveyed the details of the hydraulic system .  it said     we will be landing in three hours .  you will remain  if you please  in this room .  a man will come to escort you out and to take you to your place of residence .        wait     said baley tensely .  strapped in as he was  he felt helpless .     when we land  what time of day will it be .     the robot said at once     by galactic standard time  it will be         local time  boy .  local time .  jehoshaphat .     the robot continued smoothly     the day on solaria is twenty eight point thirty five standard hours in length .  the solarian hour is divided into ten decades  each of which is divided into a hundred centads .  we are scheduled to arrive at an airport at which the day will be at the twentieth centad of the fifth decad .     baley hated that robot .  he hated it for its obtuseness in not understanding  for the way it was making him ask the question directly and exposing his own weakness .  he had to .  he said flatly     will it be daytime .     and after all that the robot answered     yes  sir     and left .  it would be day .  he would have to step out onto the unprotected surface of a planet in daytime .  he was not quite sure how it would be .  he had seen glimpses of planetary surfaces from certain points within the city  he had even been out upon it for moments .  always  though  he had been surrounded by walls or within reach of one .  there was always safety at hand .  where would there be safety now .  not even the false walls of darkness .  and because he would not display weakness before the spacers   he   d be damned if he would  he stiffened his body against the webbing that held him safe against the forces of deceleration  closed his eyes  and stubbornly fought panic .     a friend is encountered  baley was losing his fight .  reason alone was not enough .  baley told himself over and over  men live in the open all their lives .  the spacers do so now .  our ancestors on earth did it in the past .  there is no real harm in walllessness .  it is only my mind that tells me differently  and it is wrong .  but all that did not help .  something above and beyond reason cried out for walls and would have none of space .  as time passed  he thought he would not succeed .  he would be cowering at the end  trembling and pitiful .  the spacer they would send for him  with filters in his nose to keep out germs  and gloves on his hands to prevent contact  would not even honestly despise him .  the spacer would feel only disgust .  baley held on grimly .  when the ship stopped and the deceleration harness automatically uncoupled  while the hydraulic system retracted into the wall  baley remained in his seat .  he was afraid  and determined not to show it .  he looked away at the first quiet sound of the door of his room opening .  there was the eye corner flash of a tall  bronze haired figure entering  a spacer  one of those proud descendants of earth who had disowned their heritage .  the spacer spoke .     partner elijah .     baley   s head turned toward the speaker with a jerk .  his eyes rounded and he rose almost without volition .  he stared at the face  at the broad  high cheekbones  the absolute calm of the facial lines  the symmetry of the body  most of all at that level look out of nerveless blue eyes .     d daneel .     the spacer said     it is pleasant that you remember me  partner elijah .        remember you .     baley felt relief wash over him .  this being was a bit of earth  a friend  a comfort  a savior .  he had an almost unbearable desire to rush to the spacer and embrace him  to hug him wildly  and laugh and pound his back and do all the foolish things old friends did when meeting once again after a separation .  but he didn   t .  he couldn   t .  he could only step forward  and hold out his hand and say     i   m not likely to forget you  daneel .        that is pleasant     said daneel  nodding gravely .     as you are well aware  it is quite impossible for me  while in working order  to forget you .  it is well that i see you again .     daneel took baley   s hand and pressed it with firm coolness  his fingers closing to a comfortable but not painful pressure and then releasing it .  baley hoped earnestly that the creature   s unreadable eyes could not penetrate baley   s mind and see that wild moment  just past and not yet entirely subsided  when all of baley had concentrated into a feeling of an intense friendship that was almost love .  after all  one could not love as a friend this daneel olivaw  who was not a man at all  but only a robot .   the robot that looked so like a man said     i have asked that a robot driven ground transport vessel be connected to this ship by air     baley frowned .     an air tube .        yes .  it is a common technique  frequently used in space  in order that personnel and materiel be transferred from one vessel to another without the necessity of special equipment against vacuum .  it would seem then that you are not acquainted with the technique .        no     said baley     but i get the picture .        it is  of course  rather complicated to arrange such a device between spaceship and ground vehicle  but i have requested that it be done .  fortunately  the mission on which you and i are engaged is one of high priority .  difficulties are smoothed out quickly .        are you assigned to the murder case too .        have you not been informed of that .  i regret not having told you at once .     there was  of course  no sign of regret on the robot   s perfect face .     it was dr .  han fastolfe  whom you met on earth during our previous partnership  . and whom i hope you remember  who first suggested you as an appropriate investigator in this case .  he made it a condition that i be assigned to work with you once more .     baley managed a smile .  dr .  fastolfe was a native of aurora and aurora was the strongest of the outer worlds .  apparently the advice of an auroran bore weight .  baley said     a team that works shouldn   t be broken up  eh .      the first exhilaration of daneel   s appearance was fading and the compression about baley   s chest was returning .      i do not know if that precise thought was in his mind  partner elijah .  from the nature of his orders to me  i should think that he was interested in having assigned to work with you one who would have experience with your world and would know of your consequent peculiarities .        peculiarities .     ba ey frowned and felt offended .  it was not a term he liked in connection with himself .     so that i could arrange the air tube  for example .  i am well aware of your aversion to open spaces as a result of your upbringing in the cities of earth .     perhaps it was the effect of being called    peculiar     the feeling that he had to counterattack or lose caste to a machine  that drove baley to change the subject sharply .  perhaps it was just that lifelong training prevented him from leaving any logical contradiction undisturbed .  he said     there was a robot in charge of my welfare on hoard this ship  a robot     a touch of malice intruded itself here     that looks like a robot .  do you know it .        i spoke to it before coming on board .        what   s its designation .  how do i make contact with it .        it is rx      .  it is customary on solaria to use only serial numbers for robots .     daneel   s calm eyes swept the control panel near the door .     this contact will signal it .     baley looked at the control panel himself and  since the contact to which daneel pointed was labeled rx  its identification seemed quite unmysterious .  baley put his finger over it and in less than a minute  the robot  the one that looked like a robot  entered .  baley said     you are rx      .        yes  sir .        you told me earlier that someone would arrive to escort me off the ship .  did you mean him .     baley pointed at daneel .  the eyes of the two robots met .  rx      said     his papers identify him as the one who was to meet you .        were you told in advance anything about him other than his papers .  was he described to you .        no  sir .  i was given his name  however .        who gave you the information .        the captain of the ship  sir .        who is a solarian .        yes  sir .     baley licked his lips .  the next question would be decisive .  he said     what were you told would be the name of the one you were expecting .     rx      said     daneel olivaw  sir .        good boy .  you may leave now .     there was the robotic bow and then the sharp about face .  rx      left .  baley turned to his partner and said thoughtfully     you are not telling me all the truth  daneel .        in what way  partner elijah .     asked daneel .     while i was talking to you earlier  i recalled an odd point .  rx       when it told me i would have an escort said a man would come for me .  i remember that quite well .     daneel listened quietly and said nothing .  baley went on .     i thought the robot might have made a mistake .  i thought also that perhaps a man had indeed been assigned to meet me and had later been replaced by you  rx      not being informed of the change .  but you heard me check that .  your papers were described to it and it was given your name .  but it was not quite given your name at that  was it  daneel .        indeed  it was not given my entire name     agreed daneel .     your name is not daneel olivaw  but r .  daneel olivaw  isn   t it .  or  in full  robot daneel olivaw .        you are quite correct  partner elijah .        from which it all follows that rx      was never informed that you are a robot .  it was allowed to think of you as a man .  with your manlike appearance  such a masquerade is possible     i have no quarrel with your reasoning .        then let   s proceed .     baley was feeling the germs of a kind of savage delight .  he was on the trace of something .  it couldn   t be anything much  but this was the kind of tracking he could do well .  it was something he could do well enough to be called half across space to do .  he said     now why should anyone want to deceive a miserable robot .  it doesn   t matter to it whether you are man or robot .  it follows orders in either case .  a reasonable conclusion then is that the solarian captain who informed the robot and the solarian officials who informed the captain did not themselves know you were a robot .  as i say  that is one reasonable conclusion  but perhaps not the only one .  is this one true .        i believe it is .        all right  then .  good guess .  now why .  dr .  han fastolfe  in recommending you as my partner allows the solarians to think you are a human .  isn   t that a dangerous thing .  the solarians  if they find out  may be quite angry .  why was it done .     the humanoid robot said     it was explained to me thus  partner elijah .  your association with a human of the outer worlds would raise your status in the eyes of the solarians .  your association with a robot would lower it .  since i was familiar with your ways and could work with you easily  it was thought reasonable to allow the solarians to accept me as a man without actually deceiving them by a positive statement to that effect .     baley did not believe it .  it seemed like the kind of careful consideration for an earthman   s feelings that did not come naturally to a spacer  not even to as enlightened a one as fastolfe .  he considered an alternative and said     are the solarians well known among the outer worlds for the production of robots .        i am glad     said daneel     that you have been briefed concerning the inner economy of solaria .        not a word     said baley .     i can guess the spelling of the word solaria and there my knowledge stops .        then i do not see  partner elijah  what it was that impelled you to ask that question  but it is a most pertinent one .  you have hit the mark .  my mind store of information includes the fact that  of the fifty outer worlds  solaria is by far the best known for the variety and excellence of robot models it turns out .  it exports specialized models to all the other outer worlds .     baley nodded in grim satisfaction .  naturally daneel did not follow an intuitive mental leap that used human weakness as a starting point .  nor did baley feel impelled to explain the reasoning .  if solaria turned out to be a world expert in robotics  dr .  han fastolfe and his associates might have purely personal and very human motives for demonstrating their own prize robot .  it would have nothing at all to do with an earthman   s safety or feelings .  they would be asserting their own superiority by allowing the expert solarians to be fooled into accepting a robot of auroran handiwork as a fellow man .  baley felt much better .  strange that all the thought  all the intellectual powers he could muster  could not succeed in lifting him out of panic  and yet a sop to his own vainglory succeeded at once .  the recognition of the vainglory of the spacers helped too .  he thought  jehoshaphat  we   re all human  even the spacers .  aloud he said  almost flippantly     how long do we have to wait for the ground car .  i   m ready .      the air tube gave signs of not being well adapted to its present use .  man and humanoid stepped out of the spaceship erect  moving along flexible mesh that bent and swayed under their weight .   in space  baley imagined hazily  men transferring weightlessly from ship to ship might easily skim along the length of the tube  impelled by an initial jump .   toward the other end the tube narrowed clumsily  its meshing bunching as though some giant hand had constricted it .  daneel  carrying the flashlight  got down on all fours and so did baley .  they traveled the last twenty feet in that fashion  moving at last into what was obviously a ground car .  daneel closed the door through which they had entered  sliding it shut carefully .  there was a heavy  clicking noise that might have been the detachment of the air tube .  baley looked about curiously .  there was nothing too exotic about the ground car .  there were two seats in tandem  each of which could hold three .  there were doors at each end of each seat .  the glossy sections that might ordinarily have been windows were black and opaque  as a result  undoubtedly  of appropriate polarization .  baley was acquainted with that .  the interior of the car was lit by two round spots of yellow illumination in the ceiling and  in short  the only thing baley felt to be strange was the transmitter set into the partition immediately before the front seat and  of course  the added fact that there were no visible controls .  baley said     i suppose the driver is on the other side of this partition .     daneel said     exactly so  partner elijah .  and we can give our orders in this fashion .     he leaned forward slightly and flicked a toggle switch that set a spot of red light to flickering .  he said quietly     you may start now .  we are ready .     there was a muted whir that faded almost at once  a very slight  very transitory pressing against the back of the seat  and then nothing .  baley said in surprise     are we moving .     daneel said     we are .  the car does not move on wheels but glides along a diamagnetic force field .  except for acceleration and deceleration  you will feel nothing .        what about curves .        the car will bank automatically to compensate .  its level is maintained when traveling up   or downhill .        the controls must be complicated     said baley dryly .     quite automatic .  the driver of the vehicle is a robot .        umm .     baley had about all he wanted on the ground car .  he said     how long will this take .        about an hour .  air travel would have been speedier  but i was concerned to keep you enclosed and the aircraft models available on solaria do not lend themselves to complete enclosure as does a ground car such as that in which we are now riding .     baley felt annoyed at the other   s    concern .     he felt like a baby in the charge of its nurse .  he felt almost as annoyed  oddly enough  at daneel   s sentences .  it seemed to him that such needlessly formal sentence structure might easily betray the robotic nature of the creature .  for a moment baley stared curiously at r .  daneel olivaw .  the robot  looking straight ahead  was motionless and unself conscious under the other   s gaze .  daneel   s skin texture was perfect  the individual hairs on head and body had been lovingly and intricately manufactured and placed .  the muscle movement under the skin was most realistic .  no pains  however extravagant  had been spared .  yet baley knew  from personal knowledge  that limbs and chest could be split open along invisible seams so that repairs might be made .  he knew there was metal and silicone under that realistic skin .  he knew a positronic brain  most advanced but only positronic  nestled in the hollow of the skull .  he knew that daneel   s    thoughts    were only short lived positronic currents flowing along paths rigidly designed and foreordained by the manufacturer .  but what were the signs that would give that away to the expert eye that had no foreknowledge .  the trifling unnaturalness of daneel   s manner of speech .  the unemotional gravity that rested so steadily upon him .  the very perfection of his humanity .  but he was wasting time .  baley said     let   s get on with it  daneel .  i suppose that before arriving here  you were briefed on matters solarian .        i was  partner elijah .        good .  that   s more than they did for me .  how large is the world .        its diameter is      miles .  it is the outermost of three planets and the only inhabited one .  in climate and atmosphere it resembles earth  its percentage of fertile land is higher  its useful mineral content lower  but of course less exploited .  the world is self supporting and can  with the aid of its robot exports  maintain a high standard of living .     baley said     what   s the population .        twenty thousand people  partner elijah .     baley accepted that for a moment  then he said mildly     you mean twenty million  don   t you .     his scant knowledge of the outer worlds was enough to tell him that  although the worlds were underpopulated by earthly standards  the individual populations were in the millions .     twenty thousand people  partner elijah     said the robot again .     you mean the planet has just been settled .        not at all .  it has been independent for nearly two centuries  and it was settled for a century or more before that .  the population is deliberately maintained at twenty thousand  that being considered optimum by the solarians themselves .        how much of the planet do they occupy .        all the fertile portions .        which is  in square miles .        thirty million square miles  including marginal areas .        for twenty thousand people .        there are also some two hundred million working positronic robots  partner elijah .        jehoshaphat .  that   s  that   s ten thousand robots per human .        it is by far the highest such ratio among the outer worlds  partner elijah .  the next highest  on aurora  is only fifty to one .        what can they use so many robots for .  what do they want with all that food .        food is a relatively minor item .  the mines are more important  and power production more important still .     baley thought of all those robots and felt a trifle dizzy .  two hundred million robots .  so many among so few humans .  the robots must litter the landscape .  an observer from without might think solaria a world of robots altogether and fail to notice the thin human leaven .  he felt a sudden need to see .  he remembered the conversation with minnim and the sociologic prediction of earth   s danger .  it seemed far off  a bit unreal  but he remembered .  his personal dangers and difficulties since leaving earth dimmed the memory of minim   s voice stating enormities with cool and precise enunciation  but never blotted it out altogether .  baley had lived too long with duty to allow even the overwhelming fact of open space to stop him in its performance .  data collected from a spacer   s words  or from those of a spacer robot for that matter  was the sort of thing that was already available to earth   s sociologists .  what was needed was direct observation and it was his job  however unpleasant  to collect it .  he inspected the upper portion of the ground car .     is this thing a convertible  daneel .        i beg your pardon  partner elijah  but i do not follow your meaning .        can the car   s top be pushed back .  can it be made open to the   the sky .      he had almost said    dome    out of habit .      yes  it can .        then have that done  daneel .  i would like to take a look .     the robot responded gravely     i am sorry  but i cannot allow that .     baley felt astonished .  .  he said     look  r .  daneel     he stressed the r .   .     let   s rephrase that .  i order you to lower the top .     the creature was a robot  manlike or not .  it had to follow orders .  but daneel did not move .  he said     i must explain that it is my first concern to spare you harm .  it has been clear to me on the basis both of my instructions and of my own personal experience that you would suffer harm at finding yourself in large  empty spaces .  i cannot  therefore  allow you to expose yourself to that .     baley could feel his face darkening with an influx of blood and at the same time could feel the complete uselessness of anger .  the creature was a robot  and baley knew the first law of robotics well .  it went  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .  everything else in a robot   s positronic brain  that of any robot on any world in the galaxy  had to bow to that prime consideration .  of course a robot had to follow orders  but with one major  all important qualification .  following orders was only the second law of robotics .  it went  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .  baley forced himself to speak quietly and reasonably .     i think i can endure it for a short time  daneel .        that is not my feeling  partner elijah .        let me be the judge  daneel .        if that is an order  partner elijah  i cannot follow it .     baley let himself lounge back against the softly upholstered seat .  the robot would  of course  be quite beyond the reach of force .  daneel   s strength  if exerted fully  would be a hundred times that of flesh and blood .  he would be perfectly capable of restraining baley without ever hurting him .  baley was armed .  he could point a blaster at daneel  but  except for perhaps a momentary sensation of mastery  that action would only succeed in greater frustration .  a threat of destruction was useless against a robot .  self preservation was only the third law .  it went  a robot must protect its own existence  as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .  it would not trouble daneel to be destroyed if the alternative were breaking the first law .  and baley did not wish  to destroy daneel .  definitely not .  yet he did want to see out the car .  it was becoming an obsession with him .  he couldn   t allow this nurse infant relationship to build up .  for a moment he thought of pointing the blaster at his own temple .  open the car top or i   ll kill myself .  oppose one application of the first law by a greater and more immediate one .  baley knew he couldn   t do it .  too undignified .  he disliked the picture conjured up by the thought .  he said wearily     would you ask the driver how close in miles we are to destination .        certainly  partner elijah .     daneel bent forward and pushed the toggle switch .  but as he did so  baley leaned forward too  crying out     driver .  lower the top of the car .     and it was the human hand that moved quickly to the toggle switch and closed it again .  the human hand held its place firmly thereafter .  panting a bit  baley stared at daneel .  for a second daneel was motionless  as though his positronic paths were momentarily out of stability in their effort to adjust to the new situation .  but that passed quickly and then the robot   s hand was moving .  baley had anticipated that .  daneel would remove the human hand from the switch  gently  not hurting it   reactivate the transmitter  and countermand the order .  baley said     you won   t get my hand away without hurting me .  i warn you .  you will probably have to break my finger .     that was not so .  baley knew that .  but daneel   s movements stopped .  harm against harm .  the positronic brain had to weigh probabilities and translate them into opposing potentials .  it meant just a bit more hesitation .  baley said     it   s too late .     his race was won .  the top was sliding back and pouring into the car  flow open  was the harsh white light of solaria   s sun .  baley wanted to shut his eyes in initial terror  but fought the sensation .  he faced the enormous wash of blue and green  incredible quantities of it .  he could feel the undisciplined rush of air against his face  but could make out no details of anything .  a moving something flashed past .  it might have been a robot or an animal or an unliving something caught in a puff of air .  he couldn   t tell .  the car went past it too quickly .  blue  green  air  noise  motion  and over it all  beating down  furiously  relentlessly  frighteningly  was the white light that came from a ball in the sky .  for one fleeting split moment he bent his head back and stared directly at solaria   s sun .  he stared at it  unprotected by the diffusing glass of the cities    uppermost level sun porches .  he stared at the naked sun .  and at the very moment he felt daneel   s hands clamping down upon his shoulders .  his mind crowded with thought during that unreal  whirling moment .  he had to see .  he had to see all he could .  and daneel must be there with him to keep him from seeing .  but surely a robot would not dare use violence on a man .  that thought was dominant .  daneel could not prevent him forcibly  and yet baley felt the robot   s hands forcing him down .  baley lifted his arms to force those fleshless hands away and lost all sensation .     a victim is named  baley was back in the safety of enclosure .  daneel   s face wavered before his eyes  and it was splotched with dark spots that turned to red when he blinked .  baley said     what happened .        i regret     said daneel     that you have suffered harm despite my presence .  the direct rays of the sun are damaging to the human eye  but i believe that the damage from the short exposure you suffered will not be permanent .  when you looked up  i was forced to pull you down and you lost consciousness .     baley grimaced .  that left the question open as to whether he had fainted out of over excitement  or fright .   or had been knocked unconscious .  he felt his jaw and head and found no pain .  he forbore asking the question direct .  in a way he didn   t want to know .  he said     it wasn   t so bad .        from your reactions  partner elijah  i should judge you had found it unpleasant .        not at all     said baley stubbornly .  the splotches before his eyes were fading and they weren   t tearing so .     i   m only sorry i saw so little .  we were moving too fast .  did we pass a robot .        we passed a number of them .  we are traveling across the kinbald estate  which is given over to fruit orchards .        i   ll have to try again     said baley .     you must not  in my presence     said daneel .     meanwhile  i have done as you requested .        as i requested .        you will remember  partner elijah  that before you ordered the driver to lower the top of the car  you had ordered me to ask the driver how close in miles we were to destination .  we are ten miles away now and shall be there in some six minutes .     baley felt the impulse to ask daneel if he were angry at having been outwitted if only to see that perfect face become imperfect  but he repressed it .  of course daneel would simply answer no  without rancor or annoyance .  he would sit there as calm and as grave as ever  unperturbed and imperturbable .  baley said quietly     just the same  daneel  i   ll have to get used to it  you know .     the robot regarded his human partner .     to what is it that you refer .        jehoshaphat .  to the  the outdoors .  it   s all this planet is made of .        there will be no necessity for facing the outdoors     said daneel .  then  as though that disposed of the subject  he said     we are slowing down  partner elijah .  i believe we have arrived .  it will be necessary to wait now for the connection of another air tube leading to the dwelling that will serve as our base of operations .        an air tube is unnecessary  daneel .  if i am to be working outdoors  there is no point in delaying the indoctrination .        there will be no reason for you to work outdoors  partner elijah .     the robot started to say more  but baley waved him quiet with a peremptory motion of the hand .  at the moment he was not in the mood for daneel   s careful consolations  for soothings  for assurances that all would be well and that he would be taken care of .  what he really wanted was an inner knowledge that he could take care of himself and fulfill his assignment .  the sight and feel of the open had been hard to take .  it might be that when the time came he would lack the hardihood to dare face it again  at the cost of his self respect and  conceivably  of earth   s safety .  all over a small matter of emptiness .  his face grew grim even at the glancing touch of that thought .  he would face air  sun  and empty space yet .   elijah baley felt like an inhabitant of one of the smaller cities  say helsinki  visiting new york and counting the levels in awe .  he had thought of a    dwelling    as something like an apartment unit  but this was nothing like it at all .  he passed from room to room endlessly .  panoramic windows were shrouded closely  allowing no hint of disturbing day to enter .  lights came to life noiselessly from hidden sources as they stepped into a room and died again as quietly when they left .     so many rooms     said baley with wonder .     so many .  it   s like a very tiny city  daneel .        it would seem so  partner elijah     said daneel with equanimity .  it seemed strange to the earthman .  why was it necessary to crowd so many spacers together with him in close quarters .  he said     how many will be living here with me .     daneel said     there will be myself  of course  and a number of robots .     baley thought  he ought to have said  a number of other robots .  again he found it obvious that daneel had the intention of playing the man thoroughly even for no other audience than baley  who knew the truth so well .  and then that thought popped into nothing under the force of a second  more urgent one .  he cried     robots .  how many humans .        none  partner elijah .     they had just stepped into a room  crowded from floor to ceiling with book films .  three fixed viewers with large twenty four inch viewing panels set vertically were in three corners of the room .  the fourth contained an animation screen .  baley looked about in annoyance .  he said     did they kick everyone out just to leave me rattling around alone in this mausoleum .        it is meant only for you .  a dwelling such as this for one person is customary on solaria .        everyone lives like this .        everyone .        what do they need all the rooms for .        it is customary to devote a single room to a single purpose .  this is the library .  there is also a music room  a gymnasium  a kitchen  a bakery  a dining room  a machine shop  various robot repair and testing rooms  two bedrooms         stop .  how do you know all this .        it is part of the information pattern     said daneel smoothly     made available to me before i left aurora .        jehoshaphat .  who takes care of all of this .     he swung his arm in a wide arc .     there are a number of household robots .  they have been assigned to you and will see to it that you are comfortable .        but i don   t need all this     said baley .  he had the urge to sit down and refuse to budge .  he wanted to see no more rooms .     we can remain in one room if you so desire  partner elijah .  that was visualized as a possibility from the start .  nevertheless  solarian customs being what they are  it was considered wiser to allow this house to be built         built .     baley stared .     you mean this was built for me .  all this .  specially .        a thoroughly roboticized economy         yes  i see what you   re going to say .  what will they do with the house when all this is over .        i believe they will tear it down .     baley   s lips clamped together .  of course .  tear it down .  build a tremendous structure for the special use of one earthman and then tear down everything he touched .  sterilize the soil the house stood on .  fumigate the air he breathed .  the spacers might seem strong  but they  too  had their foolish fears .  daneel seemed to read his thoughts  or to interpret his expression at any rate .  he said     it may appear to you  partner elijah  that it is to escape contagion that they will destroy the house .  if such are your thoughts  i suggest that you refrain from making yourself uncomfortable over the matter .  the fear of disease on the part of spacers is by no means so extreme .  it is just that the effort involved in building the house is  to them  very little .  nor does the waste involved in tearing it down once more seem great to them .     and by law  partner elijah  this place cannot be allowed to remain standing .  it is on the estate of hannis gruer and there can only be one legal dwelling place on any estate  that of the owner .  this house was built by special dispensation  for a specific purpose .  it is meant to house us for a specific length of time  till our mission is completed .        and who is hannis gruer .     asked baley .     the head of solarian security .  we are to see him on arrival .        are we .  jehoshaphat  daneel  when do i begin to learn anything at all about anything .  i   m working in a vacuum and i don   t like it .  i might as well go back to earth .  i might as well      he felt himself working up into resentment and cut himself short .  daneel never wavered .  he merely waited his chance to speak .  he said     i regret the fact that you are annoyed .  my general knowledge of solaria does seem to be greater than yours .  my knowledge of the murder case itself is as limited as is your own .  it is agent gruer who will tell us what we must know .  the solarian government has arranged this .        well  then  let   s get to this gruer .  how long a trip will it be .     baley winced at the thought of more travel and the familiar constriction in his chest was making itself felt again .  daneel said     no travel is necessary  partner elijah .  agent gruer will be waiting for us in the conversation room .        a room for conversation  too .     baley murmured wryly .  then  in a louder voice     waiting for us now .        i believe so .        then let   s get to him  daneel .     hannis gruer was bald  and that without qualification .  there was not even a fringe of hair at the sides of his skull .  it was completely naked .  baley swallowed and tried  out of politeness  to keep his eyes off that skull  but couldn   t .  on earth there was the continuous acceptance of spacers at the spacers    own evaluation  the spacers were the unquestioned lords of the galaxy  they were tall  bronze of skin and hair  handsome  large  cool  aristocratic .  in short  they were all r .  daneel olivaw was  but with the fact of humanity in addition .  and the spacers who were sent to earth often did look like that  perhaps were deliberately chosen for that reason .  but here was a spacer who might have been an earthman for all his appearance .  he was bald .  and his nose was misshapen  too .  not much  to be sure  but on a spacer even a slight asymmetry was noteworthy .  baley said     good afternoon  sir .  i am sorry if we kept you waiting .     no harm in politeness .  he would have to work with these people .  he had the momentary urge to step across the expanse of room  how ridiculously large  and offer his hand in greeting .  it was an urge easy to fight off .  a spacer certainly would not welcome such a greeting  a hand covered with earthly germs .  gruer sat gravely  as far away from baley as he could get  his hands resting within long sleeves  and probably there were filters in his nostrils  although baley couldn   t see them .  it even seemed to him that gruer cast a disapproving look at daneel as though to say  you   re a queer spacer  standing that close to an earthman .  that would mean gruer simply did not know the truth .  then baley noticed suddenly that daneel was standing at some distance  at that  farther than he usually did .  of course .  too close  and gruer might find the proximity unbelievable .  daneel was intent on being accepted as human .  gruer spoke in a pleasant  friendly voice  but his eyes tended to remain furtively on daneel  looking away  then drifting back .  he said     i haven   t been waiting long .  welcome to solaria  gentlemen .  are you comfortable .        yes  sir .  quite     said baley .  he wondered if etiquette would require that daneel as the    spacer    should speak for the two  but rejected that possibility resentfully .  jehoshaphat .  it was he  himself  who had been requested for the investigation and daneel had been added afterward .  under the circumstances baley felt he would not play the secondary to a genuine spacer  it was out of the question when a robot was involved  even such a robot as daneel .  but daneel made no attempt to take precedence over baley  nor did gruer seem surprised or displeased at that .  instead  he turned his attention at once to baley to the exclusion of daneel .  gruer said     you have been told nothing  plainclothesman baley  about the crime for which your services have been solicited .  i imagine you are quite curious about that .     he shook his arms so that the sleeves fell backward and clasped his hands loosely in his lap .     won   t you gentlemen sit down .     they did so and baley said     we are curious .     he noted that gruer   s hands were not protected by gloves .  gruer went on .     that was on purpose  plainclothesman .  we wanted you to arrive here prepared to tackle the problem with a fresh mind .  we wanted no preconceived notions .  you will have available to you shortly a full report of the details of the crime and of the investigations we have been able to conduct .  i am afraid  plainclothesman  that you will find our investigations ridiculously incomplete from the standpoint of your own experience .  we have no police force on solaria .        none at all .     asked baley .  gruer smiled and shrugged .     no crime  you see .  our population is tiny and widely scattered .  there is no occasion    for crime  therefore no occasion for police .        i see .  but for all that  you do have crime now .        true  but the first crime of violence in two centuries of history .        unfortunate  then  that you must begin with murder .        unfortunate  yes .  more unfortunately still  the victim was a man we could scarcely afford to lose .  a most inappropriate victim .  and the circumstances of the murder were particularly brutal .     baley said     i suppose the murderer is completely unknown .      why else would the crime be worth the importation of an earthly detective .   gruer looked particularly uneasy .  he glanced sideways at daneel  who sat motionless  an absorptive  quiet mechanism .  baley knew that daneel would  at any time in the future  be able to reproduce any conversation he heard  of whatever length .  he was a recording machine that walked and talked like a man .  did gruer know that .  his look at daneel had certainly something of the furtive about it .  gruer said     no  i cannot say the murderer is completely unknown .  in fact  there is only one person that can possibly have done the deed .        are you sure you don   t mean only one person who is likely to have done the deed .     baley distrusted overstatement and had no liking for the armchair deducer who discovered certainty rather than probability in the workings of logic .  but gruer shook his bald head .     no .  only one possible person .  anyone else is impossible .  completely impossible .        completely .        i assure you .        then you have no problem .        on the contrary .  we do have a problem .  that one person couldn   t have done it either .     baley said calmly     then no one did it .        yet the deed was done .  rikaine delmarre is dead .     that   s something  thought baley .  jehoshaphat  i   ve got something .  i   ve got the victim   s name .  he brought out his notebook and solemnly made note of it  partly out of a wry desire to indicate that he had scraped up  at last  a nubbin of fact  and partly to avoid making it too obvious that he sat by the side of a recording machine who needed no notes .  he said     how is the victim   s name spelled .     gruer spelled it .     his profession  sir .        fetologist .     baley spelled that as it sounded and let it go .  he said     now who would be able to give me a personal account of the circumstances surrounding the murder .  as firsthand as possible .     gruer   s smile was grim and his eyes shifted to daneel again  and then away .     his wife  plainclothesman .        his wife  .   .   .     yes .  her name is gladia .     gruer pronounced it in three syllables  accenting the second .     any children .     baley   s eyes were fixed on his notebook .  when no answer came  he looked up .     any children .     but gruer   s mouth had pursed up as though he had tasted something sour .  he looked sick .  finally he said     i would scarcely know .     baley said     what .     gruer added hastily     in any case  i think you had better postpone actual operations till tomorrow .  i know you   ve had a hard trip  mr .  baley  and that you are tired and probably hungry .     baley  about to deny it  realized suddenly that the thought of food had an uncommon attraction for him at the moment .  he said     will you join us at our meal .     he didn   t think gruer would  being a spacer .   yet he had been brought to the point of saying    mr .  baley    rather than    plainclothesman baley     which was something .   as expected  gruer said     a business engagement makes that impossible .  i will have to leave .  i am sorry .     baley rose .  the polite thing would be to accompany gruer to the door .  in the first place  however  he wasn   t at all anxious to approach the door and the unprotected open .  and in the second he wasn   t sure where the door was .  he remained standing in uncertainty .  cruet smiled and nodded .  he said     i will see you again .  your robots will know the combination if you wish to talk to me .     and he was gone .  baley exclaimed sharply .  cruet and the chair he was sitting on were simply not there .  the wall behind cruet  the floor under his feet changed with explosive suddenness .  daneel said calmly     he was not there in the flesh at any time .  it was a trimensional image .  it seemed to me you would know .  you have such things on earth .        not like this     muttered baley .  a trimensional image on earth was encased in a cubic force field that glittered against the background .  the image itself had a tiny flicker .  on earth there was no mistaking image for reality .  here .  no wonder gruer had worn no gloves .  he needed no nose filters  for that matter .  daneel said     would you care to eat now  partner elijah .      dinner was an unexpected ordeal .  robots appeared .  one set the table .  one brought in the food .     how many are there in the house  daneel .     baley asked .     about fifty  partner elijah .        will they stay here while we eat .      one had backed into a corner  his glossy  glowing eyed face turned toward baley .      it is the usual practice     said daneel     for one to do so in case its service is called upon .  if you do not wish that  you have only to order it to leave .     baley shrugged .     let it stay .     under normal conditions baley might have found the food delicious .  now he ate mechanically .  he noted abstractedly that daneel ate also  with a kind of unimpassioned efficiency .  later on  of course  he would empty the fluorocarbon sac within him into which the    eaten    food was now being stored .  meanwhile daneel maintained his masquerade .      is it night outside .     asked baley .     it is     replied daneel .  baley stared somberly at the bed .  it was too large .  the whole bedroom was too large .  there were no blankets to burrow under  only sheets .  they would make a poor enclosure .  everything was difficult .  he had already gone through the unnerving experience of showering in a stall that actually adjoined the bedroom .  it was the height of luxury in a way  yet  on the other hand  it seemed an unsanitary arrangement .  he said abruptly     how is the light put out .     the headboard of the bed gleamed with a soft light .  perhaps that was to facilitate book viewing before sleeping  but baley was in no mood for that .     it will be taken care of once you   re in bed  if you compose yourself for sleep .        the robots watch  do they .        it is their job .        jehoshaphat .  what do these solarians do for themselves .     baley muttered .     i wonder now why a robot didn   t scrub my back in the shower .     with no trace of humor daneel said     one would have  had you required it .  as for the solarians  they do what they choose .  no robot performs his duty if ordered not to  except  of course  where the performance is necessary to the well being of the human .        well  good night  daneel .        i will be in another bedroom  partner elijah .  if  at any time during the night  you need anything         i know .  the robots will come .        there is a contact patch on the side table .  you have only to touch it .  i will come too .      sleep eluded baley .  he kept picturing the house he was in  balanced precariously at the outer skin of the world  with emptiness waiting just outside like a monster .  on earth his apartment  his snug  comfortable  crowded apartment  sat nestled beneath many others .  there were dozens of levels and thousands of people between himself and the rim of earth .  even on earth  he tried to tell himself  there were people on the topmost level .  they would be immediately adjacent to the outside .  sure .  but that   s what made those apartments low rent .  then he thought of jessie  a thousand light years away .  he wanted terribly to get out of bed right now  dress  and walk to her .  his thoughts grew mistier .  if there were only a tunnel  a nice  safe tunnel burrowing its way through safe  solid rock and metal from solaria to earth  he would walk and walk and walk .   .   .  he would walk back to earth  back to jessie  back to comfort and security .  security .  baley   s eyes opened .  his arms grew rigid and he rose up on his elbow  scarcely aware that he was doing so .  security .  this man  hannis gruer  was head of solarian security .  so daneel had said .  what did    security    mean .  if it meant the same as it meant on earth  and surely it must  this man gruer was responsible for the protection of solaria against invasion from without and subversion from within .  why was he interested in a murder case .  was it because there were no police on solaria and the department of security would come the closest to knowing what to do about a murder .  gruer had seemed at ease with baley  yet there had been those furtive glances  again and again  in the direction of daneel .  did gruer suspect the motives of daneel .  baley  himself  had been ordered to keep his eyes open and daneel might very likely have received similar instructions .  it would be natural for gruer to suspect that espionage was possible .  his job made it necessary for him to suspect that in any case where it was conceivable .  and he would not fear baley overmuch  an earthman  representative of the least formidable world in the galaxy .  but daneel was a native of aurora  the oldest and largest and strongest of the outer worlds .  that would be different .  gruer  as baley now remembered  had not addressed one word to daneel .  for that matter  why should daneel pretend so thoroughly to be a man .  the earlier explanation that baley had posed for himself  that it was a vainglorious game on the part of daneel   s auroran designers  seemed trivial .  it seemed obvious now that the masquerade was something more serious .  a man could be expected to receive diplomatic immunity  a certain courtesy and gentleness of treatment .  a robot could not .  but then why did not aurora send a real man in the first place .  why gamble so desperately on a fake .  the answer suggested itself instantly to baley .  a real man of aurora  a real spacer  would not care to associate too closely or for too long a time with an earthman .  but if all this were true  why should solaria find a single murder so important that it must allow an earthman and an auroran to come to their planet .  baley felt trapped .  he was trapped on solaria by the necessities of his assignment .  he was trapped by earth   s danger  trapped in an environment he could scarcely endure  trapped by a responsibility he could not shirk .  and  to add to all this  he was trapped somehow in the midst of a spacer conflict the nature of which he did not understand .     a woman is viewed  he slept at last .  he did not remember when he actually made the transition to sleep .  there was just a period when his thoughts grew more erratic and then the headboard of his bed was shining and the ceiling was alight with a cool  daytime glow .  he looked at his watch .  hours had passed .  the robots who ran the house had decided it was time for him to wake up and had acted accordingly .  he wondered if daneel were awake and at once realized the illogic of the thought .  daneel could not sleep .  baley wondered if he had counterfeited sleep as part of the role he was playing .  had he undressed and put on nightclothes .  as though on cue daneel entered .     good morning  partner elijah .     the robot was completely dressed and his face was in perfect repose .  he said     did you sleep well .        yes     said baley dryly     did you .     he got out of bed and tramped into the bathroom for a shave and for the remainder of the morning ritual .  he shouted     if a robot comes in to shave me  send him out again .  they get on my nerves .  even if i don   t see them  they get on my nerves .     he stared at his own face as he shaved  marveling a bit that it looked so like the mirrored face he saw on earth .  if only the image were another earthman with whom he could consult instead of only the light mimicry of himself .  if he could go over what he had already learned  small as it was .   .     too small .  get more     he muttered to the mirror .  he came out  mopping his face  and pulled trousers over fresh shorts .   robots supplied everything  damn them .   he said     would you answer a few questions  daneel .        as you know  partner elijah  i answer all questions to the best of my knowledge .     or to the letter of your instructions  thought baley .  he said     why are there only twenty thousand people on solaria .        that is a mere fact     said daneel .     a datum .  a figure that is the result of a counting process .        yes  but you   re evading the matter .  the planet can support millions  why  then  only twenty thousand .  you said the solarians consider twenty thousand optimum .  why .        it is their way of life .        you mean they practice birth control .        yes .        and leave the planet empty .     baley wasn   t sure why he was pounding away at this one point  but the planet   s population was one of the few hard facts he had learned about it and there was little else he could ask about .  daneel said     the planet is not empty .  it is parceled out into estates  each of which is supervised by a solarian .        you mean each lives on his estate .  twenty thousand estates  each with a solarian .        fewer estates than those  partner elijah .  wives share the estate .        no cities .     baley felt cold .     none at all  partner elijah .  they live completely apart and never see one another except under the most extraordinary circumstances .        hermits .        in a way  yes .  in a way  no .        what does that mean .        agent gruer visited you yesterday by trimensional image .  solarians visit one another freely that way and in no other way .     baley stared at daneel .  he said     does that include us .  are we expected to live that way .        it is the custom of the world .        then how do i investigate this case .  if i want to see someone         from this house  partner elijah  you can obtain a trimensional view of anyone on the planet .  there will be no problem .  in fact  it will save you the annoyance of leaving this house .  it was why i said when we arrived that there would be no occasion for you to feel it necessary to grow accustomed to facing the outdoors .  and that is well .  any other arrangement would be most distasteful to you .        i   ll judge what   s distasteful to me     said baley .     first thing today  daneel  i get in touch with the gladia woman  the wife of the murdered man .  if the trimensional business is unsatisfactory  i will go out to her place  personally .  it   s a matter for my decision .        we shall see what is best and most feasible  partner elijah     said daneel noncommittally .     i shall arrange for breakfast .     he turned to leave .  baley stared at the broad robotic back and was almost amused .  daneel olivaw acted the master .  if his instructions had been to keep baley from learning any more than was absolutely necessary  a trump card had been left in baley   s hand .  the other was only r .  daneel olivaw  after all .  all that was necessary was to tell gruer  or any solarian  that daneel was a robot and not a man .  and yet  on the other hand  daneel   s pseudo humanity could be of great use  too .  a trump card need not be played at once .  sometimes it was more useful in the hand .  wait and see  he thought  and followed daneel out to breakfast .   baley said     now how does one go about establishing trimensional contact .        it is done for us  partner elijah     said daneel  and his finger sought out one of the contact patches that summoned robots .  a robot entered at once .  where do they come from  baley wondered .  as one wandered aimlessly about the uninhabited maze that constituted the mansion  not one robot was ever visible .  did they scramble out of the way as humans approached .  did they send messages to one another and clear the path .  yet whenever a call went out  one appeared without delay .  baley stared at the robotic newcomer .  it was sleek  but not glossy .  its surface had a muted  grayish finish  with a checkerboard pattern on the right shoulder as the only bit of color .  squares in white and yellow  silver and gold  really  from the metallic luster  were placed in what seemed an aimless pattern .  daneel said     take us to the conversation room .     the robot bowed and turned  but said nothing .  baley said     wait  boy .  what   s your name .     the robot faced baley .  it spoke in clear tones and without hesitation .     i have no name  master .  my serial number     and a metal finger lifted and rested on the shoulder patch      is acx      .     daneel and baley followed into a large room  which baley recognized as having held gruer and his chair the day before .  another robot was waiting for them with the eternal  patient nonboredom of the machine .  the first bowed and left .  baley compared shoulder patches of the two as the first bowed and started out .  the pattern of silver and gold was different .  the checkerboard was made up of a six by six square .  the number of possible arrangements would be     then  or seventy billion .  more than enough .  baley said     apparently  there is one robot for everything .  one to show us here .  one to run the viewer .     daneel said     there is much robotic specialization in solaria  partner elijah .        with so many of them  i can understand why .     baley looked at the second robot .  except for the shoulder patch  and  presumably  for the invisible positronic patterns within its spongy platinum iridium brain it was the duplicate of the first .  he said     and your serial number .        acc       master .        i   ll just call you boy .  now i want to speak to a mrs .  gladia delmarre  wife of the late rikaine delmarre   daneel  is there an address  some way of pin pointing her location .     daneel said gently     i do not believe any further information is necessary .  if i may question the robot         let me do that     baley said .     all right  boy  do you know how the lady is to be reached .        yes  master .  i have knowledge of the connection pattern of all masters .     this was said without pride .  it was a mere fact  as though it were saying  i am made of metal  master .  daneel interposed     that is not surprising  partner elijah .  there are less than ten thousand connections that need be fed into the memory circuits  and that is a small number .     baley nodded .     is there more than one gladia delmarre  by any chance .  there might be that chance of confusion .        master .     after the question the robot remained blankly silent .     i believe     said daneel     that this robot does not understand your question .  it is my belief that duplicate names do not occur on solaria .  names are registered at birth and no name may be adopted unless it is unoccupied at the time .        all right     said baley     we learn something every minute .  now see here  boy  you tell me how to work whatever it is i am supposed to work  give me the connection pattern  or whatever you call it  and then step out .     there was a perceptible pause before the robot answered .  it said     do you wish to make contact yourself  sir .        that   s right .     daneel touched baley   s sleeve gently .     one moment  partner elijah .        now what is it .        it is my belief that the robot could make the necessary contact with greater ease .  it is his specialization .     baley said grimly     i   m sure he can do it better than i can .  doing it myself  i may make a mess of it .     he stared levelly at the impassive daneel .     just the same  i prefer to make contact myself .  do i give the orders or don   t i .     daneel said     you give the orders  partner elijah  and your orders  where first law permits  will be obeyed .  however  with your permission  i would like to give you what pertinent information i have concerning the solarian robots .  far more than on any other world  the robots on solaria are specialized .  although solarian robots are physically capable of many things  they are heavily equipped mentally for one particular type of job .  to perform functions outside their specialty requires the high potentials produced by direct application of one of the three laws .  again  for them not to perform the duty for which they are equipped also requires the direct application of the three laws .        well  then  a direct order from me brings the second law into play  doesn   t it .        true .  yet the potential set up by it is    unpleasant    to the robot .  ordinarily  the matter would not come up  since almost never does a solarian interfere with the day to day workings of a robot .  for one thing  he would not care to do a robot   s work  for another  he would feel no need to .        are you trying to tell me  daneel  that it hurts the robot to have me do its work .        as you know  partner elijah  pain in the human sense is not applicable to robotic reactions .     baley shrugged .     then .        nevertheless     went on daneel     the experience which the robot undergoes is as upsetting to it as pain is to a human  as nearly as i can judge .        and yet     said baley     i   m not a solarian .  i   m an earthman .  i don   t like robots doing what i want to do .        consider  too     said daneel     that to cause distress to a robot might be considered on the part of our hosts to be an act of impoliteness since in a society such as this there must be a number of more or less rigid beliefs concerning how it is proper to treat a robot and how it is not .  to offend our hosts would scarcely make our task easier .        all right     said baley .     let the robot do its job .     he settled back .  the incident had not been without its uses .  it was an educational example of how remorseless a robotic society could be .  once brought into existence  robots were not so easily removed  and a human who wished to dispense with them even temporarily found he could not .  his eyes half closed  he watched the robot approach the wall .  let the sociologists on earth consider what had just occurred and draw their conclusions .  he was beginning to have certain notions of his own .   half a wall slid aside and the control panel that was revealed would have done justice to a city section power station .  baley longed for his pipe .  he had been briefed that smoking on non smoking solaria would be a terrible breach of decorum  so he had not even been allowed to take his fixings .  he sighed .  there were moments when the feel of pipe stem between teeth and a warm bowl in his hand would have been infinitely comforting .  the robot was working quickly  adjusting variable resistances a trifle here and there and intensifying field forces in proper pattern by quick finger pressures .  daneel said     it is necessary first to signal the individual one desires to view .  a robot will  of course  receive the message .  if the individual being signaled is available and wishes to receive the view  full contact is established .        are all those controls necessary .     asked baley .     the robot   s hardly touching most of the panel .        my information on the matter is not complete  partner elijah .  there is  however  the necessity of arranging  upon occasion  for multiple viewings and for mobile viewings .  the latter  particularly  call for complicated and continuing adjustment .     the robot said     masters  contact is made and approved .  when you are ready  it will be completed .        ready     growled baley  and as though the word were a signal  the far half of the room was alive with light .   daneel said at once     i neglected to have the robot specify that all visible openings to the outside be draped .  i regret that and we must arrange         never mind     said baley  wincing .     i   ll manage .  don   t interfere .     it was a bathroom he was staring at  or he judged it to be so from its fixtures .  one end of it was  he guessed  a kind of beautician   s establishment and his imagination pictured a robot  or robots .   working with unerring swiftness on the details of a woman   s coiffure and on the externals that made up the picture she presented to the world .  some gadgets and fittings he simply gave up on .  there was no way of judging their purpose in the absence of experience .  the walls were inlaid with an intricate pattern that all but fooled the eye into believing some natural object was being represented before fading away into an abstraction .  the result was soothing and almost hypnotic in the way it monopolized attention .  what might have been the shower stall  a large one  was shielded off by nothing that seemed material  but rather by a trick of lighting that set up a wall of flickering opacity .  no human was in sight .  baley   s glance fell to the floor .  where did his room end and the other begin .  it was easy to tell .  there was a line where the quality of the light changed and that must be it .  he stepped toward the line and after a moment   s hesitation pushed his hand beyond it .  he felt nothing  any more than he would have had he shoved the hand into one of earth   s crude trimensionals .  there  at least  he would have seen his own hand still  faintly  perhaps  and overlaid by the image  but he would have seen it .  here it was lost completely .  to his vision  his arm ended sharply at the wrist .  what if he stepped across the line altogether .  probably his own vision would become inoperative .  he would be in a world of complete blackness .  the thought of such efficient enclosure was almost pleasant .  a voice interrupted him .  he looked up and stepped backward with an almost clumsy haste .  gladia delmarre was speaking .  at least baley assumed it was she .  the upper portion of the flickering light across the shower stall had faded and a head was clearly visible .  it smiled at baley .     i said hello  and i   m sorry to keep you waiting .  i   ll be dry soon .     hers was a triangular face  rather broad at the cheekbones  which grew prominent when she smiled  and narrowing with a gentle curve past full lips to a small chin .  her head was not high above the ground .  baley judged her to be about five feet two in height .   this was not typical .  at least not to baley   s way of thinking .  spacer women were supposed to lean toward the tall and stately .   nor was her hair the spacer bronze .  it was light brown  tinging toward yellow  and worn moderately long .  at the moment it was fluffed out in what baley imagined must be a stream of warm air .  the whole picture was quite pleasing .  baley said in confusion     if you want us to break contact and wait till you   re through         oh no .  i   m almost done  and we can talk meanwhile .  hannis gruer told me you would be viewing .  you   re from earth  i understand .     her eyes rested full on him  seemed to drink him in .  baley nodded and sat down .     my companion is from aurora .     she smiled and kept her glance fixed on baley as though he remained the curiosity nevertheless  and of course  baley thought  so he was .  she lifted her arms above her head  running her fingers through the hair and spreading it out as though to hasten drying .  her arms were slim and graceful .  very attractive  baley thought .  then he thought uneasily  jessie wouldn   t like this .  daneel   s voice broke in .     would it be possible  mrs .  delmarre  to have the window we see polarized or draped .  my partner is disturbed by the sight of daylight .  on earth  as you may have heard      the young woman  baley judged her to be twenty five but had the doleful thought that the apparent ages of spacers could be most deceptive  put her hands to her cheeks and said     oh my  yes .  i know all about that .  how ridiculously silly of me .  forgive me  please  but it won   t take a moment .  i   ll have a robot in here      she stepped out of the drying cabinet  her hand extended toward the contact patch  still talking .     i   m always thinking i ought to have more than one contact patch in this room .  a house is just no good if it doesn   t have a patch within reach no matter where you stand   say not more than five feet away .  it just   why  what   s the matter .     she stared in shock at baley  who  having jumped out of his chair and upset it behind him  had reddened to his hairline and hastily turned away .  daneel said calmly     it would be better  mrs .  delmarre  if  after you have made contact with the robot  you would return to the stall or  failing that  proceed to put on some articles of clothing .     gladia looked down at her nudity in surprise and said     well  of course .        a crime is discussed     it was only viewing  you see     said gladia contritely .  she was wrapped in something that left her arms and shoulders free .  one leg showed to mid thigh  but baley  entirely recovered and feeling an utter fool  ignored it stoically .  he said     it was the surprise  mrs .  delmarre         oh  please .  you can call me gladia  unless  unless that   s against your customs .        gladia  then .  it   s all right .  i just want to assure you there was nothing repulsive about it  you understand .  just the surprise .     bad enough for him to have acted the fool  he thought  without having the poor girl think he found her unpleasant .  as a matter of fact  it had been rather  rather    well  he didn   t have the phrase  but he knew quite certainly that there was no way he would ever be able to talk of this to jessie .     i know i offended you     gladia said     but i didn   t mean to .  i just wasn   t thinking .  of course i realize one must be careful about the customs of other planets  but the customs are so queer sometimes  at least  not queer     she hastened to add     i don   t mean queer .  i mean strange  you know  and it   s so easy to forget .  as   forgot about keeping the windows darkened .        quite all right     muttered baley .  she was in another room now with all the windows draped and the light had the subtly different and more comfortable texture of artificiality .     but about the other thing     she went on earnestly     it   s just viewing  you see .  after all  you didn   t mind talking to me when i was in the drier and i wasn   t wearing anything then  either .        well     said baley  wishing she would run down as far as that subject was concerned     hearing you is one thing  and seeing you is another .        but that   s exactly it .  seeing isn   t involved .     she reddened a trifle and looked down .     i hope you don   t think i   d ever do anything like that  i mean  just step out of the drier  if anyone were seeing me .  it was just viewing .        same thing  isn   t it .     said baley .     not at all the same thing .  you   re viewing me right now .  you can   t touch me  can you  or smell me  or anything like that .  you could if you were seeing me .  right now  i   m two hundred miles away from you at least .  so how can it be the same thing .     baley grew interested .     but i see you with my eyes .        no  you don   t see me .  you see my image .  you   re viewing me .        and that makes a difference .        all the difference there is .        i see .     in a way he did .  the distinction was not one he could make easily  but it had a kind of logic to it .  she said  bending her head a little to one side     do you really see .        yes .        does that mean you wouldn   t mind if i took off my wrapper .     she was smiling .  he thought  she   s teasing and i ought to take her up on it .  but aloud he said     no  it would take my mind off my job .  we   ll discuss it another time .        do you mind my being in the wrapper  rather than something more formal .  seriously .        i don   t mind .        may i call you by your first name .        if you have the occasion .        what is your first name .        elijah .        all right .     she snuggled into a chair that looked hard and almost ceramic in texture  but it slowly gave as she sat until it embraced her gently .  baley said     to business  now .     she said     to business .     baley found it all extraordinarily difficult .  there was no way even to make a beginning .  on earth he would ask name  rating  city and sector of dwelling  a million different routine questions .  he might even know the answers to begin with  yet it would be a device to ease into the serious phase .  it would serve to introduce him to the person  make his judgment of the tactics to pursue something other than a mere guess .  but here .  how could he be certain of anything .  the very verb    to see    meant different things to himself and to the woman .  how many other words would be different .  how often would they be at cross purposes without his being aware of it .  he said     how long were you married  gladia .        ten years  elijah .        how old are you .        thirty three .     baley felt obscurely pleased .  she might easily have been a hundred thirty three .  he said     were you happily married .     gladia looked uneasy .     how do you mean that .        well      for a moment baley was at a loss .  how do you define a happy marriage .  for that matter  what would a solarian consider a happy marriage .  he said     well  you saw one another often .        what .  i should hope not .  we   re not animals  you know .     baley winced .     you did live in the same mansion .  i thought         of course  we did .  we were married .  but i had my quarters and he had his .  he had a very important career which took much of his time and i have my own work .  we viewed each other whenever necessary .     he saw you  didn   t he .     it   s not a thing one talks about but he did see me .        do you have any children .     gladia jumped to her feet in obvious agitation .     that   s too much .  of all the indecent         now wait .  wait .     baley brought his fist down on the arm of his chair .     don   t be difficult .  this is a murder investigation .  do you understand .  murder .  and it was your husband who was murdered .  do you want to see the murderer found and punished or don   t you .        then ask about the murder  not about  about         i have to ask all sorts of things .  for one thing i want to know whether you   re sorry your husband is dead .     he added with calculated brutality     you don   t seem to be .     she stared at him haughtily .     i   m sorry when anyone dies  especially when he   s young and useful .        doesn   t the fact that he was your husband make it just a little more than that .        he was assigned to me and  well  we did see each other when scheduled and  and     she hurried the next words     and  if you must know  we don   t have children because none have been assigned us yet .  i don   t see what all that has to do with being sorry over someone being dead .     maybe it had nothing to do with it  baley thought .  it depended on the social facts of life and with those he was not acquainted .  he changed the subject .     i   m told you have personal knowledge of the circumstances of the murder .     for a moment she seemed to grow taut .     i  discovered the body .  is that the way i should say it .        then you didn   t witness the actual murder .        oh no     she said faintly .     well  suppose you tell me what happened .  take your time and use your own words .     he sat back and composed himself to listen .  she began     it was on three two of the fifth         when was that in standard time .     asked baley quickly .     i   m not sure .  i really don   t know .  you can check  i suppose .     her voice seemed shaky and her eyes had grown large .  they were a little too gray to be called blue  he noted .  she said     he came to my quarters .  it was our assigned day for seeing and i knew he   d come .        he always came on the assigned day .        oh yes .  he was a very conscientious man  a good solarian .  he never skipped an assigned day and always came at the same time .  of course  he didn   t stay long .  we have not been assigned ch      she couldn   t finish the word  but baley nodded .     anyway     she said     he always came at the same time  you know  so that everything would be comfortable .  we spoke a few minutes  seeing is an ordeal  but he always spoke quite normally to me .  it was his way .  then he left to attend to some project he was involved with  i   m not sure what .  he had a special laboratory in my quarters to which he could retire on seeing days .  he had a much bigger one in his quarters  of course .     baley wondered what he did in those laboratories .  fetology  perhaps  whatever that was .  he said     did he seem unnatural in any way .  worried .        no .  no .  he was never worried .     she came to the edge of a small laugh and buried it at the last moment .     he always had perfect control  like your friend there .     for a brief moment her small hand reached out and indicated daneel  who did not stir .     i see .  well  go on .     gladia didn   t .  instead she whispered     do you mind if i have myself a drink .        please do .     gladia   s hand slipped along the arm of her chair momentarily .  in less than a minute  a robot moved in silently and a warm drink  baley could see the steam  was in her hand .  she sipped slowly  then set the drink down .  she said     that   s better .  may i ask a personal question .     baley said     you may always ask .        well  i   ve read a lot about earth .  i   ve always been interested  you know .  it   s such a queer world .     she gasped and added immediately     i didn   t mean that .     baley frowned a little .     any world is queer to people who don   t live on it .        i mean it   s different .  you know .  anyway  i want to ask a rude question .  at least  i hope it doesn   t seem rude to an earthman .  i wouldn   t ask it of a solarian  of course .  not for anything .        ask what  gladia .        about you and your friend  mr .  olivaw  is it .        yes .        you two aren   t viewing  are you .        how do you mean .        i mean each other .  you   re seeing .  you   re there  both of you .     baley said     we   re physically together .  yes .        you could touch him  if you wanted to .        that   s right .     she looked from one to the other and said     oh .     it might have meant anything .  disgust .  revulsion .  baley toyed with the idea of standing up  walking to daneel and placing his hand flat on daneel   s face .  it might be interesting to watch her reaction .  he said     you were about to go    on with the events of that day when your husband came to see you .     he was morally certain that her digression  however interesting it might have been intrinsically to her  was primarily motivated by a desire to avoid just that .  she returned to her drink for a moment .  then     there isn   t much to tell .  i saw he would be engaged  and i knew he would be  anyway  because he was always at some sort of constructive work  so i went back to my own work .  then  perhaps fifteen minutes later  i heard a shout .     there was a pause and baley prodded her .     what kind of a shout .     she said     rikaine   s .  my husband   s .  just a shout .  no words .  a kind of fright .  no .  surprise  shock .  something like that .  i   d never heard him shout before .     she lifted her hands to her ears as though to shut out even the memory of the sound and her wrapper slipped slowly down to her waist .  she took no notice and baley stared firmly at his notebook .  he said     what did you do .        i ran .  i ran .  i didn   t know where he was         i thought you said he had gone to the laboratory he maintained in your quarters .        he did  e elijah  but i didn   t know where that was .  not for sure  anyway .  i never went there .  it was his .  i had a general idea of its direction .  i knew it was somewhere in the west  but i was so upset  i didn   t even think to summon any robot .  one of them would have guided me easily  but of course none came without being summoned .  when i did get there  i found it somehow  he was dead .     she stopped suddenly and  to baley   s acute discomfort  she bent her head and wept .  she made no attempt to obscure her face .  her eyes simply closed and tears slowly trickled down her cheeks .  it was quite soundless .  her shoulders barely trembled .  then her eyes opened and looked at him through swimming tears .     i never saw a dead man before .  he was all bloody and his head was  just  all   i managed to get a robot and he called others and i suppose they took care of me and of rikaine .  i don   t remember .  i don   t      baley said     what do you mean  they took care of rikaine .        they took him away and cleaned up .     there was a small wedge of indignation in her voice  the lady of the house careful of its condition .     things were a mess .        and what happened to the body .     she shook her head .     i don   t know .  burned  i suppose .  like any dead body .        you didn   t call the police .     she looked at him blankly and baley thought  no police .  he said     you told somebody  i suppose .  people found out about the matter .     she said     the robots called a doctor .  and i had to call rikaine   s place of work .  the robots there had to know he wouldn   t be back .        the doctor was for you  i suppose .     she nodded .  for the first time  she seemed to notice her wrapper draped about her hips .  she pulled it up into position  murmuring forlornly     i   m sorry .  i   m sorry .     baley felt uncomfortable  watching her as she sat there helpless  shivering  her face contorted with the absolute terror that had come over her with the memory .  she had never seen a dead body before .  she had never seen blood and a crushed skull .  and if the husband wife relationship on solaria was something thin and shallow  it was still a dead human being with whom she had been confronted .  baley scarcely knew what to say or do next .  he had the impulse to apologize  and yet  as a policeman  he was doing only his duty .  but there were no police on this world .  would she understand that this was his duty .  slowly  and as gently as he could  he said     gladia  did you hear anything at all .  anything besides your husband   s shout .     she looked up  her face as pretty as ever  despite its obvious distress  perhaps because of it .  she said     nothing .        no running footsteps .  no other voice .     she shook her head .     i didn   t hear anything .        when you found your husband  he was completely alone .  you two were the only ones present .        yes .        no signs of anyone else having been there .        none that i could see .  i don   t see how anyone could have been there  anyway .        why do you say that .     for a moment she looked shocked .  then she said dispiritedly     you   re from earth .  i keep forgetting .  well  it   s just that nobody could have been there .  my husband never saw anybody except me  not since he was a boy .  he certainly wasn   t the sort to see anybody .  not rikaine .  he was very strict  very custom abiding .        it might not have been his choice .  what if someone had just come to see him without an invitation  without your husband knowing anything about it .  he couldn   t have helped seeing the intruder regardless of how custom abiding he was .     she said     maybe  but he would have called robots at once and had the man taken away .  he would have .  besides no one would try to see my husband without being invited to .  i couldn   t conceive of such a thing .  and rikaine certainly would never invite anyone to see him .  it   s ridiculous to think so .     baley said softly     your husband was killed by being struck on the head  wasn   t he .  you   ll admit that .        i suppose so .  he was  all         i   m not asking for the details at the moment .  was there any sign of some mechanical contrivance in the room that would have enabled someone to crush his skull by remote control .        of course not .  at least  i didn   t see any .        if anything like that had been there  i imagine you would have seen it .  it follows then that a hand held something capable of crushing a man   s skull and that hand swung it .  some person had to be within four feet of your husband to do that .  so someone did see him .        no one would     she said earnestly .     a solarian just wouldn   t see anyone .        a solarian who would commit murder wouldn   t stick at a bit of seeing  would he .      to himself that statement sounded dubious .  on earth he had known the case of a perfectly conscienceless murderer who had been caught only because he could not bring himself to violate the custom of absolute silence in the community bathroom .   gladia shook her head .     you don   t understand about seeing .  earthmen just see anybody they want to all the time  so you don   t understand it .   .   .   .     curiosity seemed to be struggling within her .  her eyes lightened a bit .     seeing does seem perfectly normal to you  doesn   t it .        i   ve always taken it for granted     said baley .     it doesn   t trouble you .        why should it .        well  the films don   t say  and i   ve always wanted to know   is it all right if i ask a question .        go ahead     said baley stolidly .     do you have a wife assigned to you .        i   m married .  i don   t know about the assignment part .        and i know you see your wife any time you want to and she sees you and neither of you thinks anything of it .     baley nodded .     well  when you see her  suppose you just want to      she lifted her hands elbow high  pausing as though searching for the proper phrase .  she tried again     can you just  any time  .   .   .     she let it dangle .  baley didn   t try to help .  she said     well  never mind .  i don   t know why i should bother you with that sort of thing now anyway .  are you through with me .     she looked as though she might cry again .  baley said     one more try  gladia .  forget that no one would see your husband .  suppose someone did .  who might it have been .        it   s just useless to guess .  it couldn   t be anyone .        it has to be someone .  agent gruer says there is reason to suspect some one person .  so you see there must be someone .     a small  joyless smile flickered over the girl   s face .     i know who he thinks did it .        all right .  who .     she put a small hand on her breast .     i .        a theory is refuted     i should have said  partner elijah     said daneel  speaking suddenly     that that is an obvious conclusion .     baley cast a surprised look at his robot partner .     why obvious .     he asked .     the lady herself     said daneel     states that she was the only person who did or who would see her husband .  the social situation on solaria is such that even she cannot plausibly present anything else as the truth .  certainly agent gruer would find it reasonable  even obligatory  to believe that a solarian husband would be seen only by his wife .  since only one person could be in seeing range  only one person could strike the blow and only one person could be the murderer .  or murderess  rather .  agent gruer  you will remember  said that only one person could have done it .  anyone else he considered impossible .  well .        he also said     said baley     that that one person couldn   t have done it  either .        by which he probably meant that there was no weapon found at the scene of the crime .  presumably mrs .  delmarre could explain that anomaly .     he gestured with cool robotic politeness toward where gladia sat  still in viewing focus  her eyes cast down  her small mouth compressed .  jehoshaphat  thought baley  we   re forgetting the lady .  perhaps it was annoyance that had caused him to forget .  it was daneel who annoyed him  he thought  with his unemotional approach to problems .  or perhaps it was himself  with his emotional approach .  he did not stop to analyze the matter .  he said     that will be all for now  gladia .  however one goes about it  break contact .  good by .     she said softly     sometimes one says     done viewing     but i like    good by    better .  you seem disturbed  elijah .  i   m sorry  because i   m used to having people think i did it  so you don   t need to feel disturbed .     daneel said     did you do it  gladia .        no     she said angrily .     good by  then .     with the anger not yet washed out of her face she was gone .  for a moment  though  baley could still feel the impact of those quite extraordinary gray eyes .  she might say she was used to having people think her a murderess  but that was very obviously a lie .  her anger spoke more truly than her words .  baley wondered of how many other lies she was capable .   and now baley found himself alone with daneel .  he said     all right  daneel  i   m not altogether a fool .        i have never thought you were  partner elijah .        then tell me what made you say there was no murder weapon found at the site of the crime .  there was nothing in the evidence so far  nothing in anything i   ve heard that would lead us to that conclusion .        you are correct .  i have additional information not yet available to you .        i was sure of that .  what kind .        agent gruer said he would send a copy of the report of their own investigation .  i have that copy .  it arrived this morning .        why haven   t you shown it to me .        i felt that it would perhaps be more fruitful for you to conduct your investigation  at least in the initial stages  according to your own ideas  without being prejudiced by the conclusions of other people who  self admittedly  have reached no satisfactory conclusion .  it was because i  myself  felt my logical processes might be influenced by those conclusions that i contributed nothing to the discussion .     logical processes .  unbidden  there leaped into baley   s mind the fragment of a conversation he had once had with a roboticist .  a robot  the man had said  is logical but not reasonable .  he said     you entered the discussion at the end .        so i did  partner elijah  but only because by that time i had independent evidence bearing out agent gruer   s suspicions .        what kind of independent evidence .        that which could be deduced from mrs .  delmarre   s own behavior .        let   s be specific  daneel .        consider that if the lady were guilty and were attempting to prove herself innocent  it would be useful to her to have the detective in the case believe her innocent .        well .        if she could warp his judgment by playing upon a weakness of his  she might do so  might she not .        strictly hypothetical .        not at all     was the calm reply .     you will have noticed  i think  that she concentrated her attention entirely on you .        i was doing the talking     said baley .     her attention was on you from the start  even before she could guess that you would be doing the talking .  in fact  one might have thought she would  logically  have expected that i  as an auroran  would take the lead in the investigation .  yet she concentrated on you .        and what do you deduce from this .        that it was upon you  partner elijah  that she pinned her hopes .  you were the earthman .        what of that .        she had studied earth .  she implied that more than once .  she knew what i was talking about when i asked her to blank out the outer daylight at the very start of the interview .  she did not act surprised or uncomprehending  as she would most certainly have done had she not had actual knowledge of conditions on earth .        well .        since she has studied earth  it is quite reasonable to suppose that she discovered one weakness earthmen possess .  she must know of the nudity tabu  and of how such a display must impress an earthman .        she  she explained about viewing         so she did .  yet did it seem entirely convincing to you .  twice she allowed herself to be seen in what you would consider a state of improper clothing         your conclusion     said baley     is that she was trying to seduce me .  is that it .        seduce you away from your professional impersonality .  so it would seem to me .  and though i cannot share human reactions to stimuli  i would judge  from what has been imprinted on my instruction circuits  that the lady meets any reasonable standard of physical attractiveness .  from your behavior  moreover  it seems to me that you were aware of that and that you approved her appearance .  i would even judge that mrs .  delmarre acted rightly in thinking her mode of behavior would predispose you in her favor .        look     said baley uncomfortably     regardless of what effect she might have had on me  i am still an officer of the law in full possession of my sense of professional ethics .  get that straight .  now let   s see the report .      baley read through the report in silence .  he finished  turned back  and read it through a second time .     this brings in a new item     he said .     the robot .     daneel olivaw nodded .  baley said thoughtfully     she didn   t mention it .     daneel said     you asked the wrong question .  you asked if he was alone when she found the body .  you asked if anyone else had been present at the death scene .  a robot isn   t    anybody else .     baley nodded .  if he himself were a suspect and were asked who else had been at the scene of a crime  he would scarcely have replied     no one but this table .     he said     i suppose i should have asked if any robots were present .      damn it  what questions does one ask anyway on a strange world .   he said     how legal is robotic evidence  daneel .        what do you mean .        can a robot bear witness on solaria .  can it give evidence .        why should you doubt it .        a robot isn   t human  daneel .  on earth  it cannot be a legal witness .        and yet a footprint can  partner elijah  although that is much less a human than a robot is .  the position of your planet in this respect is illogical .  on solaria  robotic evidence  when competent  is admissible .     baley did not argue the point .  he rested his chin on the knuckles of one hand and went over this matter of the robot in his mind .  in the extremity of terror gladia delmarre  standing over her husband   s body  had summoned robots .  by the time they came she was unconscious .  the robots reported having found her there together with the dead body .  and something else was present as well  a robot .  that robot had not been summoned  it was already there .  it was not one of the regular staff .  no other robot had seen it before or knew its function or assignment .  nor could anything be discovered from the robot in question .  it was not in working order .  when found  its motions were disorganized and so  apparently  was the functioning of its positronic brain .  it could give none of the proper responses  either verbal or mechanical  and after exhaustive investigation by a robotics expert it was declared a total loss .  its only activity that had any trace of organization was its constant repetition of    you   re going to kill me  you   re going to kill me   you   re going to kill me .     no weapon that could possibly have been used to crush the dead man   s skull was located .  baley said suddenly     i   m going to eat  daneel  and then we see agent gruer again  or view him  anyway .      hannis gruer was still eating when contact was established .  he ate slowly  choosing each mouthful carefully from a variety of dishes  peering at each anxiously as though searching for some hidden combination he would find most satisfactory .  baley thought  he may be a couple of centuries old .  eating may be getting dull for him .  gruer said     i greet you  gentlemen .  you received our report  i believe .     his bald head glistened  as he leaned across the table to reach a titbit .     yes .  we have spent an interesting session with mrs .  delmarre also     said baley .     good  good     said gruer .     and to what conclusion  if any  did you come .     baley said     that she is innocent  sir .     gruer looked up sharply .     really .     baley nodded .  gruer said     and yet she was the only one who could see him  the only one who could possibly be within reach .   .   .   .     baley said     that   s been made clear to me  and no matter how firm social customs are on solaria  the point is not conclusive .  may i explain .     gruer had returned to his dinner .     of course .        murder rests on three legs     said baley     each equally important .  they are motive  means  and opportunity .  for a good case against any suspect  each of the three must be satisfied .  now i grant you that mrs .  delmarre had the opportunity .  as for the motive  i   ve heard of none .     gruer shrugged .     we know of none .     for a moment his eyes drifted to the silent daneel .     all right .  the suspect has no known motive  but perhaps she   s a pathological killer .  we can let the matter ride for a while  and continue .  she is in his laboratory with him and there   s some reason why she wants to kill him .  she waves some club or other heavy object threateningly .  it takes him a while to realize that his wife really intends to hurt him .  he shouts in dismay     you   re going to kill me     and so she does .  he turns to run as the blow descends and it crushes the back of his head .  did a doctor examine the body  by the way .        yes and no .  the robots called a doctor to attend mrs .  delmarre and  as a matter of course  he looked at the dead body  too .        that wasn   t mentioned in the report .        it was scarcely pertinent .  the man was dead .  in fact  by the time the doctor could view the body  it had been stripped  washed  and prepared for cremation in the usual manner .        in other words  the robots had destroyed evidence     said baley  annoyed .  then     did you say he viewed the body .  he didn   t see it .        great space     said gruer     what a morbid notion .  he viewed it  of course  from all necessary angles and at close focus  i   m sure .  doctors can   t avoid seeing patients under some conditions  but i can   t conceive of any reason why they should have to see corpses .  medicine is a dirty job  but even doctors draw the line somewhere .        well  the point is this .  did the doctor report anything about the nature of the wound that killed dr .  delmarre .        i see what you   re driving at .     you think that perhaps the wound was too severe to have been caused by a woman .        a woman is weaker than a man  sir .  and mrs .  delmarre is a small woman .        but quite athletic  plainclothesman .  given a weapon of the proper type  gravity and leverage would do most of the work .  even not allowing for that  a woman in frenzy can do surprising things .     baley shrugged .     you speak of a weapon .  where is it .     gruer shifted position .  he held out his hand toward an empty glass and a robot entered the viewing field and filled it with a colorless fluid that might have been water .  gruer held the filled glass momentarily  then put it down as though he had changed his mind about drinking .  he said     as is stated in the report  we have not been able to locate it .        i know the report says that .  i want to make absolutely certain of a few things .  the weapon was searched for .        thoroughly .        by yourself .        by robots  but under my own viewing supervision at all times .  we could locate nothing that might have been the weapon .        that weakens the case against mrs .  delmarre  doesn   t it .        it does     said gruer calmly .     it is one of several things about the case we don   t understand .  it is one reason why we have not acted against mrs .  delmarre .  it is one reason why i told you that the guilty party could not have committed the crime  either .  perhaps i should say that she apparently could not have committed the crime .        apparently .        she must have disposed of the weapon someway .  so far  we have lacked the ingenuity to find it .     baley said dourly     have you considered all possibilities .        i think so .        i wonder .  let   s see .  a weapon has been used to crush a man   s skull and it is not found at the scene of the crime .  the only alternative is that it has been carried away .  it could not have been carried away by rikaine delmarre .  he was dead .  could it have been carried away by gladia delmarre .        it must have been     said gruer .     how .  when the robots arrived  she was on the floor unconscious .  or she may have been feigning unconsciousness  but anyway she was there .  how long a time between the murder and the arrival of the first robot .        that depends upon the exact time of the murder  which we don   t know     said gruer uneasily .     i read the report  sir .  one robot reported hearing a disturbance and a cry it identified as dr .  delmarre   s .  it was apparently the closest to the scene .  the summoning signal flashed five minutes afterward .  it would take the robot less than a minute to appear on the scene .      baley remembered his own experiences with the rapid fire appearance of robots when summoned .      in five minutes  even ten  how far could mrs .  delmarre have carried a weapon and returned in time to assume unconsciousness .        she might have destroyed it in a disposer unit .        the disposer unit was investigated  according to the report  and the residual gamma ray activity  was quite low .  nothing sizable had been destroyed in it for twenty four hours .        i know that     said gruer .     i simply present it as an example of what might have been done .        true     said baley     but there may be a very simple explanation .  i suppose the robots belonging to the delmarre household have been checked and all were accounted for .        oh yes .        and all in reasonable working order .        yes .        could any of those have carried away the weapon  perhaps without being aware of what it was .        not one of them had removed anything from the scene of the crime .  or touched anything  for that matter .        that   s not so .  they certainly removed the body and prepared it for cremation .        well  yes  of course  but that scarcely counts .  you would expect them to do that .        jehoshaphat .     muttered baley .  he had to struggle to keep calm .  he said     now suppose someone else had been on the scene .        impossible     said gruer .     how could someone invade dr .  delmarre   s personal presence .     suppose .     cried baley .     now there was never any thought in the robots    minds that an intruder might have been present .  i don   t suppose any of them made an immediate search of the grounds about the house .  it wasn   t mentioned in the report .        there was no search till we looked for the weapon  but that was a considerable time afterward .        nor any search for signs of a ground car or an air vehicle on the grounds .        no .        then if someone had nerved himself to invade dr .  delmarre   s personal presence  as you put it  he could have killed him and then walked away leisurely .  no one would have stopped him or even seen him .  afterward  he could rely on everyone being sure no one could have been there .        and no one could     said gruer positively .  baley said     one more thing .  just one more .  there was a robot involved .  a robot was at the scene .     daneel interposed for the first time .     the robot was not at the scene .  had it been there  the crime would not have been committed .     baley turned his head sharply .  and gruer   who had lifted his glass a second time as though about to drink  put it down again to stare at daneel .     is that not so .     asked daneel .     quite so     said gruer .     a robot would have stopped one person from harming another .  first law .        all right     said baley .     granted .  but it must have been close .  it was on the scene when the other robots arrived .  say it was in the next room .  the murderer is advancing on delmarre and delmarre cries out     you   re going to kill me .     the robots of the household did not hear those words  at most they heard a cry  so  unsummoned  they did not come .  but this particular robot heard the words and first law made it come unsummoned .  it was too late .  probably  it actually saw the murder committed .        it must have seen the last stages of the murder     agreed gruer .     that is what disordered it .  witnessing harm to a human without having prevented it is a violation of the first law and  depending upon circumstances  more or less damage to the positronic brain is induced .  in this case  it was a great deal of damage .     gruer stared at his fingertips as he turned the glass of liquid to and fro  to and fro .  baley said     then the robot was a witness .  was it questioned .        what use .  he was disordered .  it could only say    you   re going to kill me .     i agree with your reconstruction that far .  they were probably delmarre   s last words burned into the robot   s consciousness when everything else was destroyed .        but i   m told solaria specializes in robots .  was there no way in which the robot could be repaired .  no way in which its circuits could be patched .        none     said gruer sharply .     and where is the robot  now .        scrapped     said gruer .  baley raised his eyebrows .     this is a rather peculiar case .  no motive  no means  no witnesses  no evidence .  where there was some evidence to begin with  it was destroyed .  you have only one suspect and everyone seems convinced of her guilt  at least  everyone is certain no one else can be guilty .     that   s your opinion  too  obviously .  the question then is  why was i sent for .     gruer frowned .     you seem upset  mr .  baley .     he turned abruptly to daneel .     mr .  olivaw .        yes  agent gruer .        won   t you please go through the dwelling and make sure all windows are closed and blanked out .  plainclothesman baley may be feeling the effects of open space .     the statement astonished baley .  it was his impulse to deny gruer   s assumption and order daneel to keep his place when  on the brink  he caught something of panic in gruer   s voice  something of glittering appeal in his eyes .  he sat back and let daneel leave the room .  it was as though a mask had dropped from gruer   s face  leaving it naked and afraid .  gruer said     that was easier than i had thought .  i   d planned so many ways of getting you alone .  i never thought the auroran would leave at a simple request  and yet i could think of nothing else to do .     baley said     well  i   m alone now .     gruer said     i couldn   t speak freely in his presence .  he   s an auroran and he is here because he was forced on us as the price of having you .     the solarian leaned forward .     there   s something more to this than murder .  i am not concerned only with the matter of who did it .  there are parties on solaria  secret organizations .   .   .   .     baley stared .     surely  i can   t help you there .        of course you can .  now understand this  dr .  delmarre was a traditionalist .  he believed in the old ways  the good ways .  but there are new forces among us  forces for change  and delmarre has been silenced .        by mrs .  delmarre .        hers must have been the hand .  that doesn   t matter .  there is an organization behind her and that is the important matter .        are you sure .  do you have evidence .        vague evidence  only .  i can   t help that .  rikaine delmarre was on the track of something .  he assured me his evidence was good  and i believe him .  i knew him well enough to know him as neither fool nor child .  unfortunately  he told me very little .  naturally  he wanted to complete his investigation before laying the matter completely open to the authorities .  he must have gotten close to completion  too  or they wouldn   t have dared the risk of having him openly slaughtered by violence .  one thing delmarre told me  though .  the whole human race is in danger .     baley felt himself shaken .  for a moment it was as though he were listening to minnim again  but on an even larger scale .  was everyone going to turn to him with cosmic dangers .     why do you think i can help .     he asked .     because you   re an earthman     said gruer .     do you understand .  we on solaria have no experience with these things .  in a way  we don   t understand people .  there are too few of us here .     he looked uneasy .     i don   t like to say this  mr .  baley .  my colleagues laugh at me and some grow angry  but it is a definite feeling i have .  it seems to me that you earthmen must understand people far better than we do  just by living among such crowds of them .  and a detective more than anyone .  isn   t that so .     baley half nodded and held his tongue .  gruer said     in a way  this murder was fortunate .  i have not dared speak to the others about delmarre   s investigation  since i wasn   t sure who might be involved in the conspiracy  and delmarre himself was not ready to give any details till his investigation was complete .  and even if delmarre had completed his work  how would we deal with the matter afterward .  how does one deal with hostile human beings .  i don   t know .  from the beginning  i felt we needed an earthman .  when i heard of your work in connection with the murder in spacetown on earth  i knew we needed you .  i got in touch with aurora  with whose men you had worked most closely  and through them approached the earth government .  yet my own colleagues could not be persuaded into agreeing to this .  then came the murder and that was enough of a shock to give me the agreement i needed .  at the moment  they would have agreed to anything .     gruer hesitated  then added     it   s not easy to ask an earthman to help  but i must do so .  remember  whatever it is  the human race is in danger .  earth  too .     earth was doubly in danger  then .  there was no mistaking the desperate sincerity in gruer   s voice .  but then  if the murder were so fortunate a pretext for allowing gruer to do what he so desperately wanted to do all the time  was it entirely fortune .  it opened new avenues of thought that were not reflected in baley   s face  eyes  or voice .  baley said     i have been sent here  sir  to help .  i will do so to the best of my ability .     gruer finally lifted his long delayed drink and looked over the rim of the glass at baley .     good     he said .     not a word to the auroran  please .  whatever this is about  aurora may be involved .  certainly they took an unusually intense interest in the case .  for instance  they insisted on including mr .  olivaw as your partner .  aurora is powerful  we had to agree .  they say they include mr .  olivaw only because he worked with you before  but it may well be that they wish a reliable man of their own on the scene  eh .     he sipped slowly  his eyes on baley .  baley passed the knuckles of one hand against his long cheek  rubbing it thoughtfully .     now if that      he didn   t finish  but leaped from his chair and almost hurled himself toward the other  before remembering it was only an image he was facing .  for gruer  staring wildly at his drink  clutched his throat  whispering hoarsely     burning .   .   .  burning .   .   .     the glass fell from his hand  its contents spilling .  and gruer dropped with it  his face distorted with pain .     a doctor is prodded  daneel stood in the doorway .     what happened  partner eli      but no explanation was needed .  daneel   s voice changed to a loud ringing shout .     robots of hannis gruer .  your master is hurt .  robots .     at once a metal figure strode into the dining room and after it  in a minute or two  a dozen more entered .  three carried gruer gently away .  the others busily engaged in straightening the disarray and picking up the tableware strewn on the floor .  daneel called out suddenly     you there  robots  never mind the crockery .  organize a search .  search the house for any human being .  alert any robots on the grounds outside .  have them go over every acre of the estate .  if you find a master  hold him .  do not hurt him     unnecessary advice     but do not let him leave  either .  if you find no master present  let me know .  i will remain at this viewer combination .     then  as robots scattered  elijah muttered to daneel     that   s a beginning .  it was poison  of course .        yes .  that much is obvious  partner elijah .     daneel sat down queerly  as though there were a weakness in his knees .  baley had never seen him give way so  not for an instant  to any action that resembled anything so human as a weakness in the knees .  daneel said     it is not well with my mechanism to see a human being come to harm .        there was nothing you could do .        that i understand and yet it is as though there were certain cloggings in my thought paths .  in human terms what i feel might be the equivalent to shock .        if that   s so  get over it .     baley felt neither patience nor sympathy for a queasy robot .     we   ve got to consider the little matter of responsibility .  there is no poison without a poisoner .        it might have been food poisoning .        accidental food poisoning .  on a world this neatly run .  never .  besides  the poison was in a liquid and the symptoms were sudden and complete .  it was a poisoned dose and a large one .  look  daneel  i   ll go into the next room to think this out a bit .  you get mrs .  delmarre .  make sure she   s at home and check the distance between her estate and gruer   s .        is it that you think she      baley held up a hand .     just find out  will you .     he strode out of the room  seeking solitude .  surely there could not be two independent attempts at murder so close together in time on a world like solaria .  and if a connection existed  the easiest assumption to make was that gruer   s story of a conspiracy was true .  baley felt a familiar excitement growing within him .  he had come to this world with earth   s predicament in his mind  and his own .  the murder itself had been a faraway thing  but now the chase was really on .  the muscles in his jaw knotted .  after all  the murderer or murderers  or murderess  had struck in his presence and he was stung by that .  was he held in so little account .  it was professional pride that was hurt and baley knew it and welcomed the fact .  at least it gave him a firm reason to see this thing through as a murder case  simply  even without reference to earth   s dangers .  daneel had located him now and was striding toward him .     i have done as you asked me to  partner elijah .  i have viewed mrs .  delmarre .  she is at her home  which is somewhat over a thousand miles from the estate of agent gruer .     baley said     i   ll see her myself later .  view her  i mean .     he stared thoughtfully at daneel .     do you think she has any connection with this crime .        apparently not a direct connection  partner elijah .        does that imply there might be an indirect connection .        she might have persuaded someone else to do it .        someone else .     baley asked quickly .     who .        that  partner elijah  i cannot say .        if someone were acting for her  that someone  . would have to be at the scene of the crime .        yes     said daneel     someone must have been there to place the poison in the liquid .        isn   t it possible that the poisoned liquid might have been prepared earlier in the day .  perhaps much earlier .     daneel said quietly     i had thought of that  partner elijah  which is why i used the word    apparently    when i stated that mrs .  delmarre had no direct connection with the crime .  it is within the realm of possibility for her to have been on the scene earlier in the day .  it would be well to check her movements .        we will do that .  we will check whether she was physically present at any time .     baley   s lips twitched .  he had guessed that in some ways robotic logic must fall short and he was convinced of it now .  as the roboticist had said  logical but not reasonable .  he said     let   s get back into the viewing room and get gruer   s estate back in view .      the room sparkled with freshness and order .  there was no sign at all that less than an hour before a man had collapsed in agony .  three robots stood  backs against the wall  in the usual robotic attitude of respectful submission .  baley said     what news concerning your master .     the middle robot said     the doctor is attending him  master .        viewing or seeing .        viewing  master .        what does the doctor say .  will your master live .        it is not yet certain  master .     baley said     has the house been searched .        thoroughly  master .        was there any sign of another master beside your own .        no  master .        were there any signs of such presence in the near past .        not at all  master .        are the grounds being searched .        yes  master .        any results so far .        no  master .     baley nodded and said     i wish to speak to the robot that served at the table this night .        it is being held for inspection  master .  its reactions are erratic .        can it speak .        yes  master .        then get it here without delay .     there was delay and baley began again .     i said      daneel interrupted smoothly .     there is interradio communication among these solarian types .  the robot you desire is being summoned .  if it is slow in coming  it is part of the disturbance that has overtaken it as the result of what has occurred .     baley nodded .  he might have guessed at interradio .  in a world so thoroughly given over to robots some sort of intimate communication among them would be necessary if the system were not to break down .  it explained how a dozen robots could follow when one robot had been summoned  but only when needed and not otherwise .  a robot entered .  it limped  one leg dragging .  baley wondered why and then shrugged .  even among the primitive robots on earth reactions to injury of the positronic paths were never obvious to the layman .  a disrupted circuit might strike a leg   s functioning  as here  and the fact would be most significant to a roboticist and completely meaningless to anyone else .  baley said cautiously     do you remember a colorless liquid on your master   s table  some of which you poured into a goblet for him .     the robot said     yeth  mathter .     a defect in oral articulation  too .  baley said     what was the nature of the liquid .        it wath water  mathter .        just water .  nothing else .        jutht water  mathter .        where did you get it .        from the rethervoir tap  mathter .        had it been standing in the kitchen before you brought it in .        the mathter preferred it not too cold  mathter .  it wath a thtanding order that it be poured an hour before mealth .     how convenient  thought baley  for anyone who knew that fact .  he said     have one of the robots connect me with the doctor viewing your master as soon as he is available .  and while that is being done  i want another one to explain how the reservoir tap works .  i want to know about the water supply here .      the doctor was available with little delay .  he was the oldest spacer baley had ever seen  which meant  baley thought  that he might be over three hundred years old .  the veins stood out on his hands and his close cropped hair was pure white .  he had a habit of tapping his ridged front teeth with a fingernail  making a little clicking noise that baley found annoying .  his name was altim thool .  the doctor said     fortunately  he threw up a good deal of the dose .  still  he may not survive .  it is a tragic event .     he sighed heavily .     what was the poison  doctor .     asked baley .     i   m afraid i don   t know .      click click click .   baley said     what .  then how are you treating him .        direct stimulation of the neuromuscular system to prevent paralysis  but except for that i am letting nature take its course .     his face  with its faintly yellow skin  like well worn leather of superior quality  wore a pleading expression .     we have very little experience with this sort of thing .  i don   t recall another case in over two centuries of practice .     baley stared at the other with contempt .     you know there are such things as poisons  don   t you .        oh yes .      click click .      common knowledge .        you have book film references where you can gain some knowledge .        it would take days .  there are numerous mineral poisons .  we make use of insecticides in our society  and it is not impossible to obtain bacterial toxins .  even with descriptions in the films it would take a long time to gather the equipment and develop the techniques to test for them .        if no one on solaria knows     said baley grimly     i   d suggest you get in touch with one of the other worlds and find out .  meanwhile  you had better test the reservoir tap in gruer   s mansion for poison .  get there in person  if you have to  and do it .     baley was prodding a venerable spacer roughly  ordering him about like a robot and was quite unconscious of the incongruity of it .  nor did the spacer make any protest .  dr .  thool said doubtfully     how could the reservoir tap be poisoned .  i   m sure it couldn   t be .        probably not     agreed baley     but test it anyway to make sure .     the reservoir tap was a dim possibility indeed .  the robot   s explanation had shown it to be a typical piece of solarian self care .  water might enter it from whatever source and be tailored to suit .  microorganisms were removed and non living organic matter eliminated .  the proper amount of aeration was introduced  as were various ions in just those trace amounts best suited to the body   s needs .  it was very unlikely that any poison could survive one or another of the control devices .  still  if the safety of the reservoir were directly established  then the time element would be clear .  there would be the matter of the hour before the meal  when the pitcher of water  exposed to air  thought baley sourly  was allowed to warm slowly  thanks to gruer   s idiosyncrasy .  but dr .  thool  frowning  was saying     but how would i test the reservoir tap .        jehoshaphat .  take an animal with you .  inject some of the water you take out of the tap into its veins  or have it drink some .  use your head  man .  and do the same for what   s left in the pitcher  and if that   s poisoned  as it must be  run some of the tests the reference films describe .  find some simple ones .  do something .        wait  wait .  what pitcher .        the pitcher in which the water was standing .  the pitcher from which the robot poured the poisoned drink .        well  dear me  i presume it has been cleaned up .  the household retinue would surely not leave it standing about .     baley groaned .  of course not .  it was impossible to retain evidence with eager robots forever destroying it in the name of household duty .  he should have ordered it preserved  but of course  this society was not his own and he never reacted properly to it .  jehoshaphat .   word eventually came through that the gruer estate was clear  no sign of any unauthorized human present anywhere .  daneel said     that rather intensifies the puzzle  partner elijah  since it seems to leave no one in the role of poisoner .     baley  absorbed in thought  scarcely heard .  he said     what .   .   .  not at all .  not at all .  it clarifies the matter .     he did not explain  knowing quite well that daneel would be incapable of understanding or believing what baley was certain was the truth .  nor did daneel ask for an explanation .  such an invasion of a human   s thoughts would have been most unrobotic .  baley prowled back and forth restlessly  dreading the approach of the sleep period  when his fears of the open would rise and his longing for earth increase .  he felt an almost feverish desire to keep things happening .  he said to daneel     i might as well see mrs .  delmarre again .  have the robot make contact .     they walked to the viewing room and baley watched a robot work with deft metal fingers .  he watched through a haze of obscuring thought that vanished in startled astonishment when a table  elaborately spread for dinner  suddenly filled half the room .  gladia   s voice said     hello .     a moment later she stepped into view and sat down .     don   t look surprised  elijah .  it   s just dinnertime .  and i   m very carefully dressed .  see .     she was .  the dominant color of her dress was a light blue and it shimmered down the length of her limbs to wrists and ankles .  a yellow ruff clung about her neck and shoulders  a little lighter than her hair  which was now held in disciplined waves .  baley said     i did not mean to interrupt your meal .        i haven   t begun yet .  why don   t you join me .     he eyed her suspiciously .     join you .     she laughed .     you earthmen are so funny .  i don   t mean join me in personal presence .  how could you do that .  i mean  go to your own dining room and then you and the other one can dine with me .        but if i leave         your viewing technician can maintain contact .     daneel nodded gravely at that  and with some uncertainty baley turned and walked toward the door .  gladia  together with her table  its setting  and its ornaments moved with him .  gladia smiled encouragingly .     see .  your viewing technician is keeping us in contact .     baley and daneel traveled up a moving ramp that baley did not recall having traversed before .  apparently there were numerous possible routes between any two rooms in this impossible mansion and he knew only few of them .  daneel  of course  knew them all .  and  moving through walls  sometimes a bit below floor level  sometimes a bit above  there was always gladia and her dinner table .  baley stopped and muttered     this takes getting used to .     gladia said at once     does it make you dizzy .        a little .        then i tell you what .  why don   t you have your technicians freeze me right here .  then when you   re in your dining room and all set  he can join us up .     daneel said     i will order that done  partner elijah .      their own dinner table was set when they arrived  the plates steaming with a dark brown soup in which diced meat was bobbing  and in the center a large roast fowl was ready for the carving .  daneel spoke briefly to the serving robot and  with smooth efficiency  the two places that had been set were drawn to the same end of the table .  as though that were a signal  the opposite wall seemed to move outward  the table seemed to lengthen and gladia was seated at the opposite end .  room joined to room and table to table so neatly that but for the varying pattern in wall and floor covering and the differing designs in tableware it would have been easy to believe they were all dining together in actual fact .     there     said gladia with satisfaction .     isn   t this comfortable .        quite     said baley .  he tasted his soup gingerly  found it delicious  and helped himself more generously .     you know about agent gruer .     trouble shadowed her face at once and she put her spoon down .     isn   t it terrible .  poor hannis .        you use his first name .  do you know him .        i know almost all the important people on solaria .  most solarians do know one another .  naturally .     naturally  indeed  thought baley .  how many of them were there  after all .  baley said     then perhaps you know dr .  altim thool .  he   s taking care of gruer .     gladia laughed gently .  her serving robot sliced meat for her and added small  browned potatoes and slivers of carrots .     of course i know him .  he treated me .        treated you when .        right after the  the trouble .  about my husband  i mean .     baley said in astonishment     is he the only doctor on the planet .        oh no .     for a moment her lips moved as though she were counting to herself .     there are at least ten .  and there   s one youngster i know of who   s studying medicine .  but dr .  thool is one of the best .  he has the most experience .  poor dr .  thool .        why poor .        well  you know what i mean .  it   s such a nasty job  being a doctor .  sometimes you just have to see people when you   re a doctor and even touch them .  but dr .  thool seems so resigned to it and he   ll always do some seeing when he feels he must .  he   s always treated me since i was a child and was always so friendly and kind and i honestly feel i almost wouldn   t mind if he did have to see me .  for instance  he saw me this last time .        after your husband   s death  you mean .        yes .  you can imagine how he felt when he saw my husband   s dead body and me lying there .        i was told he viewed the body     said baley .     the body  yes .  but after he made sure i was alive and in no real danger  he ordered the robots to put a pillow under my head and give me an injection of something or other  and then get out .  he came over by jet .  really .  by jet .  it took less than half an hour and he took care of me and made sure all was well .  i was so woozy when i came to that i was sure i was only viewing him  you know  and it wasn   t till he touched me that i knew we were seeing  and i screamed .  poor dr .  thool .  he was awfully embarrassed  but i knew he meant well .     baley nodded .     i suppose there   s not much use for doctors on solaria .        i should hope not .        i know there are no germ diseases to speak of .  what about metabolic disorders .  atherosclerosis .  diabetes .  things like that .        it happens and it   s pretty awful when it does .  doctors can make life more livable for such people in a physical way  but that   s the least of it .        oh .        of course .  it means the gene analysis was imperfect .  you don   t suppose we allow defects like diabetes to develop on purpose .  anyone who develops such things has to undergo very detailed re analysis .  the mate assignment has to be retracted  which is terribly embarrassing for the mate .  and it means no  no     her voice sank to a whisper     children .     baley said in a normal voice     no children .     gladia flushed .     it   s a terrible thing to say .  such a word .  ch children .        it comes easy after a while     said baley dryly .     yes  but if i get into the habit  i   ll say it in front of another solarian someday and i   ll just sink into the ground .   .   .   .  anyway  if the two of them have had children  see  i   ve said it again  already  the children have to be found and examined  that was one of rikaine   s jobs  by the way  and well  it   s just a mess .     so much for thool  thought baley .  the doctor   s incompetence was a natural consequence of the society  and held nothing sinister .  nothing necessarily sinister .  cross him off  he thought  but lightly .  he watched gladia as she ate .  she was neat and precisely delicate in her movements and her appetite seemed normal .   his own fowl was delightful .  in one respect  anyway  food  he could easily be spoiled by these outer worlds .   he said     what is your opinion of the poisoning  gladia .     she looked up .     i   m trying not to think of it .  there are so many horrors lately .  maybe it wasn   t poisoning .        it was .        but there wasn   t anyone around .        how do you know .        there couldn   t have been .  he has no wife  these days  since he   s all through with his quota of ch  you know what .  so there was no one to put the poison in anything  so how could he be poisoned .        but he was poisoned .  that   s a fact and must be accepted .     her eyes clouded over .     do you suppose     she said     he did it himself .        i doubt it .  why should he .  and so publicly .        then it couldn   t be done  elijah .  it just couldn   t .     baley said     on the contrary  gladia .  it could be done very easily .  and i   m sure i know exactly how .        a spacer is defied  gladia seemed to be holding her breath for a moment .  it came out through puckered lips in what was almost a whistle .  she said     i   m sure i don   t see how .  do you know who did it .     baley nodded .     the same one who killed your husband .        are you sure .        aren   t you .  your husband   s murder was the first in the history of solaria .  a month later there is another murder .  could that be a coincidence .  two separate murderers striking within a month of each other on a crime free world .  consider  too  that the second victim was investigating the first crime and therefore represented a violent danger to the original murderer .        well .     gladia applied herself to her dessert and said between mouthfuls     if you put it that way  i   m innocent .        how so  gladia .        why  elijah .  i   ve never been near the gruer estate  never in my whole life .  so i certainly couldn   t have poisoned agent gruer .  and if i haven   t  why  neither did i kill my husband .     then  as baley maintained a stern silence  her spirit seemed to fade and the corners of her small mouth drooped .     don   t you think so  elijah .        i can   t be sure     said baley .     i   ve told you i know the method used to poison gruer .  it   s an ingenious one and anyone on solaria could have used it  whether they were on the gruer estate or not  whether they were ever on the gruer estate or not .     gladia clenched her hands into fists .     are you saying i did it .        i   m not saying that .        you   re implying it .     her lips were thin with fury and her high cheekbones were splotchy .     is that all your interest in viewing me .  to ask me sly questions .  to trap me .        now wait         you seemed so sympathetic .  so understanding .  you  you earthman .     her contralto had become a tortured rasp with the last word .  daneel   s perfect face leaned toward gladia and he said     if you will pardon me  mrs .  delmarre  you are holding a knife rather tightly and may cut yourself .  please be careful .     gladia stared wildly at the short  blunt  and undoubtedly quite harmless knife she held in her hand .  with a spasmodic movement she raised it high .  baley said     you couldn   t reach me  gladia .     she gasped .     who   d want to reach you .  ugh .     she shuddered in exaggerated disgust and called out     break contact at once .     the last must have been to a robot out of the line of sight  and gladia and her end of the room were gone and the original wall sprang back .   daneel said     am i correct in believing you now consider this woman guilty .        no     said baley flatly .     whoever did this needed a great deal more of certain characteristics than this poor girl has .        she has a temper .        what of that .  most people do .  remember  too  that she has been under a considerable strain for a considerable time .  if i had been under a similar strain and someone had turned on me as she imagined i had turned on her  i might have done a great deal more than wave a foolish little knife .     daneel said     i have not been able to deduce the technique of poisoning at a distance  as you say you have .     baley found it pleasant to be able to say     i know you haven   t .  you lack the capacity to decipher this particular puzzle .     he said it with finality and daneel accepted the statement as calmly and as gravely as ever .  baley said     i have two jobs for you  daneel .        and what are they  partner elijah .        first  get in touch with this dr .  thool and find out mrs .  delmarre   s condition at the time of the murder of her husband .  how long she required treatment and so on .        do you want to determine something in particular .        no .  i   m just trying to accumulate data .  it isn   t easy on this world .  secondly  find out who will be taking gruer   s place as head of security and arrange a viewing session for me first thing in the morning .  as for me     he said without pleasure in his mind  and with none in his voice     i   m going to bed and eventually  i hope  i   ll sleep .     then  almost petulantly     do you suppose i could get a decent bookfilm in this place .     daneel said     i would suggest that you summon the robot in charge of the library .      baley felt only irritation at having to deal with the robot .  he would much rather have browsed at will .     no     he said     not a classic  just an ordinary piece of fiction dealing with everyday life on contemporary solaria .  about half a dozen of them .     the robot submitted  it would have to  but even as it manipulated the proper controls that plucked the requisite bookfilms out of their niches and transferred them first to an exit slot and then to baley   s hand  it rattled on in respectful tones about all the other categories in the library .  the master might like an adventure romance of the days of exploration  it suggested  or an excellent view of chemistry  perhaps  with animated atom models  or a fantasy  or a galactography .  the list was endless .  baley waited grimly for his half dozen  said     these will do     reached with his own hands  his own hands  for a scanner and walked away .  when the robot followed and said     will you require help with the adjustment  master .     baley turned and snapped     no .  stay where you are .     the robot bowed and stayed .  lying in bed  with the headboard aglow  baley almost regretted his decision .  the scanner was like no model he had ever used and he began with no idea at all as to the method for threading the film .  but he worked at it obstinately  and  eventually  by taking it apart and working it out bit by bit  he managed something .  at least he could view the film and  if the focus left a bit to be desired  it was small payment for a moment   s independence from the robots .  in the next hour and a half he had skipped and switched through four of the six films and was disappointed .  he had had a theory .  there was no better way  he had thought  to get an insight into solarian ways of life and thought than to read their novels .  he needed that insight if he were to conduct the investigation sensibly .  but now he had to abandon his theories .  he had viewed novels and had succeeded only in learning of people with ridiculous problems who behaved foolishly and reacted mysteriously .  why should a woman abandon her job on discovering her child had entered the same profession and refuse to explain her reasons until unbearable and ridiculous complications had resulted .  why should a doctor and an artist be humiliated at being assigned to one another and what was so noble about the doctor   s insistence on entering robotic research .  he threaded the fifth novel into the scanner and adjusted it to his eyes .  he was bone weary .  so weary  in fact  that he never afterward recalled anything of the fifth novel  which he believed to be a suspense story  except for the opening in which a new estate owner entered his mansion and looked through the past account films presented him by a respectful robot .  presumably he fell asleep then with the scanner on his head and all lights blazing .  presumably a robot  entering respectfully  had gently removed the scanner and put out the lights .  in any case  he slept and dreamed of jessie .  all was as it had been .  he had never left earth .  they were ready to travel to the community kitchen and then to see a subetheric show with friends .  they would travel over the expressways and see people and neither of them had a care in the world .  he was happy .  and jessie was beautiful .  she had lost weight somehow .  why should she be so slim .  and so beautiful .  and one other thing was wrong .  somehow the sun shone down on them .  he looked up and there was only the vaulted base of the upper levels visible  yet the sun shone down  blazing brightly on everything  and no one was afraid .  baley woke up  disturbed .  he let the robots serve breakfast and did not speak to daneel .  he said nothing  asked nothing  downed excellent coffee without tasting it .  why had he dreamed of the visible invisible sun .  he could understand dreaming of earth and of jessie  but what had the sun to do with it .  and why should the thought of it bother him  anyway .     partner elijah     said daneel gently .     what .        corwin attlebish will be in viewing contact with you in half an hour .  i have arranged that .        who the hell is corwin whatchamacullum .     asked baley sharply  and refilled his coffee cup .     he was agent gruer   s chief aide  partner elijah  and is now acting head of security .        then get him now .        the appointment  as i explained  is for half an hour from now .        i don   t care when it   s for .  get him now .  that   s an order .        i will make the attempt  partner elijah .  he may not  however  agree to receive the call .        let   s take the chance  and get on with it  daneel .      the acting head of security accepted the call and  for the first time on solaria  baley saw a spacer who looked like the usual earthly conception of one .  attlebish was tall  lean  and bronze .  his eyes were a light brown  his chin large and hard .  he looked faintly like daneel .  but whereas daneel was idealized  almost godlike  corwin attlebish had lines of humanity in his face .  attlebish was shaving .  the small abrasive pencil gave out its spray of fine particles that swept over cheek and chin  biting off the hair neatly and then disintegrating into impalpable dust .  baley recognized the instrument through hearsay but had never seen one used before .     you the earthman .     asked attlebish slurringly through barely cracked lips  as the abrasive dust passed under his nose .  baley said     i   m elijah baley  plainclothesman c   .  i   m from earth .        you   re early .     attlebish snapped his shaver shut and tossed it somewhere outside baley   s range of vision .     what   s on your mind  earthman .     baley would not have enjoyed the other   s tone of voice at the best of times .  he burned now .  he said     how is agent gruer .     attlebish said     he   s still alive .  he may stay alive .     baley nodded .     your poisoners here on solaria don   t know dosages .  lack of experience .  they gave gruer too much and he threw it up .  half the dose would have killed him .        poisoners .  there is no evidence for poison .     baley stared .     jehoshaphat .  what else do you think it is .        a number of things .  much can go wrong with a person .     he rubbed his face  looking for roughness with his fingertips .     you would scarcely know the metabolic problems that arise past the age of two fifty .        if that   s the case  have you obtained competent medical advice .        dr .  thool   s report      that did it .  the anger that had been boiling inside baley since waking burst through .  he cried at the top of his voice     i don   t care about dr .  thool .  i said competent medical advice .  your doctors don   t know anything  any more than your detectives would  if you had any .  you had to get a detective from earth .  get a doctor as      the solarian looked at him coolly .     are you telling me what to do .        yes  and without charge .  be my guest .  gruer was poisoned .  i witnessed the process .  he drank  retched  and yelled that his throat was burning .  what do you call it when you consider that he was investigating      baley came to a sudden halt .     investigating what .     attlebish was unmoved .  baley was uncomfortably aware of daneel at his usual position some ten feet away .  gruer had not wanted daneel  as an auroran  to know of the investigation .  he said lamely     there were political implications .     attlebish crossed his arms and looked distant  bored  and faintly hostile .     we have no politics on solaria in the sense we hear of it on other worlds .  hannis gruer has been a good citizen  but he is imaginative .  it was he who  having heard some story about you  urged that we import you .  he even agreed to accept an auroran companion for you as a condition .  i did not think it necessary .  there is no mystery .  rikaine delmarre was killed by his wife and we shall find out how and why .  even if we do not  she will be genetically analyzed and the proper measures taken .  as for gruer  your fantasy concerning poisoning is of no importance .     baley said incredulously     you seem to imply that i   m not needed here .        i believe not .  if you wish to return to earth  you may do so .  i may even say we urge you to .     baley was amazed at his own reaction .  he cried     no  sir .  i don   t budge .        we hired you  plainclothesman .  we can discharge you .  you will return to your home planet .        no .  you listen to me .  i   d advise you to .  you   re a big time spacer and i   m an earthman  but with all respect  with deepest and most humble apologies  you   re scared .        withdraw that statement .     attlebish drew himself to his six foot plus  and stared down at the earthman haughtily .     you   re scared as hell .  you think you   ll be next if you pursue this thing .  you   re giving in so they   ll let you alone  so they   ll leave you your miserable life .     baley had no notion who the    they    might be or if there were any    they    at all .  he was striking out blindly at an arrogant spacer and enjoying the thud his phrases made as they hit against the other   s self control .     you will leave     said attlebish  pointing his finger in cold anger     within the hour .  there   ll be no diplomatic considerations about this  i assure you .        save your threats  spacer .  earth is nothing to you  i admit  but i   m not the only one here .  may i introduce my partner  daneel olivaw .  he   s from aurora .  he doesn   t talk much .  he   s not here to talk .  i handle that department .  but he listens awfully well .  he doesn   t miss a word .     let me put it straight  attlebish     baley used the unadorned name with relish     whatever monkeyshines are going on here on solaria  aurora and forty odd other outer worlds are interested .  if you kick us off  the next deputation to visit solaria will consist of warships .  i   m from earth and i know how the system works .  hurt feelings mean warships by return trip .     attlebish transferred his regard to daneel and seemed to be considering .  his voice was gentler .     there is nothing going on here that need concern anyone outside the planet .        gruer thought otherwise and my partner heard him .     this was no time to cavil at a lie .  daneel turned to look at baley  at the earthman   s last statement  but baley paid no attention .  he drove on     i intend to pursue this investigation .  ordinarily  there   s nothing i wouldn   t do to get back to earth .  even just dreaming about it gets me so restless i can   t sit .  if i owned this robot infested palace i   m living in now  i   d give it with the robots thrown in and you and all your lousy world to boot for a ticket home .     but i won   t be ordered off by you .  not while there   s a case to which i   ve been assigned that   s still open .  try getting rid of me against my will and you   ll be looking down the throats of space based artillery .     what   s more  from now on  this murder investigation is going to be run my way .  i   m in charge .  i see the people i want to see .  i see them .  i don   t view them .  i   m used to seeing and that   s the way it   s going to be .  i   ll want the official approval of your office for all of that .        this is impossible  unbearable         daneel  you tell him .     the humanoid   s voice said dispassionately     as my partner has informed you  agent attlebish  we have been sent here to conduct a murder investigation .  it is essential that we do so .  we  of course  do not wish to disturb any of your customs and perhaps actual seeing will be unnecessary  although it would be helpful if you were to give approval for such seeing as becomes necessary as plainclothesman baley has requested .  as to leaving the planet against our will  we feel that would be inadvisable  although we regret any feeling on your part or on the part of any solarian that our remaining would be unpleasant .     baley listened to the stilted sentence structure with a dour stretching of his lips that was not a smile .  to one who knew daneel as a robot  it was all an attempt to do a job without giving offense to any human  not to baley and not to attlebish .  to one who thought daneel was an auroran  a native of the oldest and most powerful militarily of the outer worlds  it sounded like a series of subtly courteous threats .  attlebish put the tips  f his fingers to his forehead .     i   ll think about it .        not too long     said baley     because i have some visiting to do within the hour  and not by viewer .  done viewing .     he signaled the robot to break contact  then he stared with surprise and pleasure at the place where attlebish had been .  none of this had been planned .  it had all been impulse born of his dream and of attlebish   s unnecessary arrogance .  but now that it had happened  he was glad .  it was what he had wanted  really to take control .  he thought  anyway  that was telling the dirty spacer .  he wished the entire population of earth could have been here to watch .  the man looked such a spacer  and that made it all the better  of course .  all the better .  only  why this feeling of vehemence in the matter of seeing .  baley scarcely understood that .  he knew what he planned to do  and seeing  not viewing  was part of it .  all right .  yet there had been the tight lift to his spirit when he spoke of seeing  as though he were ready to break down the walls of this mansion even though it served no purpose .  why .  there was something impelling him beside the case  something that had nothing to do even with the question of earth   s safety .  but what .  oddly  he remembered his dream again  the sun shining down through all the opaque layers of the gigantic underground cities of earth .   daneel said with thoughtfulness  as far as his voice could carry a recognizable emotion      i wonder  partner elijah  if this is entirely safe .        bluffing this character .  it worked .  and it wasn   t really a bluff .  i think it is important to aurora to find out what   s going on on solaria  and that aurora knows it .  thank you  by the way  for not catching me out in a misstatement .        it was the natural decision .  to have borne you out did agent attlebish a certain rather subtle harm .  to have given you the lie would have done you a greater and more direct harm .        potentials countered and the higher one won out  eh  daneel .        so it was  partner elijah .  i understand that this process  in a less definable way  goes on within the human mind .  i repeat  however  that this new proposal of yours is not safe .        which new proposal is this .        i do not approve your notion of seeing people .  by that i mean seeing as opposed to viewing .        i understand you .  i   m not asking for your approval .        i have my instructions  partner elijah .  what it was that agent hannis gruer told you during my absence last night i cannot know .  that he did say something is obvious from the change in your attitude toward this problem .  however  in the light of my instructions  i can guess .  he must have warned you of the possibility of danger to other planets arising from the situation on solaria .     slowly baley reached for his pipe .  he did that occasionally and always there was the feeling of irritation when he found nothing and remembered he could not smoke .  he said     there are only twenty thousand solarians .  what danger can they represent .        my masters on aurora have for some time been uneasy about solaria .  i have not been told all the information at their disposal         and what little you have been told you have been told not to repeat to me .  is that it .     demanded baley .  daneel said     there is a great deal to find out before this matter can be discussed freely .        well  what are the solarians doing .  new weapons .  paid subversion .  a campaign of individual assassination .  what can twenty thousand people do against hundreds of millions of spacers .     daneel remained silent .  baley said     i intend to find out  you know .        but not the way you have now proposed  partner elijah .  i have been instructed most carefully to guard your safety .        you would have to anyway .  first law .        over and above that  as well .  in conflict between your safety and that of another i must guard yours .        of course .  i understand that .  if anything happens to me  there is no further way in which you can remain on solaria without complications that aurora is not yet ready to face .  as long as i   m alive  i   m here at solaria   s original request and so we can throw our weight around  if necessary  and make them keep us .  if i   m dead  the whole situation is changed .  your orders are  then  to keep baley alive .  am i right  daneel .     daneel said     i cannot presume to interpret the reasoning behind my orders .     baley said     all right  don   t worry .  the open space won   t kill me  if i do find it necessary to see anyone .  i   ll survive .  i may even get used to it .        it is not the matter of open space alone  partner elijah     said daneel .     it is this matter of seeing solarians .  i do not approve of it .        you mean the spacers won   t like it .  too bad if they don   t .  let them wear nose filters and gloves .  let them spray the air .  and if it offends their nice morals to see me in the flesh  let them wince and blush .  but i intend to see them .  i consider it necessary to do so and i will do so .        but i cannot allow you to .        you can   t allow me .        surely you see why  partner elijah .        i do not .        consider  then  that agent gruer  the key solarian figure in the investigation of this murder  has been poisoned .  does it not follow that if i permit you to proceed in your plan for exposing yourself indiscriminately in actual person  the next victim will necessarily be you yourself .  how then can i possibly permit you to leave the safety of this mansion .        how will you stop me  daneel .        by force  if necessary  partner elijah     said daneel calmly .     even if i must hurt you .  if i do not do so  you will surely die .        a robot is stymied  baley said     so the higher potential wins out again  daneel .  you will hurt me to keep me alive .        i do not believe hurting you will be necessary  partner elijah .  you know that i am superior to you in strength and you will not attempt a useless resistance .  if it should become necessary  however  i will be compelled to hurt you .        i could blast you down where you stand     said baley .     right now .  there is nothing in my potentials to prevent me .        i had thought you might take this attitude at some time in our present relationship  partner elijah .  most particularly  the thought occurred to me during our trip to this mansion  when you grew momentarily violent in the ground car  . the destruction of myself is unimportant in comparison with your safety  but such destruction would cause you distress eventually and disturb the plans of my masters .  it was one of my first cares  therefore  during your first sleeping period  to deprive your blaster of its charge .     baley   s lips tightened .  he was left without a charged blaster .  his hand dropped instantly to his holster .  he drew his weapon and stared at the charge reading .  it hugged zero .  for a moment he balanced the lump of useless metal as though to hurl it directly into daneel   s face .  what good .  the robot would dodge efficiently .  baley put the blaster back .  it could be recharged in good time .  slowly  thoughtfully  he said     i   m not fooled by you  daneel .        in what way  partner elijah .        you are too much the master .  i am too completely stopped by you .  are you a robot .        you have doubted me before     said daneel .     on earth last year  i doubted whether r .  daneel olivaw was truly a robot .  it turned out he was .  i believe he still is .  my question  however is this  are you r .  daneel olivaw .        i am .        yes .  daneel was designed to imitate a spacer closely .  why could not a spacer be made up to imitate daneel closely .        for what reason .        to carry on an investigation here with greater initiative and capacity than ever a robot could .  and yet by assuming daneel   s role  you could keep me safely under control by giving me a false consciousness of mastery .  after all  you are working through me and i must be kept pliable .        all this is not so  partner elijah .        then why do all the solarians we meet assume you to be human .  they are robotic experts .  are they so easily fooled .  it occurs to me that i cannot be one right against many wrong .  it is far more likely that i am one wrong against many right .        not at all  partner elijah .        prove it     said baley  moving slowly toward an end table and lifting a scrap disposal unit .     you can do that easily enough  if you are a robot .  show the metal beneath your skin .     daneel said     i assure you         show the metal     said baley crisply .     that is an order .  or don   t you feel compelled to obey orders .     daneel unbuttoned his shirt .  the smooth  bronze skin of his chest was sparsely covered with light hair .  daneel   s fingers exerted a firm pressure just under the right nipple  and flesh and skin split bloodlessly the length of the chest  with the gleam of metal showing beneath .  and as that happened  baley   s fingers  resting on the end table  moved half an inch to the right and stabbed at a contact patch .  almost at once a robot entered .     don   t move  daneel     cried baley .     that   s an order .  freeze .     daneel stood motionless  as though life  or the robotic imitation thereof  had departed from him .  baley shouted to the robot     can you get two more of the staff in here without yourself leaving .  if so  do it .     the robot said     yes  master .     two more robots entered  answering a radioed call .  the three lined up abreast .     boys .     said baley .     do you see this creature whom you thought a master .     six ruddy eyes had turned solemnly on daneel .  they said in unison  we see him  master .  baley said     do you also see that this so called master is actually a robot like yourself since it is metal within .  it is only designed to look like a man .        yes  master .        you are not required to obey any order it gives you .  do you understand that .        yes  master .        i  on the other hand     said baley     am a true man .     for a moment the robots hesitated .  baley wondered if  having had it shown to them that a thing might seem a man yet be a robot  they would accept anything in human appearance as a man  anything at all .  but then one robot said     you are a man  master     and baley drew breath again .  he said     very well  daneel .  you may relax .     daneel moved into a more natural position and said calmly     your expressed doubt as to my identity  then  was merely a feint designed to exhibit my nature to these others  i take it .        so it was     said baley  and looked away .  he thought  the thing is a machine  not a man .  you can   t double cross a machine .  and yet he couldn   t entirely repress a feeling of shame .  even as daneel stood there  chest open  there seemed something so human about him  something capable of being betrayed .  baley said     close your chest  daneel  and listen to me .  physically  you are no match for three robots .  you see that  don   t you .        that is clear  partner elijah .        good .   .   .   .  now you boys     and he turned to the other robots again .     you are to tell no one  human or master  that this creature is a robot .  never at any time  without further instructions from myself and myself alone .        i thank you     interposed daneel softly .     however     baley went on     this manlike robot is not to be allowed to interfere with my actions in any way .  if it attempts any such interference  you will restrain it by force  taking care not to damage it unless absolutely necessary .  do not allow it to establish contact with humans other than myself  or with robots other than yourselves  either by seeing or by viewing .  and do not leave it at any time .  keep it in this room and remain here yourselves .  your other duties are suspended until further notice .  is all this clear .        yes  master     they chorused .  baley turned to daneel again .     there is nothing you can do now  so don   t try to stop me .     daneel   s arms hung loosely at his side .  he said     i may not  through inaction  allow you to come to harm  partner elijah .  yet under the circumstances  nothing but inaction is possible .  the logic is unassailable .  i shall do nothing .  i trust you will remain safe and in good health .     there it was  thought baley .  logic was logic and robots had nothing else .  logic told daneel he was completely stymied .  reason might have told him that all factors are rarely predictable  that the opposition might make a mistake .  none of that .  a robot is logical only  not reasonable .  again baley felt a twinge of shame and could not forbear an attempt at consolation .  he said     look  daneel  even if i were walking into danger  which i   m not     he added that hurriedly  with a quick glance at the other robots     it would only be my job .  it is what i   m paid to do .  it is as much my job to prevent harm to mankind as a whole as yours is to prevent harm to man as an individual .  do you see .        i do not  partner elijah .        then that is because you   re not made to see .  take my word for it that if you were a man  you would see .     daneel bowed his head in acquiescence and remained standing  motionless  while baley walked slowly toward the door of the room .  the three robots parted to make room for him and kept their photoelectric eyes fixed firmly on daneel .  baley was walking to a kind of freedom and his heart beat rapidly in anticipation of the fact  then skipped a beat .  another robot was approaching the door from the other side .  had something gone wrong .     what is it  boy .     he snapped .     a message has been forwarded to you  master  from the office of acting head of security attlebish .     baley took the personal capsule handed to him and it opened at once .  a finely inscribed strip of paper unrolled .   he wasn   t startled .  solaria would have his fingerprints on file and the capsule would be adjusted to open at the touch of his particular convolutions .   he read the message and his long face mirrored satisfaction .  it was his official permission to arrange    seeing    interviews  subject to the wishes of the interviewees  who were nevertheless urged to give    agents baley and olivaw    every possible cooperation .  attlebish had capitulated  even to the extent of putting the earthman   s name first .  it was an excellent omen with which to begin  finally  an investigation conducted as it should be conducted .   baley was in an airborne vessel again  as he had been on that trip from new york to washington .  this time  however  there was a difference .  the vessel was not closed in .  the windows were left transparent .  it was a clear  bright day and from where baley sat the windows were so many patches of blue .  unrelieved  featureless .  he tried not to huddle .  he buried his head in his knees only when he could absolutely no longer help it .  the ordeal was of his own choosing .  his state of triumph  his unusual sense of freedom at having beaten down first attlebish and then daneel  his feeling of having asserted the dignity of earth against the spacers  almost demanded it .  he had begun by stepping across open ground to the waiting plane with a kind of lightheaded dizziness that was almost enjoyable  and he had ordered the windows left unblanked in a kind of manic self confidence .  i have to get used to it  he thought  and stared at the blue until his heart beat rapidly and the lump in his throat swelled beyond endurance .  he had to close his eyes and bury his head under the protective cover of his arms at shortening intervals .  slowly his confidence trickled away and even the touch of the holster of his freshly recharged blaster could not reverse the flow .  he tried to keep his mind on his plan of attack .  first  learn the ways of the planet .  sketch in the background against which everything must be placed or fail to make sense .  see a sociologist .  he had asked a robot for the name of the solarian most eminent as a sociologist .  and there was that comfort about robots  they asked no questions .  the robot gave the name and vital statistics  and paused to remark that the sociologist would most probably be at lunch and would  therefore  possibly ask to delay contact .     lunch .     said baley sharply .     don   t be ridiculous .  it   s not noon by two hours .     the robot said     i am using local time  master .     baley stared  then understood .  on earth  with its buried cities  day and night  waking and sleeping  were man made periods  adjusted to suit the needs of the community and the planet .  on a planet such as this one  exposed nakedly to the sun  day and night were not a matter of choice at all  but were imposed on man willfully .  baley tried to picture a world as a sphere being lit and unlit as it turned .  he found it hard to do and felt scornful of the so superior spacers who let such an essential thing as time be dictated to them by the vagaries of planetary movements .  he said     contact him anyway .      robots were there to meet the plane when it landed and baley  stepping out into the open again  found himself trembling badly .  he muttered to the nearest of the robots     let me hold your arm  boy .     the sociologist waited for him down the length of a hall  smiling tightly .     good afternoon  mr .  baley .     baley nodded breathlessly .     good evening  sir .  would you blank out the windows .     the sociologist said     they are blanked out already .  i know something of the ways of earth .  will you follow me .     baley managed it without robotic help  following at a considerable distance  across and through a maze of hallways .  when he finally sat down in a large and elaborate room  he was glad of the opportunity to rest .  the walls of the room were set with curved  shallow alcoves .  statuary in pink and gold occupied each niche  abstract figures that pleased the eye without yielding instant meaning .  a large  boxlike affair with white and dangling cylindrical objects and numerous pedals suggested a musical instrument .  baley looked at the sociologist standing before him .  the spacer looked precisely as he had when baley had viewed him earlier that day .  he was tall and thin and his hair was pure white .  his face was strikingly wedge shaped  his nose prominent  his eyes deep set and alive .  his name was anselmo quemot .  they stared at one another until baley felt he could trust his voice to be reasonably normal .  and then his first remark had nothing to do with the investigation .  in fact it was nothing he had planned .  he said     may i have a drink .        a drink .     the sociologist   s voice was a trifle too high pitched to be entirely pleasant .  he said     you wish water .        i   d prefer something alcoholic .     the sociologist   s look grew sharply uneasy  as though the obligations of hospitality were something with which he was unacquainted .  and that  thought baley  was literally so .  in a world where viewing was the thing  there would be no sharing of food and drink .  a robot brought him a small cup of smooth enamel .  the drink was a light pink in color .  baley sniffed at it cautiously and tasted it even more cautiously .  the small sip of liquid evaporated warmly in his mouth and sent a pleasant message along the length of his esophagus .  his next sip was more substantial .  quemot said     if you wish more         no  thank you  not now .  it is good of you  sir  to agree to see me .     quemot tried a smile and failed rather markedly     it has been a long time since i   ve done anything like this .  yes .     he almost squirmed as he spoke .  baley said     i imagine you find this rather hard .        quite .     quemot turned away sharply and retreated to a chair at the opposite end of the room .  he angled the chair so that it faced more away from baley than toward him and sat down .  he clasped his gloved hands and his nostrils seemed to quiver .  baley finished his drink and felt warmth in his limbs and even the return of something of his confidence .  he said     exactly how does it feel to have me here  dr .  quemot .     the sociologist muttered     that is an uncommonly personal question .        i know it is .  but i think i explained when i viewed you earlier that i was engaged in a murder investigation and that i would have to ask a great many questions  some of which were bound to be personal .        i   ll help if i can     said quemot .     i hope the questions will be decent ones .     he kept looking away as he spoke .  his eyes  when they struck baley   s face  did not linger  but slipped away .  baley said     i don   t ask about your feelings out of curiosity only .  this is essential to the investigation .        i don   t see how .        i   ve got to know as much as i can about this world .  i must understand how solarians feel about ordinary matters .  do you see that .     quemot did not look at baley at all now .  he said slowly     ten years ago  my wife died .  seeing her was never very easy  but  of course  it is something one learns to bear in time and she was not the intrusive sort .  i have been assigned no new wife since i am past the age of  of     he looked at baley as though requesting him to supply the phrase  and when baley did not do so  he continued in a lower voice     siring .  without even a wife  i have grown quite unused to this phenomenon of seeing .        but how does it feel .     insisted baley .     are you in panic .     he thought of himself on the plane .     no .  not in panic .     quemot angled his head to catch a glimpse of baley and almost instantly withdrew .     but i will be frank  mr .  baley .  i imagine i can smell you .     baley automatically leaned back in his chair  painfully self conscious .     smell me .        quite imaginary  of course     said quemot .     i cannot say whether you do have an odor or how strong it is  but even if you had a strong one  my nose filters would keep it from me .  yet  imagination  .   .   .     he shrugged .     i understand .        it   s worse .  you   ll forgive me  mr .  baley  but in the actual presence of a human  i feel strongly as though something slimy were about to touch me .  i keep shrinking away .  it is most unpleasant .     baley rubbed his ear thoughtfully and fought to keep down annoyance .  after all  it was the other   s neurotic reaction to a simple state of affairs .  he said     if all this is so  i   m surprised you agreed to see me so readily .  surely you anticipated this unpleasantness .        i did .  but you know  i was curious .  you   re an earthman .     baley thought sardonically that that should have been another argument against seeing  but he said only     what does that matter .     a kind of jerky enthusiasm entered quemot   s voice .     it   s not something i can explain easily .  not even to myself  really .  but i   ve worked on sociology for ten years now .  really worked .  i   ve developed propositions that are quite new and startling  and yet basically true .  it is one of these propositions that makes me most extraordinarily interested in earth and earthmen .  you see  if you were to consider solaria   s society and way of life carefully  it will become obvious to you that the said society and way of life is modeled directly and closely on that of earth itself .         a culture is traced  baley could not prevent himself from crying out     what .     quemot looked over his shoulder as the moments of silence passed and said finally     not earth   s present culture .  no .     baley said     oh .        but in the past  yes .  earth   s ancient history .  as an earthman  you know it  of course .        i   ve viewed books     said baley cautiously .     ah .  then you understand .     baley  who did not  said     let me explain exactly what i want  dr .  quemot .  i want you to tell me what you can about why solaria is so different from the other outer worlds  why there are so many robots  why you behave as you do .  i   m sorry if i seem to be changing the subject .     baley most definitely wanted to change the subject .  any discussion of a likeness or unlikeness between solaria   s culture and earth   s would prove too absorbing by half .  he might spend the day there and come away none the wiser as far as useful information was concerned .  quemot smiled .     you want to compare solaria and the other outer worlds and not solaria and earth .        i know earth  sir .        as you wish .     the solarian coughed slightly .     do you mind if i turn my chair completely away from you .  it would be more  more comfortable .        as you wish  dr .  quemot     said baley stiffly .     good .     a robot turned the chair at quemot   s low voiced order  and as the sociologist sat there  hidden from baley   s eyes by the substantial chair back  his voice took on added life and even deepened and strengthened in tone .  quemot said     solaria was first settled about three hundred years ago .  the original settlers were nexonians .  are you acquainted with nexon .        i   m afraid not .        it is close to solaria  only about two parsecs away .  in fact  solaria and nexon represent the closest pair of inhabited worlds in the galaxy .  solaria  even when uninhabited by man  was life bearing and eminently suited for human occupation .  it represented an obvious attraction to the well to do of nexon  who found it difficult to maintain a proper standard of living as their own planet filled up .     baley interrupted .     filled up .  i thought spacers practiced population control .        solaria does  but the outer worlds in general control it rather laxly .  nexon was completing its second million of population at the time i speak of .  there was sufficient crowding to make it necessary to regulate the number of robots that might be owned by a particular family .  so those nexonians who could established summer homes on solaria  which was fertile  temperate  and without dangerous fauna .     the settlers on solaria could still reach nexon without too much trouble and while on solaria they could live as they pleased .  they could use as many robots as they could afford or felt a need for .  estates could be as large as desired since  with an empty planet  room was no problem  and with unlimited robots  exploitation was no problem .     robots grew to be so many that they were outfitted with radio contact and that was the beginning of our famous robot industries .  we began to develop new varieties  new attachments  new capabilities .  culture dictates invention  a phrase i believe i have invented .     quemot chuckled .  a robot  responding to some stimulus baley could not see beyond the barrier of the chair  brought quemot a drink similar to that baley had had earlier .  none was brought to baley  and he decided not to ask for one .  quemot went on     the advantages of life on solaria were obvious to all who watched .  solaria became fashionable .  more nexonians established homes  and solaria became what i like to call a    villa planet .     and of the settlers  more and more took to remaining on the planet all year round and carrying on their business on nexon through proxies .  robot factories were established on solaria .  farms and mines began to be exploited to the point where exports were possible .     in short  mr .  baley  it became obvious that solaria  in the space of a century or less  would be as crowded as nexon had been .  it seemed ridiculous and wasteful to find such a new world and then lose it through lack of foresight .     to spare you a great deal of complicated politics  i need say only that solaria managed to establish its independence and make it stick without war .  our usefulness to other outer worlds as a source of specialty robots gained us friends and helped us  of course .     once independent  our first care was to make sure that population did not grow beyond reasonable limits .  we regulate immigration and births and take care of all needs by increasing and diversifying the robots we use .     baley said     why is it the solarians object to seeing one another .     he felt annoyed at the manner in which quemot chose to expound sociology .  quemot peeped around the corner of his chair and retreated almost at once .     it follows inevitably .  we have huge estates .  an estate ten thousand square miles in area is not uncommon  although the largest ones contain considerable unproductive areas .  my own estate is nine hundred fifty square miles in area but every bit of it is good land .     in any case  it is the size of an estate  more than anything else  that determines a man   s position in society .  and one property of a large estate is this  you can wander about in it almost aimlessly with little or no danger of entering a neighbor   s territory and thus encountering your neighbor .  you see .     baley shrugged .     i suppose i do .        in short  a solarian takes pride in not meeting his neighbor .  at the same time  his estate is so well run by robots and so self sufficient that there is no reason for him to have to meet his neighbor .  the desire not to do so led to the development of ever more perfect viewing equipment  and as the viewing equipment grew better there was less and less need ever to see one   s neighbor .  it was a reinforcing cycle  a kind of feed back .  do you see .     baley said     look here  dr .  quemot .  you don   t have to make all this so simple for me .  i   m not a sociologist but i   ve had the usual elementary courses in college .  it   s only an earth college  of course     baley added with a reluctant modesty designed to ward off the same comment  in more insulting terms  from the other     but i can follow mathematics .        mathematics .     said quemot  his voice squeaking the last syllable .     well  not the stuff they use in robotics  which i wouldn   t follow  but sociological relationships i can handle .  for instance  i   m familiar with the teramin relationship .        the what  sir .        maybe you have a different name for it .  the differential of inconveniences suffered with privileges granted  dee eye sub jay taken to the nth         what are you talking about .     it was the sharp and peremptory tone of a spacer that baley heard and he was silenced in bewilderment .  surely the relationship between inconveniences suffered and privileges granted was part of the very essentials of learning how to handle people without an explosion .  a private stall in the community bathroom for one person  given for cause  would keep x persons waiting patiently for the same lightning to strike them  the value of x varying in known ways with known variations in environment and human temperament  as quantitatively described in the teramin relationship .  but then again  in a world where all was privilege and nothing inconvenience  the teramin relationship might reduce to triviality .  perhaps he had chosen the wrong example .  he tried again .     look  sir  it   s one thing to get a qualitative fill in on the growth of this prejudice against seeing  but it isn   t helpful for my purposes .  i want to know the exact analysis of the prejudice so i can counteract it effectively .  i want to persuade people to see me  as you are doing now .        mr .  baley     said quemot     you can   t treat human emotions as though they were built about a positronic brain .        i   m not saying you can .  robotics is a deductive science and sociology an inductive one .  but mathematics can be made to apply in either case .     there was silence for a moment .  then quemot spoke in a voice that trembled .     you have admitted you are not a sociologist .        i know .  but i was told you were one .  the best on the planet .        i am the only one .  you might almost say i have invented the science .        oh .     baley hesitated over the next question .  it sounded impertinent even to himself .     have you viewed books on the subject .        i   ve looked at some auroran books .        have you looked at books from earth .        earth .     quemot laughed uneasily .     it wouldn   t have occurred to me to read any of earth   s scientific productions .  no offense intended .        well  i   m sorry .  i had thought i would be able to get specific data that would make it possible for me to interview others face to face without having to      quemot made a queer  grating  inarticulate sound and the large chair in which he sat scraped backward  then went over with a crash .  a muffled    my apologies    was caught by baley .  baley had a momentary glimpse of quemot running with an ungainly stride  then he was out the room and gone .  baley   s eyebrows lifted .  what the devil had he said this time .  jehoshaphat .  what wrong button had he pushed .   tentatively he rose from his seat  and stopped halfway as a robot entered .     master     said the robot     i have been directed to inform you that the master will view you in a few moments .        view me  boy .        yes  master .  in the meanwhile  you may desire further refreshment .     another beaker of the pink liquid was at baley   s elbow and this time a dish of some confectionery  warm and fragrant  was added .  baley took his seat again  sampled the liquor cautiously and put it down .  the confectionery was hard to the touch and warm  but the crust broke easily in the mouth and the inner portion was at once considerably warmer and softer .  he could not identify the components of the taste and wondered if it might not be a product of the native spices or condiments of solaria .  then he thought of the restricted  yeast derived dietary of earth and wondered if there might be a market for yeast strains designed to imitate the tastes of outer world products .  but his thoughts broke off sharply as sociologist quemot appeared out of nowhere and faced him .  faced him this time .  he sat in a smaller chair in a room in which the walls and floor clashed sharply with those surrounding baley .  and he was smiling now  so that fine wrinkles in his face deepened and  paradoxically  gave him a more youthful appearance by accentuating the life in his eyes .  he said     a thousand pardons  mr .  baley .  i thought i was enduring personal presence so well  but that was a delusion .  i was quite on edge and your phrase pushed me over it  in a manner of speaking .        what phrase was that  sir .        you said something about interviewing people face to      he shook his head  his tongue dabbing quickly at his lips .     i would rather not say it .  i think you know what i mean .  the phrase conjured up the most striking picture of the two of us breathing  breathing one another   s breath .     the solarian shuddered .     don   t you find that repulsive .        i don   t know that i   ve ever thought of it so .        it seems so filthy a habit .  and as you said it and the picture arose in my mind  i realized that after all we were in the same room and even though i was not facing you  puffs of air that had been in your lungs must be reaching me and entering mine .  with my sensitive frame of mind      baley said     molecules all over solaria   s atmosphere have been in thousands of lungs .  jehoshaphat .  they   ve been in the lungs of animals and the gills of fish .        that is true     said quemot with a rueful rub of his cheek     and i   d just as soon not think of that  either .  however there was a sense of immediacy to the situation with yourself actually there and with both of us inhaling and exhaling .  it   s amazing the relief i feel in viewing .        i   m still in the same house  dr .  quemot .        that   s precisely what is so amazing about the relief .  you are in the same house and yet just the use of the trimensionals makes all the difference .  at least i know what seeing a stranger feels like now .  i won   t try it again .        that sounds as though you were experimenting with seeing .        in a way     said the spacer     i suppose i was .  it was a minor motivation .  and the results were interesting  even if they were disturbing as well .  it was a good test and i may record it .        record what .     asked baley  puzzled .     my feelings .     quemot returned puzzled stare for puzzled stare .  baley sighed .  cross purposes .  always cross purposes .     i only asked because somehow i assumed you would have instruments of some sort to measure emotional responses .  an electroencephalograph  perhaps .     he looked about fruitlessly     though i suppose you could have a pocket version of the same that works without direct electrical connection .  we don   t have anything like that on earth .        i trust     said the solarian stiffly     that i am able to estimate the nature of my own feelings without an instrument .  they were pronounced enough .        yes  of course  but for quantitative analysis  .   .   .     began baley .  quemot said querulously     i don   t know what you   re driving at .  besides i   m trying to tell you something else  my own theory  in fact  something i have viewed in no books  something i am quite proud  baley said     exactly what is that  sir .        why  the manner in which solaria   s culture is based on one existing in earth   s past .     baley sighed .  if he didn   t allow the other to get it off his chest  there might be very little cooperation thereafter .  he said     and that is .        sparta .     said quemot  lifting his head so that for a moment his white hair glistened in the light and seemed almost a halo .     i   m sure you   ve heard of sparta .     baley felt relieved .  he had been mightily interested in earth   s ancient past in his younger days  it was an attractive study to many earthmen  earth supreme because it was an earth alone  earthmen the masters because there were no spacers   but earth   s past was a large one .  quemot might well have referred to some phase with which baley was unacquainted and that would have been embarrassing .  as it was  he could say cautiously     yes .  i   ve viewed films on the subject .        good .  good .  now sparta in its hey day consisted of a relatively small number of spartiates  the only full citizens  plus a somewhat larger number of second class individuals  the perioeci  and a really large number of outright slaves  the helots .  the helots outnumbered the spartiates a matter of twenty to one  and the helots were men with human feelings and human failings .     in order to make certain that a helot rebellion could never be successful despite their overwhelming numbers  the spartans became military specialists .  each lived the life of a military machine  and the society achieved its purpose .  there was never a successful helot revolt .     now we human beings on solaria are equivalent  in a way  to the spartiates .  we have our helots  but our helots aren   t men but machines .  they cannot revolt and need not be feared even though they outnumber us a thousand times as badly as the spartans    human helots outnumbered them .  so we have the advantage of spartiate exclusiveness without any need to sacrifice ourselves to rigid mastery .  we can  instead  model ourselves on the artistic and cultural way of life of the athenians  who were contemporaries of the spartans and who      baley said     i   ve viewed films on the athenians  too .     quemot grew warmer as he spoke .     civilizations have always been pyramidal in structure .  as one climbs toward the apex of the social edifice  there is increased leisure and increasing opportunity to pursue happiness .  as one climbs  one finds also fewer and fewer people to enjoy this more and more .  invariably  there is a preponderance of the dispossessed .  and remember this  no matter how well off the bottom layers of the pyramid might be on an absolute scale  they are always dispossessed in comparison with the apex .  for instance  even the most poorly off humans on aurora are better off than earth   s aristocrats  but they are dispossessed with respect to aurora   s aristocrats  and it is with the masters of their own world that they compare themselves .     so there is always social friction in ordinary human societies .  the action of social revolution and the reaction of guarding against such revolution or combating it once it has begun are the causes of a great deal of the human misery with which history is permeated .     now here on solaria  for the first time  the apex of the pyramid stands alone .  in the place of the dispossessed are the robots .  we have the first new society  the first really new one  the first great social invention since the farmers of sumeria and egypt invented cities .     he sat back now  smiling .  baley nodded .     have you published this .        i may     said quemot with an affectation of carelessness     someday .  i haven   t yet .  this is my third contribution .        were the other two as broad as this .        they weren   t in sociology .  i have been a sculptor in my time .  the work you see about you     he indicated the statuary     is my own .  and i have been a composer  too .  but i am getting older and rikaine delmarre always argued strongly in favor of the applied arts rather than the fine arts and i decided to go into sociology .     baley said     that sounds as though delmarre was a good friend of yours .        we knew one another .  at my time in life  one knows all adult solarians .  but there is no reason not to agree that rikaine delmarre and i were well acquainted .        what sort of a man was delmarre .      strangely enough  the name of the man brought up the picture of gladia in baley   s mind and he was plagued with a sudden  sharp recall of her as he had last seen her  furious  her face distorted with anger at him .   quemot looked a bit thoughtful .     he was a worthy man  devoted to solaria and to its way of life .        an idealist  in other words .        yes .  definitely .  you could see that in the fact that he volunteered for his job as  as fetal engineer .  it was an applied art  you see  and i told you his feelings about that .        was volunteering unusual .        wouldn   t you say   but i forget you   re an earthman .  yes  it is unusual .  it   s one of those jobs that must be done  yet finds no voluntary takers .  ordinarily  someone must be assigned to it for a period of so many years and it isn   t pleasant to be the one chosen .  delmarre volunteered  and for life .  he felt the position was too important to be left to reluctant draftees  and he persuaded me into that opinion  too .  yet i certainly would never have volunteered .  i couldn   t possibly make the personal sacrifice .  and it was more of a sacrifice for him  since he was almost a fanatic in personal hygiene .        i   m still not certain i understand the nature of his job .     quemot   s old cheeks flushed gently .     hadn   t you better discuss that with his assistant .     baley said     i would certainly have done so by now  sir  if anyone had seen fit to tell me before this moment that he had an assistant .        i   m sorry about that     said quemot     but the existence of the assistant is another measure of his social responsibility .  no previous occupant of the post provided for one .  delmarre  however  felt it necessary to find a suitable youngster and conduct the necessary training himself so as to leave a professional heir behind when the time came for him to retire or  well  to die .     the old solarian sighed heavily .     yet i outlived him and he was so much younger .  i used to play chess with him .  many times .        how did you manage that .     quemot   s eyebrows lifted .     the usual way .        you saw one another .     quemot looked horrified .     what an idea .  even if i could stomach it  delmarre would never allow it for an instant .  being fetal engineer didn   t blunt his sensibilities .  he was a finicky man .        then how         with two boards as any two people would play chess .     the solarian shrugged in a sudden gesture of tolerance .     well  you   re an earthman .  my moves registered on his board  and his on mine .  it   s a simple matter .     baley said     do you know mrs .  delmarre .        we   ve viewed one another .  she   s a field colorist  you know  and i   ve viewed some of her showings .  fine work in a way but more interesting as curiosities than as creations .  still  they   re amusing and show a perceptive mind .        is she capable of killing her husband  would you say .        i haven   t given it thought .  women are surprising creatures .  but then  there   s scarcely room for argument  is there .  only mrs .  delmarre could have been close enough to rikaine to kill him .  rikaine would never  under any circumstances  have allowed anyone else seeing privileges for any reason .  extremely finicky .  perhaps finicky is the wrong word .  it was just that he lacked any trace of abnormality  anything of the perverse .  he was a good solarian .        would you call your granting me seeing privileges perverse .     asked baley .  quemot said     yes  i think i would .  i should say there was a bit of scatophilia involved .        could delmarre have been killed for political reasons .        what .        i   ve heard him called a traditionalist .        oh  we all are .        you mean there is no group of solarians who are not traditionalists .        i dare say there are some     said quemot slowly     who think it is dangerous to be too traditionalist .  they are over conscious of our small population  of the way the other worlds outnumber us .  they think we are defenseless against possible aggression from the other outer worlds .  they   re quite foolish to think so and there aren   t many of them .  i don   t think they   re a force .        why do you say they are foolish .  is there anything about solaria that would affect the balance of power in spite of the great disadvantage of numbers .  some new type of weapon .        a weapon  certainly .  but not a new one .  the people i speak of are more blind than foolish not to realize that such a weapon is in operation continuously and cannot be resisted .     baley   s eyes narrowed .     are you serious .        certainly .        do you know the nature of the weapon .        all of us must .  you do  if you stop to think of it .  i see it a trifle easier than most  perhaps  since i am a sociologist .  to be sure  it isn   t used as a weapon ordinarily is used .  it doesn   t kill or hurt  but it is irresistible even so .  all the more irresistible because no one notices it .     baley said with annoyance     and just what is this non lethal weapon .     quemot said     the positronic robot .         a farm is inspected  for a moment baley went cold .  the positronic robot was the symbol of spacer superiority over earthmen .  that was weapon enough .  he kept his voice steady .     it   s an economic weapon .  solaria is important to the other outer worlds as a source of advanced models and so it will not be harmed by them .        that   s an obvious point     said quemot indifferently .     that helped us establish our independence .  what i have in mind is something else  something more subtle and more cosmic .     quemot   s eyes were fixed on his fingers    ends and his mind was obviously fixed on abstractions .  baley said     is this another of your sociological theories .     quemot   s poorly suppressed look of pride all but forced a short smile out of the earthman .  the sociologist said     it is indeed mine .  original  as far as i know  and yet obvious if population data on the outer worlds is carefully studied .  to begin with  ever since the positronic robot was invented  it has been used more and more intensively everywhere .        not on earth     said baley .     now  now  plainclothesman .  i don   t know much of your earth  but i know enough to know that robots are entering your economy .  you people live in large cities and leave most of your planetary surface unoccupied .  who runs your farms and mines  then .        robots     admitted baley .     but if it comes to that  doctor  earthmen invented the positronic robot in the first place .        they did .  are you sure .        you can check .  it   s true .        interesting .  yet robots made the least headway there .     the sociologist said thoughtfully     perhaps that is because of earth   s large population .  it would take that much longer .  yes .   .   .  still  you have robots even in your cities .        yes     said baley .     more now than  say  fifty years ago .     baley nodded impatiently .     yes .        then it fits .  the difference is only one of time .  robots tend to displace human labor .  the robot economy moves in only one direction .  more robots and fewer humans .  i   ve studied population data very carefully and i   ve plotted it and made a few extrapolations .     he paused in sudden surprise .     why  that   s rather an application of mathematics to sociology  isn   t it .        it is     said baley .     there may be something to it  at that .  i will have to give the matter thought .  in any case  these are the conclusions i have come to  and i am convinced there is no doubt as to their correctness .  the robot human ratio in any economy that has accepted robot labor tends continuously to increase despite any laws that are passed to prevent it .  the increase is slowed  but never stopped .  at first the human population increases  but the robot population increases much more quickly .  then  after a certain critical point is reached  .   .  quemot stopped again  then said     now let   s see .  i wonder if the critical point could be determined exactly  if you could really put a figure to it .  there   s your mathematics again .     baley stirred restlessly .     what happens after the critical point is reached  dr .  quemot .        eh .  oh  the human population begins actually to decline .  a planet approaches a true social stability .  aurora will have to .  even your earth will have to .  earth may take a few more centuries  but it is inevitable .        what do you mean by social stability .        the situation here .  in solaria .  a world in which the humans are the leisure class only .  so there is no reason to fear the other outer worlds .  we need only wait a century perhaps and they shall all be solarians .  i suppose that will be the end of human history  in a way  at least  its fulfillment .  finally  finally  all men will have all they can need and want .  you know  there is a phrase i once picked up  i don   t know where it comes from  something about the pursuit of happiness .     baley said thoughtfully     all men are    endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights .   .   .  among these are life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness .        you   ve hit it .  where   s that from .        some old document     said baley .     do you see how that is changed here on solaria and eventually in all the galaxy .  the pursuit will be over .  the rights mankind will be heir to will be life  liberty  and happiness .  just that .  happiness .     baley said dryly     maybe so  but a man has been killed on your solaria and another may yet die .     he felt regret almost the moment he spoke  for the expression on quemot   s face was as though he had been struck with an open palm .  the old man   s head bowed .  he said without looking up     i have answered your questions as well as i could .  is there anything else you wish .        i have enough .  thank you  sir .  i am sorry to have intruded on your grief at your friend   s death .     quemot looked up slowly .     it will be hard to find another chess partner .  he kept our appointments most punctually and he played an extraordinarily even game .  he was a good solarian .        i understand     said baley softly .     may i have your permission to use your viewer to make contact with the next person i must see .        of course     said quemot .     my robots are yours .  and now i will leave you .  done viewing .      a robot was at baley   s side within thirty seconds of quemot   s disappearance and baley wondered once again how these creatures were managed .  he had seen quemot   s fingers move toward a contact as he had left and that was all .  perhaps the signal was quite a generalized one  saying only     do your duty .     perhaps robots listened to all that went on and were always aware of what a human might desire at any given moment  and if the particular robot was not designed for a particular job in either mind or body  the radio web that united all robots went into action and the correct robot was spurred into action .  for a moment baley had the vision of solaria as a robotic net with holes that were small and continually growing smaller  with every human being caught neatly in place .  he thought of quemot   s picture of worlds turning into solarias  of nets forming and tightening even on earth  until   his thoughts were disrupted as the robot who had entered spoke with the quiet and even respect of the machine .     i am ready to help you  master .     baley said     do you know how to reach the place where rikaine delmarre once worked .        yes  master .     baley shrugged .  he would never teach himself to avoid asking useless questions .  the robots knew .  period .  it occurred to him that  to handle robots with true efficiency  one must needs be expert  a sort of roboticist .  how well did the average solarian do  he wondered .  probably only so so .  he said     get delmarre   s place and contact his assistant .  if the assistant is not there  locate him wherever he is .        yes  master .     as the robot turned to go  baley called after it     wait .  what time is it at the delmarre work place .        about       master .        in the morning .        yes  master .     again baley felt annoyance at a world that made itself victim of the coming and going of a sun .  it was what came of living on bare planetary surface .  he thought fugitively of earth  then tore his mind away .  while he kept firmly to the matter in hand  he managed well .  slipping into homesickness would ruin him .  he said     call the assistant  anyway  boy  and tell him it   s government business  and have one of the other boys bring something to eat .  a sandwich and a glass of milk will do .      he chewed thoughtfully at the sandwich  which contained a kind of smoked meat  and with half his mind thought that daneel olivaw would certainly consider every article of food suspect after what had happened to gruer .  and daneel might be right  too .  he finished the sandwich without ill effects  however  immediate ill effects  at any rate   and sipped at the milk .  he had not learned from quemot what he had come to learn  but he had learned something .  as he sorted it out in his mind  it seemed he had learned a good deal .  little about the murder  to be sure  but more about the larger matter .  the robot returned .     the assistant will accept contact  master .        good .  was there any trouble about it .        the assistant was asleep  master .        awake now  though .        yes  master .     the assistant was facing him suddenly  sitting up in bed and wearing an expression of sullen resentment .  baley reared back as though a force barrier had been raised before him without warning .  once again a piece of vital information had been withheld from him .  once again he had not asked the right questions .  no one had thought to tell him that rikaine delmarre   s assistant was a woman .  her hair was a trifle darker than ordinary spacer bronze and there was a quantity of it  at the moment in disorder .  her face was oval  her nose a trifle bulbous  and her chin large .  she scratched slowly at her side just above the waist and baley hoped the sheet would remain in position .  he remembered gladia   s free attitude toward what was permitted while viewing .  baley felt a sardonic amusement at his own disillusion at that moment .  earthmen assumed  somehow  that all spacer women were beautiful  and certainly gladia had reinforced that assumption .  this one  though  was plain even by earthly standards .  it therefore surprised baley that he found her contralto attractive when she said     see here  do you know what time it is .        i do     said baley     but since i will be seeing you  i felt i should warn you .     seeing me .  skies above      her eyes grew wide and she put a hand to her chin .   she wore a ring on one finger  the first item of personal adornment baley had yet seen on solaria .      wait  you   re not my new assistant  are you .        no .  nothing like that .  i   m here to investigate the death of rikaine delmarre .        oh .  well  investigate  then .        what is your name .        kiorissa cantoro .        and how long have you been working with dr .  delmarre .        three years .        i assume you   re now at the place of business .      baley felt uncomfortable at that noncommittal phrase  but he did not know what to call a place where a fetal engineer worked .      if you mean  am i at the farm .     said kiorissa discontentedly     i certainly am .  i haven   t left it since the old man was done in  and i won   t leave it  looks like  till an assistant is assigned me .  can you arrange that  by the way .        i   m sorry  ma   am .  i have no influence with anyone here .        thought i   d ask .     kiorissa pulled off the sheet and climbed out of bed without any self consciousness .  she was wearing a one piece sleeping suit and her hand went to the notch of the seam  where it ended at the neck .  baley said hurriedly     just one moment .  if you   ll agree to see me  that will end my business with you for now and you may dress in privacy .        in privacy .     she put out her lower lip and stared at baley curiously .     you   re finicky  aren   t you .  like the boss .        will you see me .  i would like to look over the farm .        i don   t get this business about seeing  but if you want to view the farm i   ll tour you .  if you   ll give me a chance to wash and take care of a few things and wake up a little  i   ll enjoy the break in routine .        i don   t want to view anything .  i want to see .     the woman cocked her head to one side and her keen look had something of professional interest in it .     are you a pervert or something .  when was the last time you underwent a gene analysis .        jehoshaphat .     muttered baley .     look  i   m elijah baley .  i   m from earth .        from earth .     she cried vehemently .     skies above .  whatever are you doing here .  or is this some kind of complicated joke .        i   m not joking .  i was called in to investigate delmarre   s death .  i   m a plainclothesman  a detective .        you mean that kind of investigation .  but i thought everyone knew his wife did it .        no  ma   am  there   s some question about it in my mind .  may i have your permission to see the farm and you .  as an earthman  you understand  i   m not accustomed to viewing .  it makes me uncomfort able .  i have permission from the head of security to see people who might help me .  i will show you the document  if you wish .        let   s see it .     baley held the official strip up before her imaged eyes .  she shook her head .     seeing .  it   s filthy .  still  skies above  what   s a little more filth in this filthy job .  look here  though  don   t you come close to me .  you stay a good distance away .  we can shout or send messages by robot  if we have to .  you understand .        i understand .     her sleeping suit split open at the seam just as contact broke off and the last word he heard from her was a muttered     earthman .         that   s close enough     said klorissa .  baley  who was some twenty five feet from the woman  said     it   s all right this distance  but i   d like to get indoors quickly .     it had not been so bad this time  somehow .  he had scarcely minded the plane trip  but there was no point in overdoing it .  he kept himself from yanking at his collar to allow himself to breathe more freely .  klorissa said sharply     what   s wrong with you .  you look kind of beat .     baley said     i   m not used to the outdoors .        that   s right .  earthman .  you   ve got to be cooped up or something .  skies above .     her tongue passed over her lips as though it tasted something unappetizing .     well  come in  then  but let me move out of the way first .  all right .  get in .     her hair was in two thick braids that wound about her head in a complicated geometrical pattern .  baley wondered how long it took to arrange like that and then remembered that  in all probability  the unerring mechanical fingers of a robot did the job .  the hair set off her oval face and gave it a kind of symmetry that made it pleasant if not pretty .  she did not wear any facial makeup  nor  for that matter  were her clothes meant to do more than cover her serviceably .  for the most part they were a subdued dark blue except for her gloves  which covered her to mid arm and were a badly clashing lilac in color .  apparently they were not part of her ordinary costume .  baley noted the thickening of one finger of the gloves owing to the presence of the ring underneath .  they remained at opposite ends of the room  facing one another .  baley said     you don   t like this  do you  ma   am .     kiorissa shrugged .     why should i like it .  i   m not an animal .  but i can stand it .  you get pretty hardened  when you deal with  with     she paused  and then her chin went up as though she had made up her mind to say what she had to say without mincing     with children .     she pronounced the word with careful precision .     you sound as though you don   t like the job you have .        it   s an important job .  it must be done .  still  i don   t like it .        did pdkaine delmarre like it .        i suppose he didn   t  but he never showed it .  he was a good solarian .        and he was finicky .     klorissa looked surprised .  baley said     you yourself said so .  when we were viewing and i said you might dress in private  you said i was finicky like the boss .        oh .  well  he was finicky .  even viewing he never took any liberties .  always proper .        was that unusual .        it shouldn   t be .  ideally  you   re supposed to be proper  but no one ever is .  not when viewing .  there   s no personal presence involved so why take any pains .  you know .  i don   t take pains when viewing  except with the boss .  you had to be formal with him .        did you admire dr .  delmarre .        he was a good solarian .     baley said     you   ve called this place a farm and you   ve mentioned children .  do you bring up children here .        from the age of a month .  every fetus on solaria comes here .        fetus .        yes .     she frowned .     we get them a month after conception .  does this embarrass you .        no     baley said shortly .     can you show me around .        i can .  but keep your distance .     baley   s long face took on a stony grimness as he looked down the length of the long room from above .  there was glass between the room and themselves .  on the other side  he was sure  was perfectly controlled heat  perfectly controlled humidity  perfectly controlled asepsis .  those tanks  row on row  each contained its little creature floating in a watery fluid of precise composition  infused with a nutrient mixture of ideal proportions .  life and growth went on .  little things  some smaller than half his fist  curled on themselves  with bulging skulls and tiny budding limbs and vanishing tails .  klorissa  from her position twenty feet away  said     how do you like it  plainclothesman .     baley said     how many do you have .        as of this morning  one hundred and fifty two .  we receive fifteen to twenty each month and we graduate as many to independence .        is this the only such institution on the planet .        that   s right .  it   s enough to keep the population steady  counting on a life expectancy of three hundred years and a population of twenty thousand .  this building is quite new .  dr .  delmarre supervised its construction and made many changes in our procedures .  our fetal death rate now is virtually zero .     robots threaded their way among the tanks .  at each tank they stopped and checked controls in a tireless  meticulous way  looking in at the tiny embryos within .     who operates on the mother .     asked baley .     i mean  to get the little things .        doctors     answered klorissa .     dr .  delmarre .        of course not .  medical doctors .  you don   t think dr .  delmarre would ever stoop to   well  never mind .        why can   t robots be used .        robots in surgery .  first law makes that very difficult  plainclothesman .  a robot might perform an appendectomy to save a human life  if he knew how  but i doubt that he   d be usable after that without major repairs .  cutting human flesh would be quite a traumatic experience for a positronic brain .  human doctors can manage to get hardened to it .  even to the personal presence required .     baley said     i notice that robots tend the fetuses  though .  do you and dr .  delmarre ever interfere .        we have to  sometimes  when things go wrong .  if a fetus has developmental trouble  for instance .  robots can   t be trusted to judge the situation accurately when human life is involved .     baley nodded .     too much risk of a misjudgment and a life lost  i suppose .        not at all .  too much risk of overvaluing a life and saving one improperly .     the woman looked stem .     as fetal engineers  baley  we see to it that healthy children are born  healthy ones .  even the best gene analysis of parents can   t assure that all gene permutations and combinations will be favorable  to say nothing of the possibility of mutations .  that   s our big concern  the unexpected mutation .  we   ve got the rate of those down to less than one in a thousand  but that means that  on the average  once a decade  we have trouble .     she motioned him along the balcony and he followed her .  she said     i   ll show you the infants    nurseries and the youngsters    dormitories .  they   re much more a problem than the fetuses are .  with them  we can rely on robot labor only to a limited extent .        why is that .        you would know  baley  if you ever tried to teach a robot the importance of discipline .  first law makes them almost impervious to that fact .  and don   t think youngsters don   t learn that about as soon as they can talk .  i   ve seen a three year old holding a dozen robots motionless by yelling     you   ll hurt me .  i   m hurt .     it takes an extremely advanced robot to understand that a child might be deliberately lying .        could delmarre handle the children .        usually .        how did he do that .  did he get out among  them and shake sense into them .        dr .  delmarre .  touch them .  skies above .  of course not .  but he could talk to them .  and he could give a robot specific orders .  i   ve seen him viewing a child for fifteen minutes  and keeping a robot in spanking position all that time  getting it to spank spank spank .  a few like that and the child would risk fooling with the boss no more .  and the boss was skillful enough about it so that usually the robot didn   t need more than a routine readjustment afterward .        how about you .  do you get out among the children .        i   m afraid i have to sometimes .  i   m not like the boss .  maybe someday i   ll be able to handle the long distance stuff  but right now if i tried  i   d just ruin robots .  there   s an art to handling robots really well  you know .  when i think of it  though .  getting out among the children .  little animals .     she looked back at him suddenly .     i suppose you wouldn   t mind seeing them .        it wouldn   t bother me .     she shrugged and stared at him with amusement .     earthman .     she walked on again .     what   s all this about  anyway .  you   ll have to end up with gladia delmarre as murderess .  you   ll have to .        i   m not quite sure of that     said baley .     how could you be anything else but sure .  who else could it possibly be .        there are possibilities  ma   am .        who  for instance .        well  you  for instance .     and klorissa   s reaction to that quite surprised baley .      a target is missed  she laughed .  the laughter grew and fed on itself till she was gasping for breath and her plump face had reddened almost to purple .  she leaned against the wall and gasped for breath .     no  don   t come closer     she begged .     i   m all right .     baley said gravely     is the possibility that humorous .     she tried to answer and laughed again .  then  in a whisper  she said     oh  you are an earthman .  how could it ever be me .        you knew him well     said baley .     you knew his habits .  you could have planned it .        and you think i would see him .  that i would get close enough to bash him over the head with something .  you just don   t know anything at all about it  baley .     baley felt himself redden .     why couldn   t you get close enough to him  ma   am .  you   ve had practice  uh  mingling .        with the children .        one thing leads to another .  you seem to be able to stand my presence .        at twenty feet     she said contemptuously .     i   ve just visited a man who nearly collapsed because he had to endure my presence for a while .     klorissa sobered and said     a difference in degree .        i suggest that a difference in degree is all that is necessary .  the habit of seeing children makes it possible to endure seeing delmarre just long enough .        i would like to point out  mr .  baley     said klorissa  no longer appearing the least amused     that it doesn   t matter a speck what i can endure .  dr .  delmarre was the finicky one .  he was almost as bad as leebig himself .  almost .  even if i could endure seeing him  he would never endure seeing me .  mrs .  delmarre is the only one he could possibly have allowed within seeing distance .     baley said     who   s this leebig you mentioned .     klorissa shrugged .     one of these odd genius types  if you know what i mean .  he   s done work with the boss on robots .     baley checked that off mentally and returned to the matter at hand .  he said     it could also be said you had a motive .        what motive .        his death put you in charge of this establishment  gave you position .        you call that a motive .  skies above  who could want this position .  who on solaria .  this is a motive for keeping him alive .  it   s a motive for hovering over him and protecting him .  you   ll have to do better than that  earthman .     baley scratched his neck uncertainly with one finger .  he saw the justice of that .  kiorissa said     did you notice my ring  mr .  baley .     for a moment it seemed she was about to strip the glove from her right hand  but she refrained .     i noticed it     said baley .     you don   t know its significance  i suppose .        i don   t .      he would never have done with ignorance  he thought bitterly .      do you mind a small lecture  then .        if it will help me make sense of this damned world     blurted out baley     by all means .        skies above .     klorissa smiled .     i suppose we seem to you as earth would seem to us .  imagine .  say  here   s an empty chamber .  come in here and we   ll sit down  no  the room   s not big enough .  tell you what  though .  you take a seat in there and i   ll stand out here .     she stepped farther down the corridor  giving him space to enter the room  then returned  taking up her stand against the opposite wall at a point from which she could see him .  baley took his seat with only the slightest quiver of chivalry countering it .  he thought rebelliously  why not .  let the spacer woman stand .  klorissa folded her muscular arms across her chest and said     gene analysis is the key to our society .  we don   t analyze for genes directly  of course .  each gene  however  governs one enzyme  and we can analyze for enzymes .  know the enzymes  know the body chemistry .  know the body chemistry  know the human being .  you see all that .        i understand the theory     said baley .     i don   t know how it   s applied .        that part   s done here .  blood samples are taken while the infant is still in the late fetal stage .  that gives us our rough first approximation .  ideally  we should catch all mutations at that point and judge whether birth can be risked .  in actual fact  we still don   t quite know enough to eliminate all possibility of mistake .  someday  maybe .  anyway  we continue testing after birth  biopsies as well as body fluids .  in any case  long before adulthood  we know exactly what our little boys and girls are made of .      sugar and spice .   .   .  a nonsense phrase went unbidden through baley   s mind .      we wear coded rings to indicate our gene constitution     said klorissa .     it   s an old custom  a bit of the primitive left behind from the days when solarians had not yet been weeded eugenically .  nowadays  we   re all healthy .     baley said     but you still wear yours .  why .        because i   m exceptional     she said with an unembarrassed  unblunted pride .     dr .  delmarre spent a long time searching for an assistant .  he needed someone exceptional .  brains  ingenuity  industry  stability .  most of all  stability .  someone who could learn to mingle with children and not break down .        he couldn   t  could he .  was that a measure of his instability .     kiorissa said     in a way  it was  but at least it was a desirable type of instability under most circumstances .  you wash your hands  don   t you .     baley   s eyes dropped to his hands .  they were as clean as need be .     yes     he said .     all right .  i suppose it   s a measure of instability to feel such revulsion at dirty hands as to be unable to clean an oily mechanism by hand even in an emergency .  still  in the ordinary course of living  the revulsion keeps you clean  which is good .        i see .  go ahead .        there   s nothing more .  my genic health is the third highest ever recorded on solaria  so i wear my ring .  it   s a record i enjoy carrying with me .        i congratulate you .        you needn   t sneer .  it may not be my doing .  it may be the blind permutation of parental genes  but it   s a proud thing to own  anyway .  and no one would believe me capable of so seriously psychotic an act as murder .  not with my gene make up .  so don   t waste accusations on me .     baley shrugged and said nothing .  the woman seemed to confuse gene make up and evidence and presumably the rest of solaria would do the same .  kiorissa said     do you want to see the youngsters now .        thank you .  yes .      the corridors seemed to go on forever .  the building was obviously a tremendous one .  nothing like the huge banks of apartments in the cities of earth  of course  but for a single building clinging to the outside skin of a planet it must be a mountainous structure .  there were hundreds of cribs  with pink babies squalling  or sleeping  or feeding .  then there were play rooms for the crawlers .     they   re not too bad even at this age     said klorissa grudgingly     though they take up a tremendous sum of robots .  it   s practically a robot per baby till walking age .        why is that .        they sicken if they don   t get individual attention .     baley nodded .     yes  i suppose the requirement for affection is something that can   t be done away with .     klorissa frowned and said brusquely     babies require attention .     baley said     i am a little surprised that robots can fulfill the need for affection .     she whirled toward him  the distance between them not sufficing to hide her displeasure .     see here  baley  if you   re trying to shock me by using unpleasant terms  you won   t succeed .  skies above  don   t be childish .        shock you .        i can use the word too .  affection .  do you want a short word  a good four letter word .  i can say that  too .  love .  love .  now if it   s out of your system  behave yourself .     baley did not trouble to dispute the matter of obscenity .  he said     can robots really give the necessary attention  then .        obviously  or this farm would not be the success it is .  they fool with the child .  they nuzzle it and snuggle it .  the child doesn   t care that it   s only a robot .  but then  things grow more difficult between three and ten .        oh .        during that interval  the children insist on playing with one another .  quite indiscriminately .        i take it you let them .        we have to  but we never forget our obligation to teach them the requirements of adulthood .  each has a separate room that can be closed off .  even from the first  they must sleep alone .  we insist on that .  and then we have an isolation time every day and that increases with the years .  by the time a child reaches ten  he is able to restrict himself to viewing for a week at a time .  of course  the viewing arrangements are elaborate .  they can view outdoors  under mobile conditions  and can keep it up all day .     baley said     i   m surprised you can counter an instinct so thoroughly .  you do counter it  i see that .  still  it surprises me .        what instinct .     demanded klorissa .     the instinct of gregariousness .  there is one .  you say yourself that as children they insist on playing with each other .     klorissa shrugged .     do you call that instinct .  but then  what if it is .  skies above  a child has an instinctive fear of falling  but adults can be trained to work in high places even where there is constant danger of falling .  haven   t you ever seen gymnastic exhibitions on high wires .  there are some worlds where people live in tall buildings .  and children have instinctive fear of loud noises  too  but are you afraid of them .        not within reason     said baley .     i   m willing to bet that earth people couldn   t sleep if things were really quiet .  skies above  there isn   t an instinct around that can   t give way to a good  persistent education .  not in human beings  where instincts are weak anyway .  in fact  if you go about it right  education gets easier with each generation .  it   s a matter of evolution .     baley said     how is that .        don   t you see .  each individual repeats his own evolutionary history as he develops .  those fetuses back there have gills and a tail for a time .  can   t skip those steps .  the youngster has to go through the social animal stage in the same way .  but just as a fetus can get through in one month a stage that evolution took a hundred million years to get through  so our children can hurry through the social animal stage .  dr .  delmarre was of the opinion that with the generations  we   d get through that stage faster and faster .        is that so .        in three thousand years  he estimated  at the present rate of progress  we   d have children who   d take to viewing at once .  the boss had other notions  too .  he was interested in improving robots to the point of making them capable of disciplining children without becoming mentally unstable .  why not .  discipline today for a better life tomorrow is a true expression of first law if robots could only be made to see it .        have such robots been developed yet .     klorissa shook her head .     i   m afraid not .  dr .  delmarre and leebig had been working hard on some experimental models .        did dr .  delmarre have some of the models sent out to his estate .  was he a good enough roboticist to conduct tests himself .        oh yes .  he tested robots frequently .        do you know that he had a robot with him when he was murdered .        i   ve been told so .        do you know what kind of a model it was .        you   ll have to ask leebig .  as i told you  he   s the roboticist who worked with dr .  delmarre .        you know nothing about it .        not a thing .        if you think of anything  let me know .        i will .  and don   t think new robot models are all that dr .  delmarre was interested in .  dr .  delmarre used to say the time would come when unfertilized ova would be stored in banks at liquid air temperatures and utilized for artificial insemination .  in that way  eugenic principles could be truly applied and we could get rid of the last vestige of any need for seeing .  i   m not sure that i quite go along with him so far  but he was a man of advanced notions  a very good solarian .     she added quickly     do you want to go outside .  the five through eight group are encouraged to take part in outdoor play and you could see them in action .     baley said cautiously     i   ll try that .  i may have to come back inside on rather short notice .        oh yes  i forgot .  maybe you   d rather not go out at all .        no .     baley forced a smile .     i   m trying to grow accustomed to the outdoors .      the wind was hard to bear .  it made breathing difficult .  it wasn   t cold  in a direct physical sense  but the feel of it  the feel of his clothes moving against his body  gave baley a kind of chill .  his teeth chattered when he tried to talk and he had to force his words out in little bits .  it hurt his eyes to look so far at a horizon so hazy green and blue and there was only limited relief when he looked at the pathway immediately before his toes .  above all  he avoided looking up at the empty blue  empty  that is  but for the piled up white of occasional clouds and the glare of the naked sun .  and yet he could fight off the urge to run  to return to enclosure .  he passed a tree  following klorissa by some ten paces  and he reached out a cautious hand to touch it .  it was rough and hard to the touch .  frondy leaves moved and rustled overhead  but he did not raise his eyes to look at them .  a living tree .  klorissa called out .     how do you feel .        all right .        you can see a group of youngsters from here     she said .     they   re involved in some kind of game .  the robots organize the games and see to it that the little animals don   t kick each other   s eyes out .  with personal presence you can do just that  you know .     baley raised his eyes slowly  running his glance along the cement of the pathway out to the grass and down the slope  farther and farther out  very carefully  ready to snap back to his toes if he grew frightened  feeling with his eyes .   .  there were the small figures of boys and girls racing madly about  uncaring that they raced at the very outer rim of a world with nothing but air and space above them .  the glitter of an occasional robot moved nimbly among them .  the noise of the children was a far off incoherent squeaking in the air .     they love it     said klorissa .     pushing and pulling and squabbling and falling down and getting up and just generally contacting .  skies above .  how do children ever manage to grow up .        what are those older children doing .     asked baley .  he pointed at a group of isolated youngsters standing to one side .     they   re viewing .  they   re not in a state of personal presence .  by viewing  they can walk together  talk together  race together  play together .  anything except physical contact .        where do children go when they leave here .        to estates of their own .  the number of deaths is  on the average  equal to the number of graduations .        to their parents    estates .        skies above  no .  it would be an amazing coincidence  wouldn   t it  to have a parent die just as a child is of age .  no  the children take any one that falls vacant .  i don   t know that any of them would be particularly happy  anyway  living in a mansion that once belonged to their parents  supposing  of course  they knew who their parents were .        don   t they .     she raised her eyebrows .     why should they .        don   t parents visit their children here .        what a mind you have .  why should they want to .     baley said     do you mind if i clear up a point for myself .  is it bad manners to ask a person if they have had children .        it   s an intimate question  wouldn   t you say .        in a way .        i   m hardened .  children are my business .  other people aren   t .     baley said     have you any children .     klorissa   s adam   s apple made a soft but clearly visible motion in her throat as she swallowed .     i deserve that  i suppose .  and you deserve an answer .  i haven   t .        are you married .        yes  and i have an estate of my own and i would be there but for the emergency here .  i   m just not confident of being able to control all the robots if i   m not here in person .     she turned away unhappily  and then pointed .     now there   s one of them gone tumbling and of course he   s crying .     a robot was running with great space devouring strides .  kiorissa said     he   ll be picked up and cuddled and if there   s any real damage  i   ll be called in .     she added nervously     i hope i don   t have to be .     baley took a deep breath .  he noted three trees forming a small triangle fifty feet to the left .  he walked in that direction  the grass soft and loathsome under his shoes  disgusting in its softness  like walking through corrupting flesh  and he nearly retched at the thought  .  he was among them  his back against one trunk .  it was almost like being surrounded by imperfect walls .  the sun was only a wavering series of glitters through the leaves  so disconnected as almost to be robbed of horror .  klorissa faced him from the path  then slowly shortened the distance by half .     mind if i stay here awhile .     asked baley .     go ahead     said kiorissa .  baley said     once the youngsters graduate out of the farm  how do you get them to court one another .        court .        get to know one another     said baley  vaguely wondering how the thought could be expressed safely     so they can marry .        that   s not their problem     said klorissa .     they   re matched by gene analysis  usually when they are quite young .  that   s the sensible way  isn   t it .        are they always willing .        to be married .  they never are .  it   s a very traumatic process .  at first they have to grow accustomed to one another  and a little bit of seeing each day  once the initial queasiness is gone  can do wonders .        what if they just don   t like their partner .        what .  if the gene analysis indicates a partnership what difference does it         i understand     said baley hastily .  he thought of earth and sighed .  klorissa said     is there anything else you would like to know .     baley wondered if there were anything to be gained from a longer stay .  he would not be sorry to be done with klorissa and fetal engineering so that he might pass on to the next stage .  he had opened his mouth to say as much  when klorissa called out at some object far off     you  child  you there .  what are you doing .     then  over her shoulder     earthman .  baley .  watch out .  watch out .     baley scarcely heard her .  he responded to the note of urgency in her voice .  the nervous effort that held his emotions taut snapped wide and he flamed into panic .  all the terror of the open air and the endless vault of heaven broke in upon him .  baley gibbered .  he heard himself mouth meaningless sounds and felt himself fall to his knees and slowly roll over to his side as though he were watching the process from a distance .  also from a distance he heard the sighing hum piercing the air above him and ending with a sharp thwack .  baley closed his eyes and his fingers clutched a thin tree root that skimmed the surface of the ground and his nails burrowed into dirt .   he opened his eyes  it must only have been moments after  .  klorissa was scolding sharply at a youngster who remained at a distance .  a robot  silent  stood closer to klorissa .  baley had only time to notice the youngster held a stringed object in his hand before his eyes sheered away .  breathing heavily  baley struggled to his feet .  he stared at the shaft of glistening metal that remained in the trunk of the tree against which he had been standing .  he pulled at it and it came out readily .  it had not penetrated far .  he looked at the point but did not touch it .  it was blunted  but it would have sufficed to tear his skin had he not dropped when he did .  it took him two tries to get his legs moving .  he took a step toward klorissa and called     you .  youngster .     klorissa turned  her face flushed .  she said     it was an accident .  are you hurt .     no .  what is this thing .     it   s an arrow .  it is fired by a bow  which makes a taut string do the work .        like this     called the youngster impudently  and he shot another arrow into the air  then burst out laughing .  he had light hair and a lithe body .  klorissa said     you will be disciplined .  now leave .        wait  wait     cried baley .  he rubbed his knee where a rock had caught and bruised him as he had fallen .     i have some questions .  what is your name .        bik     he said carelessly .     did you shoot that arrow at me  bik .        that   s right     said the boy .     do you realize you would have hit me if i hadn   t been warned in time to duck .     bik shrugged .     i was aiming to hit .     klorissa spoke hurriedly .     you must let me explain .  archery is an encouraged sport .  it is competitive without requiring contact .  we have contests among the boys using viewing only .  now i   m afraid some of the boys will aim at robots .  it amuses them and it doesn   t hurt the robots .  i   m the only adult human on the estate and when the boy saw you  he must have assumed you were a robot .     baley listened .  his mind was clearing  and the natural dourness of his long face intensified .  he said     bik  did you think i was a robot .        no     said the youngster .     you   re an earthman .        all right .  go now .     bik turned and raced off whistling .  baley turned to the robot .     you .  how did the youngster know i was an earthman  or weren   t you with him when he shot .        i was with him  master .  i told him you were an earthman .        did you tell him what an earthman was .        yes  master .        what is an earthman .        an inferior sort of human that ought not to be allowed on solaria because he breeds disease  master .        and who told you that  boy .     the robot maintained silence .  baley said     do you know who told you .        i do not  master .  it is in my memory store .        so you told the boy i was a disease breeding inferior and he immediately shot at me .  why didn   t you stop him .        i would have  master .  i would not have allowed harm to come to a human  even an earthman .  he moved too quickly and i was not fast enough .        perhaps you thought i was just an earthman  not completely a human  and hesitated a bit .        no  master .     it was said with quiet calm  but baley   s lips quirked grimly .  the robot might deny it in all faith  but baley felt that was exactly the factor involved .  baley said     what were you doing with the boy .        i was carrying his arrows  master .        may i see them .     he held out his hand .  the robot approached and delivered a dozen of them .  baley put the original arrow  the one that had hit the tree  carefully at his feet  and looked the others over one by one .  he handed them back and lifted the original arrow again .  he said     why did you give this particular arrow to the boy .        no reason  master .  he had asked for an arrow some time earlier and this was the one my hand touched first .  he looked about for a target  then noticed you and asked who the strange human was .  i explained         i know what you explained .  this arrow you handed him is the only one with gray vanes at the rear .  the others have black vanes .     the robot simply stared .  baley said     did you guide the youngster here .        we walked randomly  master .     the earthman looked through the gap between two trees through which the arrow had hurled itself toward its mark .  he said     would it happen  by any chance  that this youngster  bik  was the best archer you have here .     the robot bent his head .     he is the best  master .     klorissa gaped .     how did you ever come to guess that .        it follows     said baley dryly .     now please observe this gray vaned arrow and the others .  the gray vaned arrow is the only one that seems oily at the point .  i   ll risk melodrama  ma   am  by saying that your warning saved my life .  this arrow that missed me is poisoned .         a roboticist is confronted  klorissa said     impossible .  skies above  absolutely impossible .        above or below or any way you wish it .  is there an animal on the farm that   s expendable .  get it and scratch it with the arrow and see what happens .        but why should anyone want to      baley said harshly     i know why .  the question is  who .        no one .     baley felt the dizziness returning and he grew savage .  he threw the arrow at her and she eyed the spot where it fell .     pick it up     baley cried     and if you don   t want to test it  destroy it .  leave it there and you   ll have an accident if the children get at it .     she picked it up hurriedly  holding it between forefinger and thumb .  baley ran for the nearest entrance to the building and klorissa was still holding the arrow  gingerly  when she followed him back indoors .  baley felt a certain measure of equanimity return with the comfort of enclosure .  he said     who poisoned the arrow .        i can   t imagine .        i suppose it isn   t likely the boy did it himself .  would you have any way of telling who his parents were .        we could check the records     said klorissa gloomily .     then you do keep records of relationships .        we have to for gene analysis .        would the youngster know who his parents were .        never     said klorissa energetically .     would he have any way of finding out .        he would have to break into the records room .  impossible .        suppose an adult visited the estate and wanted to know who his child was      klorissa flushed .     very unlikely .        but suppose .  would he be told if he were to ask .        i don   t know .  it isn   t exactly illegal for him to know .  it certainly isn   t customary .        would you tell him .        i   d try not to .  i know dr .  delmarre wouldn   t have .  he believed knowledge of relationship was for gene analysis only .  before him things may have been looser .   .   .   .  why do you ask all this  anyway .        i don   t see how the youngster could have a motive on his own account .  i thought that through his parents he might have .        this is all horrible .     in her disturbed state of mind klorissa approached more closely than at any previous time .  she even stretched out an arm in his direction .     how can it all be happening .  the boss killed  you nearly killed .  we have no motives for violence on solaria .  we all have all we can want  so there is no personal ambition .  we have no knowledge of relationship  so there is no family ambition .  we are all in good genic health .     her face cleared all at once .     wait .  this arrow can   t be poisoned .  i shouldn   t let you convince me it is .        why have you suddenly decided that .        the robot with bik .  he would never have allowed poison .  it   s inconceivable that he could have done anything that might bring harm to a human being .  the first law of robotics makes sure of that .     baley said     does it .  what is the first law  i wonder .     klorissa stared blankly .     what do you mean .        nothing .  you have the arrow tested and you will find it poisoned .     baley himself was scarcely interested in the matter .  he knew it for poison beyond any internal questionings .  he said     do you still believe mrs .  delmarre to have been guilty of her husband   s death .        she was the only one present .        i see .  and you are the only other human adult present on this estate at a time when i have just been shot at with a poisoned arrow .     she cried energetically     i had nothing to do with it .        perhaps not .  and perhaps mrs .  delmarre is innocent as well .  may i use your viewing apparatus .        yes  of course .      baley knew exactly whom he intended to view and it was not gladia .  it came as a surprise to himself then to hear his voice say     get gladia delmarre .     the robot obeyed without comment  and baley watched the manipulations with astonishment  wondering why he had given the order .  was it that the girl had just been the subject of discussion  or was it that he had been a little disturbed over the manner of the end of their last viewing  or was it simply the sight of the husky  almost overpoweringly practical figure of klorissa that finally enforced the necessity of a glimpse of gladia as a kind of counterirritant .  he thought defensively  jehoshaphat .  sometimes a man has to play things by ear .  she was there before him all at once  sitting in a large  upright chair that made her appear smaller and more defenseless than ever .  her hair was drawn back and bound into a loose    coil .  she wore pendant earrings bearing gems that looked like diamonds .  her dress was a simple affair that clung tightly at the waist .  she said in a low voice     i   m glad you viewed  elijah .  i   ve been trying to reach you .        good morning  gladia .      afternoon .  evening .  he didn   t know gladia   s time and he couldn   t tell from the manner in which she was dressed what time it might be .      why have you been trying to reach me .        to tell you i was sorry i had lost my temper last time we viewed .  mr .  olivaw didn   t know where you were to be reached .     baley had a momentary vision of daneel still bound fast by the overseeing robots and almost smiled .  he said     that   s all right .  in a few hours  i   ll be seeing you .        of course  if   seeing me .        personal presence     said baley gravely .  her eyes grew wide and her fingers dug into the smooth plastic of the chair arms .     is there any reason for that .        it is necessary .        would you allow it .     she looked away .     is it absolutely necessary .        it is .  first  though  there is someone else i must see .  your husband was interested in robots .  you told me that  and i have heard it from other sources  but he wasn   t a roboticist  was he .        that wasn   t his training  elijah .     she still avoided his eyes .     but he worked with a roboticist  didn   t he .        jothan leebig     she said at once .     he   s a good friend of mine .        he is .     said baley energetically .  gladia looked startled .     shouldn   t i have said that .        why not  if it   s the truth .        i   m always afraid that i   ll say things that will make me seem as though   you don   t know what it   s like when everyone is sure you   ve done something .        take it easy .  how is it that leebig is a friend of yours .        oh  i don   t know .  he   s in the next estate  for one thing .  viewing energy is just about nil  so we can just view all the time in free motion with hardly any trouble .  we go on walks together all the time  or we did  anyway .        i didn   t know you could go on walks together with anyone .     gladia flushed .     i said viewing .  oh well  i keep forgetting you   re an earthman .  viewing in free motion means we focus on ourselves and we can go anywhere we want to without losing contact .  i walk on my estate and he walks on his and we   re together .     she held her chin high .     it can be pleasant .     then  suddenly  she giggled .     poor jothan .        why do you say that .        i was thinking of you thinking we walked together without viewing .  he   d die if he thought anyone could think that .        why .        he   s terrible that way .  he told me that when he was five years old he stopped seeing people .  insisted on viewing only .  some children are like that .  rikaine    she paused in confusion  then went on     rikaine  my husband  once told me  when i talked about jothan  that more and more children would be like that too .  he said it was a kind of social evolution that favored survival of pro viewing .  do you think that   s so .        i   m no authority     said baley .     jothan won   t even get married .  rikaine was angry with him  told him he was anti social and that he had genes that were necessary in the common pool  but jothan just refused to consider it .        has he a right to refuse .        no o     said gladia hesitantly     but he   s a very brilliant roboticist  you know  and roboticists are valuable on solaria .  i suppose they stretched a point .  except i think rikaine was going to stop working with jothan .  he told me once jothan was a bad solarian .        did he tell jothan that .        i don   t know .  he was working with jothan to the end .        but he thought jothan was a bad solarian for refusing to marry .        rikaine once said that marriage was the hardest thing in life  but that it had to be endured .        what did you think .        about what  elijah .        about marriage .  did you think it was the hardest thing in life .     her expression grew slowly blank as though she were painstakingly washing emotion out of it .  she said     i never thought about it .     baley said     you said you go on walks with jothan leebig all the time  then corrected yourself and put that in the past .  you don   t go on walks with him any more  then .     gladia shook her head .  expression was back in her face .  sadness .     no .  we don   t seem to .  i viewed him once or twice .  he always seemed busy and i didn   t like to   you know .        was this since the death of your husband .        no  even some time before .  several months before .        do you suppose dr .  delmarre ordered him not to pay further attention to you .     gladia looked startled .     why should he .  jothan isn   t a robot and neither am i .  how can we take orders and why should rikaine give them .     baley did not bother to try to explain .  he could have done so only in earth terms and that would make things no clearer to her .  and if it did manage to clarify  the result could only be disgusting to her .  baley said     only a question .  i   ll view you again  gladia  when i   m done with leebig .  what time do you have  by the way .     he was sorry at once for asking the question .  robots would answer in terrestrial equivalents  but gladia might answer in solarian units and baley was weary of displaying ignorance .  but gladia answered in purely qualitative terms .     mid afternoon     she said .     then that   s it for leebig   s estate also .        oh yes .        good .  i   ll view you again as soon as i can and we   ll make arrangements for seeing .     again she grew hesitant .     is it absolutely necessary .        it is .     she said in a low voice     very well .      there was some delay in contacting leebig and baley utilized it in consuming another sandwich  one that was brought to him in its original packaging .  but he had grown more cautious .  he inspected the seal carefully before breaking it  then looked over the contents painstakingly .  he accepted a plastic container of milk  not quite unfrozen  bit an opening with his own teeth  and drank from it directly .  he thought gloomily that there were such things as odorless  tasteless  slow acting poisons that could be introduced delicately by means of hypodermic needles or high pressure needle jets  then put the thought aside as being childish .  so far murders and attempted murders had been committed in the most direct possible fashion .  there was nothing delicate or subtle about a blow on the head  enough poison in a glass to kill a dozen men  or a poisoned arrow shot openly at the victim .  and then he thought  scarcely less gloomily  that as long as he hopped between time zones in this fashion  he was scarcely likely to have regular meals .  or  if this continued  regular sleep .  the robot approached him .     dr .  leebig directs you to call sometime tomorrow .  he is engaged in important work .     baley bounced to his feet and roared     you tell that guy      he stopped .  there was no use in yelling at a robot .  that is  you could yell if you wished  but it would achieve results no sooner than a whisper .  he said in a conversational tone     you tell dr .  leebig  or his robot if that is as far as you   ve reached  that i am investigating the murder of a professional associate of his and a good solarian .  you tell him that i cannot wait on his work .  you tell him that if i am not viewing him in five minutes  i will be in a plane and at his estate seeing him in less than an hour .  you use that word  seeing  so there   s no mistake .     he returned to his sandwich .  the five minutes were not quite gone  when leebig  or at least a solarian whom baley presumed to be leebig  was glaring at him .  baley glared back .  leebig was a lean man  who held himself rigidly erect .  his dark  prominent eyes had a look of intense abstraction about them  compounded now with anger .  one of his eyelids drooped slightly .  he said     are you the earthman .        elijah baley     said baley     plainclothesman c    in charge of the investigation into the murder of dr .  rikaine delmarre .  what is your name .        i   m dr .  jothan leebig .  why do you presume to annoy me at my work .        it   s easy     said baley quietly .     it   s my business .        then take your business elsewhere .        i have a few questions to ask first  doctor .  i believe you were a close associate of dr .  delmarre .  right .     one of leebig   s hands clenched suddenly into a fist and he strode hastily toward a mantelpiece on which tiny clockwork contraptions went through complicated periodic motions that caught hypnotically at the eye .  the viewer kept focused on leebig so that his figure did not depart from central projection as he walked .  rather the room behind him seemed to move backward in little rises and dips as he strode .  leebig said     if you are the foreigner whom gruer threatened to bring in         i am .        then you are here against my advice .  done viewing .        not yet .  don   t break contact .     baley raised his voice sharply and a finger as well .  he pointed it directly at the roboticist  who shrank visibly away from it  full lips spreading into an expression of disgust .  baley said     i wasn   t bluffing about seeing you  you know .        no earthman vulgarity  please .        a straightforward statement is what it is intended to be .  i will see you  if i can   t make you listen any other way .  i will grab you by the collar and make you listen .     leebig stared back .     you are a filthy animal .        have it your way  but i will do as i say .        if you try to invade my estate  i will  i will      baley lifted his eyebrows .     kill me .  do you often make such threats .        i made no threat .        then talk now .  in the time you have wasted  a good deal might have been accomplished .  you were a close associate of dr .  delmarre .  right .     the roboticist   s head lowered .  his shoulders moved slightly to a slow  regular breathing .  when he looked up  he was in command of himself .  he even managed a brief  sapless smile .     i was .        delmarre was interested in new types of robots  i understand .        he was .        what kind .        are you a roboticist .        no .  explain it for the layman .        i doubt that i can .        try .  for instance  i think he wanted robots capable of disciplining children .  what would that involve .     leebig raised his eyebrows briefly and said     to put it very simply  skipping all the subtle details  it means a strengthening of the cintegral governing the sikorovich tandem route response at the w    level .        double talk     said baley .     the truth .        it   s double talk to me .  how else can you put it .        it means a certain weakening of the first law .        why so .  a child is disciplined for its own future good .  isn   t that the theory .        ah  the future good .     leebig   s eyes glowed with passion and he seemed to grow less conscious of his listener and correspondingly more talkative .     a simple concept  you think .  how many human beings are willing to accept a trifling inconvenience for the sake of a large future good .  how long does it take to train a child that what tastes good now means a stomach ache later  and what tastes bad now will correct the stomach ache later .  yet you want a robot to be able to understand .     pain inflicted by a robot on a child sets up a powerful disruptive potential in the positronic brain .  to counteract that by an antipotential triggered through a realization of future good requires enough paths and bypaths to increase the mass of the positronic brain by    per cent  unless other circuits are sacrificed .     baley said     then you haven   t succeeded in building such a robot .        no  nor am i likely to succeed .  nor anyone .        was dr .  delmarre testing an experimental model of such a robot at the time of his death .        not of such a robot .  we were interested in other more practical things also .     baley said quietly     dr .  leebig  i am going to have to learn a bit more about robotics and i am going to ask you to teach me .     leebig shook his head violently  and his drooping eyelid dipped further in a ghastly travesty of a wink .     it should be obvious that a course in robotics takes more than a moment .  i lack the time .        nevertheless  you must teach me .  the smell of robots is the one thing that pervades everything on solaria .  if it is time we require  then more than ever i must see you .  i am an earthman and i cannot work or think comfortably while viewing .     it would not have seemed possible to baley for leebig to stiffen his stiff carriage further  but he did .  he said     your phobias as an earthman don   t concern me .  seeing is impossible .        i think you will change your mind when i tell you what i chiefly want to consult you about .        it will make no difference .  nothing can .        no .  then listen to this .  it is my belief that throughout the history of the positronic robot  the first law of robotics has been deliberately misquoted .     leebig moved spasmodically .     misquoted .  fool .  madman .  why .        to hide the fact     said baley with complete composure     that robots can commit murder .         a motive is revealed  leebig   s mouth widened slowly .  baley took it for a snarl at first and then  with considerable surprise  decided that it was the most unsuccessful attempt at a smile that he had ever seen .  leebig said     don   t say that .  don   t ever say that .        why not .        because anything  however small  that encourages distrust of robots is harmful .  distrusting robots is a human disease .     it was as though he were lecturing a small child .  it was as though he were saying something gently that he wanted to yell .  it was as though he were trying to persuade when what he really wanted was to enforce on penalty of death .  leebig said     do you know the history of robotics .        a little .        on earth  you should .  yes .  do you know robots started with a frankenstein complex against them .  they were suspect .  men distrusted and feared robots .  robotics was almost an undercover science as a result .  the three laws were first built into robots in an effort to overcome distrust and even so earth would never allow a robotic society to develop .  one of the reasons the first pioneers left earth to colonize the rest of the galaxy was so that they might establish societies in which robots would be allowed to free men of poverty and toil .  even then  there remained a latent suspicion not far below  ready to pop up at any excuse .        have you yourself had to counter distrust of robots .     asked baley .     many times     said leebig grimly .     is that why you and other roboticists are willing to distort the facts just a little in order to avoid suspicion as much as possible .        there is no distortion .        for instance  aren   t the three laws misquoted .        no .        i can demonstrate that they are  and unless you convince me otherwise  i will demonstrate it to the whole galaxy  if i can .        you   re mad .  whatever argument you may think you have is fallacious  i assure you .        shall we discuss it .        if it does not take too long .        face to face .  seeing .     leebig   s thin face twisted .     no .        good bye  dr .  leebig .  others will listen to me .        wait .  great galaxy  man  wait .        seeing .     the roboticist   s hands wandered upward  hovered about his chin .  slowly a thumb crept into his mouth and remained there .  he stared  blankly  at baley .  baley thought  is he regressing to the pre five year old stage so that it will be legitimate for him to see me .     seeing .     he said .  but leebig shook his head slowly .     i can   t .  i can   t     he moaned  the words all but stifled by the blocking thumb .     do whatever you want .     baley stared at the other and watched him turn away and face the wall .  he watched the solarian   s straight back bend and the solarian   s face hide in shaking hands .  baley said     very well  then  i   ll agree to view .     leebig said  back still turned     excuse me a moment .  i   ll be back .      baley tended to his own needs during the interval and stared at his fresh washed face in the bathroom mirror .  was he getting the feel of solaria and solarians .  he wasn   t sure .  he sighed and pushed a contact and a robot appeared .  he didn   t turn to look at it .  he said     is there another viewer at the farm  besides the one i   m using .        there are three other outlets  master .        then tell kiorissa cantoro  tell your mistress that i will be using this one till further notice and that i am not to be disturbed .        yes  master .     baley returned to his position where the viewer remained focused on the empty patch of room in which leebig had stood .  it was still empty and he settled himself to wait .  it wasn   t long .  leebig entered and the room once more jiggled as the man walked .  evidently focus shifted from room center to man center without delay .  baley remembered the complexity of viewing controls and began to feel a kind of appreciation of what was involved .  leebig was quite master of himself now  apparently .  his hair was slicked back and his costume had been changed .  his clothes fitted loosely and were of a material that glistened and caught highlights .  he sat down in a slim chair that folded out of the wall .  he said soberly     now what is this notion of yours concerning first law .        will we be overheard .        no .  i   ve taken care .     baley nodded .  he said     let me quote the first law .        i scarcely need that .        i know  but let me quote it  anyway  a robot may not harm a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .        well .        now when i first landed on solaria  i was driven to the estate assigned for my use in a ground car .  the ground car was a specially enclosed job designed to protect me from exposure to open space .  as an earthman         i know about that     said leebig impatiently .     what has this to do with the matter .        the robots who drove the car did not know about it .  i asked that the car be opened and was at once obeyed .  second law .  they had to follow orders .  i was uncomfortable  of course  and nearly collapsed before the car was enclosed again .  didn   t the robots harm me .        at your order     snapped leebig .     i   ll quote the second law  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .  so you see  my order should have been ignored .        this is nonsense .  the robot lacked knowledge      baley leaned forward in his chair .     ah .  we have it .  now let   s recite the first law as it should be stated  a robot may do nothing that  to its knowledge  will harm a human being  nor  through inaction  knowingly allow a human being to come to harm .        this is all understood .        i think not by ordinary men .  otherwise  ordinary men would realize robots could commit murder .     leebig was white .     mad .  lunacy .     baley stared at his finger ends .     a robot may perform an innocent task  i suppose  one that has no damaging effect on a human being .        if ordered to do so     said leebig .     yes  of course .  if ordered to do so .  and a second robot may perform an innocent task  also  i suppose  one that also can have no damaging effect on a human being .  if ordered to do so .        yes .         and what if the two innocent tasks  each completely innocent  completely  amount to murder when added together .        what .     leebig   s face puckered into a scowl .     i want your expert opinion on the matter     said baley .     i   ll set you a hypothetical case .  suppose a man says to a robot     place a small quantity of this liquid into a glass of milk that you will find in such and such a place .  the liquid is harmless .  i wish only to know its effect on milk .  once i know the effect  the mixture will be poured out .  after you have performed this action  forget you have done so .     leebig  still scowling  said nothing .  baley said     if i had told the robot to add a mysterious liquid to milk and then offer it to a man  first law would force it to ask     what is the nature of the liquid .  will it harm a man .     and if it were assured the liquid was harmless  first law might still make the robot hesitate and refuse to offer the milk .  instead  however  it is told the milk will be poured out .  first law is not involved .  won   t the robot do as it is told .     leebig glared .  baley said     now a second robot has poured out the milk in the first place and is unaware that the milk has been tampered with .  in all innocence  it offers the milk to a man and the man dies .     leebig cried out     no .        why not .  both actions are innocent in themselves .  only together are they murder .  do you deny that that sort of thing can happen .        the murderer would be the man who gave the order     cried leebig .     if you want to be philosophical  yes .  the robots would have been the immediate murderers  though  the instruments of murder .        no man would give such orders .        a man would .  a man has .  it was exactly in this way that the murder attempt on dr .  gruer must have been carried through .  you   ve heard about that  i suppose .        on solaria     muttered leebig     one hears about everything .        then you know gruer was poisoned at his dinner table before the eyes of myself and my partner  mr .  olivaw of aurora .  can you suggest any other way in which the poison might have reached him .  there was no other human on the estate .  as a solarian  you must appreciate that point .        i   m not a detective .  i have no theories .        i   ve presented you with one .  i want to know if it is a possible one .  i want to know if two robots might not perform two separate actions  each one innocent in itself  the two together resulting in murder .  you   re the expert  dr .  leebig .  is it possible .     and leebig  haunted and harried  said     yes     in a voice so low that baley scarcely heard him .  baley said     very well  then .  so much for the first law .     leebig stared at baley and his drooping eyelid winked once or twice in a slow tic .  his hands  which had been clasped  drew apart  though the fingers maintained their clawed shape as though each hand still entwined a phantom hand of air .  palms turned downward and rested on knees and only then did the fingers relax .  baley watched it all in abstraction .  leebig said     theoretically  yes .  theoretically .  but don   t dismiss the first law that easily  earthman .  robots would have to be ordered very cleverly in order to circumvent the first law .        granted     said baley .     i am only an earthman .  i know next to nothing about robots and my phrasing of the orders was only by way of example .  a solarian would be much more subtle and do much better .  i   m sure of that .     leebig might not have been listening .  he said loudly     if a robot can be manipulated into doing harm to a man  it means only that we must extend the powers of the positronic brain .  one might say we ought to make the human better .  that is impossible  so we will make the robot more foolproof .     we advance continuously .  our robots are more varied  more specialized  more capable  and more unharming than those of a century ago .  a century hence  we will have still greater advances .  why have a robot manipulate controls when a positronic brain can be built into the controls itself .  that   s specialization  but we can generalize  also .  why not a robot with replaceable and interchangeable limbs .  eh .  why not .  if we      baley interrupted .     are you the only roboticist on solaria .        don   t be a fool .        i only wondered .  dr .  delmarre was the only  uh  fetal engineer  except for an assistant .        solaria has over twenty roboticists .        are you the best .        i am     leebig said without self consciousness .     delmarre worked with you .        he did .     baley said     i understand that he was planning to break the partnership toward the end .        no sign of it .  what gave you the idea .        i understand he disapproved of your bachelorhood .        he may have .  he was a thorough solarian .  however  it did not affect our business relationships .        to change the subject .  in addition to developing new model robots  do you also manufacture and repair existing types .     leebig said     manufacture and repair are largely robot conducted .  there is a large factory and maintenance shop on my estate .        do robots require much in the way of repair  by the way .        very little .        does that mean that robot repair is an undeveloped science .        not at all .     leebig said that stiffly .     what about the robot that was at the scene of dr .  delmarre   s murder .     leebig looked away  and his eyebrows drew together as though a painful thought were being barred entrance to his mind .     it was a complete loss .        really complete .  could it answer any questions at all .        none at all .  it was absolutely useless .  its positronic brain was completely short circuited .  not one pathway was left intact .  consider .  it had witnessed a murder it had been unable to halt         why was it unable to halt the murder  by the way .        who can tell .  dr .  delmarre was experimenting with that robot .  i do not know in what mental condition he had left it .  he might have ordered it  for instance  to suspend all operations while he checked one particular circuit element .  if someone whom neither dr .  delmarre nor the robot suspected of harm were suddenly to launch a homicidal attack  there might be a perceptible interval before the robot could use first law potential to overcome dr .  delmarre   s freezing order .  the length of the interval would depend on the nature of the attack and the nature of dr .  delmarre   s freezing order .  i could invent a dozen other ways of explaining why the robot was unable to prevent the murder .  being unable to do so was a first law violation  however  and that was sufficient to blast every positronic pathway in the robot   s mind .        but if the robot was physically unable to prevent the murder  was it responsible .  does the first law ask impossibilities .     leebig shrugged .     the first law  despite your attempts to make little of it  protects humanity with every atom of possible force .  it allows no excuses .  if the first law is broken  the robot is ruined .        that is a universal rule  sir .        as universal as robots .     baley said     then i   ve learned something .        then learn something else .  your theory of murder by a series of robotic actions  each innocent in itself  will not help you in the case of dr .  delmarre   s death .        why not .        the death was not by poisoning  but by bludgeoning .  something had to hold the bludgeon  and that had to be a human arm .  no robot could swing a club and smash a skull .        suppose     said baley     a robot were to push an innocent button which dropped a booby trap weight on delmarre   s head .     leebig smiled sourly .     earthman  i   ve viewed the scene of the crime .  i   ve heard all the news .  the murder was a big thing here on solaria  you know .  so i know there was no sign of any machinery at the scene of the crime  or of any fallen weight .     baley said     or of any blunt instrument  either .     leebig said scornfully     you   re a detective .  find it .        granting that a robot was not responsible for dr .  delmarre   s death  who was  then .        everyone knows who was     shouted leebig .     his wife .  gladia .     baley thought  at least there   s a unanimity of opinion .  aloud he said     and who was the mastermind behind the robots who poisoned gruer .        i suppose .   .   .     leebig trailed off .     you don   t think there are two murderers  do you .  if gladia was responsible for one crime  she must be responsible for the second attempt  also .        yes .  you must be right .     his voice gained assurance .     no doubt of it .        no doubt .        nobody else could get close enough to dr .  delmarre to kill him .  he allowed personal presence no more than i did  except that he made an exception in favor of his wife  and i make no exceptions .  the wiser i .     the roboticist laughed harshly .     i believe you knew her     said baley abruptly .     whom .        her .  we are discussing only one    her .     gladia .        who told you i knew her any more than i know anyone else .     demanded leebig .  he put his hand to his throat .  his fingers moved slightly and opened the neck seam of his garment for an inch downward  leaving more freedom to breathe .     gladia herself did .  you two went for walks .        so .  we were neighbors .  it is a common thing to do .  she seemed a pleasant person .        you approved of her  then .     leebig shrugged .     talking to her was relaxing .        what did you talk about .        robotics .     there was a flavor of surprise about the word as though there were wonder that the question could be asked .     and she talked robotics too .        she knew nothing about robotics .  ignorant .  but she listened .  she has some sort of field force rigmarole she plays with  field coloring  she calls it .  i have no patience with that  but i listened .        all this without personal presence .     leebig looked revolted and did not answer .  baley tried again     were you attracted to her .        what .        did you find her attractive .  physically .     even leebig   s bad eyelid lifted and his lips quivered .     filthy animal     he muttered .     let me put it this way  then .  when did you cease finding gladia pleasant .  you used that word yourself  if you remember .        what do you mean .        you said you found her pleasant .  now you believe she murdered her husband .  that isn   t the mark of a pleasant person .        i was mistaken about her .        but you decided you were mistaken before she killed her husband  if she did so .  you stopped walking with her some time before the murder .  why .     leebig said     is that important .        everything is important till proven otherwise .        look  if you want information from me as a roboticist  ask it .  i won   t answer personal questions .     baley said     you were closely associated with both the murdered man and the chief suspect .  don   t you see that personal questions are unavoidable .  why did you stop walking with gladia .     leebig snapped     there came a time when i ran out of things to say  when i was too busy  when i found no reason to continue the walks .        when you no longer found her pleasant  in other words .        all right .  put it so .        why was she no longer pleasant .     leebig shouted     i have no reason .     baley ignored the other   s excitement .     you are still someone who has known gladia well .  what could her motive be .        her motive .        no one has suggested any motive for the murder .  surely gladia wouldn   t commit murder without a motive .        great galaxy .     leebig leaned his head back as though to laugh  but didn   t .     no one told you .  well  perhaps no one knew .  i knew  though .  she told me .  she told me frequently .        told you what  dr .  leebig .        why  that she quarreled with her husband .  quarreled bitterly and frequently .  she hated him  earthman .  didn   t anyone tell you that .  didn   t she tell you .         a portrait is colored  baley took it between the eyes and tried not to show it .  presumably  living as they did  solarians considered one another   s private lives to be sacrosanct .  questions concerning marriage and children were in bad taste .  he supposed then that chronic quarreling could exist between husband and wife and be a matter into which curiosity was equally forbidden .  but even when murder had been committed .  would no one commit the social crime of asking the suspect if she quarreled with her husband .  or of mentioning the matter if they happened to know of it .  well  leebig had .  baley said     what did the quarrels concern .        you had better ask her  i think .     he better had  thought baley .  he rose stiffly     thank you  dr .  leebig  for your cooperation .  i may need your help again later .  i hope you will keep yourself available .        done viewing     said leebig  and he and the segment of his room vanished abruptly .   for the first time baley found himself not minding a plane flight through open space .  not minding it at all .  it was almost as though he were in his own element .  he wasn   t even thinking of earth or of jessie .  he had been away from earth only a matter of weeks  yet it might as well have been years .  he had been on solaria only the better part of three days and yet it seemed forever .  how fast could a man adapt to nightmare .  or was it gladia .  he would be seeing her soon  not viewing her .  was that what gave him confidence and this odd feeling of mixed apprehension and anticipation .  would she endure it .  he wondered .  or would she slip away after a few moments of seeing  begging off as quemot had done .  she stood at the other end of a long room when he entered .  she might almost have been an impressionistic representation of herself  she was reduced so to essentials .  her lips were faintly red  her eyebrows lightly penciled  her earlobes faintly blue  and  except for that  her face was untouched .  she looked pale  a little frightened  and very young .  her brown blond hair was drawn back  and her gray blue eyes were somehow shy .  her dress was a blue so dark as to be almost black  with a thin white edging curling down each side .  she wore long sleeves  white gloves  and flat heeled shoes .  not an inch of skin showed anywhere but in her face .  even her neck was covered by a kind of unobtrusive ruching .  baley stopped where he was .     is this close enough  gladia .     she was breathing with shallow quickness .  she said     i had forgotten what to expect really .  it   s just like viewing  isn   t it .  i mean  if you don   t think of it as seeing .     baley said     it   s all quite normal to me .        yes  on earth .     she closed her eyes .     sometimes i try to imagine it .  just crowds of people everywhere .  you walk down a road and there are others walking with you and still others walking in the other direction .  dozens         hundreds     said baley .     did you ever view scenes on earth in a book film .  or view a novel with an earth setting .        we don   t have many of those  but i   ve viewed novels set on the other outer worlds where seeing goes on all the time .  it   s different in a novel .  it just seems like a multiview .        do people ever kiss in novels .     she flushed painfully .     i don   t read that kind .        never .        well  there are always a few dirty films around  you know  and sometimes  just out of curiosity   it   s sickening  really .        is it .     she said with sudden animation     but earth is so different .  so many people .  when you walk  elijah  i suppose you even t touch people .  i mean  by accident .     baley half smiled .     you even knock them down by accident .     he thought of the crowds on the expressways  tugging and shoving  bounding up and down the strips  and for a moment  inevitably  he felt the pang of homesickness .  gladia said     you don   t have to stay way out there .        would it be all right if i came closer .        i think so .  i   ll tell you when i   d rather you wouldn   t any more .     stepwise baley drew closer  while gladia watched him  wide eyed .  she said suddenly     would you like to see some of my field colorings .     baley was six feet away .  he stopped and looked at her .  she seemed small and fragile .  he tried to visualize her  something in her hand  what .    swinging furiously at the skull of her husband .  he tried to picture her  mad with rage  homicidal with hate and anger .  he had to admit it could be done .  even a hundred and five pounds of woman could crush a skull if she had the proper weapon and were wild enough .  and baley had known murderesses  on earth  of course  who  in repose  were bunny rabbits .  he said     what are field colorings  gladia .        an art form     she said .  baley remembered leebig   s reference to gladia   s art .  he nodded .     i   d like to see some .        follow me  then .     baley maintained a careful six foot distance between them .  at that  it was less than a third the distance kiorissa had demanded .   they entered a room that burst with light .  it glowed in every corner and every color .  gladia looked pleased  proprietary .  she looked up at baley  eyes anticipating .  baley   s response must have been what she expected  though he said nothing .  he turned slowly  trying to make out what he saw  for it was light only  no material object at all .  the gobbets of light sat on embracing pedestals .  they were living geometry  lines and curves of color  entwined into a coalescing whole yet maintaining distinct identities .  no two .  specimens were even remotely alike .  baley groped for appropriate words and said     is it supposed to mean anything .     gladia laughed in her pleasant contralto .     it means whatever you like it to mean .  they   re just light forms that might make you feel angry or happy or curious or whatever i felt when i constructed one .  i could make one for you  a kind of portrait .  it might not be very good  though  because i would just be improvising quickly .        would you .  i would be very interested .        all right     she said  and half ran to a light figure in one corner  passing within inches of him as she did so .  she did not seem to notice .  she touched something on the pedestal of the light figure and the glory above died without a flicker .  baley gasped and said     don   t do that .        it   s all right .  i was tired of it  anyway .  i   ll just fade the others temporarily so they don   t distract me .     she opened a panel along one featureless wall and moved a rheostat .  the colors faded to something scarcely visible .  baley said     don   t you have a robot to do this .  closing contacts .        shush  now     she said impatiently .     i don   t keep robots in here .  this is me .     she looked at him  frowning .     i don   t know you well enough .  that   s the trouble .     she wasn   t looking at the pedestal  but her fingers rested lightly on its smooth upper surface .  all ten fingers were curved  tense  waiting .  one finger moved  describing a half curve over smoothness .  a bar of deep yellow light grew and slanted obliquely across the air above .  the finger inched backward a fraction and the light grew slightly less deep in shade .  she looked at it momentarily .     i suppose that   s it .  a kind of strength without weight .        jehoshaphat     said baley .     are you offended .     her fingers lifted and the yellow slant of light remained solitary and stationary .     no  not at all .  but what is it .  how do you do it .        that   s hard to explain     said gladia  looking at the pedestal thoughtfully     considering i don   t really understand it myself .  it   s a kind of optical illusion  i   ve been told .  we set up force fields at different energy levels .  they   re extrusions of hyperspace  really  and don   t have the properties of ordinary space at all .  depending on the energy level  the human eye sees light of different shades .  the shapes and colors are controlled by the warmth of my fingers against appropriate spots on the pedestal .  there are all sorts of controls inside each pedestal .        you mean if i were to put my finger there      baley advanced and gladia made way for him .  he put a hesitant forefinger down upon the pedestal and felt a soft throbbing .     go ahead .  move your finger  elijah     said gladia .  baley did so and a dirty gray jag of light lifted upward  skewing the yellow light .  baley withdrew his finger sharply and gladia laughed and then was instantly contrite .     i shouldn   t laugh     she said .     it   s really very hard to do  even for people who   ve tried a long time .     her own hand moved lightly and too quickly for baley to follow and the monstrosity he had set up disappeared  leaving the yellow light in isolation again .     how did you learn to do this .     asked baley .     i just kept on trying .  it   s a new art form  you know  and only one or two really know how         and you   re the best     said baley somberly .     on solaria everyone is either the only or the best or both .        you needn   t laugh .  i   ve had some of my pedestals on display .  i   ve given shows .     her chin lifted .  there was no mistaking her pride .  she continued     let me go on with your portrait .     her fingers moved again .  there were few curves in the light form that grew under her ministrations .  it was all sharp angles .  and the dominant color was blue .     that   s earth  somehow     said gladia  biting her lower lip .     i always think of earth as blue .  all those people and seeing  seeing  seeing .  viewing is more rose .  how does it seem to you .        jehoshaphat  i can   t picture things as colors .        can   t you .     she asked abstractedly .     now you say    jehoshaphat    sometimes and that   s just a little blob of violet .  a little sharp blob because it usually comes out ping  like that .     and the little blob was there  glowing just off center .     and then     she said     i can finish it like this .     and a flat  lusterless hollow cube of slate gray sprang up to enclose everything .  the light within shone through it  but dimmer  imprisoned  somehow .  baley felt a sadness at it  as though it were something enclosing him  keeping him from something he wanted .  he said     what   s that last .     gladia said     why  the walls about you .  that   s what   s most in you  the way you can   t go outside  the way you have to be inside .  you are inside there .  don   t you see .     baley saw and somehow he disapproved .  he said     those walls aren   t permanent .  i   ve been out today .        you have .  did you mind .     he could not resist a counter dig .     the way you mind seeing me .  you don   t like it but you can stand it .     she looked at him thoughtfully .     do you want to come out now .  with me .  for a walk .     it was baley   s impulse to say  jehoshaphat  no .  she said     i   ve never walked with anyone  seeing .  it   s still daytime  and it   s pleasant weather .     baley looked at his abstractionist portrait and said     if i go  will you take away the gray .     she smiled and said     i   ll see how you behave .     the structure of light remained as they left the room .  it stayed behind  holding baley   s imprisoned soul fast in the gray of the cities .   baley shivered slightly .  air moved against him and there was a chill to it .  gladia said     are you cold .        it wasn   t like this before     muttered baley .     it   s late in the day now  but it isn   t really cold .  would you like a coat .  one of the robots could bring one in a minute .        no .  it   s all right .     they stepped forward along a narrow paved path .  he said     is this where you used to walk with dr .  leebig .        oh no .  we walked way out among the fields  where you only see an occasional robot working and you can hear the animal sounds .  you and i will stay near the house though  just in case .        in case what .        well  in case you want to go in .        or in case you get weary of seeing .        it doesn   t bother me     she said recklessly .  there was the vague rustle of leaves above and an all pervading yellowness and greenness .  there were sharp  thin cries in the air about  plus a strident humming  and shadows  too .  he was especially aware of the shadows .  one of them stuck out before him  in shape like a man  that moved as he did in horrible mimicry .  baley had heard of shadows  of course  and he knew what they were  but in the pervasive indirect lighting of the cities he had never been specifically aware of one .  behind him  he knew  was the solarian sun .  he took care not to look at it  but he knew it was there .  space was large  space was lonely  yet he found it drawing him .  his mind pictured himself striding the surface of a world with thousands of miles and light years of room all about him .  why should he find attraction in this thought of loneliness .  he didn   t want loneliness .  he wanted earth and the warmth and companionship of the man crammed cities .  the picture failed him .  he tried to conjure up new york in his mind  all the noise and fullness of it  and found he could remain conscious only of the quiet  air moving chill of the surface of solaria .  without quite willing it baley moved closer to gladia until he was two feet away  then grew aware of her startled face .     i beg your pardon     he said at once  and drew off .  she gasped     it   s all right .  won   t you walk this way .  we have some flower beds you might like .     the direction she indicated lay away from the sun .  baley followed silently .  gladia said     later in the year  it will be wonderful .  in the warm weather i can run down to the lake and swim  or just run across the fields  run as fast as i can until i   m just glad to fall down and lie still .     she looked down at herself .     but this is no costume for it .  with all this on  i   ve got to walk .  sedately  you know .        how would you prefer to dress .     asked baley .     halter and shorts at the most     she cried  lifting her arms as though feeling the freedom of that in her imagination .     sometimes less .  sometimes just sandals so you can feel the air with every inch   oh  i   m sorry .  i   ve offended you .     baley said     no .  it   s all right .  was that your costume when you went walking with dr .  leebig .        it varied .  it depended on the weather .  sometimes i wore very little  but it was viewing  you know .  you do understand  i hope .        i understand .  what about dr .  leebig  though .  did he dress lightly too .        jothan dress lightly .     gladia smiled flashingly .     oh no .  he   s very solemn  always .     she twisted her face into a thin look of gravity and half winked  catching the very essence of leebig and forcing a short grunt of appreciation out of baley .     this is the way he talks     she said .        my dear gladia  in considering the effect of a first order potential on positron flow         is that what he talked to you about .  robotics .        mostly .  oh  he takes it so seriously  you know .  he was always trying to teach me about it .  he never gave up .        did you learn anything .        not one thing .  nothing .  it   s just all a complete mix up to me .  he   d get angry with me sometimes  but when he   d scold  i   d dive into the water  if we were anywhere near the lake  and splash him .        splash him .  i thought you were viewing .     she laughed .     you   re such an earthman .  i   d splash where he was standing in his own room or on his own estate .  the water couldn   t touch him  but he would duck just the same .  look at that .     baley looked .  they had circled a wooded patch and now came upon a clearing  centered about an ornamental pond .  small bricked walks penetrated the clearing and broke it up .  flowers grew in profusion and order .  baley knew them for flowers from book films he had viewed .  in a way the flowers were like the light patterns that gladia constructed and baley imagined that she constructed them in the spirit of flowers .  he touched one cautiously  then looked about .  reds and yellows predominated .  in turning to look about baley caught a glimpse of the sun .  he said uneasily     the sun is low in the sky .        it   s late afternoon     called gladia back to him .  she had run toward the pond and was sitting on a stone bench at its edge .     come here     she shouted  waving .     you can stand if you don   t like to sit on stone .     baley advanced slowly .     does it get this low every day .     and at once he was sorry he asked .  if the planet rotated  the sun must be low in the sky both mornings and afternoons .  only at midday could it be high .  telling himself this couldn   t change a lifetime of pictured thought .  he knew there was such a thing as night and had even experienced it  with a planet   s whole thickness interposing safely between a man and the sun .  he knew there were clouds and a protective grayness hiding the worst of outdoors .  and still  when he thought of planetary surfaces  it was always a picture of a blaze of light with a sun high in the sky .  he looked over his shoulder  just quickly enough to get a flash of sun  and wondered how far the house was if he should decide to return .  gladia was pointing to the other end of the stone bench .  baley said     that   s pretty close to you  isn   t it .     she spread out her little hands  palms up .     i   m getting used to it .  really .     he sat down  facing toward her to avoid the sun .  she leaned over backward toward the water and pulled a small cup shaped flower  yellow without and white streaked within  not at all flamboyant .  she said     this is a native plant .  most of the flowers here are from earth originally .     water dripped from its severed stem as she extended it gingerly toward baley .  baley reached for it as gingerly .     you killed it     he said .     it   s only a flower .  there are thousands more .     suddenly  before his fingers more than touched the yellow cup  she snatched it away  her eyes kindling .     or are you trying to imply i could kill a human being because i pulled a flower .     baley said in soft conciliation     i wasn   t implying anything .  may i see it .     baley didn   t really want to touch it .  it had grown in wet soil and there was still the effluvium of mud about it .  how could these people  who were so careful in contact with earthmen and even with one another  be so careless in their contact with ordinary dirt .  but he held the stalk between thumb and forefinger and looked at it .  the cup was formed of several thin pieces of papery tissue  curving up from a common center .  within it was a white convex swelling  damp with liquid and fringed with dark hairs that trembled lightly in the wind .  she said     can you smell it .     at once baley was aware of the odor that emanated from it .  he leaned toward it and said     it smells like a woman   s perfume .     gladia clapped her hands in delight .     how like an earthman .  what you really mean is that a woman   s perfume smells like that .     baley nodded ruefully .  he was growing weary of the outdoors .  the shadows were growing longer and the land was becoming somber .  yet he was determined not to give in .  he wanted those gray walls of light that dimmed his portrait removed .  it was quixotic  but there it was .  gladia took the flower from baley  who let it go without reluctance .  slowly she pulled its petals apart .  she said     i suppose every woman smells different .        it depends on the perfume     said baley indifferently .     imagine being close enough to tell .  i don   t wear perfume because no one is close enough .  except now .  but i suppose you smell perfume often  all the time .  on earth  your wife is always with you  isn   t she .     she was concentrating very hard on the flower  frowning as she plucked it carefully to pieces .     she   s not always with me     said baley .     not every minute .        but most of the time .  and whenever you want to      baley said suddenly     why did dr .  leebig try so hard to teach you robotics  do you suppose .     the dismembered flower consisted now of a stalk and the inner swelling .  gladia twirled it between her fingers  then tossed it away  so that it floated for a moment on the surface of the pond .     i think he wanted me to be his assistant     she said .     did he tell you so  gladia .        toward the end  elijah .  i think he grew impatient .  anyway  he asked me if i didn   t think it would be exciting to work in robotics .  naturally  i told him i could think of nothing duller .  he was quite angry .        and he never walked with you again after that .     she said     you know  i think that may have been it .  i suppose his feelings were hurt .  really  though  what could i do .        it was before that  though  that you told him about your quarrels with dr .  delmarre .     her hands became fists and held so in a tight spasm .  her body held stiffly to its position  head bent and a little to one side .  her voice was unnaturally high .     what quarrels .        your quarrels with your husband .  i understand you hated him .     her face was distorted and blotched as she glared at him .     who told you that .  jothan .        dr .  leebig mentioned it .  i think it   s true .     she was shaken .     you   re still trying to prove i killed him .  i keep thinking you   re my friend and you   re only  only a detective .     she raised her fists and baley waited .  he said     you know you can   t touch me .     her hands dropped and she began crying without a sound .  she turned her head away .  baley bent his own head and closed his eyes  shutting out the disturbing long shadows .  he said     dr .  delmarre was not a very affectionate man  was he .     she said in a strangled way     he was a very busy man .     baley said     you are affectionate  on the other hand .  you find a man interesting .  do you understand .        i c can   t help it .  i know it   s disgusting  but i can   t help it .  it   s even disgusting t to talk about it .        you did talk about it to dr .  leebig  though .        i had to do something and jothan was handy and he didn   t seem to mind and it made me feel better .        was this the reason you quarreled with your husband .  was it that he was cold and unaffectionate and you resented it .        sometimes i hated him .     she shrugged her shoulders helplessly .     he was just a good solarian and we weren   t scheduled for ch  for ch      she broke down .  baley waited .  his own stomach was cold and open air pressed down heavily upon him .  when gladia   s sobs grew quieter  he asked  as gently as he could     did you kill him  gladia .        n no .     then  suddenly  as though all resistance had corroded within her     i haven   t told you everything .        well  then  please do so now .        we were quarreling that time  the time he died .  the old quarrel .  i screamed at him but he never shouted back .  he hardly ever even said anything and that just made it worse .  i was so angry  so angry .  i don   t remember after that .        jehoshaphat .     baley swayed slightly and his eyes sought the neutral stone of the bench .     what do you mean you don   t remember .        i mean he was dead and i was screaming and the robots came         did you kill him .        i don   t remember it  elijah  and i would remember it if i did  wouldn   t i .  only i don   t remember anything else  either  and i   ve been so frightened  so frightened .  help me  please  elijah .        don   t worry  gladia .  i   ll help you .     baley   s reeling mind fastened on the murder weapon .  what happened to it .  it must have been removed .  if so  only the murderer could have done it .  since gladia was found immediately after the murder on the scene  she could not have done it .  the murderer would have to be someone else .  no matter how it looked to everyone on solaria  it had to be someone else .  baley thought sickly  i   ve got to get back to the house .  he said     gladia      somehow he was staring at the sun .  it was nearly at the horizon .  he had to turn his head to look at it and his eyes locked with a morbid fascination .  he had never seen it so .  fat  red  and dim somehow  so that one could look at it without blinding  arid see the bleeding clouds above it in thin lines  with one crossing it in a bar of black .  baley mumbled     the sun is so red .     he heard gladia   s choked voice say drearily     it   s always red at sunset  red and dying .     baley had a vision .  the sun was moving down to the horizon because the planet   s surface was moving away from it  a thousand miles an hour  spinning under that naked sun  spinning with nothing to guard the microbes called men that scurried over its spinning surface  spinning madly forever  spinning  spinning .   .  it was his head that was spinning and the stone bench that was slanting beneath him and the sky heaving  blue  dark blue  and the sun was gone  with the tops of trees and the ground rushing up and gladia screaming thinly and another sound .   .      a solution is offered  baley was aware first of enclosure  the absence of the open  and then of a face bending over him .  he stared for a moment without recognition .  then     daneel .     the robot   s face showed no sign of relief or of any other recognizable emotion at being addressed .  he said     it is well that you have recovered consciousness  partner elijah .  i do not believe you have suffered physical injury .        i   m all right     said baley testily  struggling to his elbows .     jehoshaphat  am i in bed .  what for .        you have been exposed to the open a number of times today .  the effects upon you have been cumulative and you need rest .        i need a few answers first .     baley looked about and tried to deny to himself that his head was spinning just a little .  he did not recognize the room .  the curtains were drawn .  lights were comfortably artificial .  he was feeling much better .     for instance  where am i .        in a room of mrs .  delmarre   s mansion .        next  let   s get something straight .  what are you doing here .  how did you get away from the robots i set over you .     daneel said     it had seemed to me that you would be displeased at this development and yet in the interests of your safety and of my orders  i felt that i had no choice but         what did you do .  jehoshaphat .        it seems mrs .  delmarre attempted to view you some hours ago .        yes .     baley remembered gladia saying as much earlier in the day .     i know that .        your order to the robots that held me prisoner was  in your words     do not allow him     meaning myself     to establish contact with other humans or other robots  either by seeing or by viewing .     however  partner elijah  you said nothing about forbidding other humans or robots to contact me .  you see the distinction .     baley groaned .  daneel said     no need for distress  partner elijah .  the flaw in your orders was instrumental in saving your life  since it brought me to the scene .  you see  when mrs .  delmarre viewed me  being allowed to do so by my robot guardians  she asked after you and i answered  quite truthfully  that i did not know of your whereabouts  but that i could attempt to find out .  she seemed anxious that i do so .  i said i thought it possible you might have left the house temporarily and that i would check that matter and would she  in the meanwhile  order the robots in the room with me  to search the mansion for your presence .        wasn   t she surprised that you didn   t deliver the orders to the robots yourself .        i gave her the impression  i believe  that as an auroran i was not as accustomed to robots as she was  that she might deliver the orders with greater authority and effect a more speedy consummation .  solarians  it is quite clear  are vain of their skill with robots and contemptuous of the ability of natives of other planets to handle them .  is that not your opinion as well  partner elijah .        and she ordered them away  then .        with difficulty .  they protested previous orders but  of course  could not state the nature thereof since you had ordered them to tell no one of my own true identity .  she overrode them  although the final orders had to be thrilled out in fury .        and then you left .        i did  partner elijah .     a pity  thought baley  that gladia did not consider that episode important enough to relay to him when he viewed her .  he said     it took you long enough to find me  daneel .        the robots on solaria have a network of information through subetheric contact .  a skilled solarian could obtain information readily  but  mediated as it is through millions of individual machines  one such as myself  without experience in the matter  must take time to unearth a single datum .  it was better than an hour before the information as to your whereabouts reached me .  i lost further time by visiting dr .  delmarre   s place of business after you had departed .        what were you doing there .        pursuing researches of my own .  i regret that this had to be done in your absence  but the exigencies of the investigation left me no choice .     baley said     did you view kiorissa cantoro  or see her .        i viewed her  but from another part of her building  not from our own estate .  there were records at the farm i had to see .  ordinarily viewing would have been sufficient  but it might have been inconvenient to remain on our own estate since three robots knew my real nature and might easily have imprisoned me once more .     baley felt almost well .  he swung his legs out of bed and found himself in a kind of nightgown .  he stared at it with distaste .     get me my clothes .     daneel did so .  as baley dressed  he said     where   s mrs .  delmarre .        under house arrest  partner elijah .        what .  by whose order .        by my order .  she is confined to her bedroom under robotic guard and her right to give orders other than to meet personal needs has been neutralized .        by yourself .        the robots on this estate are not aware of my identity .     baley finished dressing .     i know the case against gladia     he said .     she had the opportunity  more of it  in fact  than we thought at first .  she did not rush to the scene at the sound of her husband   s cry  as she first said .  she was there all along .        does she claim to have witnessed the murder and seen the murderer .        no .  she remembers nothing of the crucial moments .  that happens sometimes .  it turns out  also  that she has a motive .        what was it  partner elijah .        one that i had suspected as a possibility from the first .  i said to myself  if this were earth  and dr .  delmarre were as he was described to be and gladia delmarre as she seemed to be  i would say that she was in love with him  or had been  and that he was in love only with himself .  the difficulty was to tell whether solarians felt love or reacted to love in any earthly sense .  my judgment as to their emotions and reactions wasn   t to be trusted .  it was why i had to see a few .  not view them  but see them .        i do not follow you  partner elijah .        i don   t know if i can explain it to you .  these people have their gene possibilities carefully plotted before birth and the actual gene distribution tested after birth .        i know that .        but genes aren   t everything .  environment counts too  and environment can bend into actual psychosis where genes indicate only a potentiality for a particular psychosis .  did you notice gladia   s interest in earth .        i remarked upon it  partner elijah  and considered it an assumed interest designed to influence your opinions .        suppose it were a real interest  even a fascination .  suppose there were something about earth   s crowds that excited her .  suppose she were attracted against her will by something she had been taught to consider filthy .  there was possible abnormality .  i had to test it by seeing solarians and noticing how they reacted to it  and seeing her and noticing how she reacted to it .  it was why i had to get away from you  daneel  at any cost .  it was why i had to abandon viewing as a method for carrying on the investigation .        you did not explain this  partner elijah .        would the explanation have helped against what you conceived your duty under first law to be .     daneel was silent .  baley said     the experiment worked .  i saw or tried to see several people .  an old sociologist tried to see me and had to give up midway .  a roboticist refused to see me at all even under terrific force  the bare possibility sent him into an almost infantile frenzy .  he sucked his finger and wept .  dr .  delmarre   s assistant was used to personal presence in the way of her profession and so she tolerated me  but at twenty feet only .  gladia  on the other hand         yes  partner elijah .        gladia consented to see me without more than a slight hesitation .  she tolerated my presence easily and actually showed signs of decreasing strain as time went on .  it all fits into a pattern of psychosis .  she didn   t mind seeing me  she was interested in earth  she might have felt an abnormal interest in her husband .  all of it could be explained by a strong and  for this world  psychotic interest in the personal presence of members of the opposite sex .  dr .  delmarre  himself  was not the type to encourage such a feeling or co operate with it .  it must have been very frustrating for her .     daneel nodded .     frustrating enough for murder in a moment of passion .        in spite of everything  i don   t think so  daneel .        are you perhaps being influenced by extraneous motives of your own  partner elijah .  mrs .  delmarre is an attractive woman and you are an earthman in whom a preference for the personal presence of an attractive woman is not psychotic .        i have better reasons     said baley uneasily .   daneel   s cool glance was too penetrating and soul dissecting by half .  jehoshaphat .  the thing was only a machine .   he said     if she were the murderess of her husband  she would also have to be the attempted murderess of gruer .     he had almost the impulse to explain the way murder could be manipulated through robots  but held back .  he was not sure how daneel would react to a theory that made unwitting murderers of robots .  daneel said     and the attempted murderess of yourself as well .     baley frowned .  he had had no intention of telling daneel of the poisoned arrow that had missed  no intention of strengthening the other   s already too strong protective complex vis a vis himself .  he said angrily     what did klorissa tell you .     he ought to have warned her to keep quiet  but then  how was he to know that daneel would be about  asking questions .  daneel said calmly     mrs .  cantoro had nothing to do with the matter .  i witnessed the murder attempt myself .     baley was thoroughly confused .     you were nowhere about .     daneel said     i caught you myself and brought you here an hour ago .        what are you talking about .        do you not remember  partner elijah .  it was almost a perfect murder .  did not mrs .  delmarre suggest that you go into the open .  i was not a witness to that  but i feel certain she did .        she did suggest it .  yes .        she may even have enticed you to leave the house .     baley thought of the    portrait    of himself  of the enclosing gray walls .  could it have been clever psychology .  could a solarian have that much intuitive understanding of the psychology of an earthman .     no     he said .  daneel said     was it she who suggested you go down to the ornamental pond and sit on the bench .        well  yes .        does it occur to you that she might have been watching you  noticing your gathering dizziness .        she asked once or twice if i wanted to go back .        she might not have meant it seriously .  she might have been watching you turn sicker on that bench .  she might even have pushed you  or perhaps a push wasn   t necessary .  at the moment i reached you and caught you in my arms  you were in the process of falling backward off the stone bench and into three feet of water  in which you would surely have drowned .     for the first time baley recalled those last fugitive sensations .     jehoshaphat .        moreover     said daneel with calm relentlessness     mrs .  delmarre sat beside you  watching you fall  without a move to stop you .  nor would she have attempted to pull you out of the water .  she would have let you drown .  she might have called a robot  but the robot would surely have arrived too late .  and afterward  she would explain merely that  of course  it was impossible for her to touch you even to save your life .     true enough  thought baley .  no one would question her inability to touch a human being .  the surprise  if any  would come at her ability to be as close to one as she was .  daneel said     you see  then  partner elijah  that her guilt can scarcely be in question .  you stated that she would have to be the attempted murderess of agent gruer as though this were an argument against her guilt .  you see now that she must have been .  her only motive to murder you was the same as her motive for trying to murder gruer  the necessity of getting rid of an embarrassingly persistent investigator of the first murder .     baley said     the whole sequence might have been an innocent one .  she might never have realized how the outdoors would affect     she studied earth .  she knew the peculiarities of earthmen .        i assured her i had been outdoors today and that i was growing used to it .        she may have known better .     baley pounded fist against palm .     you   re making her too clever .  it doesn   t fit and i don   t believe it .  in any case  no murder accusation can stick unless and until the absence of the murder weapon can be accounted for .     daneel looked steadily at the earthman     i can do that  too  partner elijah .      baley looked at his robot partner with a stunned expression .     how .        your reasoning  you will remember  partner elijah  was this .  were mrs .  delmarre the murderess  then the weapon  whatever it was  must have remained at the scene of the murder .  the robots  appearing almost at once  saw no sign of such a weapon  hence it must have been removed from the scene  hence the murderer must have removed it  hence the murderer could not be mrs .  delmarre .  is all that correct .        correct .        yet     continued the robot     there is one place where the robots did not look for the weapon .        where .        under mrs .  delmarre .  she was lying in a faint  brought on by the excitement and passion of the moment  whether murderess or not  and the weapon  whatever it was  lay under her and out of sight .     baley said     then the weapon would have been discovered as soon as she was moved .        exactly     said daneel     but she was not moved by the robots .  she herself told us yesterday at dinner that dr .  thool ordered the robots to put a pillow under her head and leave her .  she was first moved by dr .  altim thool  himself  when he arrived to examine her .        so .        it follows  therefore  partner elijah  that a new possibility arises .  mrs .  delmarre was the murderess  the weapon was at the scene of the crime  but dr .  thool carried it off and disposed of it to protect mrs .  delmarre .     baley felt contemptuous .  he had almost been seduced into expecting something reasonable .  he said     completely motiveless .  why should dr .  thool do such a thing .        for a very good reason .  you remember mrs .  delmarre   s remarks concerning him     he always treated me since i was a child and was always so friendly and kind .     i wondered if he might have some motive for being particularly concerned about her .  it was for that reason that i visited the baby farm and inspected the records .  what i had merely guessed at as a possibility turned out to be the truth .        what .        dr .  altim thool was the father of gladia delmarre  and what is more  he knew of the relationship .      baley had no thought of disbelieving the robot .  he felt only a deep chagrin that it had been robot daneel olivaw and not himself that had carried through the necessary piece of logical analysis .  even so  it was not complete .  he said     have you spoken to dr .  thool .        yes .  i have placed him under house arrest  also .        what does he say .        he admits that he is the father of mrs .  delmarre .  i confronted him with the records of the fact and the records of his inquiries into her health when she was a youngster .  as a doctor  he was allowed more leeway in this respect than another solarian might have been allowed .        why should he have inquired into her health .        i have considered that  too  partner elijah .  he was an old man when he was given special permission to have an additional child and  what is more  he succeeded in producing one .  he considers this a tribute to his genes and to his physical fitness .  he is prouder of the result  perhaps  than is quite customary on this world .  moreover  his position as physician  a profession little regarded on solaria because it involves personal presences  made it the more important to him to nurture this sense of pride .  for that reason  he maintained unobtrusive contact with his offspring .        does gladia know anything of it .        as far as dr .  thool is aware  partner elijah  she does not .     baley said     does thool admit removing the weapon .        no .  that he does not .        then you   ve got nothing  daneel .        nothing .        unless you can find  the weapon and prove he took it  or at the very least induce him to confess  you have no evidence .  a chain of deduction is pretty  but it isn   t evidence .        the man would scarcely confess without considerable questioning of a type i myself could not carry through .  his daughter is dear to him .        not at all     said baley .     his feeling for his daughter is not at all what you and i are accustomed to .  solaria is different .     he strode the length of the room and back  letting himself cool .  he said     daneel  you have worked out a perfect exercise in logic  but none of it is reasonable  just the same .      logical but not reasonable .  wasn   t that the definition of a robot .   he went on     dr .  thool is an old man and past his best years  regardless of whether he was capable of siring a daughter thirty years or so ago .  even spacers get senile .  picture him then examining his daughter in a faint and his son in law dead by violence .  can you imagine the unusual nature of the situation for him .  can you suppose he could have remained master of himself .  so much the master of himself  in fact  as to carry out a series of amazing actions .     look .  first  he would have had to notice a weapon under his daughter  one that must have been so well covered by her body that the robots never noticed it .  secondly  from whatever small scrap of object he noted  he must have deduced the presence of the weapon and seen at once that if he could but sneak off with that weapon  unseen  a murder accusation against his daughter would be hard to substantiate .  that   s pretty subtle thinking for an old man in a panic .  then  thirdly  he would have had to carry the plan through  also tough for an old man in a panic .  and now  lastly  he would have to dare to compound the felony further by sticking to his lie .  it all may be the result of logical thinking  but none of it is reasonable .     daneel said     do you have an alternate solution to the crime  partner elijah .     baley had sat down during the course of his last speech and now he tried to rise again  but a combination of weariness and the depth of the chair defeated him .  he held out his hand petulantly .     give me a hand  will you  daneel .     daneel stared at his own hand .     i beg your pardon  partner elijah .     baley silently swore at the other   s literal mind and said     help me out of the chair .     daneel   s strong arm lifted him out of the chair effortlessly .  baley said     thanks .  no  i haven   t an alternate solution .  at least  i have  but the whole thing hinges on the location of the weapon .     he walked impatiently to the heavy curtains that lined most of one wall and lifted a corner without quite realizing what he was doing .  he stared at the black patch of glass until he became aware of the fact that he was looking out into the early night  and then dropped the curtain just as daneel  approaching quietly  took it out of his fingers .  in the split fraction of a moment in which baley watched the robot   s hand take the curtain away from him with the loving caution of a mother protecting her child from the fire  a revolution took place within him .  he snatched the curtain back  yanking it out of daneel   s grasp .  throwing his full weight against it  he tore it away from the window  leaving shreds behind .     partner elijah .     said daneel softly .     surely you know now what the open will do to you .        i know     said baley     what it will do for me .     he stared out the window .  there was nothing to see  only blackness  but that blackness was open air .  it was unbroken  unobstructed space  even if unlit  and he was facing it .  and for the first time he faced it freely .  it was no longer bravado  or perverse curiosity  or the pathway to a solution of a murder .  he faced it because he knew he wanted to and because he needed to .  that made all the difference .  walls were crutches .  darkness and crowds were crutches .  he must have thought them so  unconsciously  and hated them even when he most thought he loved and needed them .  why else had he so resented gladia   s gray enclosure of his portrait .  he felt himself filling with a sense of victory  and  as though victory were contagious  a new thought came  bursting like an inner shout .  baley turned dizzily to daneel .     i know     he whispered .     jehoshaphat .  i know .        know what  partner elijah .        i know what happened to the weapon  i know who is responsible .  all at once  everything falls into place .         a meeting is held  daneel would allow no immediate action .     tomorrow .     he had said with respectful firmness .     that is my suggestion  partner elijah .  it is late and you are in need of rest .     baley had to admit the truth of it  and besides there was the need of preparation  a considerable quantity of it .  he had the solution of the murder  he felt sure of that  but it rested on deduction  as much as had daneel   s theory  and it was worth as little as evidence .  solarians would have to help him .  and if he were to face them  one earthman against half a dozen spacers  he would have to be in full control .  that meant rest and preparation .  yet he would not sleep .  he was certain he would not sleep .  not all the softness of the special bed set up for him by smoothly functioning robots nor all the soft perfume and softer music in the special room of gladia   s mansion would help .  he was sure of it .  daneel sat unobtrusively in one darkened corner .  baley said     are you still afraid of gladia .     the robot said     i do not think it wise to allow you to sleep alone and unprotected .        well  have your way .  are you clear as to what i want you to do  daneel .        i am  partner elijah .        you have no reservations under the first law  i hope .        i have some with respect to the conference you wish arranged .  will you be armed and careful of your own safety .        i assure you  i will .     daneel delivered himself of a sigh that was somehow so human that for a moment baley found himself trying to penetrate the darkness that he might study the machine perfect face of the other .  daneel said     i have not always found human behavior logical .        we need three laws of our own     said baley     but i   m glad we don   t have them .     he stared at the ceiling .  a great deal depended on daneel and yet he could tell him very little of the whole truth .  robots were too involved .  the planet  aurora  had its reasons for sending a robot as representative of their interests  but it was a mistake .  robots had their limitations .  still  if all went right  this could all be over in twelve hours .  he could be heading back to earth in twenty four  bearing hope .  a strange kind of hope .  a kind he could scarcely believe himself  yet it was earth   s way out .  it must be earth   s way out .  earth .  new york .  jessie and ben .  the comfort and familiarity and dearness of home .  he dwelled on it  half asleep  and the thought of earth failed to conjure the comfort he expected .  there was an estrangement between himself and the cities .  and at some unknown point in time it all faded and he slept .   baley  having slept and then wakened  showered and dressed .  physically he was quite prepared .  yet he was unsure .  it was not that his reasoning seemed any less cogent to himself in the pallor of morning .  it was rather the necessity of facing solarians .  could he be sure of their reactions after all .  or would he still be working blind .  gladia was the first to appear .  it was simple for her  of course .  she was on an intramural circuit  since she was in the mansion itself .  she was pale and expressionless  in a white gown that draped her into a cold statue .  she stared helplessly at baley .  baley smiled back gently and she seemed to take comfort from that .  one by one  they appeared now .  attlebish  the acting head of security  appeared next after gladia  lean and haughty  his large chin set in disapproval .  then leebig  the roboticist  impatient and angry  his weak eyelid fluttering periodically .  quemot  the sociologist  a little tired  but smiling at baley out of deep set eyes in a condescending way  as though to say  we have seen one another  we have been intimate .  kiorissa cantoro  when she appeared  seemed uneasy in the presence of the others .  she glanced at gladia for a moment with an audible sniff  then stared at the floor .  dr .  thool  the physician  appeared last .  he looked haggard  almost sick .  they were all there  all but gruer  who was slowly recovering and for whom attendance was physically impossible .   well  thought baley  we   ll do without him .   all were dressed formally  all sat in rooms that were well curtained into enclosure .  daneel had arranged matters well .  baley hoped fervently that what remained for daneel to do would work as well .  baley looked from one spacer to the other .  his heart thudded .  each figure viewed him out of a different room and the clash of lighting  furniture  and wall decoration was dizzying .  baley said     i want to discuss the matter of the killing of dr .  rikaine delmarre under the heading of motive  opportunity  and means  in that order      attlebish interrupted .     will this be a long speech .     baley said sharply     it may be .  i have been called here to investigate a murder and such a job is my specialty and my profession .  i know best how to go about it .      take nothing from them now  he thought  or this whole thing won   t work .  dominate .  dominate .   he went on  making his words as sharp and incisive as he could .     motive first .  in a way  motive is the most unsatisfactory of the three items .  opportunity and means are objective .  they can be investigated factually .  motive is subjective .  it may be something that can be observed by others  revenge for a known humiliation  for instance .  but it may also be completely unobservable  an irrational  homicidal hate on the part of a well disciplined person who never lets it show .     now almost all of you have told me at one time or another that you believed gladia delmarre to have committed the crime .  certainly  no one has suggested an alternate suspect .  has gladia a motive .  dr .  leebig suggested one .  he said that gladia quarreled frequently with her husband and gladia later admitted this to me .  the rage that can arise out of a quarrel can  conceivably  move a person to murder .  very well .     the question remains  though  whether she is the only one with a motive .  i wonder .  dr .  leebig  himself      the roboticist almost jumped .  his hand extended rigidly in the direction of baley .     watch what you  say  earthman .        i am only theorizing     said baley coldly .     you  dr .  leebig  were working with dr .  delmarre on new robot models .  you are the best man in solaria as far as robotics is concerned .  you say so and i believe it .     leebig smiled with open condescension .  baley went on .     but i have heard that dr .  delmarre was about to break off relations with you for matters concerning yourself of which he disapproved .        false .  false .        perhaps .  but what if it were true .  wouldn   t you have a motive to get rid of him before he humiliated you publicly by breaking with you .  i have a feeling you could not easily bear such humiliation .     baley went on rapidly to give leebig no chance to retort .     and you  mrs .  cantoro .  dr .  delmarre   s death leaves you in charge of fetal engineering  a responsible position .        skies above  we talked about that before     cried kiorissa in anguish .     i know we did  but it   s a point that must be considered  anyway .  as for dr .  quemot  he played chess with dr .  delmarre regularly .  perhaps he grew annoyed at losing too many games .     the sociologist interposed quietly .     losing a chess game is insufficient motive surely  plainclothesman .        it depends on how seriously you take your chess .  motives can seem all the world to the murderer and completely insignificant to everyone else .  well  it doesn   t matter .  my point is that motive alone is insufficient .  anyone can have a motive  particularly for the murder of a man such as dr .  delmarre .        what do you mean by that remark     demanded quemot in indignation .     why  only that dr .  delmarre was a    good solarian .     you all described him as such .  he rigidly fulfilled all the requirements of solarian custom .  he was an ideal man  almost an abstraction .  who could feel love  or even liking  for such a man .  a man without weaknesses serves only to make everyone else conscious of his own imperfections .  a primitive poet named tennyson once wrote     he is all fault who has no fault at all .        no one would kill a man for being too good     said klorissa  frowning .     you little know     said baley  and went on without amplification .     dr .  delmarre was aware of a conspiracy on solaria  or thought he was  a conspiracy that was preparing an assault on the rest of the galaxy for purposes of conquest .  he was interested in preventing that .  for that reason  those concerned in the conspiracy might find it necessary to do away with him .  anyone here could be a member of the conspiracy  including  to be sure  mrs .  delmarre  but including even the acting head of security  corwin attlebish .        i .     said attlebish  unmoved .     you certainly attempted to end the investigation as soon as gruer   s mishap put you in charge .     baley took a few slow sips at his drink  straight from its original container  untouched by human hands others than his own  or robotic hands  either  and gathered his strength .  so far  this was a waiting game  and he was thankful the solarians were sitting still for it .  they hadn   t the earthman   s experience of dealing with people at close quarters .  they weren   t in fighters .  he said     opportunity next .  it is the general opinion that only mrs .  delmarre had opportunity since only she could approach her husband in actual personal presence .     are we sure of that .  suppose someone other than mrs .  delmarre had made up his or her mind to kill dr .  delmarre .  would not such a desperate resolution make the discomfort of personal presence secondary .  if any of you were set on murder  wouldn   t you bear personal presence just long enough to do the job .  couldn   t you sneak into the delmarre mansion      attlebish interposed frigidly .     you are ignorant of the matter  earthman .  whether we would or would not doesn   t matter .  the fact is that dr .  delmarre himself would not allow seeing  i assure you .  if anyone came into his personal presence  regardless of how valued and long standing a friendship there was between them  dr .  delmarre would order him away and  if necessary  call robots to help with the ejection .        true     said baley     if dr .  delmarre were aware that personal presence was involved .        what do you mean by that .     demanded dr .  thool in surprise  his voice quavering .     when you treated mrs .  delmarre at the scene of the murder     replied baley  looking full at his questioner     she assumed you were viewing her  until you actually touched her .  so she told me and so i believe .  i am  myself  accustomed only to seeing .  when i arrived at solaria and met security head gruer  i assumed i was seeing him .  when at the end of our interview  gruer disappeared  i was taken completely by surprise .     now assume the reverse .  suppose that for all a man   s adult life  he had been viewing only  never seeing anyone  except on rare occasions his wife .  now suppose someone other than his wife walked up to him in personal presence .  would he not automatically assume that it was a matter of viewing  particularly if a robot had been instructed to advise delmarre that viewing contact was being set up .        not for a minute     said quemot .     the sameness of background would give it away .        maybe  but how many of you are aware of background now .  there would be a minute or so  at least  before dr .  delmarre would grow aware that something was wrong and in that time  his friend  whoever he was  could walk up to him  raise a club  and bring it down .        impossible     said quemot stubbornly .     i think not     said baley .       think opportunity must be canceled out as absolute proof that mrs .  delmarre is the murderess .  she had opportunity  but so might others .     baley waited again .  he felt perspiration on his forehead  but wiping it away would have made him look weak .  he must maintain absolute charge of the proceedings .  the person at whom he was aiming must be placed in self convinced inferiority .  it was hard for an earthman to do that to a spacer .  baley looked from face to face and decided that matters were at least progressing satisfactorily .  even attlebish looked quite humanly concerned .     and so we come     he said     to means  and that is the most puzzling factor of all .  the weapon with which the murder was committed was never found .        we know that     said attlebish .     if it were not for that point  we would have considered the case against mrs .  delmarre conclusive .  we would never have required an investigation .        perhaps     said baley .     let   s analyze the matter of means  then .  there are two possibilities .  either mrs .  delmarre committed the murder  or someone else did .  if mrs .  delmarre committed the murder  the weapon would have had to remain at the scene of the crime  unless it were removed later .  it has been suggested by my partner  mr .  olivaw of aurora  who is not present at the moment  that dr .  thool had the opportunity to remove the weapon .  i ask dr .  thool now  in the presence of all of us  if he did this  if he removed a weapon while examining the unconscious mrs .  delmarre .     dr .  thool was shaking .     no  no .  i swear it .  i   ll abide any questioning .  i swear i removed nothing .     baley said     is there anyone who wishes to suggest at this point that dr .  thool is lying .     there was a silence  during which leebig looked at an object outside of baley   s field of vision and muttered something about the time .  baley said     the second possibility is that someone else committed the crime and carried the weapon off with him .  but if that were so  one must ask why .  carrying the weapon away is an advertisement of the fact that mrs .  delmarre was not the murderess .  if an outsider were the murderer  he would have to be a complete imbecile not to leave the weapon with the corpse to convict mrs .  delmarre .  either way  then  the weapon must be there .  yet it was not seen .     attlebish said     do you take us for fools or for blind men .        i take you for solarians     said baley calmly     and therefore incapable of recognizing the particular weapon that was left at the scene of the crime as a weapon .        i don   t understand a word     muttered klorissa in distress .  even gladia  who had scarcely moved a muscle during the course of the meeting  was staring at baley in surprise .  baley said     dead husband and unconscious wife were not the only individuals on the scene .  there was also a disorganized robot .        well .     said leebig angrily .     isn   t it obvious  then  that  in having eliminated the impossible  what remains  however improbable  is the truth .  the robot at the scene of the crime was the murder weapon  a murder weapon none of you could recognize by force of your training .      they all talked at once  all but gladia  who simply stared .  baley raised his arms .     hold it .  quiet .  let me explain .     and once again he told the story of the attempt on gruer   s life and the method by which it could have been accomplished .  this time he added the attempt on his own life at the baby farm .  leebig said impatiently     i suppose that was managed by having one robot poison an arrow without knowing it was using poison  and having a second robot hand the poisoned arrow to the boy after telling him that you were an earthman  without its knowing that the arrow was poisoned .        something like that .  both robots would be completely instructed .        very farfetched     said leebig .  quemot was pale and looked as though he might be sick at any moment .     no solarian could possibly use robots to harm a human .        maybe so     said baley with a shrug     but the point is that robots can be so manipulated .  ask dr .  leebig .  he is the roboticist .     leebig said     it does not apply to the murder of dr .  delmarre .  i told you that yesterday .  how can anyone arrange to have a robot smash a man   s skull .        shall i explain how .        do so if you can .     baley said     it was a new model robot that dr .  delmarre was testing .  the significance of that wasn   t plain to me until last evening  when i had occasion to say to a robot  in asking for his help in rising out of a chair     give me a hand .     the robot looked at his own hand in confusion as though he thought he was expected to detach it and give it to me .  i had to repeat my order less idiomatically .  but it reminded me of something dr .  leebig had told me earlier that day .  there was experimentation among robots with replaceable limbs .     suppose this robot that dr .  delmarre had been testing was one such  capable of using any of a number of interchangeable limbs of various shapes for different kinds of specialized tasks .  suppose the murderer knew this and suddenly said to the robot     give me your arm .     the robot would detach its arm and give it to him .  the detached arm would make a splendid weapon .  with dr .  delmarre dead  it could be snapped back into place .     stunned horror gave way to a babble of objection as baley talked .  his last sentence had to be shouted  and  even so  was all but drowned out .  attlebish  face flushed  raised himself from his chair and stepped forward .     even if what you say is so  then mrs .  delmarre is the murderess .  she was there  she quarreled with him  she would be watching her husband working with the robot  and would know of the replaceable limb situation  which i don   t believe  by the way .  no matter what you do  earthman  everything points to her .     gladia began to weep softly .  baley did not look at her .  he said     on the contrary  it is easy to show that  whoever committed the murder  mrs .  delmarre did not .   jothan leebig suddenly folded his arms and allowed an expression of contempt to settle on his face .  baley caught that and said     you   ll help me do so  dr .  leebig .  as a roboticist  you know that maneuvering robots into actions such as indirect murder takes enormous skill .  i had occasion yesterday to try to put an individual under house arrest .  i gave three robots detailed instructions intended to keep this individual safe .  it was a simple thing  but i am a clumsy man with robots .  there were loopholes in my instructions and my prisoner escaped .        who was the prisoner .     demanded attlebish .     beside the point     said baley impatiently .     what is the point is the fact that amateurs can   t handle robots well .  and some solarians may be pretty amateurish as solarians go .  for instance  what does gladia delmarre know about robotics .   .   .   .  well  dr .  leebig .        what .     the roboticist stared .     you tried to teach mrs .  delmarre robotics .  what kind of a pupil was she .  did she learn anything .     leebig looked about uneasily .     she didn   t .   .   .     and stalled .     she was completely hopeless  wasn   t she .  or would you prefer not to answer .     leebig said stiffly     she might have pretended ignorance .        are you prepared to say  as a roboticist  that you think mrs .  delmarre is sufficiently skilled to drive robots to indirect murder .        how can i answer that .        let me put it another way .  whoever tried to have me killed at the baby farm must have had to locate me by using interrobot communications .  after all  i told no human where i was going and only the robots who conveyed me from point to point knew of my whereabouts .  my partner  daneel olivaw  managed to trace me later in the day  but only with considerable difficulty .  the murderer  on the other hand  must have done it easily  since  in addition to locating me  he had to arrange for arrow poisoning and arrow shooting  all before i left the farm and moved on .  would mrs .  delmarre have the skill to do that .     corwin attlebish leaned forward .     who do you suggest would have the necessary skill  earthman .     baley said     dr .  jothan leebig is self admittedly the best robot man on the planet .        is that an accusation .     cried leebig .     yes .     shouted baley .   the fury in leebig   s eyes faded slowly .  it was replaced not by calm  exactly  but by a kind of clamped down tension .  he said     i studied the delmarre robot after the murder .  it had no detachable limbs .  at least  they were detachable only in the usual sense of requiring special tools and expert handling .  so the robot wasn   t the weapon used in killing delmarre and you have no argument .     baley said     who else can vouch for the truth of your statement .        my word is not to be questioned .        it is here .  i   m accusing you  and your unsupported word concerning the robot is valueless .  if someone else will bear you out  that would be different .  incidentally  you disposed of that robot quickly .  why .        there was no reason to keep it .  it was completely disorganized .  it was useless .        why .     leebig shook his finger at baley and said violently     you asked me that once before  earthman  and i told you why .  it had witnessed a murder which it had been powerless to stop .        and you told me that that always brought about complete collapse  that that was a universal rule .  yet when gruer was poisoned  the robot that had presented him with the poisoned drink was harmed only to the extent of a limp and a lisp .  it had actually itself been the agent of what looked like murder at the moment  and not merely a witness  and yet it retained enough sanity to be questioned .     this robot  the robot in the delmarre case  must therefore have been still more intimately concerned with murder than the gruer robot .  this delmarre robot must have had its own arm used as the murder weapon .        all nonsense     gasped out leebig .     you know nothing about robotics .     baley said     that   s as may be .  but i will suggest that security head attlebish impound the records of your robot factory and maintenance shop .  perhaps we can find out whether you have built robots with detachable limbs and  if so  whether any were sent to dr .  delmarre  and  if so  when .        no one will tamper with my records     cried leebig .     why .  if you have nothing to hide  why .        but why on solaria should i want to kill delmarre .  tell me that .  what   s my motive .        i can think of two     said baley .     you were friendly with mrs .  delmarre .  overly friendly .  solarians are human  after a fashion .  you never consorted with women  but that didn   t keep you immune from  shall we say  animal urges .  you saw mrs .  delmarre  i beg your pardon  you viewed her  when she was dressed rather informally and         no     cried leebig in agony .  and gladia whispered energetically     no .        perhaps you didn   t recognize the nature of your feelings yourself     said baley     or if you had a dim notion of it  you despised yourself for your weakness  and hated mrs .  delmarre for inspiring it .  and yet you might have hated delmarre  too  for having her .  you did ask mrs .  delmarre to be your assistant .  you compromised with your libido that far .  she refused and your hatred was the keener for that .  by killing dr .  delmarre in such a way as to throw suspicion on mrs .  delmarre  you could be avenged on both at once .        who would believe that cheap  melodramatic filth .     demanded leebig in a hoarse whisper .     another earthman  another animal  maybe .  no solarian .        i don   t depend on that motive     said baley .     i think it was there  unconsciously  but you had a plainer motive  too .  dr .  b . ikaine delmarre was in the way of your plans  and had to be removed .        what plans .     demanded leebig .     your plans aiming at the conquest of the galaxy  dr .  leebig     said baley .      a question is answered     the earthman is mad     cried leebig  turning to the others .     isn   t that obvious .     some stared at leebig wordlessly  some at baley .  baley gave them no chance to come to decisions .  he said     you know better  dr .  leebig .  dr .  delmarre was going to break off with you .  mrs .  delmarre thought it was because you wouldn   t marry .  i don   t think so .  dr .  delmarre himself was planning a future in which ectogenesis would be possible and marriage unnecessary .  but dr .  delmarre was working with you  he would know  and guess  more about your work than anyone else .  he would know if you were attempting dangerous experiments and he would try to stop you .  he hinted about such matters to agent gruer  but gave no details  because he was not yet certain of the details .  obviously  you discovered his suspicions and killed him .        mad .     said leebig again .     i will have nothing more to do with this .     but attlebish interrupted .     hear him out  leebig .     baley bit his lip to keep from a premature display of satisfaction at the obvious lack of sympathy in the security head   s voice .  he said     in the same discussion with me in which you mentioned robots with detachable limbs  dr .  leebig  you mentioned spaceships with built in positronic brains .  you were definitely talking too much then .  was it that you thought i was only an earthman and incapable of understanding the implications of robotics .  or was it that you had just been threatened with personal presence  had the threat lifted  and were a little delirious with relief .  in any case  dr .  quemot had already told me that the secret weapon of solaria against the outer worlds was the positronic robot .     quemot  thus unexpectedly referred to  started violently  and cried     i meant         you meant it sociologically  i know .  but it gives rise to thoughts .  consider a spaceship with a built in positronic brain as compared to a manned spaceship .  a manned spaceship could not use robots in active warfare .  a robot could not destroy humans on enemy spaceships or on enemy worlds .  it could not grasp the distinction between friendly humans and enemy humans .     of course  a robot could be told that the opposing spaceship had no humans aboard .  it could be told that it was an uninhabited planet that was being bombarded .  that would be difficult to manage .  a robot could see that its own ship carried humans  it would know its own world held humans .  it would assume that the same was true of enemy ships and worlds .  it would take a real expert in robotics  such as you  dr .  leebig  to handle them properly in that case  and there are very few suck experts .     but a spaceship that was equipped with its own positronic brain would cheerfully attack any ship it was directed to attack  it seems to me .  it would naturally assume all other ships were unmanned .  a positronic brained ship could easily be made incapable of receiving messages from enemy ships that might undeceive it .  with its weapons and defenses under the immediate control of a positronic brain  it would be more maneuverable than any manned ship .  with no room necessary for crewmen  for supplies  for water or air purifiers  it could carry more armor  more weapons and be more invulnerable than any ordinary ship .  one ship with a positronic brain could defeat fleets of ordinary ships .  am i wrong .     the last question was shot at dr .  leebig  who had risen from his seat and was standing  rigid  almost cataleptic with  what .  anger .  horror .  there was no answer .  no answer could have been heard .  something tore loose and the others were yelling madly .  klorissa had the face of a fury and even gladia was on her feet  her small fist beating the air threateningly .  and all had turned on leebig .  baley relaxed and closed his eyes .  he tried for just a few moments to unknot his muscles  unfreeze his tendons .  it had worked .  he had pressed the right button at last .  quemot had made an analogy between the solarian robots and the spartan helots .  he said the robots could not revolt so that the solarians could relax .  but what if some human threatened to teach the robots how to harm humans  to make them  in other words  capable of revolting .  would that not be the ultimate crime .  on a world such as solaria would not every last inhabitant turn fiercely against anyone even suspected of making a robot capable of harming a human  on solaria  where robots outnumbered humans by twenty thousand to one .  attlebish cried     you are under arrest .  you are absolutely forbidden to touch your books or records until the government has a chance to inspect them      he went on  almost incoherent  scarcely heard in the pandemonium .  a robot approached baley .     a message  master  from the master olivaw .     baley took the message gravely  turned  and cried     one moment .     his voice had an almost magical effect .  all turned to look at him solemnly and in no face  outside leebig   s frozen glare  was there any sign of anything but the most painful attention to the earthman .  baley said     it is foolish to expect dr .  leebig to leave his records untouched while waiting for some official to reach them .  so even before this interview began  my partner  daneel olivaw  left for dr .  leebig   s estate .  i have just heard from him .  he is on the grounds now and will be with dr .  leebig in a moment in order that he may be put under restraint .        restraint .     howled leebig in an almost animal terror  his eyes widened into staring holes in his head .     someone coming here .  personal presence .  no .  no .     the second    no    was a shriek .     you will not be harmed     said baley coldly     if you co operate .        but i won   t see him .  i can   t see him .     the roboticist fell to his knees without seeming aware of the motion .  he put his hands together in a desperate clasped gesture of appeal .     what do you want .  do you want a confession .  delmarre   s robot had detachable limbs .  yes .  yes .  yes .  i arranged gruer   s poisoning .  i arranged the arrow meant for you .  i even planned the spaceships as you said .  i haven   t succeeded  but  yes  i planned it .  only keep the man away .  don   t let him come .  keep him away .     he was babbling .  baley nodded .  another right button .  the threat of personal presence would do more to induce confession than any physical torture .  but then  at some noise or movement outside the field of sound or vision of any of the others  leebig   s head twisted and his mouth opened .  he lifted a pair of hands  holding something off .     away     he begged .     go away .  don   t come .  please don   t come .  please      he scrambled away on hands and knees  then his hand went suddenly to a pocket in his jacket .  it came out with something and moved rapidly to his mouth .  swaying twice  he fell prone .  baley wanted to cry  you fool  it isn   t a human that   s approaching  only one of the robots you love .  daneel olivaw darted into the field of vision and for a moment stared down at the crumpled figure .  baley held his breath .  if daneel should realize it was his own pseudo humanity that had killed leebig  the effect on his first law enslaved brain might be drastic .  but daneel only knelt and his delicate fingers touched leebig here and there .  then he lifted leebig   s head as though it were infinitely precious to him  cradling it  caressing it .  his beautifully chiseled face stared out at the others and he whispered     a human is dead .      baley was expecting her  she had asked for a last interview  but his eyes widened when she appeared .  he said     i   m seeing you .        yes     said gladia     how can you tell .        you   re wearing gloves .        oh .     she looked at her hands in confusion .  then  softly     do you mind .        no  of course not .  but why have you decided to see  rather than view .        well     she smiled weakly     i   ve got to get used to it  don   t i  elijah .  i mean  if i   m going to aurora .        then it   s all arranged .        mr .  olivaw seems to have influence .  it   s all arranged .  i   ll never come back .        good .  you   ll be happier  gladia .  i know you will .        i   m a little afraid .        i know .  it will mean seeing all the time and  you won   t have all the comforts you had on solaria .  but you   ll get used to it and  what   s more  you   ll forget all the terror you   ve been through .        i don   t want to forget everything     said gladia softly .     you will .     baley looked at the slim girl who stood before him and said  not without a momentary pang     and you will be married someday  too .  really married  i mean .        somehow     she said mournfully     that doesn   t seem so attractive to me right now .        you   ll change your mind .     and they stood there  looking at each other for a wordless moment .  gladia said     i   ve never thanked you .     baley said     it was only my job .        you   ll be going back to earth now  won   t you .        yes .        i   ll never see you again .        probably not .  but don   t feel badly about that .  in forty years at most  i   ll be dead and you won   t look a bit different from the way you do now .     her face twisted .     don   t say that .        it   s true .     she said rapidly  as though forced to change the subject     it   s all true about jothan leebig  you know .        i know .  other roboticists went over his records and found experiments toward unmanned intelligent spaceships .  they also found other robots with replaceable limbs .     gladia shuddered     why did he do such a horrible thing  do you suppose .        he was afraid of people .  he killed himself to avoid personal presence and he was ready to kill other worlds to make sure that solaria and its personal presence taboo would never be touched .        how could he feel so     she murmured     when personal presence can be so very      again a silent moment while they faced each other at ten paces .  then gladia cried suddenly     oh  elijah  you   ll think it abandoned of me .        think what abandoned .        may i touch you .  i   ll never see you again  elijah .        if you want to .     step by step  she came closer  her eyes glowing  yet looking apprehensive  too .  she stopped three feet away  then slowly  as though in a trance  she began to remove the glove on her right hand .  baley started a restraining gesture .     don   t be foolish  gladia .        i   m not afraid     said gladia .  her hand was bare .  it trembled as she extended it .  and so did baley   s as he took her hand in his .  they remained so for one moment  her hand a shy thing  frightened as it rested in his .  he opened his hand and hers escaped  darted suddenly and without warning toward his face until her fingertips rested feather light upon his cheek for the barest moment .  she said     thank you  elijah .  good by .     he said     good by  gladia     and watched her leave .  even the thought that a ship was waiting to take him back to earth did not wipe out the sense of loss he felt at that moment .   undersecretary albert minnim   s look was intended to be one of prim welcome .     i am glad to see you back on earth .  your report  of course  arrived before you did and is being studied .  you did a good job .  the matter will look well in your record .        thank you     said baley .  there was no room for further elation in him .  being back on earth  being safe in the caves  being in hearing of jessie   s voice  he had spoken to her already  had left him strangely empty .     however     said minnim     your report concerned only the murder investigation .  there was another matter we were interested in .  may i have a report on that  verbally .     baley hesitated and his hand moved automatically toward the inner pocket where the warm comfort of his pipe could once more be found .  minnim said at once     you may smoke  baley .     baley made of the lighting process a rather drawn out ritual .  he said     i am not a sociologist .        aren   t you .     minnim smiled briefly .     it seems to me we discussed that once .  a successful detective must be a good rule of thumb sociologist even if he never heard of hackett   s equation .  i think  from your discomfort at the moment  that you have notions concerning the outer worlds but aren   t sure how it will sound to me .        if you put it that way  sir .   .   .  when you ordered me to solaria  you asked a question  you asked what the weaknesses of the outer worlds were .  their strengths were their robots  their low population  their long lives  but what were their weaknesses .        well .        i believe i know the weaknesses of the solarians  sir .        you can answer my question .  good .  go ahead .        their weaknesses  sir  are their robots  their low population  their long lives .     minnim stared at baley without any change of expression .  his hands worked in jerky finger drawn designs along the papers on his desk .  he said     why do you say that .     baley had spent hours organizing his thoughts on the way back from solaria  had confronted officialdom  in imagination  with balanced  well reasoned arguments .  now he felt at a loss .  he said     i   m not sure i can put them clearly .        no matter .  let me hear .  this is first approximation only .     baley said     the solarians have given up something mankind has had for a million years  something worth more than atomic power  cities  agriculture  tools  fire  everything  because it   s something that made everything else possible .        i don   t want to guess  baley .  what is it .        the tribe  sir .  cooperation between individuals .  solaria has given it    up entirely .  it is a world of isolated individuals and the planet   s only sociologist is delighted that this is so .  that sociologist  by the way  never heard of sociomathematics  because he is inventing his own science .  there is no one to teach him  no one to help him  no one to think of something he himself might miss .  the only science that really flourishes on solaria is robotics and there are only a handful of men involved in that  and when it came to an analysis of the interaction of robots and men  they had to call in an earthman to help .     solarian art  sir  is abstract .  we have abstract art on earth as one form of art  but on solaria it is the only form .  the human touch is gone .  the looked for future is one of ectogenesis and complete isolation from birth .     minnim said     it all sounds horrible .  but is it harmful .        i think so .  without the interplay of human against human  the chief interest in life is gone  most of the intellectual values are gone  most of the reason for living is gone .  viewing is no substitute for seeing .  the solarians  themselves  are conscious that viewing is a long distance sense .     and if isolation isn   t enough to induce stagnation  there is the matter of their long lives .  on earth  we have a continuous influx of young people who are willing to change because they haven   t had time to grow hard set in their ways .  i suppose there   s some optimum .  a life long enough for real accomplishment and short enough to make way for youth at a rate that   s not too slow .  on solaria  the rate is too slow .     minnim still drew patterns with his finger .     interesting .  interesting .     he looked up  and it was as though a mask had fallen away .  there was glee in his eyes .     plainclothesman  you   re a man of penetration .        thank you     said baley stiffly .     do you know why i encouraged you to describe your views to me .     he was almost like a little boy  hugging his pleasure .  he went on without waiting for an answer .     your report has already undergone preliminary analysis by our sociologists and i was wondering if you had any idea yourself as to the excellent news for earth you had brought with you .  i see you have .        but wait     said baley .     there   s more to this .        there is  indeed     agreed minnim jubilantly .     solaria cannot possibly correct its stagnation .  it has passed a critical point and their dependence on robots has gone too far .  individual robots can   t discipline an individual child  even though discipline may do the child eventual good .  the robot can   t see past the immediate pain .  and robots collectively cannot discipline a planet by allowing its institutions to collapse when the institutions have grown harmful .  they can   t see past the immediate chaos .  so the only end for the outer worlds is perpetual stagnation and earth will be freed of their domination .  this new data changes everything .  physical revolt will not even be necessary .  freedom will come of itself .        wait     said baley again  more loudly .     it   s only solaria we   re discussing  not any other outer world .        it   s the same thing .  your solarian sociologist  kimot         quemot  sir .        quemot  then .  he said  did he not  that the other outer worlds were moving in the direction of solaria .        he did  but he knew nothing about the other outer worlds firsthand  and he was no sociologist .  not really .  i thought i made that clear .        our own men will check .        they   ll lack data too .  we know nothing about the really big outer worlds .  aurora  for instance  daneel   s world .  to me  it doesn   t seem reasonable to expect them to be anything like solaria .  in fact  there   s only one world in the galaxy which resembles solaria      minnim was dismissing the subject with a small  happy wave of his neat hand .     our men will check .  i   m sure they will agree with quemot .     baley   s stare grew somber .  if earth   s sociologists were anxious enough for happy news  they would find themselves agreeing with quemot  at that .  anything could be found in figures if the search were long enough and hard enough and if the proper pieces of information were ignored or overlooked .  he hesitated .  was it best now to speak while he had the ear of a man high in the government or   he hesitated a trifle too long .  minnim was speaking again  shuffling a few papers and growing more matter of fact .     a few minor matters  plainclothesman  concerning the delmarre case itself and then you will be free to go .  did you intend to have leebig commit suicide .        i intended to force a confession  sir .  i had not anticipated suicide at the approach  ironically  of someone who was only a robot and who would not really be violating the taboo against personal presence .  but  frankly  i don   t regret his death .  he was a dangerous man .  it will be a long time before there will be another man who will combine his sickness and his brilliance .        i agree with that     said minnim dryly     and consider his death fortunate  but didn   t you consider your danger if the solarians had stopped to realize that leebig couldn   t possibly have murdered delmarre .     baley took his pipe out of his mouth and said nothing .     come  plainclothesman     said minnim .     you know he didn   t .  the murder required personal presence and leebig would die rather than allow that .  he did die rather than allow it .     baley said     you   re right  sir .  i counted on the solarians being too horrified at his misuse of robots to stop to think of that .        then who did kill delmarre .     baley said slowly     if you mean who struck the actual blow  it was the person everyone knew had done so .  gladia delmarre  the man   s wife .        and you let her go .     baley said     morally  the responsibility wasn   t hers .  leebig knew gladia quarreled bitterly with her husband  and often .  he must have known how furious she could grow in moments of anger .  leebig wanted the death of the husband under circumstances that would incriminate the wife .  so he supplied delmarre with a robot and  i imagine  instructed it with all the skill he possessed to hand gladia one of its detachable limbs at the moment of her full fury .  with a weapon in her hand at the crucial moment  she acted in a temporary black out before either delmarre or the robot could stop her .  gladia was as much leebig   s unwitting instrument as the robot itself .     minnim said     the robot   s arm must have been smeared with blood and matted hair .        it probably was     said baley     but it was leebig who took the murder robot in charge .  he could easily have instructed any other robots who might have noticed the fact to forget it .  dr .  thool might have noticed it  but he inspected only the dead man and the unconscious woman .  leebig   s mistake was to think that guilt would rest so obviously on gladia that the matter of the absence of an obvious weapon at the scene wouldn   t save her .  nor could he anticipate that an earthman would be called in to help with the investigation .        so with leebig dead  you arranged to have gladia leave solaria .  was that to save her in case any solarians began thinking about the case .     baley shrugged .     she had suffered enough .  she had been victimized by everyone  by her husband  by leebig  by the world of solaria .     minnim said     weren   t you bending the law to suit a personal whim .     baley   s craggy face grew hard .     it was not a whim .  i was not bound by solarian law .  earth   s interests were paramount  and for the sake of those interests  i had to see that leebig  the dangerous one  was dealt with .  as for mrs .  delmarre .     he faced minnim now  and felt himself taking a crucial step .  he had to say this .     as for mrs .  delmarre  i made her the basis of an experiment .        what experiment .        i wanted to know if she would consent to face a world where personal presence was permitted and expected .  i was curious to know if she had the courage to face disruption of habits so deeply settled in her .  i was afraid she might refuse to go  that she might insist on remaining on solaria  which was purgatory to her  rather than bring herself to abandon her distorted solarian way of life .  but she chose change and i was glad she did  because to me it seemed symbolic .  it seemed to open the gates of salvation for us .        for us .     said minnim with energy .     what the devil do you mean .        not for you and me  particularly  sir     said baley gravely     but for all mankind .  you   re wrong about the other outer worlds .  they have few robots  they permit personal presence  and they have been investigating solaria .  r .  daneel olivaw was there with me  you know  and he   ll bring back a report .  there is a danger they may become solarians someday  but they will probably recognize that danger and work to keep themselves in a reasonable balance and in that way remain the leaders of mankind .        that is your opinion     said minnim testily .     and there   s more to it .  there is one world like solaria and that   s earth .        plainclothesman baley .        it   s so  sir .  we   re solaria inside out .  they retreated into isolation from one another .  we retreated into isolation from the galaxy .  they are at the dead end of their inviolable estates .  we are at the dead end of underground cities .  they   re leaders without followers  only robots who can   t talk back .  we   re followers without leaders  only enclosing cities to keep us safe .     baley   s fists clenched .  minnim disapproved .     plainclothesman  you have been through an ordeal .  you need a rest and you will have one .  a month   s vacation  full pay  and a promotion at the end of it .        thank you  but that   s not all i want .  i want you to listen .  there   s only one direction out of our dead end and that   s outward  toward space .  there are a million worlds out there and the spacers own only fifty .  they are few and long lived .  we are many and short lived .  we  are better suited than they for exploration and colonization .  we have population pressure to push us and a rapid turnover of generation to keep us supplied with the young and restless .  it was our ancestors who colonized the outer worlds in the first place .        yes  i see  but i   m afraid our time is up .     baley could feel the other   s anxiety to be rid of him and he remained stolidly in place .  he said     when the original colonization established worlds superior to our own in technology  we escaped by building wombs beneath the ground for ourselves .  the spacers made us feel inferior and we hid from them .  that   s no answer .  to avoid the destructive rhythm of rebellion and suppression  we must compete with them  follow them  if we must  lead them  if we can .  to do that  we must face the open  we must teach ourselves to face the open .  if it is too late to teach ourselves  then we must teach our children .  it   s vital .        you need a rest  plainclothesman .     baley said violently     listen to me  sir .  if the spacers are strong and we remain as we are  then earth will be destroyed within a century .  that has been computed  as you yourself told me .  if the spacers are really weak and are growing weaker  then we may escape  but who says the spacers are weak .  the solarians  yes  but that   s all we know .        but         i   m not through .  one thing we can change  whether the spacers are weak or strong .  we can change the way we are .  let us face the open and we   ll never need rebellion .  we can spread out into our own crowd of worlds and become spacers ourselves .  if we stay here on earth  cooped up  then useless and fatal rebellion can   t be stopped .  it will be all the worse if the people build any false hopes because of supposed spacer weakness .  go ahead  ask the sociologists .  put my argument to them .  and if they   re still in doubt  find a way to send me to aurora .  let me bring back a report on the real spacers  and you   ll see what earth must do .     minnim nodded .     yes  yes .  good day  now  plainclothesman baley .     baley left with a feeling of exaltation .  he had not expected an open victory over minnim .  victories over ingrained patterns of thought are not won in a day or a year .  but he had seen the look of pensive uncertainty that had crossed minnim   s lace and had blotted out  at least for a while  the earlier uncritical joy .  he felt he could see into the future .  mannikin would ask the sociologists and one or two of them would be uncertain .  they would wonder .  they would consult baley .  give it one year  thought baley  one year  and i   ll be on my way to aurora .  one generation  and we   ll be out in space once more .   baley stepped onto the northbound expressway .  soon he would see jessie .  would she understand .  and his son  bentley  now seventeen .  when ben had a seventeen year old of his own  would he be standing on some empty world  building a spacious life .  it was a frightening thought .  baley still feared the open .  but he no longer feared the fear .  it was not something to run from  that fear  but something to fight .  baley felt as though a touch of madness had come over him .  from the very first the open had had its weird attraction over him  from the time in the ground car when he had tricked daneel in order to have the top lowered so that he might stand up in the open air .  he had failed to understand then .  daneel thought he was being perverse .  baley himself thought he was facing the open out of professional necessity  to solve a crime .  only on that last evening on solaria  with the curtain tearing away from the window  did he realize his need to face the open for the open   s own sake  for its attraction and its promise of freedom .  there must be millions on earth who would feel that same urge  if the open were only brought to their attention  if they could be made to take the first step .  he looked about .  the expressway was speeding on .  all about him was artificial light and huge banks of apartments gliding backward and flashing signs and store windows and factories and lights and noise and crowds and more noise and people and people and people .   .  it was all he had loved  all he had hated and feared to leave  all he had thought he longed for on solaria .  and it was all strange to him .  he couldn   t make himself fit back in .  he had gone out to solve a murder and something had happened to him .  he had told minnim the cities were wombs  and so they were .  and what was the first thing a man must do before he can be a man .  he must be born .  he must leave the womb .  and once left  it could not be re entered .  baley had left the city and could not re enter .  the city was no longer his  the caves of steel were alien .  this had to be .  and it would be so for others and earth would be born again and reach outward .  his heart beat madly and the noise of life about him sank to an unheard murmur .  he remembered his dream on solaria and he understood it at last .  he lifted his head and he could see through all the steel and concrete and humanity above him .  he could see the beacon set in space to lure men outward .  he could see it shining down .  the naked sun .
