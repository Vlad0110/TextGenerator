    begin reading     through the shredded black clouds a fire moved like a dying star  falling back to earth        the earth  that is  of the discworld        but unlike any star had ever done before  it sometimes managed to steer its fall  sometimes rising  sometimes twisting  but inevitably heading down .   snow glowed briefly on the mountain slopes when it crackled overhead .   under it  the land itself started to fall away .  the fire was reflected off walls of blue ice as the light dropped into the beginnings of a canyon and thundered now through its twists and turns .   the light snapped off .  something still glided down the moonlit ribbon between the rocks .   it shot out of the canyon at the top of a cliff  where meltwater from a glacier plunged down into a distant pool .   against all reason there was a valley here  or a network of valleys  clinging to the edge of the mountains before the long fall to the plains .  a small lake gleamed in the warmer air .  there were forests .  there were tiny fields  like a patchwork quilt thrown across the rocks .   the wind had died .  the air was warmer .   the shadow began to circle .   far below  unheeded and unheeding  something else was entering this little handful of valleys .  it was hard to see exactly what it was  furze rippled  heather rustled  as if a very large army made of very small creatures was moving with one purpose .   the shadow reached a flat rock that offered a magnificent view of the fields and wood below  and there the army came out from among the roots .  it was made up of very small blue men  some wearing pointy blue caps but most of them with their red hair uncovered .  they carried swords .  none of them was more than six inches high .   they lined up and looked down into the new place and then  weapons waving  raised a battle cry .  it would have been more impressive if they   d all agreed on one before  but as it was it sounded as though every single small warrior had a battle cry of his very own and would fight anyone who tried to take it away from him .      nac mac feegle .         ach  stickit yer trakkans .         gie you sich a kickin    .         bigjobs .         dere c   n onlie be whin t   ousand .         nac mac feegle wha hae .         wha hae yersel  ya boggin .          the little cup of valleys  glowing in the last shreds of evening sunlight  was the kingdom of lancre .  from its highest points  people said  you could see all the way to the rim of the world .   it was also said  although not by the people who lived in lancre  that below the rim  where the seas thundered continuously over the edge  their home went through space on the back of four huge elephants that in turn stood on the shell of a turtle that was as big as the world .   the people of lancre had heard of this .  they thought it sounded about right .  the world was obviously flat  although in lancre itself the only truly flat places were tables and the top of some people   s heads  and certainly turtles could shift a fair load .  elephants  by all accounts  were pretty strong too .  there didn   t seem any major gaps in the thesis  so lancrastrians left it at that .   it wasn   t that they didn   t take an interest in the world around them .  on the contrary  they had a deep  personal and passionate involvement in it  but instead of asking    why are we here .     they asked    is it going to rain before the harvest .      a philosopher might have deplored this lack of mental ambition  but only if he was really certain about where his next meal was coming from .   in fact lancre   s position and climate bred a hardheaded and straightforward people who often excelled in the world down below .  it had supplied the plains with many of their greatest wizards and witches and  once again  the philosopher might have marveled that such a four square people could give the world so many successful magical practitioners  being quite unaware that only those with their feet on rock can build castles in the air .   and so the sons and daughters of lancre went off into the world  carved out careers  climbed the various ladders of achievement  and always remembered to send money home .   apart from noting the return addresses on the envelope  those who stayed didn   t think much about the world outside .   the world outside thought about them  though .   the big flat topped rock was deserted now  but on the moor below  the heather trembled in a v shape heading toward the lowlands .      gin   s a haddie .         nac mac feegle .          there are many kinds of vampires .  indeed  it is said that there are as many kinds of vampires as there are types of disease .   and they   re not just human  if vampires are human  .  all along the ramtops may be found the belief that any apparently innocent tool  be it hammer or saw  will seek blood if left unused for more than three years .  in ghat they believe in vampire watermelons  although folklore is silent about what they believe about vampire watermelons .  possibly they suck back .   two things have traditionally puzzled vampire researchers .  one is  why do vampires have so much power .  vampires   re so easy to kill  they point out .  there are dozens of ways to dispatch them  quite apart from the stake through the heart  which also works on normal people so if you have any stakes left over you don   t have to waste them .  classically  they spent the day in some coffin somewhere  with no guard other than an elderly hunchback who doesn   t look all that spry and should succumb to quite a small mob .  yet just one can keep a whole community in a state of sullen obedience     the other puzzle is  why are vampires always so stupid .  as if wearing evening dress all day wasn   t an undead giveaway  why do they choose to live in old castles which offer so much in the way of ways to defeat a vampire  like easily torn curtains and wall decorations that can readily be twisted into a religious symbol .  do they really think that spelling their name backward fools anyone .   a coach rattled across the moorlands  many miles away from lancre .  from the way it bounced over the ruts  it was traveling light .  but darkness came with it .   the horses were black  and so was the coach  except for the coat of arms on the doors .  each horse had a black plume between its ears  there was a black plume at each corner of the coach as well .  perhaps these caused the coach   s strange effect of traveling shadow .  it seemed to be dragging the night behind it .   on the top of the moor  where a few trees grew out of the rubble of a ruined building  it creaked to a halt .   the horses stood still  occasionally stamping a hoof or tossing their heads .  the coachman sat hunched over the reins  waiting .   four figures flew just above the clouds  in the silvery moonlight .  by the sound of their conversation someone was annoyed  although the sharp unpleasant tone to the voice suggested that a better word might be    vexed .         you let it get away .     this voice had a whine to it  the voice of a chronic complainer .      it was wounded  lacci .     this voice sounded conciliatory  parental  but with just a hint of a repressed desire to give the first voice a thick ear .      i really hate those things .  they   re so   soppy .         yes  dear .  a symbol of a credulous past .         if i could burn like that i wouldn   t skulk around just looking pretty .  why do they do it .         it must have been of use to them at one time  i suppose .         then they   re   what did you call them .         an evolutionary cul de sac  lacci .  a marooned survivor on the seas of progress .         then i   m doing them a favor by killing them .         yes  that is a point .  now  shall           after all  chickens don   t burn     said the voice called lacci .     not easily  anyway .         we heard you experiment .  killing them first might have been a good idea .     this was a third voice   young  male  and also somewhat weary with the female .  it had    older brother    harmonics on every syllable .      what   s the point in that .         well  dear  it would have been quieter .         listen to your father  dear .     and this  the fourth voice  could only be a mother   s voice .  it   d love the other voices whatever they did .      you   re so unfair .         we did let you drop rocks on the pixies  dear .  life can   t be all fun .      the coachman stirred as the voices descended through the clouds .  and then four figures were standing a little way off .  the coachman clambered down and  with difficulty  opened the coach door as they approached .      most of the wretched things got away  though     said mother .      never mind  my dear     said father .      i really hate them .  are they a dead end too .     said daughter .      not quite dead enough as yet  despite your valiant efforts .  igor .  on to lancre .      the coachman turned .      yeth  marthter .         oh  for the last time  man   is that any way to talk .         it   th the only way i know  marthter     said igor .      and i told you to take the plumes off the coach  you idiot .      the coachman shifted uneasily .      gotta hath black plumeth  marthter .  it   th tradithional .         remove them at once     mother commanded .     what will people think .         yeth  mithtreth .      the one addressed as igor slammed the door and lurched back around to the horse .  he removed the plumes reverentially and placed them under his seat .   inside the coach the vexed voice said     is igor an evolutionary dead end too  father .         we can but hope  dear .         thod     said igor to himself  as he picked up the reins .       the wording began   you are cordially invited        and was in that posh runny writing that was hard to read but ever so official .   nanny ogg grinned and tucked the card back on the mantelpiece .  she liked the idea of    cordially .     it had a rich  a thick and above all an alcoholic sound .   she was ironing her best petticoat .  that is to say  she was sitting in her chair by the fire while one of her daughters in law  whose name she couldn   t remember just at this moment  was doing the actual work .  nanny was helping by pointing out the bits she   d missed .   it was a damn good invite  she thought .  especially the gold edging  which was as thick as syrup .  probably not real gold  but impressively glittery all the same .      there   s a bit there that could do with goin    over again  gel     she said  topping up her beer .      yes  nanny .      another daughter in law  whose name she   d certainly be able to recall after a few seconds    thought  was buffing up nanny   s red boots .  a third was very carefully dabbing the lint off nanny   s best pointed hat  on its stand .   nanny got up again and wandered over and opened the back door .  there was little light left in the sky now  and a few rags of cloud were scudding over the early stars .  she sniffed the air .  winter hung on late up here in the mountains  but there was definitely a taste of spring on the wind .   a good time  she thought .  best time  really .  oh  she knew that the year started on hogswatchnight  when the cold tide turned  but the new year started now  with green shoots boring upward through the last of the snow .  change was in the air  she could feel it in her bones .   of course  her friend granny weatherwax always said you couldn   t trust bones  but granny weatherwax said a lot of things like that all the time .   nanny ogg closed the door .  in the trees at the end of her garden  leafless and scratchy against the sky  something rustled its wings and chattered as a veil of dark crossed the world .       in her own cottage a few miles away the witch agnes nitt was in two minds about her new pointy hat .  agnes was generally in two minds about anything .   as she tucked in her hair and observed herself critically in the mirror she sang a song .  she sang in harmony .  not  of course  with her reflection in the glass  because that kind of heroine will sooner or later end up singing a duet with mr .  bluebird and other forest creatures and then there   s nothing for it but a flamethrower .   she simply sang in harmony with herself .  unless she concentrated it was happening more and more these days .  perdita had rather a reedy voice  but she insisted on joining in .   those who are inclined to casual cruelty say that inside a fat girl is a thin girl and a lot of chocolate .  agnes   s thin girl was perdita .   she wasn   t sure how she   d acquired the invisible passenger .  her mother had told her that when she was small she   d been in the habit of blaming accidents and mysteries  such as the disappearance of a bowl of cream or the breaking of a prized jug  on    the other little girl .      only now did she realize that indulging this sort of thing wasn   t a good idea when  despite yourself  you   ve got a bit of natural witchcraft in your blood .  the imaginary friend had simply grown up and had never gone away and had turned out to be a pain .   agnes disliked perdita  who was vain  selfish and vicious  and perdita hated going around inside agnes  whom she regarded as a fat  pathetic  weak willed blob that people would walk all over were she not so steep .   agnes told herself she   d simply invented the name perdita as some convenient label for all those thoughts and desires she knew she shouldn   t have  as a name for that troublesome little commentator that lives on everyone   s shoulder and sneers .  but sometimes she thought perdita had created agnes for something to pummel .   agnes tended to obey rules .  perdita didn   t .  perdita thought that not obeying rules was somehow cool .  agnes though that rules like    don   t fall into this huge pit of spikes    were there for a purpose .  perdita thought  to take an example at random  that things like table manners were a stupid and repressive idea .  agnes  on the other hand  was against being hit by flying bits of other people   s cabbage .   perdita thought a witch   s hat was a powerful symbol of authority .  agnes thought that a dumpy girl should not wear a tall hat  especially with black .  it made her look as though someone had dropped a licorice flavored ice cream cone .   the trouble was that although agnes was right  so was perdita .  the pointy hat carried a lot of weight in the ramtops .  people talked to the hat  not to the person wearing it .  when people were in serious trouble they went to a witch .    you had to wear black  too .  perdita liked black .  perdita thought black was cool .  agnes thought that black wasn   t a good color for the circumferentially challenged   oh  and that    cool    was a dumb word only used by people whose brains wouldn   t fill a spoon .   magrat garlick hadn   t worn black and had probably never in her life said    cool    except when commenting on the temperature .   agnes stopped examining her pointiness in the mirror and looked around the cottage that had been magrat   s and was now hers  and sighed .  her gaze took in the expensive  gold edged card on the mantelpiece .   well  magrat had certainly retired now  and had gone off to be queen and if there was ever any doubt about that then there could be no doubt today .  agnes was puzzled at the way nanny ogg and granny weatherwax still talked about her  though .  they were proud  more or less  that she   d married the king  and agreed that it was the right kind of life for her  but while they never actually articulated the thought it hung in the air over their heads in flashing mental colors  magrat had settled for second prize .   agnes had almost burst out laughing when she first realized this  but you wouldn   t be able to argue with them .  they wouldn   t even see that there could be an argument .   granny weatherwax lived in a cottage with a thatch so old there was quite a sprightly young tree growing in it  and got up and went to bed alone  and washed in the rain barrel .  and nanny ogg was the most local person agnes had ever met .  she   d gone off to foreign parts  yes  but she always carried lancre with her  like a sort of invisible hat .  but they took it for granted that they were top of every tree  and the rest of the world was there for them to tinker with .   perdita thought that being a queen was just about the best thing you could be .   agnes though the best thing you could be was far away from lancre  and good second best would be to be alone in your own head .   she adjusted the hat as best she could and left the cottage .   witches never locked their doors .  they never needed to .   as she stepped out into the moonlight  two magpies landed on the thatch .       the current activities of the witch granny weatherwax would have puzzled a hidden observer .   she peered at the flagstones just inside her back door and lifted the old rag rug in front of it with her toe .   then she walked to the front door  which was never used  and did the same thing there .  she also examined the cracks around the edges of the doors .   she went outside .  there had been a sharp frost during the night  a spiteful little trick by the dying winter  and the drifts of leaves that still hung on in the shadows were crisp .  in the harsh air she poked around in the flowerpots and bushes by the front door .   then she went back inside .   she had a clock .  lancrastrians liked clocks  although they didn   t bother much about actual time in any length much shorter than an hour .  if you needed to boil an egg  you sang fifteen verses of    where has all the custard gone .     under your breath .  but the tick was a comfort on long evenings .   finally she sat down in her rocking chair and glared at the doorway .   owls were hooting in the forest when someone came running up the path and hammered on the door .   anyone who hadn   t heard about granny   s iron self control  which you could bend a horseshoe round  might just have thought they heard her give a tiny sigh of relief .      well  it   s about time       she began .       the excitement up at the castle was just a distant hum down here in the mews .  the hawks and falcons sat hunched on their perches  lost in some inner world of stoop and updraft .  there was the occasional clink of a chain or flutter of a wing .   hodgesaargh the falconer was getting ready in the tiny room next door when he felt the change in the air .  he stepped out into a silent mews .  the birds were all awake  alert  expectant .  even king henry the eagle  who hodgesaargh would only go near at the moment when he was wearing full plate armor  was peering around .   you got something like this when there was a rat in the place  but hodgesaargh couldn   t see one .  perhaps it had gone .   for tonight   s event he   d selected william the buzzard  who could be depended upon .  all hodgesaargh   s birds could be depended upon  but more often than not they could be depended upon to viciously attack him on sight .  william  however  thought that she was a chicken  and she was usually safe in company .   but even william was paying a lot of attention to the world  which didn   t often happen unless she   d seen some corn .   odd  thought hodgesaargh .  and that was all .   the birds went on staring up  as though the roof simply was not there .       granny weatherwax lowered her gaze to a red  round and worried face .      here  you   re not       she pulled herself together .     you   re the wattley boy from over in slice  aren   t you .         y   g   t       the boy leaned against the doorjamb and fought for breath .     you g   t           just take deep breaths .  you want a drink of water .         you g   t t              yes  yes  all right .  just breathe        the boy gulped air a few times .      you got to come to mrs .  ivy and her baby missus .      the words came out in one quick stream .   granny grabbed her hat from its peg by the door and pulled her broomstick out of its lodging in the thatch .      i thought old mrs .  patternoster was seeing to her     she said  ramming her hatpins into place with the urgency of a warrior preparing for sudden battle .      she says it   s all gone wrong  miss .      granny was already running down her garden path .   there was a small drop on the other side of the clearing  with a twenty foot fall to a bend in the track .  the broom hadn   t fired by the time she reached it but she ran on  swinging a leg over the bristles as it plunged .   the magic caught halfway down and her boots dragged across the dead bracken as the broom soared up into the night .       the road wound over the mountains like a dropped ribbon .  up here there was always the sound of the wind .   the highwayman   s horse was a big black stallion .  it was also quite possibly the only horse with a ladder strapped behind the saddle .   this was because the highwayman   s name was casanunda  and he was a dwarf .  most people thought of dwarfs as reserved  cautious  law abiding and very reticent on matters of the heart and other vaguely connected organs  and this was indeed true of almost all dwarfs .  but genetics rolls strange dice on the green baize of life and somehow the dwarfs had produced casanunda  who preferred fun to money and devoted to women all the passion that other dwarfs reserved for gold .   he also regarded laws as useful things and he obeyed them when it was convenient .  casanunda despised highwaymanning  but it got you out in the fresh air of the countryside which was very good for you  especially when the nearby towns were lousy with husbands carrying a grudge and a big stick .   the trouble was that no one on the road took him seriously .  he could stop the coaches all right  but people tended to say     what .  i say  it   s a lowwayman .  what   s up .  a bit short  are you .  hur  hur  hur     and he would be forced to shoot them in the knee .   he blew on his hands to warm them  and looked up at the sound of an approaching coach .   he was about to ride out of his meager hiding place in the thicket when he saw the other highwayman trot out from the wood opposite .   the coach came to a halt .  casanunda couldn   t hear what transpired  but the highwayman rode around to one of the doors and leaned down to speak to the occupants        and a hand reached out and plucked him off his horse and into the coach .   it rocked on its springs for a while  and then the door burst open and the highwayman tumbled out and lay still on the road .   the coach moved on     casanunda waited a little while and then rode down to the body .  his horse stood patiently while he untied the ladder and dismounted .   he could tell the highwayman was stone dead .  living people are expected to have some blood in them .       the coach stopped at the top of a rise a few miles farther on  before the road began the long winding fall toward lancre and the plains .   the four passengers got out and walked to the start of the drop .   the clouds were rolling in behind them but here the air was frosty clear  and the view stretched all the way to the rim under the moonlight .  down below  scooped out of the mountains  was the little kingdom .      gateway to the world     said the count de magpyr .      and entirely undefended     said his son .      on the contrary .  possessed of some extremely effective de fenses     said the count .  he smiled in the night .     at least   until now           witches should be on our side     said the countess .      she will be soon  at any rate     said the count .     a most   interesting woman .  an interesting family .  uncle used to talk about her grandmother .  the weatherwax women have always had one foot in shadow .  it   s in the blood .  and most of their power comes from denying it .  however     and his teeth shone as he grinned in the dark     she will soon find out on which side her bread is buttered .         or her gingerbread is gilded     said the countess .      ah  yes .  how nicely put .  that   s the penalty for being a weatherwax woman  of course .  when they get older they start to hear the clang of the big oven door .         i   ve heard she   s pretty tough  though     said the count   s son .     a very sharp mind .         let   s kill her .     said the count   s daughter .      really  lacci dear  you can   t kill everything .         i don   t see why not .         no .  i rather like the idea of her being   useful .  and she sees everything in black and white .  that   s always a trap for the powerful .  oh yes .  a mind like that is so easily   led .  with a little help .      there was a whir of wings under the moonlight and something bi colored landed on the count   s shoulder .      and this       said the count  stroking the magpie and then letting it go .  he pulled a square of white card from an inner pocket of his jacket .  its edge gleamed briefly .     can you believe it .  has this sort of thing ever happened before .  a new world order indeed           do you have a handkerchief  sir .     said the countess .     give it to me  please .  you have a few specks        she dabbed at his chin and pushed the bloodstained handkerchief back into his pocket .      there     she said .      there are other witches     said the son  like someone turning over a mouthful that was proving rather tough to chew .      oh yes .  i hope we will meet them .  they could be entertaining .      the coach went on .       back in the mountains  the man who had tried to rob the coach managed to get to his feet  which seemed for a moment to be caught in something .  he rubbed his neck irritably and looked around for his horse  which he found standing behind some rocks a little way away .   when he tried to lay a hand on the bridle it passed straight through the leather and the horse   s neck  like smoke .  the creature reared up and galloped madly away .   it was not  the highwayman thought muzzily  going to be a good night .  well  he   d be damned if he   d lose a horse as well as some wages .  who the hell were those people .  he couldn   t quite remember what had happened in the carriage  but it hadn   t been enjoyable .   the highwayman was of that simple class of men who  having been hit by someone bigger than them  finds someone smaller than them for the purposes of retaliation .  someone else was going to suffer tonight  he vowed .  he   d get another horse  at least .   and  on cue  he heard the sound of hoofbeats on the wind .  he drew his sword and stepped out into the road .      stand and deliver .      the approaching horse halted obediently a few feet away .  this was not going to be such a bad night after all  he thought .  it really was a magnificent creature  more of a warhorse than an everyday hack .  it was so pale that it shone in the light of the occasional star and  by the look of it  there was silver on its harness .   the rider was heavily wrapped up against the cold .      your money or your life .     said the highwayman .   i   m sorry .      your money     said the highwayman     or your life .  which part of this don   t you understand .      oh  i see .  well  i have a small amount of money .   a couple of coins landed on the frosty road .  the highwayman scrabbled for them but could not pick them up  a fact that only added to his annoyance .      it   s your life  then .      the mounted figure shook its head .  i think not .  i really do .   it pulled a long curved stick out of a holster .  the highwayman had assumed it was a lance  but now a curved blade sprang out and glittered blue along its edges .   i must say that you have an amazing persistence of vitality  said the horseman .  it was no so much a voice  more an echo inside the head .  if not a presence of mind .      who are you .      i   m death  said death .  and i really am not here to take your money .  which part of this don   t you understand .       something fluttered weakly at the window of the castle mews .  there was no glass in the frame  just thin wooden slats to allow some passage of air .   and there was a scrabbling  and then a faint pecking  and then silence .   the hawks watched .   outside the window something went whoomph .   beams of brilliant light jerked across the far wall and  slowly  the bars began to char .       nanny ogg knew that while the actual party would be in the great hall all the fun would be outside  in the courtyard around the big fire .  inside it   d be all quails    eggs  goose liver jam and little sandwiches that were four to the mouthful .  outside it   d be roasted potatoes floating in vats of butter and a whole stag on a spit .  later on  there   d be a command performance by that man who put weasels down his trousers  a form of entertainment that nanny ranked higher than grand opera .   as a witch  of course  she   d be welcome anywhere and it was always a good idea to remind the nobs of this  in case they forgot .  it was a hard choice  but she decided to stay outside and have a good dinner of venison because  like many old ladies  nanny ogg was a bottomless pit for free food .  then she   d go inside and fill the gaps with the fiddly dishes .  besides  they probably had that expensive fizzy wine in there and nanny had quite a taste for it  provided it was served in a big enough mug .  but you needed a good depth of beer before you loaded up on the fancy stuff .   she picked up a tankard  ambled to the front of the queue at the beer barrel  gently nudged aside the head of a man who   d decided to spend the evening lying under the tap  and drew herself a pint .   as she turned back she saw the splay footed figure of agnes approaching  still slightly uneasy with the idea of wearing the new pointy hat in public .      wotcha  girl     said nanny .     try some of the venison  it   s good stuff .      agnes looked doubtfully at the roasting meat .  lancre people looked after the calories and let the vitamins go hang .      do you think i could get a salad .     she ventured .      hope not     said nanny happily     lot of people here     said agnes .      everyone got a invite     said nanny .     magrat was very gracious about that  i thought .      agnes craned her head .     can   t see granny around anywhere  though .         she   ll be inside  tellin    people what to do .         i haven   t seen her around much at all  lately     said agnes .     she   s got something on her mind  i think .      nanny narrowed her eyes .      you think so .     she said  adding to herself  you   re getting good  miss .      it   s just that ever since we heard about the birth     agnes waved a plump hand to indicate the general high cholesterol celebration around them     she   s been so   stretched  sort of .  twanging .      nanny ogg thumbed some tobacco into her pipe and struck a match on her boot .      you certainly notice things  don   t you     she said  puffing away .     notice  notice  notice .  we   ll have to call you miss notice .         i certainly notice you always fiddle around with your pipe when you   re thinking thoughts you don   t much like     said agnes .     it   s displacement activity .      through a cloud of sweet smelling smoke nanny reflected that agnes read books .  all the witches who   d lived in her cottage were bookish types .  they thought you could see life through books but you couldn   t  the reason being that the words got in the way .      she has been a bit quiet  that   s true     she said .     best to let her get on with it .         i thought perhaps she was sulking about the priest who   ll be doing the naming     said agnes .      oh  old brother perdore   s all right     said nanny .     gabbles away in some ancient lingo  keeps it short and then you just give him sixpence for his trouble  fill him up with brandy and load him on his donkey and off he goes .         what .  didn   t you hear .     said agnes .     he   s laid up over in skund .  broke his wrist and both legs falling off his donkey .      nanny ogg took her pipe out of her mouth .      why wasn   t i told .     she said .      i don   t know  nanny .  mrs .  weaver told me yesterday .         oo  that woman .  i passed her in the street this morning .  she could   ve said .      nanny poked her pipe back in her mouth as though stabbing all uncommunicative gossips .     how can you break both your legs falling off a donkey .         it was going up that little path on the side of skund gorge .  he fell sixty feet .         oh .  well   that   s a tall donkey  right enough .         so the king sent down to the omnian mission in ohulan to send us up a priest  apparently     said agnes .      he did what .     said nanny .       a small gray tent was inexpertly pitched in a field just outside the town .  the rising wind made it flap  and tore at the poster which had been pinned onto an easel outside .   it read  good news .  om welcomes you .  .  .   in fact no one had turned up to the small introductory service that mightily oats had organized that afternoon  but since he had an nounced one he had gone ahead with it anyway  singing a few cheerful hymns to his own accompaniment on the small portable harmonium and then preaching a very short sermon to the wind and the sky .   now the quite reverend oats looked at himself in the mirror .  he was a bit uneasy about the mirror  to be honest .  mirrors had led to one of the church   s innumerable schisms  one side saying that since they encouraged vanity they were bad  and the other saying that since they reflected the goodness of om they were holy .  oats had not quite formed his own opinion  being by nature someone who tries to see something in both sides of every question  but at least the mirrors helped him get his complicated clerical collar on straight .   it was still very new .  the very reverend mekkle  who   d taken pastoral practice  had advised that the rules about starch were only really a guideline  but oats hadn   t wanted to put a foot wrong and his collar could have been used as a razor .   he carefully lowered his holy turtle pendant into place  noting its gleam with some satisfaction  and picked up his finely printed graduation copy of the book of om .  some of his fellow students had spent hours carefully ruffling the pages to give them that certain straight and narrow credibility  but oats had refrained from this as well .  besides  he knew most of it by heart .   feeling rather guilty  because there had been some admonitions at the college against using holy writ merely for fortune telling  he shut his eyes and let the book flop open at random .   then he opened his eyes quickly and read the first passage they encountered .   it was somewhere in the middle of brutha   s second letter to the omish  gently chiding them for not replying to the first letter to the omish .         silence is an answer that begs three more questions .  seek and you will find  but first you should know what you seek        oh well .  he shut the book .   what a place .  what a dump .  he   d had a short walk after the service  and every path seemed to end in a cliff or a sheer drop .  never had he seen such a vertical country .  things had rustled at him in the bushes  and he   d got his shoes muddy .  as for the people he   d met   well  simple ignorant country folk  salt of the earth  obviously  but they   d just stared at him carefully from a distance  as if they were waiting for something to happen to him and didn   t care to be too close to him when it did .   but still  he mused  it did say in brutha   s letter to the simonites that if you wished the light to be seen you had to take it into dark places .  and this was certainly a dark place .   he said a small prayer and stepped out into the muddy  windy darkness .       granny flew high above the roaring treetops  under a half moon .   she distrusted a moon like that .  a full moon could only wane  a new moon could only wax  but a half moon  balancing so precariously between light and dark   well  it could do anything .   witches always lived on the edges of things .  she felt the tingle in her hands .  it was not just from the frosty air .  there was an edge somewhere .  something was beginning .   on the other side of the sky the hublights were burning around the mountains at the center of the world  bright enough even to fight the pale light of the moon .  green and gold flames danced in the air over the central mountains .  it was rare to see them at this time of the year  and granny wondered what that might signify .   slice was perched along the sides of a cleft in the mountains that couldn   t be dignified by the name of valley .  in the moonlight she saw the pale upturned face waiting in the shadows of garden as she came into land .      evening  mr .  ivy     she said  leaping off .     upstairs  is she .         in the barn     said ivy  flatly .     the cow kicked her   hard .      granny   s expression stayed impassive .      we shall see     she said     what may be done .      in the barn  one look at mrs .  patternoster   s face told her how little that might now be .  the woman wasn   t a witch  but she knew all the practical midwifery that can be picked up in an isolated village  be it from cows  goats  horses or humans .      it   s bad     she whispered  as granny looked at the moaning figure on the straw .     i reckon we   ll lose both of them   or maybe just one        there was  if you were listening for it  just the suggestion of a question in that sentence .  granny focused her mind .      it   s a boy     she said .   mrs .  patternoster didn   t bother to wonder how granny knew  but her expression indicated that a little more weight had been added to a burden .      i   d better go and put it to john ivy  then     she said .   she   d barely moved before granny weatherwax   s hand locked on her arm .      he   s no part in this     she said .      but after all  he is the           he   s no part in this .      mrs .  patternoster looked into the blue stare and knew two things .  one was that mr .  ivy had no part in this  and the other was that anything that happened in this barn was never  ever  going to be mentioned again .      i think i can bring    em to mind     said granny  letting go and rolling up her sleeves .     pleasant couple  as i recall .  he   s a good husband  by all accounts .     she poured warm water from its jug into the bowl that the midwife had set up on a manger .   mrs .  patternoster nodded .      of course  it   s difficult for a man working these steep lands alone     granny went on  washing her hands .  mrs .  patternoster nodded again  mournfully .      well  i reckon you should take him into the cottage  mrs .  patternoster  and make him a cup of tea     granny commanded .     you can tell him i   m doing all i can .      this time the midwife nodded gratefully .   when she had fled  granny laid a hand on mrs .  ivy   s damp forehead .      well now  florence ivy     she said     let us see what might be done .  but first of all   no pain        as she moved her head she caught sight of the moon through the unglazed window .  between the light and the dark   well  sometimes that   s where you had to be .   indeed .   granny didn   t bother to turn around .      i thought you   d be here     she said  as she knelt down in the straw .   where else .  said death .      do you know who you   re here for .      that is not my choice .  on the very edge you will always find some uncertainty .   granny felt the words in her head for several seconds  like little melting cubes of ice .  on the very  very edge  then  there had to be   judgment .      there   s too much damage here     she said  at last .     too much .      a few minutes later she felt the life stream past her .  death had the decency to leave without a word .   when mrs .  patternoster tremulously knocked on the door and pushed it open  granny was in the cow   s stall .  the midwife saw her stand up holding a piece of thorn .      been in the beast   s leg all day     she said .     no wonder it was fretful .  try and make sure he doesn   t kill the cow  you understand .  they   ll need it .      mrs .  patternoster glanced down at the rolled up blanket in the straw .  granny had tactfully placed it out of sight of mrs .  ivy  who was sleeping now .      i   ll tell him     said granny  brushing off her dress .     as for her  well  she   s strong and young and you know what to do .  you keep an eye on her  and me or nanny ogg will drop in when we can .  if she   s up to it  they may need a wet nurse up at the castle  and that may be good for everyone .      it was doubtful that anyone in slice would defy granny weatherwax  but granny saw the faintest gray shadow of disapproval in the midwife   s expression .      you still reckon i should   ve asked mr .  ivy .     she said .      that   s what i would have done       the woman mumbled .      you don   t like him .  you think he   s a bad man .     said granny .  adjusting her hat pins .      no .         then what   s he ever done to me  that i should hurt him so .          agnes had to run to keep up .  nanny ogg  when roused  could move as though powered by pistons .      but we get a lot of priests up here  nanny .         not like the omnians .     snapped nanny .     we had    em up here last year .  a couple of    em knocked at my door .         well  that is what a door is f           and they shoved a leaflet under it saying    repent .        nanny ogg went on .     repent .  me .  cheek .  i can   t start repenting at my time of life .  i   d never get any work done .  anyway     she added     i ain   t sorry for most of it .         you   re getting a bit excited  i think           they set fire to people .     said nanny .      i think i read somewhere that they used to  yes     said agnes  panting with the effort of keeping up .     but that was a long time ago  nanny .  the ones i saw in ankh morpork just handed out leaflets and preached in a big tent and sang rather dreary songs               hah .  the leopard does not change his shorts  my girl .      they ran along a corridor  and out from behind a screen into the hubbub of the great hall .      knee deep in nobs     said nanny  craning .     ah  there   s our shawn        lancre   s standing army was lurking by a pillar  probably in the hope that no one would see him in his footman   s powdered wig  which had been made for a much bigger footman .   the kingdom didn   t have much of an executive arm of government  and most of its actual hands belonged to nanny ogg   s youngest son .  despite the earnest efforts of king verence  who was quite a forward looking ruler in a nervous kind of way  the people of lancre could not be persuaded to accept a democracy at any price and the place had not  regrettably  attracted much in the way of government .  a lot of the bits it couldn   t avoid were done by shawn .  he emptied the palace privies  delivered its sparse mail  guarded the walls  operated the royal mint  balanced the budget  helped out the gardener in his spare time and  on those occasions these days when it was felt necessary to man the borders  and verence felt that yellow and black striped poles did give a country such a professional look  he stamped passports  or at a pinch any other pieces of paper the visitor could produce  such as the back of an envelope  with a stamp he   d carved quite nicely out of half a potato .  he took it all very seriously .  at times like this  he buttled when spriggins the butler was not on duty  or if an extra hand was needed he footed as well .      evening  our shawn     said nanny ogg .     i see you   ve got that dead lamb on your head again .         aoow  mum     said shawn  trying to adjust the wig .      where   s this priest that   s doing the naming .     said nanny .      what  mum .  dunno  mum .  i stopped shouting out the names half an hour ago and got on to serving the bits of cheese on sticks   aoow  mum  you shouldn   t take that many  mum .       nanny ogg sucked the cocktail goodies off four sticks in one easy movement  and looked speculatively at the throng .      i   m going to have a word with young verence     said nanny .      he is the king  nanny     said agnes .      that   s no reason for him to go around acting like he was royalty .         i think it is  actually .         none of that cheek .  you just go and find this omnian and keep an eye on him .         what should i look for .     said agnes sourly .     a column of smoke .         they all wear black     said nanny firmly .     hah .  typical .         well .  so do we .         right .  but ours is   ours is       nanny thumped her chest  causing considerable ripples     ours is the right black  right .  now  off you go and look inconspicuous     added nanny  a lady wearing a two foot tall pointed black hat .  she stared around at the crowd again  and nudged her son .      shawn  you did deliver an invite to esme weatherwax  didn   t you .      he looked horrified .     of course  mum .         shove it under her door .         no  mum .  you know she gave me an ear bashin    when the snails got at that postcard last year .  i put it under a stone  good and tight .         there   s a good boy     said nanny .   lancre people didn   t bother much with letterboxes .  mail was infrequent but biting gales were not .  why have a slot in the door to let in unsolicited winds .  so letters were left under large stones  wedged firmly in flowerpots or slipped under the door .   there were never very many .   lancre operated on the feudal system  which was to say  everyone feuded all the time and handed on the fight to their descendants .  the chips on some shoulders had been passed down for generations .  some had antique value .  a bloody good grudge  lancre reckoned  was like a fine old wine .  you looked after it carefully and left it to your children .   you never wrote to anyone .  if you had anything to say  you said it to their face .  it kept everything nice and hot .   agnes edged into the crowd  feeling stupid .  she often did .  now she knew why magrat garlick had always worn those soppy floppy dresses and never wore the pointy hat .  wear the pointy hat and dress in black  and on agnes there was plenty of black to go around  and everyone saw you in a certain way .  you were a witch .  it had its good points .  among the bad ones was the fact that people turned to you when they were in trouble and never thought for a moment that you couldn   t cope .   but she got a bit of respect  even from people who could remember her before she   d been allowed to wear the hat .  they tended to make way for her  although people tended to make way in any case for agnes when she was in full steam .      evening  miss        she turned  and saw hodgesaargh in full official regalia .   it was important not to smile at times like this  so agnes kept a straight face and tried to ignore perdita   s hysterical laughter at the back of her mind .   she   d seen hodgesaargh occasionally  around the edges of the woods or up on the moors .  usually the royal falconer was vainly fighting off his hawks  who attacked him for a pastime  and in the case of king henry kept picking him up and dropping him again in the belief that he was a giant tortoise .   it wasn   t that he was bad falconer .  a few other people in lancre kept hawks and reckoned he was one of the best trainers in the mountains  possibly because he was so single minded about it .  it was just that he trained every feathery little killing machine so well that it became unable to resist seeing what he tasted like .   he didn   t deserve it .  nor did he deserve his ceremonial costume .  usually  when not in the company of king henry  he just wore working leathers and about three sticking plasters  but what he was wearing now had been designed hundreds of years before by someone with a lyrical view of the countryside and who had never had to run through a bramble bush with a gerfalcon hanging on their ear .  it had a lot of red and gold in it and would have looked much better on someone two feet taller who had the legs for red stockings .  the hat was best not talked about  but if you had to  you   d talk about it in terms of something big  red and floppy .  with a feather in it .      miss nitt .     said hodgesaargh .      sorry   i was looking at your hat .         it   s good  isn   t it     said hodgesaargh amiably .     this is william .  she   s a buzzard .  but she thinks she   s a chicken .  she can   t fly .  i   m having to teach her how to hunt .      agnes was craning her neck for any signs of overtly religious activity  but the incongruity of the slightly bedraggled creature on hodgesaargh   s wrist brought her gaze back down again .      how .     she said .      she walks into the burrows and kicks the rabbits to death .  and i   ve almost cured her of crowing .  haven   t i  william .         william .     said agnes .     oh   yes .     to a falconer  she remembered  all hawks were    she .         have you seen any omnians here .     she whispered  leaning down toward him .      what kind of bird are they  miss .     said the falconer uneasily .  he always seemed to have a preoccupied air when not discussing hawks  like a man with a big dictionary who couldn   t find the index .      oh  er   don   t worry about it  then .     she stared at william again and said     how .  i mean  how does a bird like that think he   s   she   s a chicken .         can happen all too easy  miss     said hodgesaargh .     thomas peerless over in bad ass pinched an egg and put it under a broody hen  miss .  he didn   t take the chicken away in time .  so william thought if her mum was a chicken  then so was she .         well  that   s           and that   s what happens  miss .  when i raise them from eggs i don   t do that .  i   ve got a special glove  miss           that   s absolutely fascinating  but i   d better go     said agnes  quickly .      yes  miss .      she   d spotted the quarry  walking across the hall .   there was something unmistakable about him .  it was as if he was a witch .  it wasn   t that his black robe ended at the knees and became a pair of legs encased in gray socks and sandals  or that his hat had a tiny crown but a brim big enough to set out your dinner on .  it was because wherever he walked  he was in a little empty space that seemed to move around him  just like you got around witches .  no one wanted to get too close to witches .   she couldn   t see his face .  he was making a beeline for the buffet table .      excuse me  miss nitt .      shawn had appeared at her side .  he stood very stiffly  because if he made any sudden turns the oversized wig tended to spin on his head .      yes  shawn .     said agnes .      the queen wants a word  miss     said shawn .      with me .         yes  miss .  she   s up in the ghastly green drawing room  miss .     shawn swiveled slowly .  his wig stayed facing the same way .   agnes hesitated .  it was a royal command  she supposed  even if it was only from magrat garlick as was  and as such it superseded anything nanny had asked her to do .  anyway  she had spotted the priest  and it was not as though he was going to set fire to everyone over the canap  s .  she   d better go .       a little hatch shot open behind the doleful igor .      why   ve we stopped this time .         troll   th in the way  marthter .         a what .      igor rolled his eyes .     a troll   th in the way     he said .   the hatch shut .  there was a whispered conversation inside the coach .  the hatch opened .      you mean a troll .         yeth  marthter .         run it down .      the troll advanced  holding a flickering torch above its head .  at some point recently someone had said    this troll needs a uniform    and had found that the only thing in the armory that would fit was the helmet  and then only if you attached it to his head with string .      the old count wouldn   t have told me to run it down     igor muttered  not quite under his breath .     but  then  he wath a gentleman .         what was that .     a female voice snapped .   the troll reached the coach and banged its knuckles on its helmet respectfully .      evenin        it said .     dis is a bit embarrassin    .  you know a pole .         pole .     said igor suspiciously .      it are a long wooden fing           yeth .  well .  what about it .         i   d like you to imagine  right  dat dere   s a black an    yellow striped one across dis road  right .  only    cos we   ve only got der one  an    it   s bein    used up on der copperhead road tonight .      the hatch slid open .      get a move on  man .  run it down .         i could go an    get it if you like     said the troll  shifting nervously from one huge foot to the other .     only it wouldn   t be here till tomorrow  right .  or you could pretend it   s here right now  an    then i could pretend to lift it up  and dat   d be okay  right .         do it  then     said igor .  he ignored the grumbling behind him .  the old count had always been polite to trolls even though you couldn   t bite them  and that was real class in a vampire .      only firs    i gotta stamp somethin        said the troll .  it held up half a potato and a paint soaked rag .      why .         shows you   ve bin past me     said the troll .      yeth  but we will have been parthed you     igor pointed out .     i mean  everyone will know we   ve been parthed you becauthe we are .         but it   ll show you done it officially     said the troll .      what   ll happen if we jutht drive on .     said igor .      er   den i won   t lift der pole     said the troll .   locked in a metaphysical conundrum  they both looked at the patch of road where the virtual pole barred the way .   normally  igor wouldn   t have wasted any time .  but the family had been getting on his nerves  and he reacted in the traditional way of the put upon servant by suddenly becoming very stupid .  he leaned down and addressed the coach   s occupants through the hatch .      it   th a border check  marthter     he said .     we got to have thomething thtamped .      there was more whispering inside the coach  and then a large white rectangle  edged in gold  was thrust ungraciously through the hatch .  igor passed it down .      seems a shame     said the troll  stamping it inexpertly and handing it back .      what   th thith .     igor demanded .      pardon .         thith   thtupid mark .         well  the potato wasn   t big enough for the official seal and i don   t know what a seal look like in any case but i reckon dat   s a good carvin    of a duck i done there     said the troll cheerfully .      now   are you ready .     cos i   m liftin    der pole .  here it goes now .  look at it pointin    up in der air like dat .  dis means you can go .      the coach rolled on a little way and stopped just before the bridge .   the troll  aware that he   d done his duty  wandered toward it and heard what he considered to be a perplexing conversation  although to big jim beef most conversations involving polysyllabic words were shrouded in mystery .      now  i want you to all pay attention           father  we have done this before .         the point can   t be hammered home far enough .  that is the lancre river down there .  running water .  and we will cross it .  it is as well to consider that your ancestors  although quite capable of undertaking journeys of hundreds of miles  nevertheless firmly believed that they couldn   t cross a stream .  do i need to point out the contradiction .         no  father .         good .  cultural conditioning would be the death of us  if we are not careful .  drive on  igor .      the troll watched them go .  coldness seemed to follow them across the bridge .  granny weatherwax was airborne again  glad of the clean  crisp air .  she was well above the trees and  to the benefit of all concerned  no one could see her face .   isolated homesteads passed below  a few with lighted windows but most of them dark  because people would long ago have headed for the palace .   there was a story under every roof  she knew .  she knew all about stories .  but those down there were the stories that were never to be told  the little secret stories  enacted in little rooms     they were about those times when medicines didn   t help and headology was at a loss because a mind was a rage of pain in a body that had become its own enemy  when people were simply in a prison made of flesh  and at times like this she could let them go .  there was no need for desperate stuff with a pillow  or deliberate mistakes with the medicine .  you didn   t push them out of the world  you just stopped the world pulling them back .  you just reached in  and   showed them the way .   there was never anything said .  sometimes you saw in the face of the relatives the request they   d never  ever put words around  or maybe they   d say    is there something you can do for him .     and this was  perhaps  the code .  if you dared ask  they   d be shocked that you might have thought they meant anything other than  perhaps  a comfier pillow .   and any midwife  out in isolated cottages on bloody nights  would know all the other little secrets     never to be told     she   d been a witch here all her life .  and one of the things a witch did was stand right on the edge  where the decisions had to be made .  you made them so that others didn   t have to  so that others could even pretend to themselves that there were no decisions to be made  no little secrets  that things just happened .  you never said what you knew .  and you didn   t ask for anything in return .   the castle was brightly lit  she saw .  she could even make out figures around the bonfire .   something else caught her eye  because she was going to look everywhere but at the castle now  and it jolted her out of her mood .  mist was pouring over the mountains and sliding down the far valleys under the moonlight .  one strand was flowing toward the castle and pouring  very slowly  into the lancre gorge .   of course you got mists in the spring  when the weather was changing  but this mist was coming from uberwald .       the door to magrat   s room was opened by millie chillum  the maid  who curtseyed to agnes  or at least to her hat  and then left her alone with the queen  who was at her dressing table .   agnes wasn   t sure of the protocol  but tried a sort of republican curtsey .  this caused considerable movement in outlying regions .   queen magrat of lancre blew her nose and stuffed the hankie up the sleeve of her dressing gown .      oh  hello  agnes     she said .     take a seat  do .  you don   t have to bob up and down like that .  millie does it all the time and i get seasick .  anyway  strictly speaking  witches bow .         er       agnes began .  she glanced at the crib in the corner .  it had more loops and lace than any piece of furniture should .      she   s asleep     said magrat .     oh  the crib .  verence ordered it all the way from ankh morpork .  i said the old one they   d always used was fine  but he   s very  you know   modern .  please sit down .         you wanted me  your maj       agnes began  still uncertain .  it was turning out to be a very complicated evening  and she wasn   t sure even now how she felt about magrat .  the woman had left echoes of herself in the cottage   an old bangle lost under the bed  rather soppy notes in some of the ancient notebooks  vases full of desiccated flowers   you can build up a very strange view of someone via the things they leave behind the dresser .      i just wanted a little talk     said magrat .     it   s a bit   look  i   m really very happy  but   well  millie   s nice but she agrees with me all the time and nanny and granny still treat me as if i wasn   t  well  you know  queen and everything   not that i want to be treated as queen all the time but  well  you know  i want them to know i   m queen but not treat me as one  if you see what i mean           i think so     said agnes carefully .   magrat waved her hands in an effort to describe the indescribable .  used handkerchiefs cascaded out of her sleeves .      i mean   i get dizzy with people bobbing up and down all the time  so when they see me i like them to think    oh  there   s magrat  she   s queen now but i shall treat her in a perfectly normal way              but perhaps just a little bit more politely because she is queen  after all     agnes suggested .      well  yes   exactly .  actually  nanny   s not too bad  at least she treats everyone the same all the time  but when granny looks at me you can see her thinking    oh  there   s magrat .  make the tea  magrat .     one day i swear i   ll make a very cutting remark .  it   s as if they think i   m doing this as a hobby .         i do know what you mean .         it   s as if they think i   m going to get it out of my system and go back to witching again .  they wouldn   t say that  of course  but that   s what they think .  they really don   t believe there   s any other sort of life .         that   s true .         how   s the old cottage .         there   s a lot of mice     said agnes .      i know .  i used to feed them .  don   t tell granny .  she   s here  isn   t she .         haven   t seen her yet     said agnes .      ah  she   ll be waiting for a dramatic moment     said magrat .     and you know what .  i   ve never caught her actually waiting for a dramatic moment  not in all the  well  things we   ve been involved in .  i mean  if it was you or me  we   d be hanging around in the hall or something  but she just walks in and it   s the right time .         she says you make your own right time     said agnes .      yes .         yes .         and you say she   s not here yet .  it was the first card we did .     magrat leaned closer .     verence got them to put extra gold leaf on it .  i   m amazed it doesn   t go clang when she puts it down .  how are you at making the tea .         they always complain     said agnes .      they do  don   t they .  three lumps of sugar for nanny ogg  right .         it   s not as if they even give me tea money     said agnes .  she sniffed .  there was a slight mustiness to the air .      it   s not worth baking biscuits  i can tell you that     said magrat .     i used to spend hours doing fancy ones with crescent moons and so on .  you might just as well get them from the shop .      she sniffed  too .     that   s not the baby     she said .     i   m sure shawn ogg   s been so busy arranging things he hasn   t had time to clean up the privy pit the last two weeks .  the smell comes right up the garderobe in the gong tower when the wind gusts .  i   ve tried hanging up fragrant herbs but they sort of dissolve .      she looked uncertain  as if a worse prospect than lax castle sanitation had crossed her mind .     er   she must   ve got the invitation  mustn   t she .         shawn says he delivered it     said agnes .     and she probably said     and here her voice changed  becoming clipped and harsh        i can   t be havin    with that at my time of life .  i   ve never bin one to put meself forward  no one could ever say i   m one to put meself forward .         magrat   s mouth was an o of amazement .      that   s so like her it   s frightening .     she said .      it   s one of the few things i   m good at     said agnes  in her normal voice .     big hair  a wonderful personality  and an ear for sounds .     and two minds  perdita added .     she   ll come anyway     agnes went on  ignoring the inner voice .      but it   s gone half eleven   good grief  i   d better get dressed .  can you give me a hand .      she hurried into the dressing room with agnes tagging along behind .      i even wrote a bit underneath asking her to be a godmother     she said  sitting down in front of the mirror and scrabbling among the debris of makeup .     she   s always secretly wanted to be one .         that   s something to wish on a child     said agnes  without thinking .   magrat   s hand stopped halfway to her face  in a little cloud of powder  and agnes saw her horrified look in the mirror .  then the jaw tightened  and for a moment the queen had just the same expression that granny sometimes employed .      well  if it was a choice of wishing a child health  wealth and happiness  or granny weatherwax being on her side  i know which i   d choose     said magrat .     you must have seen her in action .         once or twice  yes     agnes conceded .      she   ll never be beaten     said magrat .     you wait till you see her when she   s in a tight corner .  she   s got that way of   putting part of herself somewhere safe .  it   s as if   as if she gives herself to someone else to keep hidden for a while .  it   s all part of that borrowing stuff she does .      agnes nodded .  nanny had warned her about it but  even so  it was unnerving to turn up at granny   s cottage and find her stretched out on the floor as stiff as a stick and holding  in fingers that were almost blue  a card with the words  i ate   nt dead .   it just meant that she was out in the world somewhere  seeing life through the eyes of a badger or a pigeon  riding as an unheeded passenger in its mind .      and you know what .     magrat went on .     it   s just like those magicians in howondaland who keep their heart hidden in a jar somewhere  for safety  so they can   t be killed .  there   s something about it in a book at the cottage .         wouldn   t have to be a big jar     said agnes .      that wasn   t fair     said magrat .  she paused .     well   not fair for most of the time .  often  anyway .  sometimes  at least .  can you help me with this bloody ruff .      there was a gurgle from the cradle .      what name are you giving her .     said agnes .      you   ll have to wait     said magrat .   that made a sort of sense  agnes admitted  as she followed magrat and the maids to the hall .  in lancre  you named children at midnight  so that they started a day with a new name .  she didn   t know why it made sense .  it just felt as though  once  someone had found that it worked .  lancrastrians never threw away anything that worked .  the trouble was  they seldom changed anything that worked  either .   she   d heard that this was depressing king verence  who was teaching himself kinging out of books .  his plans for better irrigation and agriculture were warmly applauded by the people of lancre  who then did nothing about them .  nor did they take any notice of his scheme for sanitation  i . e .   that there should be some  since the lancrastrian idea of posh sanitation was a non slippery path to the privy and a mail order catalogue with really soft pages .  they   d agreed to the idea of a royal society for the betterment of mankind  but since this largely consisted of as much time as shawn ogg had to spare on thursday afternoons mankind was safe from too much betterment for a while  although shawn had invented draft excluders for some of the windier parts of the castle  for which the king had awarded him a small medal .   the people of lancre wouldn   t dream of living in anything other than a monarchy .  they   d done so for thousands of years and knew that it worked .  but they   d also found that it didn   t do to pay too much attention to what the king wanted  because there was bound to be another king along in forty years or so and he   d be certain to want something different and so they   d have gone to all that trouble for nothing .  in the meantime  his job as they saw it was to mostly stay in the palace  practice the waving  have enough sense to face the right way on coins and let them get on with the plowing  sowing  growing and harvesting .  it was  as they saw it  a social contract .  they did what they always did  and he let them .   but sometimes  he kinged     in lancre castle  king verence looked at himself in the mirror  and sighed .      mrs .  ogg     he said  adjusting his crown     i have  as you know  a great respect for the witches of lancre but this is  with respect  broadly a matter of general policy which  i respectfully submit  is a matter for the king .     he adjusted the crown again  while spriggins the butler brushed his robe .     we must be tolerant .  really  mrs .  ogg  i haven   t seen you in a state like this before           they go round setting fire to people .     said nanny  annoyed at all the respect .      used to  i believe     said verence .      and it was witches they burned .      verence removed his crown and polished it with his sleeve in an infuriatingly reasonable manner .      i   ve always understood they set fire to practically everybody     he said     but that was some time ago  wasn   t it .         our jason heard    em preaching once down in ohulan and they was saying some very nasty things about witches     said nanny .      sadly  not everyone knows witches like we do     said verence  with what nanny on her overheated state thought was unnecessary diplomacy .      and our wayne said they tries to turn folk against other religions     she went on .     since they opened up that mission of theirs even the offlerians have upped sticks and gone .  i mean  it   s one thing saying you   ve got the best god  but sayin    it   s the only real one is a bit of a cheek  in my opinion .  i know where i can find at least two any day of the week .  and they say everyone starts out bad and only gets good by believin    in om  which is frankly damn nonsense .  i mean  look at your little girl   what   s her name going to be  now    .         everyone will know in twenty minutes  nanny     said verence smoothly .      hah .     nanny   s tone made it clear that radio ogg disapproved of this news management .     well  look   the worst she could put her little hand up to at her age is a few grubby nappies and keepin    you awake at night .  that   s hardly sinful  to my mind .         but you   ve never objected to the gloomy brethren  nanny .  or to the wonderers .  and the balancing monks come through here all the time .         but none of them object to me     said nanny .   verence turned .  he was finding this disconcerting .  he knew nanny ogg very well  but mainly as the person standing just behind granny weatherwax and smiling a lot .  it was hard to deal with an angry ogg .      i really think you   re taking this too much to heart  mrs .  ogg     he said .      granny weatherwax won   t like it .     nanny played the trump card .  to her horror  it didn   t seem to have the desired effect .      granny weatherwax isn   t king  mrs .  ogg     said verence .     and the world is changing .  there is a new order .  once upon a time trolls were monsters that ate people but now  thanks to the endeavors of men  and of course trolls  of goodwill and peaceful intent we get along very well and i hope we understand each other .  this is no longer a time when little kingdoms need only worry about little concerns .  we   re part of a big world .  we have to play that part .  for example  what about the muntab question .      nanny ogg asked the muntab question .     where the hell   s muntab .     she said .      several thousand miles away  mrs .  ogg .  but it has ambitions hubward  and it there   s war with borogravia we will certainly have to adopt a position .         this one several thousand miles away looks fine by me     said nanny .     and i don   t see           i   m afraid you don   t     said verence .     nor should you have to .  but affairs in distant countries can suddenly end up close to home .  if klatch sneezes  ankh morpork catches a cold .  we have to pay attention .  are we always to be part of the ankh morpork hegemony .  are we not in a unique position as we reach the end of the century of the fruitbat .  the countries widdershins of the ramtops are beginning to make themselves felt .  the    werewolf economies     as the patrician in ankh morpork calls them .  new powers are emerging .  old countries are blinking in the sunlight of the dawning millennium .  and of course we have to maintain friendships with all blocs .  and so on .  despite a turbulent past  omnia is a friendly country   or  at least     he admitted     i   m sure they would be friendly if they knew about lancre .  being unpleasant to the priests of its state religion will serve us no good purpose .  i   m sure we will not regret it .         let   s hope we won   t     said nanny .  she gave verence a withering look .     and i remember you when you were just a man in a funny hat .      even this didn   t work .  verence merely sighed again and turned toward the door .      i still am  nanny     he said .     it   s just that this one   s a lot heavier .  and now i must go  otherwise we shall be keeping our guests waiting .  ah  shawn        shawn ogg had appeared at the door .  he saluted .      how   s the army coming along  shawn .         i   ve nearly finished the knife  sir .   just got to do the nose hair tweezers and the folding saw  sir .  but actually i   m here as herald at the moment  sir .         ah  it must be time .         yes  sir .         a shorter fanfare this time  shawn  i think     said the king .     while i personally appreciate your skill  an occasion like this calls for something a little simpler than several bars of    pink hedgehog rag .            yes  sir .         let us go  then .      they went out into the main passage just as magrat   s group was passing  and the king took her hand .   nanny ogg trailed after them .  the king was right  in a way .  she did feel   unusual  ill tempered and snappish  as if she   d put on a vest that was too tight .  well  granny would be here soon enough  and she knew how to talk to kings .   you needed a special technique for that  nanny reasoned  for example  you couldn   t say things like    who died and made you king .     because they   d know .     you and whose army .     was another difficult one  although in this case verence   s army consisted of shawn and a troll and was unlikely to be a serious threat to shawn   s own mother if he wanted to be allowed to eat his tea indoors .   she pulled agnes to one side as the procession reached the top of the big staircase and shawn went on ahead .      we   ll get a good view from the minstrel gallery     she hissed  dragging agnes into the king oak structure just as the trumpet began the royal fanfare .      that   s my boy     she added proudly  when the final flourish caused a stir .      yes  not many royal fanfares end with    shave and a haircut  no legs         said agnes .      puts people at their ease  though     said shawn   s loyal mum .   agnes looked down at the throng  and caught sight of the priest again .  he was moving through the press of guests .      i found him  nanny     she said .     he didn   t make it hard  i must say .  he won   t try anything in a crowd  will he .         which one is it .      agnes pointed .  nanny stared  and then turned to her .      sometimes i think the weight of that damn crown is turning verence   s head     she said .     i reckon he really doesn   t know what he   s lettin    into the kingdom .  when esme gets here she   s going to go through this priest like cabbage soup .      by now the guests had got themselves sorted out on either side of the red carpet that began at the bottom of the stairs .  agnes glanced up at the royal couple  waiting awkwardly  just out of sight for the appropriate moment to descend  and thought  granny weatherwax says you make your own right time .  they   re the royal family .  all they need to do is walk down the stairs and it   d be the right time .  they   re doing it wrong .   several of the lancre guests were occasionally glancing at the big double doors  shut for this official ceremony .  they   d be thrown open later  for the more public and enjoyable part  but right now they looked        like doors which would soon creak back and frame a figure against the firelight .   she could see the image so clearly .   the exercises granny had reluctantly given her were working  perdita thought .   there was a hurried conversation among the royal party and then millie hurried back up the stairs and toward the witches .      mag   the queen says  is granny weatherwax coming or not .     she panted .      of course she is     said nanny .      only  well  the king   s getting a bit   upset .  he said it did say rsvp on the invitation     said millie  trying not to meet nanny eye to eye .      oh  witches never reservups     said nanny .     they just come .      millie put her hand in front of her mouth and gave a nervous little cough .  she glanced wretchedly toward magrat  who was making frantic hand signals .      only  well  the queen says we   d better not hold things up  so  er  would you be godmother  mrs .  ogg .      the wrinkles doubled on nanny   s face as she smiled .      tell you what     she said brightly     i   ll come and sort of stand in until granny gets here  shall i .          once again  granny weatherwax paced up and down in the spartan grayness of her kitchen .  occasionally she   d glance at the floor .  there was quite a gap under the door  and sometimes things could be blown anywhere .  but she   d already searched a dozen times .  she must   ve got the cleanest floor in the country by now .  anyway  it was too late .   even so   uberwald      she strode up and down a few more times .      i   ll be blowed if i   ll give    em the satisfaction     she muttered .   she sat down in her rocking chair  stood up again so quickly that the chair almost fell over  and went back to the pacing .      i mean  i never been the kind of person to put myself forward     she said to the air .     i   m not the sort to go where i   m not welcome  i   m sure .      she went to make a cup of tea  fumbling with the kettle in shaking hands  and dropped the lid on her sugar bowl  breaking it .   a light caught her eye .  the half moon was visible over the lawn .      anyway  it   s not as if i   ve not got other things to do     she said .     can   t all be rushing off to parties the whole time   wouldn   t have gone anyway .      she found herself flouncing around the corners of the floor again and thought  if i   d found it  the wattley boy would have knocked at an empty cottage .  i   d have gone and enjoyed meself .  and john ivy   d be sitting alone  now        drat .      that was the worst part about being good   it caught you coming and going .   she landed in the rocking chair again and pulled her shawl around her  against the chill .  she hadn   t kept the fire in .  she hadn   t expected to be at home tonight .   shadows filled the corners of the room  but she couldn   t be bothered to light the lamp .  the candle would have to do .   as she rocked  glaring at the wall  the shadows lengthened .       agnes followed nanny down into the hall .  she probably wasn   t meant to  but very few people will argue with a hat of authority .   small countries were normal along this part of the ramtops .  every glacial valley  separated from its neighbors by a route that required a scramble or  at worst  a ladder  more or less ruled itself .  there seemed to agnes to be any number of kings  even if some of them did their ruling in the evenings after they   d milked the cows .  a lot of them were here  because a free meal is not to be sneezed at .  there were also some senior dwarfs from copperhead and  standing well away from them  a group of trolls .  they weren   t carrying weapons  so agnes assumed they were politicians .  trolls weren   t strictly subjects of king verence  but they were there to say  in official body language  that playing football with human heads was something no one did anymore  much .  hardly at all  really .  not roun    here  certainly .  dere   s practic   ly a law against it .   the witches were ushered to the area in front of the thrones  and then millie scurried away .   the omnian priest nodded at them .      good  um  evening     he said  and completely failed to set fire to anyone .  he wasn   t very old and had a rather ripe boil beside his nose .  inside agnes  perdita made a face at him .   nanny ogg grunted .  agnes risked a brief smile .  the priest blew his nose noisily .      you must be some of these  um  witches i   ve heard so much about     he said .  he had an amazing smile .  it appeared on his face as if someone had operated a shutter .  one moment it wasn   t there  the next moment it was .  and then it was gone .      um  yes     said agnes .      hah     said nanny ogg  who could haughtily turn her back on people while looking them in the eye .      and i am  i am  aaaa       said the priest .  he stopped  and pinched the bridge of his nose .     oh  i am sorry .  the mountain air doesn   t agree with me .  i am the quite reverend mightily oats .         you are .     said agnes .  to her amazement  the man began to redden .  the more she looked at him  the more she realized that he wasn   t much older than she was .      that is  mightily praiseworthy are ye who exalteth om oats     he said .     it   s much shorter in omnian  of course .  have you by any chance heard the word of om .         which one .     fire    .     said nanny ogg .     hah .      the nascent religious war was abruptly cut short by the first official royal fanfare to end with a few bars from the    hedgehog cakewalk .     the royal couple began to descend the stairs .      and we   ll have none of your heathen ways  thank you very much     muttered nanny ogg behind the pastor .     no sloshing water or oil or sand around or cutting any bits off and if i hears a single word i understand  well  i   m standing behind you with a pointy stick .       from the other side he heard     he   s not some kind of horrible inquisitor  nanny .         but my pointy stick   s still a pointy stick  my girl .      what   s got into her .  agnes thought  watching the pastor   s ears turn red .  that   s the way granny would act .  perdita added  perhaps she thinks she   s got to carry on like that because that old bat   s not here yet .   agnes was quite shocked at hearing herself think that .      you do things our way here  all right .     said nanny .      the  um  king did explain it all to me  um     said the pastor .     er  do have anything for a headache .  i   m afraid i           you put the key in one hand and let her grip the crown with the other     nanny ogg went on .      yes  um  he did           then you tell her what her name is and her mum   s name and her dad   s name  mumbling a bit over the latter if the mum ain   t sure           nanny .  this is royalty .         hah  i could tell you stories  gel   and then  see  you give her to me and i tell her  too  and then i give her back and you tell the people what her name is  an    then you give her to me  and then i give her to her dad  and he takes her out through the doors and shows her to everyone  everyone throws their hats in the air and shouts    hoorah .     and then it   s all over bar the drinks and horses    doovers and findin    your own hat .  start extemporizin    on the subject of sin and it   ll go hard with you .         what is  um  your role  madam .         i   m the godmother .         which  um  god .     the young man was trembling slightly .      it   s from old lancre     said agnes hurriedly .     it   s means something like    goodmother .     it   s all right   as witches we believe in religious toleration           that   s right     said nanny ogg .     but only for the right religions  so you watch your step .      the royal parents had reached the thrones .  magrat took her seat and  to agnes   s amazement  gave her a sly wink .   verence didn   t wink .  he stood there and coughed loudly .      ahem .         i   ve got a pastille somewhere     said nanny  her hand reaching toward her knicker leg .      ahem .     verence   s eyes darted toward his throne .   what had appeared to be a gray cushion rolled over  yawned  gave the king a brief glance  and started to wash itself .      oh  greebo .     said nanny .     i was wonderin    where you   d got to           could you please remove him  mrs .  ogg .     said the king .   agnes glanced at magrat .  the queen had half turned away  with her elbow on the arm of the throne and her hand covering her mouth .  her shoulders were shaking .   nanny grabbed her cat off the throne .      a cat can look at a king     she said .      not with that expression  i believe     said verence .  he waved graciously at the assembled company  just as the castle   s clock began to strike midnight .      please begin  reverend .         i  um  did have a small suitable homily on the subject of  um  hope for the       the quite reverend oats began  but there was a grunt from nanny and he suddenly seemed to jerk forward slightly .  he blinked once or twice and his adam   s apple bobbed up and down .     but alas i fear we have no time     he concluded quickly .   magrat leaned over and whispered something in her husband   s ear .  agnes heard him say     well  dear  i think we have to  whether she   s here or not        shawn scurried up  slightly out of breath and with his wig on sideways .  he was carrying a cushion .  on the faded velvet was the big iron key of the castle .   millie chillum carefully handed the baby to the priest  who held it gingerly .   it seemed to the royal couple that he suddenly started to speak very hesitantly .  behind him  nanny ogg   s was an expression of extreme interest that was nevertheless made up of one hundred percent artificial additives .  they also had the impression that the poor man was suffering from frequent attacks of cramp .         we are gathered here together in the sight of   um   one another           are you all right  reverend .     said the king  leaning forward .      never better  sir  um  i assure you     said oats miserably        and i therefore name thee   that is  you        there was a deep  horrible pause .   glassy faced  the priest handed the baby to millie .  then he removed his hat  took a small scrap of paper from the lining  read it  moved his lips a few times as he said the words to himself  and then replaced the hat on his sweating forehead and took the baby again .      i name you   esmerelda margaret note spelling of lancre .      the shocked silence was suddenly filled .      note spelling .     said magrat and agnes together .      esmerelda .     said nanny .   the baby opened her eyes .   and the doors swung back .       choices .  it was always choices     there   d been that man down in spackle  the one that   d killed those little kids .  the people   d sent for her and she   d looked at him and seen the guilt writhing in his head like a red worm  and then she   d taken them to his farm and showed them where to dig  and he   d thrown himself down and asked her for mercy  because he said he   d been drunk and it   d all been done in alcohol .   her words came back to her .  she   d said  in sobriety  end it in hemp .   and they   d dragged him off and hanged him in a hempen rope and she   d gone to watch because she owed him that much  and he   d cursed  which was unfair because hanging is a clean death  or at least cleaner than the one he   d have got if the villagers had dared defy her  and she   d seen the shadow of death come for him  and then behind death came the smaller  brighter figures  and then     in the darkness  the rocking chair creaked as it thundered back and forth .   the villagers had said justice had been done  and she   d lost patience and told them to go home  then  and pray to whatever gods they believed in that it was never done to them .  the smug mask of virtue triumphant could be almost as horrible as the face of wickedness revealed .   she shuddered at a memory .  almost as horrible  but not quite .   the odd thing was  quite a lot of villagers had turned up to his funeral  and there had been mutterings from one or two people on the lines of  yes  well  but overall he wasn   t such a bad chap   and anyway  maybe she made him say it .  and she   d got the dark looks .   supposing there was justice for all  after all .  for every unheeded beggar  every harsh word  every neglected duty  every slight   every choice   because that was the point  wasn   t it .  you had to choose .  you might be right  you might be wrong  but you had to choose  knowing that the rightness or wrongness might never be clear or even that you were deciding between two sorts of wrong  that there was no right anywhere .  and always  always  you did it by yourself .  you were the one there  on the edge  watching and listening .  never any tears  never any apology  never any regrets   you saved all that up in a way that could be used when needed .   she never discussed this with nanny ogg or any of the other witches .  that would be breaking the secret .  sometimes  late at night  when the conversation tip toed around to that area  nanny might just drop in some line like    old scrivens went peacefully enough at the finish    and may or may not mean something by it .  nanny  as far as she could see  didn   t agonize very much .  to her  some things obviously had to be done  and that was that .  any of the thoughts that hung around she kept locked up tight  even from herself .  granny envied her .   who   d come to her funeral when she died .   they didn   t ask her .   memories jostled .  other figures marched out into the shadows around the candlelight .   she   d done things and been places  and found ways to turn anger outward that had surprised even her .  she   d faced down others far more powerful than she was  if only she   d allowed them to believe it .  she   d given up so much  but she   d earned a lot     it was a sign .  she knew it   d come  sooner or later   they   d realized it  and now she was no more use     what had she ever earned .  the reward for toil had been more toil .  if you dug the best ditches  they gave you a bigger shovel .   and you got these bare walls  this bare floor  this cold cottage .   the darkness in the corners grew out into the room and began to tangle in her hair .   they didn   t ask her .   she   d never  ever asked for anything in return .  and the trouble with not asking for anything in return was that sometimes you didn   t get it .   she   d always tried to face toward the light .  she   d always tried to face toward the light .  but the harder you stared into the brightness the harsher it burned into you until  at last  the temptation picked you up and bid you turn around to see how long  rich  strong and dark  streaming away behind you  your shadow had become     someone mentioned her name .   there was a moment of light and noise and bewilderment .   and then she awoke  and looked at the darkness flowing in  and saw things in black and white .          so sorry   delays on the road  you know how it is        the newcomers hurried in and joined the crowd  who paid little attention because they were watching the unplanned entertainment around the thrones .      note spelling .         definitely a bit tricky     said nanny .     esmerelda  now  that was a good one .  gytha would have been good too  but esmerelda  yes  you can   t argue with it .  but you know kids .  they   ll all be calling her spelly .         if she   s lucky     said agnes gloomily .      i didn   t expect anyone to say it .     magrat hissed .     i just wanted to make sure she didn   t end up with    magrat    .      mightily oats was standing with his eyes cast upward and his hands clasped together .  occasionally he made a whimpering sound .      we can change it  can   t we .     said king verence .     where   s the royal historian .      shawn coughed .     it   s not wednesday evening and i   ll have to go and fetch the proper hat  sire           can we change it or not  man .         er   it has been said  sire .  at the official time .  i think it   s her name now  but i   ll need to go and look it up .  everyone heard it  sire .         no  you can   t change it     said nanny  who as the royal historian   s mum took it as read that she knew more than the royal historian .     look at old moocow poorchick over in slice  for one .         what happened to him  then .     said the king sharply .      his full name is james what the hell   s that cow doing in here poorchick     said magrat .      that was a very strange day  i do remember that     said nanny .      and if my mother had been sensible enough to tell brother perdore my name instead of coming over all bashful and writing it down  life would have been a whole lot different     said magrat .  she glanced nervously at verence .     probably worse  of course .         so i   ve got to take esmerelda out to her people and tell them one of her middle names is note spelling .     said verence .      well  we did once have a king called my god he   s heavy the first     said nanny .     and the beer   s been on for the last couple of hours so  basic   ly  you   ll get a cheer whatever you say .      besides  thought agnes  i know for a fact there   s people out there called syphilidae wilson and yodel lightley and total biscuit .    verence smiled .     oh well   let me have her           whifm       said mightily oats .         and perhaps someone ought to give this man a drink .         i   m so terribly  terribly sorry     whispered the priest  as the king walked between the lines of guests .      been on the drink already  i expect     said nanny .      i never ever touch alcohol .     moaned the priest .  he dabbed at his streaming eyes with a handkerchief .      i knew there was something wrong with him as soon as i looked at him     said nanny .     where   s esme  then .         i don   t know  nanny .     said agnes .      she   d know about this  you mark my words .  this   ll be a feather in her cap  right enough  a princess named after her .  she   ll be crowing about it for months .  i   m going to see what   s going on .      she stumped off .   agnes grabbed the priest   s arm .      come along  you     she sighed .      i really cannot  um  express how sorry           it   s a very strange evening all round .         i   ve  i   ve  i   ve never  um  heard of the custom before           people put a lot of importance on words in these parts .         i   m very much afraid the king will give a bad  um  report of me to brother melchio           really .      there are some people who could turn even the most amiable character into a bully and he seemed to be one of them .  there was something   sort of damp about him  the kind of helpless hopelessness that made people angry rather than charitable  the total certainty that if the whole world was a party he   d still find the kitchen .   she seemed to be stuck with him .  the vips were all crowded around the open doors  where loud cheering indicated that the people of lancre thought that note spelling was a nice name for a future queen .      perhaps you should just sit there and try to get a grip     she said .     there   s going to be dancing later on .         oh  i don   t dance     said mightily oats .     dancing is a snare to entrap the weak willed .         oh .  well  i suppose there   s a barbecue outside        mightily oats dabbed at his eyes again .      um  any fish .         i doubt it .         we eat only fish this month .         oh .     but a deadpan voice didn   t seem to work .  he still wanted to talk to her .      because the prophet brutha eschewed meat  um  when he was wandering in the desert  you see .         each mouthful forty times .         pardon .         sorry  i was thinking of something else .     against her better judgment  agnes let curiosity enter her life .     what meat is there to eat  in a desert .         um  none  i think .         so he didn   t exactly refuse to eat it  did he .     agnes scanned the gathering crowds  but no one seemed anxious to join in this little discussion .      um   you   d have to  um  ask brother melchio that .  i   m so sorry .  i think i have a migraine coming on        you don   t believe anything you   re saying  do you .  agnes thought .  nervousness and a sort of low grade terror was radiating off him .  perdita added  what a damp little maggot .      i   ve got to go and   er   to go and   i   ve got to go and   help     said agnes  backing away .  he nodded .  as she left  he blew his nose again  produced a small black book from a pocket  sighed  and hurriedly opened it at a bookmark .   she picked up a tray to add some weight to the alibi  stepped toward the food table  turned to look back at the hunched figure as out of place as a lost sheep  and walked into someone as solid as a tree .      who is that strange person .     said a voice by her ear .  agnes heard perdita curse her for jumping sideways  but she recovered and managed to smile awkwardly at the person who   d spoken .   he was a young man and  it dawned on her  a very attractive one .  attractive men were not in plentiful supply in lancre  where licking your hand and smoothing your hair down before taking a girl out was considered swanky .   he   s got a ponytail .  squeaked perdita .  now that is cool .   agnes felt the blush start somewhere in the region of her knees and begin its inevitable acceleration upward .      er   sorry .     she said .      you can practically smell him     said the man .  he inclined his head slightly toward the sad priest .     looks rather like a scruffy little crow  don   t you think .         er   yes     agnes managed .  the blush rounded the curve of her bosom  red hot and rising .  a ponytail on a man was unheard of in lancre  and the cut of his clothes also suggested that he   d spent time somewhere where fashion changed more than once a lifetime .  no one in lancre had ever worn a waistcoat embroidered with peacocks .   say something to him .  perdita screamed within .      wstfgl .     said agnes .  behind her  mightily oats had got up and was inspecting the food suspiciously .      i beg your pardon .      agnes swallowed  partly because perdita was trying to shake her by the throat .      he does look as if he   s about to flap away  doesn   t he     she said .  oh  please  don   t let me giggle     the man snapped his fingers .  a waiter hurrying past with a tray of drinks turned through ninety degrees .      can i get you a drink  miss nitt .         er   white wine .     agnes whispered .      no  you don   t want white wine  the red is much more   colorful     he said  taking a glass and handing it to her .     what is our quarry doing now   ah  applying himself to a biscuit with a very small amount of p  t   on it  i see        ask him his name .  perdita yelled .  no  that   d be forward of me  agnes thought .  perdita screamed  you were built forward  you stupid lump        please let me introduce myself .  i   m vlad     he said  kindly .     oh  now he   s   yes  he   s about to pounce on   yes  a prawn vol au vent .  prawns up here  eh .  king verence has spared no expense  has he .         he had them brought up on ice all the way from genua     agnes mumbled .      they do very good seafood there  i believe .         never been     agnes mumbled .  inside her head perdita laid down and cried .      maybe we could visit it one day  agnes     said vlad .   the blush was at agnes   s neck .      it   s very hot in here  don   t you think .     said vlad .      it   s the fire     said agnes gratefully .     it   s over there     she added  nodding to where quite a large amount of a tree was burning in the hall   s enormous fireplace and could only have been missed by a man with a bucket on his head .      my sister and i have       vlad began .      excuse me  miss nitt .         what is it  shawn .     drop dead  shawn ogg  said perdita .      mum says you   re to come at once  miss .  she   s down in the yard .  she says it   s important .         it always is     said agnes .  she gave vlad a quick smile .     excuse me  i have to go and help an old lady .         i   m sure we   ll meet again  agnes     said vlad .      oh  er   thank you .      she hurried out and was halfway down the steps before she remembered she hadn   t told him her name .   two steps farther she thought  well  he could have asked someone .   two steps after that perdita said  why would he ask anyone your name .   agnes cursed the fact that she had grown up with an invisible enemy .      come and look at this .     hissed nanny  grabbing her by the arm as she reached the courtyard .  she was dragged out to the carriages parked near the stables .  nanny waved a finger to the door of the nearest one .      see that .     she said .      it looks very impressive     said agnes .      see the crest .         looks like   a couple of black and white birds .  magpies  aren   t they .         yeah  but look at the writin        said nanny ogg  with that dark relish old ladies reserve for nastily portentous things .         carpe jugulum        read agnes aloud .     that   s   well  carpe diem is    seize the day     so this means              go for the throat        said nanny .     you know what our king has done  so we can play our part in this new changin    world order thing and get money for hedges because klatch gets a nosebleed when ankh morpork stubs its toe .  he   s gone an    invited some bigwigs from uberwald  that   s what he   s done .  oh  deary deary me .  vampires and werewolves  werewolves and vampires .  we   ll all be murdered in one another   s beds .     she walked up to the front of the coach and tapped on the wood near the driver  who was sitting hunched up in an enormous cloak .     where   re you from  igor .      the shadowy figure turned .      what maketh you think my name ith   igor .         lucky guess .     said nanny .      you think everyone from uberwald ith called igor  do you .  i could have any one of a thouthand different nameth  woman .         look  i   m nanny ogg and thith  excuse me  this is agnes nitt .  and you are    .         my name ith   well  it   th igor  ath a matter of facththth     said igor .  he raised a hasty finger .     but it might not have been .         it   s a chilly night .  can we get you something .     said nanny cheerfully .      perhaps a towel .     said agnes .   nanny nudged her in the ribs to be silent .     a glass of wine  p   raps .     she said .      i do not drink   wine     said igor haughtily .      i   ve got some brandy     said nanny  hitching up her skirt .      oh right  i drink brandy like thtink .      knickerleg elastic twanged in the gloom .      so     said nanny  passing up the flask     what   re you doing this far from home  igor .         why   th there a thtupid troll down there on the   bridge .     said igor  taking the flask in one large hand which  agnes noticed  was a mass of scars and stitches .      oh  that   s big jim beef .  the king lets him live under there provided he looks official when we   ve got comp   ny comin    .         beef ith an odd name for a troll .         he likes the sound of it     said nanny .     it   s like a man calling himself rocky  i suppose .  so   i used to know an igor from uber wald .  walked with a limp .  one eye a bit higher than the other .  had the same manner of   speaking .  very good at brain juggling  too .         that thoundth like my uncle igor     said igor .     he worked for the mad doctor at blinz .  ha  an    he wath a proper mad doctor  too  not like the mad doctorth you get thethe dayth .  and the thervantth .  even worthe .  no pride thethe dayth .     he tapped the brandy flask for emphasis .     when uncle igor wath thent out for a geniuth   th brain  that   th what you damn well got .  there wath none of thith fumble finger thtuff and then pinching a brain out of the    really inthane    jar and hopin    no one   d notithe .  they alwayth do  anyway .      nanny took a step back .  the only sensible way to hold a conversation with igor was when you had an umbrella .      i think i   ve heard of that chap     she said .     didn   t he stitch folk together out of dead parts .         no .  really .     said agnes  shocked .     ow .         that   th right .  ith there a problem .         no  i call it prudent     said nanny  taking her foot off agnes   s toe .     my mum was a dab hand at sewing a new sheet from bits of old ones  and people   re worth more than linen .  so he   s your master now  is he .         no  my uncle igor thtill workth for him .  been thtruck by lightning three hundred timeth and thtill putth in a full night   th work .         have a drop more of that brandy  it   s very cold out here     said nanny .     so who is your master  igor .         call them marthterth .     said igor  with sudden venom and a light shower .     huh .  now the old count  he wath a gentleman of the old thcool .  he knew how it all workth .  proper evening dreth at all timeth  that   th the rule .         evenin    dress  eh .     said nanny .      yeth .  thith lot only wear it in the evening  can you imagine that .  the retht of the time it   th all thwanning around in fanthy waithtcoatth and lacy thkirtth .  hah .  d   you know what thith lot hath done .         do tell           they   th oiled the hingeth .     igor took a hefty pull of nanny   s special brandy .     thome of thothe thqueakth took bloody yearth to get right .  but  oh no  now it   th    igor  clean thothe thpiderth out of the dungeon    and    igor  order up thome proper oil lampth  all thethe

in thome carthle  you got a right to expect proper thqueakin    doorth and thome old world courtethy  don   t you .         ah  right .  an    a bed in the room with a balcony outside     said nanny .      my point egthactly .         proper billowing curtains  too .         damn right .         real gutterin    candles .         i spend ageth gettin them properly dribbly .  not that anyone careth .         you got to get the details right  i always say     said nanny .     well  well  well   so our king invited vampires  eh .      there was a thump as igor slumped backward and a tinny sound as the flask landed on the cobbles .  nanny picked it up and secreted it about her person .      good head for his drink     she remarked .  not many people ever tasted nanny ogg   s homemade brandy  it was technically impossible .  once it encountered the warmth of the human mouth it immediately turned into fumes .  you drank it via your sinuses .      what   re we going to do .     said agnes .      do .  he invited    em .  they   re guests     said nanny .     i bet if i asked him  verence   d tell me to mind my own business .  o    course  he wouldn   t put it quite like that     she added  since she knew the king had no suicidal tendencies .     he   d prob   ly use the word    respect    two or three times at least .  but it   d mean the same thing in the end .         but vampires   what   s granny going to say .         listen  my girl  they   ll be gone tomorrow   well  today  really .  we   ll just keep an eye on    em and wave    em goodbye when they go .         we don   t even know what they look like .      nanny looked at the recumbent igor .      on reflection  maybe  i should   ve asked him     she said .  she brightened up .     still  there   s one way to find them .  that   s something everyone knows about vampires        in fact there are many things everyone knows about vampires  without really taking into account that perhaps the vampires know them by now  too .       the castle hall was a din .  there was a mob around the buffet table .  nanny and agnes helped out .      can o    pee  anyone .     said nanny  shoving a tray toward a likely looking group .      i beg your pardon .     said someone .     oh   canap  s        he took a vol au vent and bit into it as he turned back to the group .         so i said to his lordship what the hell is this .      he turned to find himself under close scrutiny by the wrinkled old lady in a pointy hat .      sorry .     she said .      this   this   this is just mashed garlic .         don   t like garlic flavor  eh .     said nanny  sternly .      i love garlic  but it doesn   t like me .  this isn   t just garlic flavored  woman  it   s all garlic .      nanny peered at her tray with theatrical shortsightedness .      no  there   s some   there   s a bit of   you   re right  perhaps we overdid it a gnat   s   i   ll just go and   just get some   i   ll just go        she collided with agnes at the entrance to the kitchen .  two trays slid to the floor  spilling garlic vol au vents  garlic dip  garlic stuffed with garlic and tiny cubes of garlic on a stick  stuck into a garlic .      either there   s a lot of vampires in these parts or we   re doing something wrong     said agnes flatly .      i   ve always said you can   t have too much garlic     said nanny .      everyone else disagrees  nanny .         all right  then .  what else   ah .  all vampires wear evening dress in the evenings .         everyone here is wearing some kind of evening dress  nanny .  except us .      nanny ogg looked down .     this is the dress i always wear in the evenin    .         vampires aren   t supposed to show up in a mirror  are they .     said agnes .   nanny snapped her fingers .     good thinking .     she said .     there   s one in the lavvie .  i   ll kind of hover in there .  everyone   s got to go sooner or later .         but what if a man comes in .         oh  i won   t mind     said nanny dismissively .     i won   t be embarrassed .         i think there may be objections     said agnes  trying to ignore the mental picture just conjured up .  nanny had a pleasant grin  but there had to be times when you didn   t want it looking at you .      we   ve got to do something .  supposing granny were to turn up now  what would she think .     said nanny .      we could just ask     said agnes .      what .     hands up all vampires    .         ladies .      they turned .  the young man who had introduced himself as vlad was approaching .   agnes began to blush .      i think you were talking about vampires     he said  taking a garlic pasty from agnes   s tray and biting into it with every sign of enjoyment .     could i be of assistance .      nanny looked him up and down .      do you know much about them .     she said .      well  i am one     he said .     so i suppose the answer is yes .  charmed to meet you  mrs .  ogg .     he bowed  and reached for her hand .      oh no you don   t .     said nanny  snatching it away .     i don   t hold with bloodsuckers .         i know .  but i   m sure you shall in time .  would you like to come and meet my family .         they can bugger off .  what was the king thinking of .         nanny .     snapped agnes .      what .         you don   t have to shout like that .  it   s not very   polite .  i don   t think           vlad de magpyr     said vlad  bowing .         is going to bite my neck .     shouted nanny .      of course not     said vlad .     we had some sort of bandit earlier .  mrs .  ogg is  i suspect  a meal to be savored .  any more of these garlic things .  they   re rather piquant .         you what .     said nanny .      you just   killed someone .     said agnes .      of course .  we are vampires     said vlad .     or  we prefer  vampyres .  with a    y .     it   s more modern .  now  do come and meet my father .         you actually killed someone .     said agnes .      right .  that   s it .     snarled nanny  marching away .     i   m getting shawn and he   s gonna come back with a big sharp        vlad coughed quietly .  nanny stopped .      there are several other things people know about vampires     he said .     and one is that they have considerable control over the minds of lesser creatures .  so forget all about vampires  dear ladies .  that is an order .  and do come and meet my family .      agnes blinked .  she was aware that there had been   something .  she could feel the tail of it  slipping away between her fingers .      seems a nice young man     said nanny  in a mildly stunned voice .      i   he   yes     said agnes .   something surfaced in her mind  like a message in a bottle written indistinctly in some foreign language .  she tried  but she could not read it .      i wish granny were here     she said at last .     she   d know what to do .         what about .     said nanny .     she ain   t good at parties .         i feel a bit   odd     said agnes .      ah  could be the drink     said nanny .      i haven   t had any .         no .  well  there   s the problem right there .  come on .      they hurried into the hall .  even though it was now well after midnight  the noise level was approaching the pain threshold .  when the midnight hour lies on the glass like a big cocktail onion  there   s always an extra edge to the laughter .   vlad gave them an encouraging wave and beckoned them over to a group around king verence .      ah  agnes and nanny     said the king     count  may i present           gytha ogg and agnes nitt  i believe     said the man the king had just been talking to .  he bowed .  for some reason a tiny part of agnes was expecting a somber looking man with an exciting widows    peak hairstyle and an opera cloak .  she couldn   t think why .   this man looked like   well  like a gentleman of independent means and an inquiring mind  perhaps  the kind of man who goes for long walks in the morning and spends the afternoons improving his mind in his own private library or doing small interesting experiments on parsnips and never  ever  worrying about money .  there was something glossy about him  and also a sort of urgent  hungry enthusiasm  the kind you get when someone has just read a really interesting book and is determined to tell someone all about it .      allow me to present the countess de magpyr     he said .     these are the witches i told you about  dear .  i believe you   ve met my son .  and this is my daughter  lacrimosa .      agnes met the gaze of a thin girl in a white dress  with very long black hair and far too much eye makeup .  there is such a thing as hate at first sight .      the count was just telling me how he is planning to move into the castle and rule the country     said verence .     and i was saying that i think we shall be honored .         well done     said nanny .     but it you don   t mind  i don   t want to miss the weasel man           the trouble is that people always think of vampires in terms of their diet     said the count  as nanny hurried away .     it   s really rather insulting .  you eat animal flesh and vegetables  but it hardly defines you  does it .      verence   s face was contorted in a smile  but it looked glassy and unreal .      but you do drink human blood .     he said .      of course .  and sometimes we kill people  although hardly at all these days .  in any case  where exactly is the harm in that .  prey and hunter  hunter and prey .  the sheep was designed as dinner for the wolf  the wolf as a means of preventing overgrazing by the sheep .  if you examine your teeth  sire  you   ll see that they are designed for a particular kind of diet and  indeed  your whole body is constructed to take advantage of it .  and so it is with us .  i   m sure the nuts and cabbages do not blame you .  hunter and prey are all just part of the great cycle of life .         fascinating     said verence .  little beads of sweat were rolling down his face .      of course  in uberwald everyone understands this instinctively     said the countess .     but it is rather a backward place for the children .  we are so looking forward to lancre .         very glad to hear it     said verence     and so kind of you to invite us     she went on .     otherwise we could not have come  of course .         not exactly     said the count  beaming at his wife .     but i have to admit that the prohibition against entering places uninvited has proved curiously   durable .  it must be something to do with ancient territorial instincts .  but     he added brightly     i have been working on an instructional technique which i   m sure will  within a few years           oh  don   t let   s go through all that dull stuff again     said lacri mosa .      yes  i suppose it can sound a little tedious     said the count  smiling benevolently at his daughter .     has anyone any more of that wonderful garlic dip .      the king still looked uneasy  agnes noticed .  which was odd  because the count and his family seemed absolutely charming and what they were saying made perfect sense .  everything was perfectly all right .      exactly     said vlad  beside her .     do you dance  miss nitt .     on the other side of the hall  the lancre light symphony orchestra  cond .  s .  ogg  was striking up and out at random .      ur       she stopped it turning into a giggle .     not really .  not very well        didn   t you listen to what they were saying .  they   re vampires .      shut up     she said aloud .      i beg your pardon .     said vlad  looking puzzled .      and they   re   well  they   re not a very good orchestra        didn   t you pay any attention to what they were saying at all  you useless lump .      they   re a very bad orchestra     said vlad .      well  the king only bought the instruments last month and basically they   re trying to learn together        chop his head off .  give him a garlic enema .      are you all right .  you really know there are no vampires here  don   t you        he   s controlling you .  perdita screamed .  they   re   affecting people .      i   m a bit   faint from all the excitement     agnes mumbled .     i think i   ll go home .     some instinct at bone marrow level made her add     i   ll ask nanny to go with me .      vlad gave her an odd look  as if she wasn   t reacting in quite the right way .  then he smiled .  agnes noticed that he had very white teeth .      i don   t think i   ve ever met anyone like you  miss nitt     he said .     there   s something so   inner about you .      that   s me .  that   s me .  he can   t work me out .  now let   s both get out of here .  yelled perdita .      but we shall meet again .      agnes gave him a nod and staggered away  clutching at her head .  it felt like a ball of cotton wool in which there was  inexplicably  a needle .   she passed mightily oats  who   d dropped his book on the floor and was sitting groaning with his head in his hands .  he raised it to look at her .      er   miss  have you anything that might help my head .     he said .     it really is   rather painful           the queen makes up some sort of headache pills out of willow bark     agnes panted  and hurried on .   nanny ogg was standing morosely with a pint in her hand  a hitherto unheard of combination .      the weasel juggler didn   t turn up     she said .     well  i   m going to put out the hard word on him .  he   s had it in showbusiness in these parts .         could you   help me home  nanny .         so what if he got bitten on the essentials  that   s all part of   are you all right .         i feel really awful  nanny .         let   s go  then .  all the good beer   s gone and i   m not stoppin    anyway if there   s nothin    to laugh at .      the wind was whistling across the sky when they walked back to agnes   s cottage .  in fact there seemed more whistle than wind .  the leafless trees creaked as they passed  the weak moonlight filling the eaves of the woods with dangerous shadows .  clouds were piling in  and there was more rain on the way .   agnes noticed nanny pick up something as they left the town behind them .   it was a stick .  she   d never known a witch to carry a stick at night before .      why have you got that  nanny .         what .  oh .  dunno  really .  it   s a rattly old night  ain   t it    .         but you   re never frightened of anything in lan        several things pushed through the bushes and clattered onto the road ahead .  for a moment agnes thought they were horses  until the moonlight caught them .  then they were gone  into the shadows on the other side of the road .  she heard galloping among the trees .      haven   t seen any of those for a long time     said nanny .      i   ve never seen centaurs at all except in pictures     said agnes .      must   ve come down out of uberwald     said nanny .     nice to see them about again .      agnes hurriedly lit the candles when she got into the cottage  and wished there were bolts on the door .      just sit down     said nanny     i   ll get a cup of water  i know my way around here .         it   s all right  i        agnes   s left arm twitched .  to her horror it swung at the elbow and waved its hand up and down in front of her face  as if guided by a mind of its own .      feeling a bit warm  are you .     said nanny .      i   ll get the water .     panted agnes .   she rushed into the kitchen  gripping her left wrist with her right hand .  it shook itself free  grabbed a knife from the draining board  and stabbed it into the wall  dragging it so that it formed crude letters in the crumbling plaster   vmpir  it dropped the knife  grabbed at the hair on the back of agnes   s head  and thrust her face within inches of the letters .      you all right in there .     nanny called from the next room .      er  yes  but i think i   m trying to tell me something        a movement made her turn .  a small blue man wearing a blue cap was staring at her from the shelves over the washcopper .  he stuck out his tongue  made a very small obscene gesture  and disappeared behind a bag of washing crystals .      nanny .         yes  luv .         are there such things as blue mice .         not while you   re sober  dear .         i think   i   m owed a drink  then .  is there any brandy left .      nanny came in  uncorking the flask .      i topped it up at the party .  of course  it   s only shop bought stuff  you couldn   t        agnes   s left hand snatched it and poured it down her throat .  then she coughed so hard that some of it went up her nose .      hang on  hang on  it   s not that weak     said nanny .   agnes plonked the flask down on the kitchen table .      right     she said  and her voice sounded quite different to nanny     my name is perdita and i   m taking over this body right now .          hodgesaargh noticed the smell of burnt wood as he ambled back to the mews but put it down to the bonfire in the courtyard .  he   d left the party early .  no one had wanted to talk about hawks .   the smell was very strong when he looked in on the birds and saw the little flame in the middle of the floor .  he stared at it for a second  then picked up a water bucket and threw it .   the flame continued to flicker gently on a bare stone that was awash with water .   hodgesaargh looked at the birds .  they were watching it with interest  normally they   d be frantic in the presence of fire .   hodgesaargh was never one to panic .  he watched it for a while  and then took a piece of wood and gently touched it to the flame .  the fire leapt on to the wood and went on burning .   the wood didn   t even char .   he found another twig and brushed it against the flame  which slid easily from one to the other .  there was one flame .  it was clear there wasn   t going to be two .   half the bars in the window had been burned away  and there was some scorched wood at the end of the mews  where the old nestboxes had been .  above it  a few stars shone through rags of mist over a charred hole in the roof .   something had burned here  hodgesaargh saw .  fiercely  by the look of it .  but also in a curiously local way  as if all the heat had been somehow contained     he reached toward the flame dancing on the end of the stick .  it was warm  but   not as hot as it should be .   now it was on his finger .  it tingled .  as he waved it around  the head of every bird turned to watch it .   by its light  he poked around in the charred remains of the nestboxes .  in the ashes were bits of broken eggshell .   hodgesaargh picked them up and carried them into the crowded little room at the end of the mews which served as workshop and bedroom .  he balanced the flame on a saucer .  in here  where it was quieter  he could hear it making a slight sizzling noise .   in the dim glow he looked along the one crowded bookshelf over his bed and pulled down a huge ragged volume on the cover of which someone had written  centuries ago  the word    burds .      the book was a huge ledger .  the spine had been cut and widened inexpertly several times so that more pages could be pasted in .   the falconers of lancre knew a lot about birds .  the kingdom was on a main migratory route between the hub and the rim .  the hawks had brought down many strange species over the centuries and the falconers had  very painstakingly  taken notes .  the pages were thick with drawings and closely spaced writing  the entries copied and recopied and updated over the years .  the occasional feather carefully glued to a page had added to the thickness of the thing .   no one had ever bothered with an index  but some past falconer had considerately arranged many of the entries into alphabetical order .   hodgesaargh glanced again at the flame burning steadily in its saucer  and then  handing the crackling pages with care  turned to    f .      after some browsing  he eventually found what he was looking for under    p .      back in the mews  in the deepest shadow  something cowered .       there were three shelves of books in agnes   s cottage .  by witch standards  that was a giant library .   two very small blue figures lay on the top of the books  watching the scene with interest .   nanny ogg backed away  waving the poker .      it   s all right     said agnes .     it   s me again  agnes nitt  but   she   s here but   i   m sort of holding on .  yes .  yes .  all right .  all right  just shut up  will y   look  it   s my body  you   re just a figment of my imagina   okay .  okay .  perhaps it   s not quite so clear c   let me just talk to nanny  will you .         which one are you now .     said nanny ogg .      i   m still agnes  of course .     she rolled her eyes up .     all right .  i   m agnes currently being advised by perdita  who is also me .  in a way .  and i   m not too fat  thank you so very much .         how many of you are there in there .     said nanny .      what do you mean     room for ten    .     shouted agnes .     shut up .  listen  perdita says there were vampires at the party .  the magpyr family  she says .  she can   t understand how we acted .  they were putting a kind of      fluence over everyone .  including me  which is why she was able to break thr   yes  all right  i   m telling it  thank you .         why not her  then .     said nanny .      because she   s got a mind of her own .  nanny  can you remember anything they actually said .         now you come to mention it  no .  but they seemed nice enough people .         and you remember talking to igor .         who   s igor .      the tiny blue figures watched  fascinated  for the next half hour .   nanny sat back at the end of it and stared at the ceiling for a while .      why should we believe her .     she said eventually .      because she   s me .         they do say that inside every fat girl is a thin girl and       nanny began .      yes     said agnes bitterly .     i   ve heard it .  yes .  she   s the thin girl .  i   m the lot of chocolate .      nanny leaned toward agnes   s ear and raised her voice .     how   re you gettin    on in there .  everything all right  is it .  treatin    you all right  is she .         haha  nanny .  very funny .         they were saying all this stuff about drinkin    blood and killin    people and everyone was just noddin    and sayin        well  well  how very fascinatin    .         yes .         and eatin    garlic .         yes .         that can   t be right  can it .         i don   t know  perhaps we used the wrong sort of garlic .      nanny rubbed her chin  torn between the vampiric revelation and prurient curiosity about perdita .      how does perdita work  then .     she said .   agnes sighed .     look  you know the part of you that wants to do all the things you don   t dare do  and thinks the thoughts you don   t dare think .      nanny   s face stayed blank .  agnes floundered .     like   maybe   rip off all your clothes and run naked in the rain .     she hazarded .      oh yes .  right     said nanny .      well   i suppose perdita is that part of me .         really .  i   ve always been that part of me     said nanny .     the important thing is to remember where you left your clothes .      agnes remembered too late that nanny ogg was in many ways a very uncomplicated personality .      mind you  i think i know what you mean     nanny went on in a more thoughtful voice .     there   s times when i   ve wanted to do things and stopped meself       she shook her head .     but   vampires   verence wouldn   t be so stupid as to send an invitation to vampires  would he .     she paused for thought .     yes  he would .  prob   ly think of it as offering the hand of friendship .      she stood up .     right  they won   t have left yet .  let   s get straight to the jelly .  you get extra garlic and a few stakes  i   ll round up shawn and jason and the lads .         it won   t work  nanny .  perdita saw what they can do .  the moment you get near them  you   ll forget all about it .  they do something to your mind  nanny .      nanny hesitated .      can   t say i know that much about vampires     she said .      perdita thinks they can tell what you   re thinking too .         then this is esme   s type of stuff     said nanny .     messing with minds and so on .  it   s meat and drink to her .         nanny  they were talking about staying .  we have to do something .         well  where is she .     nanny almost wailed .     esme ought to be sortin    this out .         maybe they   ve got to her first .         you don   t think so  do you .     said nanny  now looking quite panicky .     i can   t think about a vampire getting his teeth into esme .         don   t worry  dog doesn   t eat dog .     it was perdita who blurted it out  but it was agnes who got the blow .  it wasn   t a ladylike slap of disapproval .  nanny ogg had reared some strapping sons  the ogg forearm was a power in its own right .   when agnes looked up from the hearthrug nanny was rubbing some life back into her hand .  she gave agnes a solemn look .      we   ll say no more about that  shall we .     she commanded .     i ain   t gen   rally given to physicality of that nature but it saves a lot of arguing .  now  we   re goin    back to the castle .  we   re going to sort this out right now .          hodgesaargh shut the book and looked at the flame .  it was true  then .  there   d even been a picture of one just like it in the book  painstakingly drawn by another royal falconer two hundred years before .  he wrote that he   d found the thing up on the high meadows  one spring .  it   d burned for three years  and then he   d lost it somewhere .   if you looked at it closely  you could even see the detail .  it was not exactly a flame .  it was more like a bright feather     well  lancre was on one of the main migration routes  for birds of all sorts .  it was only a matter of time .   so   the new hatchling was around .  they needed time to grow  it said in the book .  odd that it should lay an egg here  because it said in the book that it was always hatched in the burning deserts of klatch .   he went and looked at the birds in the mews .  they were still very alert .   yes  it all made sense .  it had flown in here  among the comfort of other birds  and laid its egg  just like it said it did in the book  and then it had burned itself up to hatch the new bird .   if hodgesaargh had a fault  it lay in his rather utilitarian view of the bird world .  there were birds that you hunted  and there were birds you hunted with .  oh  there were other sorts  tweeting away in the bushes  but they didn   t really count .  it occurred to him that if ever there was a bird you could hunt with  it   d be the phoenix .   oh yes .  it   d be weak  and young  and it wouldn   t have gone far .   hmm   birds tended to think the same way  after all .   it would have helped if there was one picture in the book .  in fact  there were several  all carefully drawn by ancient falconers who claimed it was a firebird they   d seen .   apart from the fact that they all had wings and a beak  no two were remotely alike .  one looked very much like a heron .  another looked like a goose .  one  and he scratched his head about this  appeared to be a sparrow .  bit of a puzzle  he decided  and left it at that and selected a drawing that looked at least slightly foreign .   he glanced at the bird gloves hanging on their hooks .  he was good at rearing young birds .  he could get them eating out of his hand .  later on  of course  they just ate his hand .   yes .  catch it young and train it to the wrist .  it   d have to be a champion hunting bird .   hodgesaargh couldn   t imagine a phoenix as quarry .  for one thing  how could you cook it .      and in darkest corner of the mews  something hopped onto a perch         once again agnes had to run to keep up as nanny ogg strode into the courtyard  elbows pumping furiously .  the old lady marched up to a group of men standing around one of the barrels and grabbed two of them  spilling their drinks .  had it not been nanny ogg  this would have been a challenge equal to throwing down a glove or  in slightly less exalted circles  smashing a bottle on the edge of a bar .   but the men looked sheepish and one or two of the others in the circle even scuffled their feet and made an attempt to hide their pints behind their backs .      jason .  darren .  you come along of me     nanny commanded .     we   re after vampires  right .  any sharp stakes around here .         no  mum     said jason  lancre   s only blacksmith .  then he raised his hand .     but ten minutes ago the cook come out and said  did anyone want all these nibbly things that someone had mucked up with garlic and i et    em  mum .      nanny sniffed  and then took a step back  fanning her hand in front of her face .     yeah  that should do it all right     she said .     if i give you the signal  you   re to burp hugely  understand .         i don   t think it   ll work  nanny     said agnes  as boldly as she dared .      i don   t see why  it   s nearly knocking me down .         i told you  you won   t get close enough  even if it   ll work at all .  perdita could feel it .  it   s like being drunk .         i   ll be ready for    em this time     said nanny .     i   ve learned a thing or two from esme .         yes  but she   s       agnes was going to say    better at them than you     but changed it to    not here           that   s as may be  but i   d rather face    em now than explain to esme that i didn   t .  come on .      agnes followed the oggs  but very uneasily .  she wasn   t sure how far she trusted perdita .   a few guests had departed  but the castle had laid on a pretty good feast and ramtop people at any social level were never ones to pass up a laden table .   nanny glanced at the crowd and grabbed shawn  who was passing with a tray .      where   s the vampires .         what  mum .         that count   magpie           magpyr     said agnes .      him     said nanny .      he   s not a   he   s gone up to   the solar  mum .  they all have   what   s that smell of garlic  mum .         it   s your brother .  all right  let   s keep going .      the solar was right at the top of the keep .  it was old  cold and drafty .  verence had put glass in the huge windows  at his queen   s insistence  which just meant that now the huge room attracted the more cunning  insidious kind of draft .  but it was the royal room   not as public as the great hall  but the place where the king received visitors when he was being formally informal .   the nanny ogg expeditionary force corkscrewed up the spiral staircase .  she advanced across the good yet threadbare carpet to the group seated around the fire .   she took a deep breath .      ah  mrs ogg     said verence  desperately .     do join us .      agnes looked sideways at nanny  and saw her face contort into a strange smile .   the count was sitting in the big chair by the fire  with vlad standing behind him .  they both looked very handsome  she thought .  compared to them verence  in his clothes that never seemed to fit right and permanently harassed expression  looked out of place .      the count was just explaining how lancre will become a duchy of his lands in uberwald     said verence .     but we   ll still be referred to as a kingdom  which i think is very reasonable of him  don   t you agree .         very handsome suggestion     said nanny .      there will be taxes  of course     said the count .     not onerous .  we don   t want blood   figuratively speaking .     he beamed at the joke .      seems reasonable to me     said nanny .      it is  isn   t it     said the count  beaming .     i knew it would work out so well .  and i am so pleased  verence  to see your essential modern attitude .  people have quite the wrong idea about vampires  you see .  are we fiendish killers .     he beamed at them .     well  yes  of course we are .  but only when necessary .  frankly  we could hardly hope to rule a country if we went around killing everyone all the time  could we .  there   d be none left to rule  for one thing .     there was polite laughter  loudest of all from the count .   it made perfect sense to agnes .  the count was clearly a fair minded man .  anyone who didn   t think so deserved to die .      and we are only human     said the countess .     well   in fact  not only human .  but if you prick us do we not bleed .  which always seems such a waste .      they   ve got you again  said a voice in her mind .   vlad   s head jerked up .  agnes felt him staring at her .      we are  above all  up to date     said the count .     and we do like what you   ve done to this castle  i must say .         oh  those torches back home .     said the countess  rolling her eyes .     and some of the things in the dungeons  well  when i saw them i nearly died of shame .  so   fifteen centuries ago .  if one is a vampire then one is     she gave a deprecating little laugh     a vampire .  coffins  yes  of course  but there   s no point in skulking around as if you   re ashamed of what you are  is there .  we all have   needs .      you   re all standing around like rabbits in front of a fox .  perdita raged in the caverns of agnes   s brain .      oh .     said the countess  clapping her hands together .     i see you have a pianoforte .      it stood under a shroud in a corner of the room where it had stood for four months now .  verence had ordered it because he   d heard they were very modern  but the only person in the kingdom who   d come close to mastering it was nanny ogg who would  as she put it  come up occasionally for a tinkle on the ivories .   then it had been covered over on the orders of magrat and the palace rumor was that verence had got an ear bashing for buying what was effectively a murdered elephant .      lacrimosa would so like to play for you     the countess commanded .      oh  mother     said lacrimosa .      i   m sure we should love it     said verence .  agnes wouldn   t have noticed the sweat running down his face if perdita hadn   t pointed it out  he   s trying to fight it  she said .  aren   t you glad you   ve got me .   there was some bustling while a wad of sheet music was pulled out of the piano stool and the young lady sat down to play .  she glared at agnes before beginning .  there was some sort of chemistry there  although it was the sort that results in the entire building being evacuated .   it   s a racket  said the perdita within  after the first few bars .  everyone   s looking as though it   s wonderful but it   s a din .   agnes concentrated .  the music was beautiful but if she really paid attention  with perdita nudging her  it wasn   t really there at all .  it sounded like someone playing scales  badly and angrily .   i can say that at any time  she thought .  any time i want  i can just wake up .   everyone else applauded politely .  agnes tried to  but found that her left hand was suddenly on strike .  perdita was getting stronger in her left arm .   vlad was beside her so quickly that she wasn   t even aware that he   d moved .      you are a   fascinating woman  miss nitt     he said .     such lovely hair  may i say .  but who is perdita .         no one  really     agnes mumbled .  she fought against the urge to bunch her left hand into a fist .  perdita was screaming at her again .   vlad stroked a strand of her hair .  it was  she knew  good hair .  it wasn   t simply big hair  it was enormous hair  as if she was trying to counterbalance her body .  it was glossy  it never split  and was extremely well behaved except for a tendency to eat combs .      eat combs .     said vlad  coiling the hair around his finger .      yes  it        he can see what you   re thinking .   vlad looked puzzled again  like someone trying to make out some faint noise .      you   can resist  can   t you     he said .     i was watching you when lacci was playing the piano and losing .  do you have any vampire blood in you .         what .  no .         it could be arranged  haha .     he grinned .  it was the sort of grin that agnes supposed was called infectious but  then  so was measles .  it filled her immediate future .  something was pouring over her like a pink fluffy cloud saying  it   s all right  everything is fine  this is exactly right        look at mrs .  ogg there     said vlad .     grinning like a pumpkin  ain   t she .  and she is apparently one of the more powerful witches in the mountains .  it   s almost distressing  don   t you think .      tell him you know he can read minds  perdita commanded .   and again  the puzzled  quizzical look .      you can       agnes began .      no  not exactly .  just people     said vlad .     one learns  one learns .  one picks things up .     he flung himself down on a sofa  one leg over the arm  and stared thoughtfully at her .      things will be changing  agnes nitt     he said .     my father is right .  why lurk in dark castles .  why be ashamed .  we   re vampires .  or  rather  vampyres .  father   s a bit keen on the new spelling .  he says it indicates a clean break with a stupid and superstitious past .  in any case  it   s not our fault .  we were born vampires .         i thought you became              vampires by being bitten .  dear me  no .  oh  we can turn people into vampires  it   s an easy technique  but what would be the point .  when you eat   now what is it you eat .  oh yes  chocolate   you don   t want to turn it into another agnes nitt  do you .  less chocolate to go around .     he sighed .     oh dear  superstition  superstition everywhere we turn .  isn   t it true that we   ve been here at least ten minutes and your neck is quite free of anything except a small amount of soap you didn   t wash off .      agnes   s hand flew to her throat .      we notice these things     said vlad .     and now we   re here to notice them .  oh  father is powerful in his way  and quite an advanced thinker  but i don   t think even he is aware of the possibilities .  i can   t tell you how good it is to be out of that place  miss nitt .  the werewolves   oh dear  the werewolves   marvelous people  it goes without saying  and of course the baron has a certain rough style  but really   give them a good deer hunt  a warm spot in front of the fire and a nice big bone and the rest of the world can go hang .  we have done our best  we really have .  no one has done more than father to bring our part of the country into the century of the fruitbat           it   s nearly over       agnes began .      perhaps that   s why he   s so keen     said vlad .     the place is just full of   well  remnants .  i mean   centaurs .  really .  they   ve got no business surviving .  they   re out of place .  and frankly all the lower races are just as bad .  the trolls are stupid  the dwarfs are devious  the pixies are evil and the gnomes stick in your teeth .  time they were gone .  driven out .  we have great hopes of lancre .     he looked around disdainfully .     after some redecoration .      agnes looked back at nanny and her sons .  they were listening quite contentedly to the worst music since shawn ogg   s bagpipes had been dropped down the stairs .      and   you   re taking our country .     she said .     just like that .      vlad gave her another smile  stood up  and walked toward her .     oh yes .  bloodlessly .  well   metaphorically .  you really are quite remarkable  miss nitt .  the uberwald girls are so sheep like .  but you   you   re concealing something from me .  everything i feel tells me you   re quite under my power   and yet you   re not .     he chuckled .     this is delightful        agnes felt her mind unraveling .  the pink fog was blowing through her head        and looming out of it  deadly and mostly concealed  was the iceberg of perdita .   as agnes withdrew into the pinkness she felt the tingle spread down her arms and legs .  it was not pleasant .  it was like sensing someone standing right behind you  and then feeling them take one step forward .   agnes would have pushed him away .  that is  agnes would have dithered and tried to talk her way out of things  but if push had come to shove then she   d have pushed hard .  but perdita struck  and when her hand was halfway around she turned it palm out and curled her fingers to bring her nails into play     he caught her wrist  his hand moving in a blur .      well done     he said  laughing .   his other hand shot out and caught her other arm as it swung .      i like a woman with spirit .      however  he had run out of hands  and perdita still had a knee in reserve .  vlad   s eyes crossed and he made that small sound best recorded as    ghni           magnificent .     he croaked as he folded up .   perdita pulled herself away and ran over to nanny ogg  grabbing the woman   s arm .      nanny  we are leaving .         are we  dear .     said nanny calmly  not making a move .      and jason and darren too .      perdita didn   t read as much as agnes .  she thought books were boring .  but now she really needed to know  what did you use against vampires .   holy symbols .  agnes prompted from within .   perdita looked around desperately .  nothing in the room looked particularly holy .  religion  apart from its use as a sort of cosmic registrar  had never caught on in lancre .      daylight is always good  my dear     said the countess  who must have caught the edge of her thought .     your uncle always had big windows and easily twitched aside curtains  didn   t he  count .         yes indeed     said the count .      and when it came to running water  he always kept the moat flowing perfectly  didn   t he .         fed from a mountain stream  i think     said the count .      and  for a vampire  he always seemed to have so many ornamental items around the castle that could be bent or broken into the shape of some religious symbol  as i recall .         he certainly did .  a vampire of the old school .         yes .     the countess gave her husband a smile .     the stupid school .     she turned to perdita and looked her up and down .     so i think you will find we are here to stay  my dear .  although you do seem to have made an impression on my son .  come here  girl .  let me have a good look at you .      even cushioned inside her own head agnes felt the weight of the vampire   s will hit perdita like an iron bar  pushing her down .  like the other end of a seesaw  agnes rose .      where   s magrat .  what have you done with her .     she said .      putting the baby to bed  i believe     said the countess  raising her eyebrows .     a lovely child .         granny weatherwax is going to hear about this  and you   ll wish you   d never been born   or un born or re born or whatever you are .         we look forward to meeting her     said the count calmly .     but here we are  and i don   t seem to see this famous lady with us .  perhaps you should go and fetch her .  you could take your friends .  and when you see her  miss nitt  you can tell her that there is no reason why witches and vampires should fight .      nanny ogg stirred .  jason shifted in his seat .  agnes pulled them upright and toward the stairs .      we   ll be back .     she shouted .   the count nodded .      good     he said .     we are famous for our hospitality .          it was still dark when hodgesaargh set out .  if you were hunting a phoenix  he reasoned  the dark was probably the best time .  light showed up better in the darkness .   he   d packed a portable wire cage after considering the charred bars of the window  and he   d also spent some time on the glove .   it was basically a puppet  made of yellow cloth with some purple and blue rags tacked on .  it was not  he conceded  very much like the drawing of the phoenix  but in his experience birds weren   t choosy observers .   newly hatched birds were prepared to accept practically anything as their parent .  anyone who   d hatched eggs under a broody hen knew that ducklings could be made to think they were chicks  and poor william the buzzard was a case in point .   the fact that a young phoenix never saw its parent and therefore didn   t know what it was supposed to look like might be a drawback in getting its trust  but this was unknown territory and hodgesaargh was prepared to try anything .  like bait  for example .  he   d packed meat and grain  although the drawing certainly suggested a hawk like bird  but in case it needed to eat inflammable materials as well he also put in a bag of moth balls and a pint of fish oil .  nets were out of the question  and bird lime was not to be thought of .  hodgesaargh had his pride .  anyway  they probably wouldn   t work .   since anything might be worth trying  he   d also adapted a duck lure  trying to achieve a sound described by a long dead falconer as    like unto the cry of a buzzard yet of a lower pitch .     he wasn   t too happy about the result but  on the other hand  maybe a young phoenix didn   t know what a phoenix was meant to sound like  either .  it might work  and if he didn   t try it  he   d always be wondering .   he set out .   soon a cry like a duck in a power dive was heard among the damp  dark hills .       the pre dawn light was gray on the horizon and a shower of sleet had made the leaves sparkle when granny weatherwax left her cottage .  there had been so much to do .   what she   d chosen to take with her was slung in a sack tied across her back with string .  she   d left the broomstick in the corner by the fire .   she wedged the door open with a stone and then  without once looking back  strode off through the woods .   down in the villages  the cocks crowed in response to a sunrise hidden somewhere beyond the clouds .   an hour later  a broomstick settled gently on the lawn .  nanny ogg got off and hurried to the back door .   her foot kicked something holding it open .  she glared at the stone as if it was something dangerous  and then edged around it and into the gloom of the cottage .   she came out a few minutes later  looking worried .   her next move was toward the water butt .  she broke the film of ice with her hand and pulled out a piece  looked at it for a moment  and then tossed it away .   people often got the wrong idea about nanny ogg  and she took care to see that they did .  one thing they often got wrong was the idea that she never thought further than the bottom of the glass .   up in a nearby tree  a magpie chattered at her .  she threw a stone at it .   agnes arrived half an hour later .  she preferred to go on foot whenever possible .  she suspected that she overhung too much .   nanny ogg was sitting on a chair just inside the door  smoking her pipe .  she took it out of her mouth and nodded .      she   s gorn     she said .      gone .  just when we need her .     said agnes .     what do you mean .         she ain   t here     nanny expanded .      perhaps she   s just out .     said agnes .      gorn     said nanny .     these past two hours  if i   m any judge .         how do you know that .      once   probably even yesterday   nanny would have alluded vaguely to magical powers .  it was a measure of her concern that  today  she got right to the jelly .      first thing she does in the mornings  rain or shine  is wash her face in the water butt     she said .     someone broke the ice two hours ago .  you can see where it   s frozed over again .         oh  is that all .     said agnes .     well   perhaps she   s got business           you come and see     said nanny  standing up .   the kitchen was spotless .  every flat surface had been scrubbed .  the fireplace had been swept and a new fire laid .   most of the cottage   s smaller contents had been laid out on the table .  there were three cups  three plates  three knives  a cleaver  three forks  three spoons  two ladles  a pair of scissors and three candlesticks .  a wooden box was packed with needles and thread and pins     if it was possible for anything to be polished  it had been .  someone had even managed to buff up a shine on the old pewter candlesticks .   agnes felt the little knot of tension grow inside her .  witches didn   t own much .  the cottage owned things .  they were not yours to take away .   this looked like an inventory .   behind her  nanny ogg was opening and shutting drawers in the ancient dresser .      she   s left it all neat     nanny said .     she   s even chipped all the rust off the kettle .  the larder   s all bare except for some hobnailed cheese and suicide biscuits .  it   s the same in the bedroom .  her    i ate   nt dead    card is hanging behind the door .  and the guzunda   s so clean you could eat your tea out of it  if the fancy took you that way .  and she   s taken the box out of the dresser .         what box .         oh  she keeps stuff in it     said nanny .     memororabililia .         mem    .         you know   keepsakes and whatnot .  stuff that   s hers           what   s this .     said agnes  holding up a green glass ball .      oh  magrat passed that on to her     said nanny  lifting up a corner of the rug and peering under it .     it   s a float our wayne brought back from the seaside once .  it   s a buoy for the fishing nets .         i didn   t know buoys had glass balls     said agnes .   she groaned inwardly  and felt the blush unfold .  but nanny hadn   t noticed .  it was then she realized how really serious this was .  nanny would normally leap on such a gift like a cat on a feather .  nanny could find an innuendo in    good morning .     she could certainly find one in    innuendo .     and    buoys with glass balls    should have lasted her all week .  she   d be accosting total strangers and saying     you   ll never guess what agnes nitt said        she ventured    i said           dunno much about fishing  really     said nanny .  she straightened up  biting her thumbnail thoughtfully .     something   s wrong with all this     she said .     the box   she wasn   t going to leave anything behind           granny wouldn   t go  would she .     said agnes nervously .     i mean  not actually leave .  she   s always here .         like i told you last night  she   s been herself lately     said nanny  vaguely .  she sat down in the rocking chair .      you mean she   s not been herself  don   t you .     said agnes .      i knows exactly what i means  girl .  when she   s herself she snaps at people and sulks and makes herself depressed .  ain   t you ever heard of taking people out of themselves .  now shut up     cos i   m thinkin    .      agnes looked down at the green ball in her hands .  a glass fishing float  five hundred miles from the sea .  an ornament  like a shell .  not a crystal ball .  you could use it like a crystal ball but it wasn   t a crystal ball   and she knew why that was important .   granny was a very traditional witch .  witches hadn   t always been popular .  there might even be times   there had been times  long ago   when it was a good idea not to advertise what you were  and that was why all these things on the table didn   t betray their owner at all .  there was no need for that anymore  there hadn   t been in lancre for hundreds of years  but some habits get passed down in the blood .   in fact things now worked the other way .  being a witch was an honorable trade in the mountains  but only the young ones invested in real crystal balls and colored knives and dribbly candles .  the old ones   they stuck with simple kitchen cutlery  fishing floats  bits of wood  whose very ordinariness subtly advertised their status .  any fool could be a witch with a runic knife  but it took skill to be one with an apple corer .   a sound she hadn   t been hearing stopped abruptly  and the silence echoed .   nanny glanced up .      clock   s stopped     she said .      it   s not even telling the right time     said agnes  turning to look at it .      oh  she just kept it for the tick     said nanny .   agnes put down the glass ball .      i   m going to look around some more     she said .   she learned to look around when she visited someone   s home  because in one way it was a piece of clothing and had grown to fit their shape .  it might show not just what they   d been doing  but what they   d been thinking .  you might be visiting someone who expected you to know everything about everything  and in those circumstances you took every advantage you could get .   someone had told her that a witch   s cottage was her second face .  come to think of it  it had been granny .   it should be easy to read this place .  granny   s thoughts had the strength of hammer blows and they   d pounded her personality into the walls .  if her cottage had been any more organic it would have had a pulse .   agnes wandered through to the dank little scullery .  the copper wash pot had been scoured .  a fork and a couple of shining spoons lay beside it  along with the washboard and scrubbing brush .  the slop bucket gleamed  although the fragments of a broken cup in the bottom said that the recent intensive housework hadn   t been without its casualties .   she pushed open the door into the old goat shed .  granny was not keeping goats at the moment  but her homemade beekeeping equipment was neatly laid out on a bench .  she   d never needed much .  if you needed smoke and a veil to deal with your bees  what was the point of being a witch .   bees     a moment later she was out in the garden  her ear pressed against a beehive .   there were no bees flying this early in the day  but the sound inside was a roar .      they   ll know     said a voice behind her .  agnes stood up so quickly she bumped her head on the hive roof .      but they won   t say     nanny added .     she   d have told    em .  well done for thinkin    about    em  though .      something chattered at them from a nearby branch .  it was a magpie .      good morning  mister magpie     said agnes automatically .      bugger off  you bastard     said nanny  and reached down for a stick to throw .  the bird swooped off to the other side of the clearing .      that   s bad luck     said agnes .      it will be if i get a chance to aim     said nanny .     can   t stand those maggoty pies .            one for sorrow        said agnes  watching the bird hop along a branch .      i always take the view there   s prob   ly going to be another one along in a minute     said nanny  dropping a stick .         two for joy    .     said agnes .      it   s    two for mirth .            same thing  i suppose .         dunno about that     said nanny .     i was joyful when our jason was born  but i can   t say i was laughin    at the time .  come on  let   s have another look .      two more magpies landed on the cottage   s antique thatch .      that   s    three for a girl          said agnes nervously .         three for a funeral    is what i learned     said nanny .     but there   s lots of magpie rhymes .  look  you take her broomstick and have a look over toward the mountains  and i   ll           wait     said agnes .   perdita was screaming at her to pay attention .  she listened .   threes     three spoons .  three knives .  three cups .   the broken cup thrown away .   she stood still  afraid that if she moved or breathed something awful would happen .   the clock had stopped        nanny .      nanny ogg was wise enough to recognize that something was happening and didn   t waste time on daft questions .      yes .     she said .      go in and tell me what time the clock stopped at  will you .      nanny nodded and trotted off .   the tension in agnes   s head stretched out thin and made a noise like a plucked string .  she was amazed that the whine from it couldn   t be heard all round the garden .  if she moved  if she tried to force things  it   d snap .   nanny returned .      three o   clock .     said agnes  before she opened her mouth .      just after .         how much after .         two or three minutes           two or three .         three  then .      the three magpies landed together in another tree and chased one another through the branches  chattering loudly .      three minutes after three     said agnes  and felt the tension ease and the words form .     threes  nanny .  she was thinking in threes .  there was another candlestick out in the goat shed  and some cutlery too .  but she only put out threes .         some things were in ones and twos     said nanny  but her voice was edged with doubt .      then she   d only got one or two of them     said agnes .     there were more spoons and things out in the scullery that she   d missed .  i mean that for some reason she wasn   t putting out more than three .         i know for a fact she   s got four cups     said nanny .      three     said agnes .     she must   ve broken one .  the bits are in the slop bucket .      nanny ogg stared at her .     she   s not clumsy  as a rule     she mumbled .  she looked to agnes as though she was trying to avoid some huge and horrible thought .   a gust shook the trees .  a few drops of rain spattered across the garden .      let   s get inside     agnes suggested .   nanny shook her head .     it   s chillier in there than out here     she said .  something skimmed across the leaves and landed on the lawn .  it was a fourth magpie .        four for a birth        she added  apparently to herself .     that   d be it  sure enough .  i hoped she wouldn   t realize  but you can   t get anything past esme .  i   ll tan young shawn   s hide for him when i get home .  he swore he   d delivered that invite .         perhaps she took it away with her .         no .  if she   d got it she   d have been there last night  you can bet on it .     snapped nanny .      what wouldn   t she realize .     said agnes .      magrat   s daughter .         what .  well  i should think she would realize .  you can   t hide a baby .  everyone in the kingdom knows about it .         i mean magrat   s got a daughter .  she   s a mother .     said nanny     well  yes .  that   s how it works .  so .      they were shouting at one another  and they both realized it at the same time .   it was raining harder now .  drips were flying off agnes   s hat every time she moved her head .   nanny recovered a little .     all right  i s   pose between us we   ve got enough sense to get in out of the rain .         and at least we can light the fire     said agnes  as they stepped into the chill of the kitchen .     she   s left it all laid           no .         there   s no need to shout again .         look  don   t light the fire  right .     said nanny .     don   t touch anything more than you have to .         i could easily get more kindling in  and           be told .  that fire wasn   t laid for you to light .  and leave that door alone .      agnes stopped in the act of pushing away the stone .      be sensible  nanny  the rain and leaves are blowing in .         let    em .      nanny flopped into the rocking chair  pulled up her skirt and fumbled in the depths of a lengthy knicker leg until she came up with the spirit flask .  she took a long pull .  her hands were shaking .      i can   t start being a hag at my time of life     she muttered .     none of my bras   ll fit .         nanny .         yes .         what the hell are you going on about .  daughter .  not lighting fires .  hags .      nanny replaced the flask and felt around in the other leg  coming up eventually with her pipe and tobacco pouch .      not sure if i ought to tell you     she said .       now granny weatherwax was well beyond the local woods and high in the forests  following a track used by the charcoal burners and the occasional dwarf .   already lancre was dying away .  she could feel it ebbing from her mind .  down below  when things were quiet  she was always aware of the buzz of minds around her .  human and animal  they all stirred up together in some great mental stew .  but here there were mainly the slow thoughts of the trees  which were frankly boring after the first few hours and could be safely ignored .  snow  still quite thick in the hollows and on the shadow sides of trees  was dissolving in a drizzle of rain .   she stepped into a clearing and a small herd of deer on the far edge raised their heads to watch her .  out of habit she stopped and gently let herself unravel  until from the deer   s point of view there was hardly anyone there .   when she began to walk forward again a deer stepped out of some bushes and stopped and turned to face her .   she   d seen this happen before .  hunters talked about it sometimes .  you could track a herd all day  creeping silently among the trees in search of that one clean shot  and just as you were aiming  a deer would step out right in ffront of you  turn and watch   and wait .  those were the times when a hunter found out how good he was     granny snapped her fingers .  the deer shook itself  and galloped off .   she climbed higher  following the stony bed of a stream .  despite its swiftness  there was a border of ice along its banks .  where it dropped over a series of small waterfalls she turned and looked back down into the bowl of lancre .   it was full of clouds .   a few hundred feet below she saw a black and white magpie skim across the forest roof .   granny turned and scrambled quickly up the dripping  icy rocks and onto the fringes of the moorland beyond .   up here there was more sky .  silence clamped down .  far overhead  an eagle wheeled .   it seemed to be the only other life .  no one ever came up here .  the furze and heather stretched away for a mile between the mountains  unbroken by any path .  it was matted  thorny stuff that would tear unprotected flesh to ribbons .   she sat down on a rock and stared at the unbroken expanse for a while .  then she reached into her sack and took out a thick pair of socks .   and set off  onward and upward .       nanny ogg scratched her nose .  she very seldom looked embarrassed  but there was just a hint of embarrassment about her now .  it was even worse than nanny ogg upset .      i ain   t sure if this is the right time     she said .      look  nanny     said agnes     we need her .  if there   s something i ought to know  then tell me .         it   s this business with   you know   three witches     she said .     the maiden  the mother and              the other one     said agnes .     oh yes  i know that .  but that   s just a bit of superstition  isn   t it .  witches don   t have to come in threes .         oh no .  course not     said nanny .     you can have any number up to about  oh  four or five .         what happens if there   s more  then .  something awful .         bloody great row  usually     said nanny .     over nothin    much .  and then they all goes off and sulks .  witches don   t like being compressed up  much .  but three   sort of   works well .  i don   t have to draw you a picture  do i .         and now magrat   s a mother       said agnes .      ah  well  that   s where it all goes a bit runny     said nanny .     this maiden and mother thing   it   s not as simple as you   d think  see .  now you     she prodded agnes with her pipe     are a maiden .  you are  aren   t you .         nanny .  that   s not the sort of thing people discuss .         well  i knows you are     cos i   d soon hear if you wasn   t     said nanny  the kind of person who discussed that kind of thing all the time .     but that ain   t really important  because it ain   t down to technicalities  see .  now me  i don   t reckon i was ever a maiden ment   ly .  oh  you don   t need to go all red like that .  what about your aunt may over in creel springs .  four kids and she   s still bashful around men .  you got your blush from her .  tell her a saucy joke and if you   re quick you can cook dinner for six on her head .  when you   ve been around for a while  miss  you   ll see that some people   s bodies and heads don   t always work together .         and what   s granny weatherwax  then .     said agnes  and added  a little nastily because the reference to the blush had gone home     ment   ly .         damned if i   ve ever worked that out     said nanny .     but i reckon she sees there   s a new three here .  that bloody invitation must   ve been the last straw .  so she   s gone .     she poked at her pipe .     can   t say i fancy being a crone .  i ain   t the right shape and anyway i don   t know what sound they make .      agnes had a sudden and very clear and horrible mental image of the broken cup .      but granny isn   t a   wasn   t a   i mean  she didn   t look like a       she began .      there   s no point in lookin    at a dog an    sayin    that   s not a dog    cos a dog don   t look like that     said nanny simply .   agnes fell silent .  nanny was right  of course .  nanny was someone   s mum .  it was written all over her .  if you cut her in half  the word    ma    would be all the way through .  some girls were just naturally   mothers .  and some  perdita added  were cut out to be professional maidens .  as for the third  agnes went on  ignoring her own interruption  perhaps it wasn   t so odd that people generally called nanny out for the births and granny for the deaths .      she thinks we don   t need her anymore .         i reckon so .         what is she going to do  then .         dunno .  but if you had three  and now there   s four   well  something   s got to go  hasn   t it .         what about the vampires .  the two of us can   t cope with them .         she   s been telling us there   s three of us     said nanny .      what .  magrat .  but she   s       agnes stopped herself .     she   s no nanny ogg     she said .      well  i sure as hell ain   t an esme weatherwax  if it comes to that     said nanny .     the ment   l stuff is meat and drink to her .  getting inside other heads  puttin    her mind somewhere else   that   s her for tay  right enough .  she   d wipe the smile off that count   s face for him .  from the inside  if i know esme .      they sat and stared glumly at the empty  cold fireplace .      maybe we weren   t always very nice to her     said agnes .  she kept thinking of the broken cup .  she was sure granny weatherwax hadn   t done that accidentally .  she may have thought she   d done it accidentally  but maybe everyone had a perdita inside .  she   d walked around this gloomy cottage  which was as much in tune with her thoughts by now as a dog is with its master  and she   d had three on her mind .  three  three  three        esme didn   t thrive on nice     said nanny ogg .     take her an apple pie and she   ll complain about the pastry .         but people don   t often thank her .  and she does do a lot .         she   s not set up for thanks  neither .  ment   ly .  to tell you the honest truth  there   s always been a bit of the dark in the weatherwaxes  and that   s where the trouble is .  look at old alison weatherwax .         who was she .         her own granny .  went to the bad  they say  just packed up one day and headed for uberwald .  and as for esme   s sister       nanny stopped  and restarted .     anyway  that   s why she   s always standin    behind herself and criticizin    what she   s doing .  some times i reckon she   s terrified she   ll go bad without noticin    .         granny .  but she   s a moral as           oh yes  she is .  but that   s because she   s got granny weather wax glarin    over her shoulder the whole time .      agnes took another look around the spartan room .  now the rain was leaking steadily through the ceiling .  she fancied she could hear the walls settling into the clay .  she fancied she could hear them thinking .      did she know magrat was going to call the baby esme .     she said .      probably .  it   s amazin    what she picks up .         maybe not tactful  when you think about it     said agnes .      what do you mean .  i   d have been honored  if it was me .         perhaps granny thought the name was being passed on .  inherited .         oh .  yes     said nanny .     yes  i can just imagine esme workin    it up to that  when she   s in one of her gloomy moods .         my granny used to say if you   re too sharp you   ll cut yourself     said agnes .   they sat in gray silence for a while  and then nanny ogg said     my own granny has an old country sayin    she always trotted out at times like this           which was    .            bugger off  you little devil  or i   ll chop off your nose and give it to the cat .     of course  that   s not so very helpful at a time like this  i   ll admit .      there was a tinkle behind them .   she turned her head and looked down at the table .      there   s a spoon gone        there was another jangle  this time by the door .   a magpie paused in its attempt to pick the stolen spoon off the doorstep  cocked its head and glared at them with a beady eye .  it just managed to get airborne before nanny   s hat  spinning like a plate  bounced off the doorjamb .      the devils   ll pinch anything that damn well shines       she began .       the count de magpyr looked out of the window at the glow that marked the rising sun .      there you are  you see .     he said  turning back to his family .     morning  and here we are .         you   ve made it overcast     said lacrimosa sullenly .     it   s hardly sunny .         one step at a time  dear  one step at a time     said the count cheerfully .     i just wished to make the point .  today  yes  it is overcast .  but we can build on it .  we can acclimatize .  and one day   the beach           you really are very clever  dear     said the countess .      thank you  my love     said the count  nodding his private agreement .     how are you doing with that cork  vlad .         is this such a good idea  father .     said vlad  struggling with a bottle and a corkscrew .     i thought we did not drink   wine .         i believe it   s time we started .         yuk     said lacrimosa .     i   m not touching that  it   s squeezed from vegetables .         fruit  i think you   ll find     said the count calmly .  he took the bottle from his son and removed the cork .     a fine claret  i understand .  you   ll try some  my dear .      his wife smiled nervously  supporting her husband but slightly against her better judgment .      do we  er  are we  eh  supposed to warm it up .     she said .      room temperature is suggested .         that   s sickening     said lacrimosa .     i don   t know how you can bear it .         try it for your father  dear     said the countess .     quickly  before it congeals .         no  my dear .  wine stays runny .         really .  how very convenient .         vlad .     said the count  pouring a glass .  the son watched nervously .      perhaps it would help if you think of it as grape blood     said his father  as vlad took the wine .     and you  lacci .      she folded her arms resolutely .     huh .         i thought you   d like this sort of thing  dear     said the countess .     it   s the sort of thing your crowd does  isn   t it .         i don   t know what you   re talking about .     said the girl .      oh  staying up until gone noon  and wearing brightly colored clothes  and giving yourselves funny names     said the countess .      like gertrude     sneered vlad .     and pam .  they think it   s cool .      lacrimosa turned on him furiously  nails out .  he caught her wrist  grinning .      that   s none of your business .         lady strigoiul said her daughter has taken to calling herself wendy     said the countess .     i can   t imagine why she   d want to  when hieroglyphica is such a nice name for a girl .  and if i was her mother i   d see to it that she at least wore a bit of eyeliner           yes  but no one drinks wine     said lacrimosa .     only real weirdos who file their teeth blunt drink wine           maladora krvoijac does     said vlad .     or    freda     i should say           no she doesn   t .         what .  she wears a silver corkscrew on a chain round her neck and sometimes there   s even a cork on it .         that   s just a fashion item .  oh  i know she says she   s partial to a drop of port  but really it   s just blood in the glass .  henry actually brought a bottle to a party and she fainted at the smell .         henry .     said the countess .   lacrimosa looked down sulkily .     graven gierachi     she said .      the one who grows his hair short and pretends he   s an accountant     said vlad .      i just hope someone   s told his father  then     said the countess .      be quiet     said the count .     this is all just cultural conditioning  you understand .  please .  i   ve worked hard for this .  all we want is a piece of the day .  is that too much to ask .  and wine is just wine .  there   s nothing mystical about it .  now  take up your glasses .  you too  lacci .  please .  for daddy .         and when you tell    cyril    and    tim    they   ll be so impressed     said vlad to lacrimosa .      shut up .     she hissed .     father  it   ll make me sick .         no  your body will adapt     said the count .     i   ve tried it myself .  a little watery  perhaps  somewhat sour  but quite palatable .  please .         oh well           good     said the count .     now  raise the glasses           le sang nouveau est arriv       said vlad .      carpe diem     said the count .      by the throat     said the countess .      people won   t believe me when i tell them     said lacrimosa .   they swallowed .      there     said count magpyr .     that wasn   t too bad  was it .         a bit chilly     said vlad .      i   ll have a wine warmer installed     said the count .     i   m not an unreasonable vampire .  but within a year  children  i think i can have us quite cured of phenophobia and even capable of a little light salad        lacrimosa turned her back theatrically and made throwing up noises into a vase .         and then  lacci  you   ll be free .  no more lonely days .  no more        vlad was half expecting it  and kept an entirely blank expression as his father whipped a card from his pocket and held it up .      that is the double snake symbol of the djelibeybian water cult     he said calmly .      you see .     said the count excitedly .     you barely flinched .  sacrephobia can be beaten .  i   ve always said so .  the way may have been hard at times           i hated the way you used to leap out in corridors and flick holy water on us     said lacrimosa .      it wasn   t holy at all     said her father .     it was strongly diluted .  mildly devout at worst .  but it made you strong  didn   t it .         i caught colds a lot  i know that .      the count   s hand whipped out of his pocket .   lacrimosa gave a sigh of theatrical weariness .     the all seeing face of the ionians     she said wearily .   the count very nearly danced a jig .      you see .  it has worked .  you didn   t even wince .  and apparently as holy symbols go it   s pretty strong .  isn   t it all worth it .         there   ll have to be something really good to make up for those garlic pillows you used to make us sleep on .      her father took her by the shoulder and turned her toward the window .      will it be enough to know that the world is your oyster .      her forehead wrinkled in perplexity .     why should i want it to be some nasty little sea creature .     she said .      because they get eaten alive     said the count .     unfortunately i doubt if we can find a slice of lemon five hundred miles long  but the metaphor will suffice .      she brightened up  grudgingly .     we ell       she said .      good .  i like to see my little girl smile     said the count .     now   who shall we have for breakfast .         the baby .         no  i think not .     the count pulled a bellpull beside the fireplace .     that would be undiplomatic .  we   re not quite there yet .         well  that apology for a queen looks pretty bloodless .  vlad should have hung on to his fat girl     said lacrimosa .      don   t you start     vlad warned .     agnes is a   very interesting girl .  i feel there is a lot in her .         a lot of her     said lacrimosa .     are you saving her for later .         now  now     said the count .     your own dear mother wasn   t a vampire when i met her           yes  yes  you   ve told us a million times     said lacrimosa  rolling her eyes with the impatience of someone who   d been a teenager for eighty years .     the balcony  the nightdress  you in your cloak  she screamed           things were simpler then     said the count .     and also very  very stupid .     he sighed .     where the hell   s igor .         ahem .  i   ve been meaning to talk to you about him  dear     said the countess .     i think he   ll have to go .         that   s right .     snapped lacrimosa .     honestly  even my friends laugh at him .         i find his more gothic than thou attitude extremely irritating     said the countess .     that stupid accent   and do you know what i found him doing in the old dungeons last week .         i   m sure i couldn   t guess     said the count .      he had a box of spiders and a whip .  he was forcing them to make webs all over the place .         i wondered why there was always so many  i must admit     said the count .      i agree  father     said vlad .     he   s all right for uberwald  but you   d hardly want something like him opening the door in polite society  would you .         and he smells     said the countess .      of course  parts of him have been in the family for centuries     said the count .     but i must admit he   s getting beyond a joke .     he yanked the bellpull again .      yeth  marthter .     said igor  behind him .   the count spun around .     i told you not to do that .         not to do what  marthter .         turn up behind me like that .         it   th the only way i know how to turn up  marthter .         go and fetch king verence  will you .  he   s joining us for a light meal .         yeth  marthter .      they watched the servant limp off .  the count shook his head .      he   ll never retire     said vlad .     he   ll never take a hint .         and it   s so old fashioned  having a servant called igor     said the countess .     he really is too much .         look  it   s simple     said lacrimosa .     just take him down to the cellars  slam him in the iron maiden  stretch him on the rack over a fire for a day or two  and then slice him thinly from the feet upward  so he can watch .  you   ll be doing him a kindness  really .         i suppose it   s the best way     said the count sadly .      i remember when you told me to put my cat out of its misery     said lacrimosa .      i really meant for you to stop what you were doing to it     said the count .     but   yes  you are right  he   ll have to go        igor ushered in king verence  who stood there with the mildly bemused expression of someone in the presence of the count .      ah  your majesty     said the countess  advancing .     do join us in a light meal .          agnes   s hair snagged in the twigs .  she managed to get one boot on a branch while holding on for dear life to the branch above  but that left her other foot standing on the broomstick  which was beginning to drift sideways and causing her to do what even ballerinas can   t do without some training .      can you see it yet .     nanny cried  from far too far below .      i think this is an old nest as well   oh no           what   s happened .         i think my drawers have split           i always go for roomy  myself     said nanny .   agnes got the other leg onto the branch  which creaked .   lump  said perdita .  i could have climbed this like a gazelle .      gazelles don   t climb .     said agnes .      what   s that .     said the voice from below .      oh  nothing        agnes inched her way along  and suddenly her vision was full of black and white wings .  a magpie landed on a twig a foot from her face and screamed at her .  five others swooped in from the other trees and joined in the chorus .   she didn   t like birds in any case .  they were fine when they were flying  and their songs were nice  but up close they were mad little balls of needles with the intelligence of a house fly .   she tried to swat the nearest one  and it fluttered onto a higher branch while she struggled to get her balance back .  when the branch stopped rocking she moved further along  gingerly  trying to ignore the enraged birds  and looked at the nest .   it was hard to tell if it was the remains of an old one or the start of a new one  but it did contain a piece of tinsel  a shard of broken glass and  gleaming even under this sullen sky  something white   with a gleaming edge .         five for silver   six for gold          she said  half to herself .      it   s    five for heaven  six for hell        nanny called up .      i can just reach it  anyway        the bough broke .  there were plenty of others up . below it  but they just served as points of interest on the way down .  the last one flipped agnes into a holly bush .   nanny took the invitation from her outflung hand .  rain had made the ink run  but the word    weatherwax    was still very readable .  she scratched at the gold edging with her thumb .      too much gold     she said .     well  that explains the invite .  i told you them birds will steal anything that glitters .         i   m not hurt at all     said agnes pointedly .     the holly quite cushioned my fall .         i   ll wring their necks     said nanny .  the magpies in the trees around the cottage screamed at her .      i think i may have dislocated my hat  however     said agnes  pulling herself to her feet .  but it was useless angling for sympathy in a puddle  so she gave up .     all right  we   ve found the invitation .  it was all a terrible mistake .  no one   s fault .  now let   s find granny .         not if she don   t want to be found     said nanny  rubbing the edge of the card thoughtfully .      you can do borrowing .  even if she left early  some creatures will have seen her           i don   t borrow  as a rule     said nanny firmly .     i ain   t got esme   s self discipline .  i gets   involved .  i was a rabbit for three whole days until our jason went and fetched esme and she brought me back .  much longer and there wouldn   t have been a me to come back .         rabbits sound dull .         they have their ups and downs .         all right  then  have a look in the buoy   s glass ball     said agnes .     you   re good at that  magrat told me .     across the clearing a crumbling brick fell out of the cottage   s chimney .      not here  then     said nanny  with some reluctance .     it   s giving me the willies   oh no  as if we didn   t have enough   what   s he doing here .      mightily oats was advancing through the wood .  he walked awkwardly  as city people do when traversing real  rutted  leaf moldy  twig strewn soil  and had the concerned look of someone who was expecting to be attacked at any moment by owls or beetles .   in his strange black and white clothing he looked like a human magpie himself .   the magpies screamed from the trees .         seven for a secret never to be told        said agnes .         seven   s a devil  his own sel           said nanny  darkly .     you   ve got your rhyme  i   ve got mine .      when oats saw the witches he brightened up very slightly and blew his nose at them .      what a waste of skin     muttered nanny .      ah  mrs .  ogg   and miss nitt     said oats  inching around some mud .     er   i trust i find you well .         up till now     said nanny .      i had  er  hoped to see mrs .  weatherwax .      for a moment the only sound was the chattering of the ravens .      hoped .     said agnes .      mrs .  weatherwax .     said nanny .      er  yes .  it is part of my   i   m supposed to   one of the things we   well  i heard she might be ill  and visiting the elderly and infirm is part  er  of our pastoral duties   of course  i realize that technically i have no pastoral duties  but still  while i   m here        nanny   s face was a picture  possibly one painted by an artist with a very strange sense of humor .      i   m really sorry she ain   t here     she said  and agnes knew she was being altogether honest and absolutely nasty .      oh dear .  i was  er  going to give her some   i was going   er   is she well  then .         i   m sure she   d be all the better for a visit from you     said nanny  and once again there was a strange  curvy sort of truth to this .     it   d be the sort of thing she   d talk about for days .  you can come back any time you want .      oats looked helpless .     then i suppose i   d better  er  be getting back to my  er  tent     he said .     may i accompany you ladies down to the town .  there are  er  some dangerous things in the woods           we got broomsticks     said nanny firmly .  the priest looked crestfallen  and agnes made a decision .      a broomstick     she said .     i   ll walk you   i mean  you can walk me back .  if you like .      the priest looked relieved .  nanny sniffed .  there was a certain weatherwax quality to the sniff .      back at my place  then .  an    no dilly dallyin        she said .      i don   t dilly dally     said agnes .      just see you don   t start     said nanny  and went to find her broomstick .   agnes and the priest walked in embarrassed silence for a while .  at last agnes said     how   s the headache .         oh  much better  thank you .  it went away .  but her majesty was kind enough to give me some pills anyway .         that   s nice     said agnes .  she ought to have given him a needle .  look at the size of that boil .  said perdita  one of nature   s born squeezers .  why doesn   t he do something about it .      er   you don   t like me very much  do you     said oats .      i   ve hardly met you .     she was becoming aware of an embarrassing draftiness in the nether regions .      a lot of people don   t like me as soon as they   ve met me     said oats .      i suppose that saves time     said agnes  and cursed .  perdita had got through on that one  but oats didn   t seem to have noticed .  he sighed .      i   m afraid i have a bit of a difficulty with people     he went on .     i fear i   m just not cut out for pastoral work .      don   t get involved with this twerp  said perdita .  but agnes said     you mean sheep and so on .         it all seemed a lot clearer at college     said oats  who like many people seldom paid much attention to what others said when he was unrolling his miseries     but here  when i tell people some of the more accessible stories from the book of om they say things like     that   s not right  mushrooms wouldn   t grow in the desert     or    that   s a stupid way to run a vineyard .     everyone here is so very   literal .      oats coughed .  there seemed to be something preying on his mind .     unfortunately  the old book of om is rather unyielding on the subject of witches     he said .      really .         although having studied the passage in question in the original second omnian iv text  i have advanced the rather daring theory that the actual word in question translates more accurately as    cockroaches .            yes .         especially since it goes on to say that they can be killed by fire or in    traps of treacle .     it also says later on that they bring lascivious dreams .         don   t look at me     said agnes .     all you   re getting is a walk home .      to her amazement  and perdita   s crowing delight  he blushed as red as she ever did .      er  er  the word in question in that passage might just as easily be read in context as    boiled lobsters        he said hurriedly .      nanny ogg says omnians used to burn witches     said agnes .      we used to burn practically everybody     said oats gloomily .     although some witches did get pushed into big barrels of treacle  i believe .      he had a boring voice  too .  he did appear  she had to admit  to be a boring person .  it was almost too perfect a presentation  as if he was trying to make himself seem boring .  but one thing had piqued agnes   s curiosity .      why did you come to visit granny weatherwax .         well  everyone speaks very   highly of her     said oats  suddenly picking his words like a man pulling plums from a boiling pot .     and they said she hadn   t turned up last night  which was very strange .  and i thought it must be hard for an old lady living by herself .  and           yes .         well  i understand she   s quite old and it   s never too late to consider the state of your immortal soul     said oats .     which she must have  of course .      agnes gave him a sideways look .     she   s never mentioned it     she said .      you probably think i   m foolish .         i just think you are an amazingly lucky man  mr .  oats .      on the other hand   here was someone who   d been told about granny weatherwax  and had still walked through these woods that scared him stiff to see her  even though she was possibly a cockroach or a boiled lobster .  no one in lancre ever came to see granny unless they wanted something .  oh  sometimes they came with little presents  because one day they   d want something again   but they generally made sure she was out first .  there was more to mr .  oats than met the eye .  there had to be .   a couple of centaurs burst out of the bushes ahead of them and cantered away down the path .  oats grabbed a tree .      they were running around when i came up .     he said .     are they usual .         i   ve never seen them before     said agnes .     i think they   re from uberwald .         and the horrible little blue goblins .  one of them made a very unpleasant gesture at me .         don   t know about them at all .         and the vampires .  i mean  i knew that things were different here  but really           vampires .  .     shouted agnes .     you saw the vampires .  last night .         well  i mean  yes  i studied them at length at the seminary  but i never thought i   d see them standing around talking about drinking blood and things  really  i   m surprised the king allows it           and they didn   t   affect your mind .         i did have that terrible migraine .  does that count .  i thought it was the prawns .      a cry rang through the woods .  it seemed to have many components  but mostly it soundly as though a turkey was being throttled at the other end of a tin tube .      and what the heck was that .     shouted oats .   agnes looked around  bewildered .  she   d grown up in the lancre woods .  oh  you got strange things sometimes  passing through  but generally they contained nothing more dangerous than other people .  now  in this tarnished light  even the trees were starting to look suspicious .      let   s at least get down to bad ass     she said  tugging at oats   s hand .      you what .      agnes sighed .     it   s the nearest village .         bad ass .         look  there was a donkey  and it stopped in the middle of the river  and it wouldn   t go backward or forward     said agnes  as patiently as possible .  lancre people got used to explaining this .     bad ass .  see .  yes  i know that    disobedient donkey    might have been more   acceptable  but        the horrible cry echoed around the woods again .  agnes thought of all the things that were rumored to be in the mountains  and dragged oats after her like a badly hitched cart .   then the sound was right in front of them and  at a turn in the lane  a head emerged from a bush .   agnes had seen pictures of an ostrich .   so   start with one of them  but make the head and neck in violent yellow  and give the head a huge ruff of red and purple feathers and two big round eyes  the pupils of which jiggled drunkenly as the head moved back and forth        is that some sort of local chicken .     warbled oats .      i doubt it     said agnes .  one of the long feathers had a tartan pattern .   the cry started again  but was strangled halfway through when agnes stepped forward  grabbed the thing   s neck  and pulled .   a figure rose from the undergrowth  dragged up by his arm .      hodgesaargh .      he quacked at her .      take that thing out of your mouth     said agnes .     you sound like mr .  punch .      he removed the whistle .     sorry  miss nitt .         hodgesaargh  why   and i realize i might not like the answer   why are you hiding in the woods with your arm dressed up like hetty the hen and making horrible noises through a tube .         trying to lure the phoenix  miss .         the phoenix .  that   s a mythical bird  hodgesaargh .         that   s right  miss .  there   s one in lancre  miss .  it   s very young  miss .  so i thought i might be able to attract it .      she looked at the brightly colored glove .  oh yes   if you raised chicks  you had to let them know what kind of bird they were  so you used a sort of glove puppet .  but        hodgesaargh .         yes  miss .         i   m not an expert  of course  but i seem to recall that according to the commonly accepted legend of the phoenix it would never see its parent .  you can only have one phoenix at a time .  it   s automatically an orphan .  you see .         um  may i say something .     said oats .     miss nitt is right  i have to say .  the phoenix builds a nest and bursts into flame and the new bird arises from the ashes .  i   ve read that .  anyway  it   s an allegory .      hodgesaargh looked at the puppet phoenix on his arm and then looked bashfully at his feet .      sorry about that  miss .         so  you see  a phoenix can never see another phoenix     said agnes .      wouldn   t know about that  miss     said hodgesaargh  still staring at his boots .   an idea struck agnes .  hodgesaargh was always out of doors .     hodgesaargh .         yes  miss .         have you been out in the woods all morning .         oh yes  miss .         have you seen granny weatherwax .         yes  miss .         you have .         yes  miss .         where .         up in the woods over toward the border  miss .  at first light  miss .         why didn   t you tell me .         er   did you want to know  miss .         oh .  yes  sorry   what were you doing up there .      hodgesaargh blew a couple of quacks on his phoenix lure by way of explanation .  agnes grabbed the priest again .      come on  let   s get to the road and find nanny        hodgesaargh was left with his glove puppet and his lure and his knapsack and a deeply awkward feeling .  he   d been brought up to respect witches  and miss nitt was a witch .  the man with her hadn   t been a witch  but his manner fitted him into that class of people hodgesaargh mentally pigeonholed as    my betters     although in truth this was quite a large category .  he wasn   t about to disagree with his betters .  hodgesaargh was a one man feudal system .   on the other hand  he thought  as he packed up and prepared to move on  books that were all about the world tended to be written by people who knew all about books rather than all about the world .  all that stuff about birds hatching from ashes must have been written by someone who didn   t know anything about birds .  as for there only ever being one phoenix  well  that   d obviously been written down by a man who ought to get out in the fresh air more and meet some ladies .  birds came from eggs .  oh  the phoenix was one of those creatures that had learned to use magic  had built it right into its very existence  but magic was tricky stuff and nothing used any more of it than it needed to .  so there   d be an egg  definitely .  and eggs needed warmth  didn   t they .   hodgesaargh had been thinking about this a lot during the morning  as he tramped through damp bushes making the acquaintance of several disappointed ducks .  he   d never bothered much about history  except the history of falconry  but he did know that there were once places   and in some cases still were   with a very high level of background magic  which made them rather exciting and not a good place to raise your young .   maybe the phoenix  whatever it really looked like  was simply a bird who   d worked out a way of making incubation work very  very fast .   hodgesaargh had actually got quite a long way  and if he   d had a bit more time he   d have worked out the next step  too .       it was well after noon before granny weatherwax came off the moor  and a watcher might have wondered why it took such a long time to cross a little patch of moorland .   they   d have wondered even more about the little stream .  it had cut a rock studded groove in the peat that a healthy woman could have leapt across  but someone had place a broad stone across it for a bridge .   she looked at it for a while  and then reached into her sack .  she took out a long piece of black material and blindfolded herself .  then she walked out across the stone  taking tiny steps with her arms flung out wide for balance .  halfway across she fell onto her hands and knees and stayed there  panting  for several minutes .  then she crawled forward again  by inches .   a few feet below  the peaty stream rattled happily over the stones .   the sky glinted .  it was a sky with blue patches and bits of cloud  but it had a strange look  as though a picture painted on glass had been fractured and then the shards reassembled wrongly .  a drifting cloud disappeared against some invisible line and began to emerge in another part of the sky altogether .   things were not what they seemed .  but then  as granny always said  they never were .       agnes practically had to pull oats into nanny ogg   s house  which was in fact so far away from the concept of a witch   s cottage that it  as it were  approached it from the other side .  it tended toward jolly clashing colors rather than black  and smelled of polish .  there were no skulls or strange candles  apart from the pink novelty one that nanny had once bought in ankh morpork and only brought out to show to guests with the right sense of humor .  there were lots of tables  mainly in order to display the vast number of drawings and iconographs of the huge ogg clan .  at first sight these looked randomly placed  until you worked out the code .  in reality  pictures were advanced or retarded around the room as various family members temporarily fell in or out of favor  and anyone ending up on the small wobbly table near the cat   s bowl had some serious spadework to do .  what made it worse was you could fall down the pecking order not because you   d done something bad  but because everyone else had done something better .  this was why what space wasn   t taken up with family pictures was occupied by ornaments  because no ogg who traveled more than ten miles from the homestead would dream of returning without a present .  the oggs loved nanny ogg and  well  there were even worse places than the wobbly table .  a distant cousin had once ended up in the hall .   most of the ornaments were cheapjack stuff bought from fairs  but nanny ogg never minded  provided they were colorful and shiny .  so there were a lot of cross eyed dogs  pink shepherdesses and mugs with badly spelled slogans like    to the wordl   s best mum    and    we luove our nanny .     a huge gilded china beer stein that played    ich bin ein rattarsedschwein    from the student horse was locked in a glass fronted cabinet as a treasure too great for common display  and had earned shirl ogg   s picture a permanent place on the dresser .   nanny ogg had already cleared a space on the table for the green ball .  she looked up sharply when agnes entered .      you were a long time .  been dallyin    .     she said  in an armor piercing voice .      nanny  granny would have said that     said agnes reproachfully .   nanny shivered .     you   re right  gel     she said .     let   s find her quickly  eh .  i   m too cheerful to be a crone .         there   s odd creatures everywhere .     said agnes .     there   s loads of centaurs .  we had to dive into the ditch .         ah  i did notice you   d got grass and leaves on your dress     said nanny .     but i was too polite to mention it .         where   re they all coming from .         down out of the mountains  i suppose .  why did you bring soapy sam back with you .         because he   s covered in mud  nanny     said agnes sharply     and i said he could have a wash down here .         er   is this really a witch   s cottage .     said oats  staring at the assembled ranks of oggery .      oh dear     said nanny .      pastor melchio said they are sinks of depravity and sexual ex cess .     the young man took a nervous step backward  knocking against a small table and causing a blue clockwork ballerina to begin a jerky pirouette to the tune of    three blind mice .         well  we   ve got a sink all right     said nanny .     what   s your best offer .         i suppose we should be grateful that was a nanny ogg comment     said agnes .     don   t wind him up  nanny .  it   s been a busy morning .         er   which way   s the pump .     said oats .  agnes pointed .  he hurried out  gratefully .      wetter than a thunderstorm sandwich     said nanny  shaking her head .      granny was seen up above the long lake     said agnes  sitting down at the table .   nanny looked up sharply .     on that bit of moor .     she said .      yes .         that   s bad .  that   s gnarly country up there .         gnarly .         all scrunched up .         what .  i   ve been up there .  it   s just heather and gorse and there   s a few old caves at the end of the valley .         oh really .  looked up at the clouds  did you .  oh well  let   s have a go        when oats came back  scrubbed and shining  they were arguing .  they looked rather embarrassed when they saw him .      i said it   d need three of us     said nanny  pushing the glass ball aside .     especially if she   s up there .  gnarly ground plays merry hell with scrying .  we just ain   t got the power .         i don   t want to go back to the castle .         magrat   s good at this sort of thing .         she   s got a little baby to look after  nanny .         yeah  in a castle full of vampires .  think about that .  no knowing when they   ll get hungry again .  better for    em both to be out of it .         but           you get her out now .  i   d come myself  but you said i just sit there grinnin    .      agnes suddenly pointed a finger at oats .     you .         me .     he quavered .      you said you could see they were vampires  didn   t you .         i did .         you did .         that   s right  i did .  er   and .         you didn   t find your mind becoming all pink and happy .         i don   t think my mind has ever been pink and happy     said oats .      so why didn   t they get through to you .      oats smiled uneasily and fished in his jacket .      i am protected by the hand of om     he said .   nanny inspected the pendant .  it show a figure trussed across the back of a turtle .      you say .     she said .     that   s a good wheeze  then .         just as om reach out his hand to save the prophet brutha from the torture .  so will he spread his wings over me in my time of trial     said oats  but he sounded as though he was trying to reassure himself rather than nanny .  he went on     i   ve got a pamphlet if you would like to know more     and this time the tone was much more positive  as if the existence of om was a little uncertain whereas the existence of pamphlets was obvious to any open minded  rational thinking person .      don   t     said nanny .  she let the medallion go .     well  brother perdore never needed any magic jewelry for fighting off people  that   s all i can say .         no  he just used to breathe alcohol all over them     said agnes .     well  you   re coming with me  mr .  oats .  i   m not facing prince slime again alone .  and you can shut up .         er  i didn   t say anything           i didn   t mean you  i meant   look  you said you   ve studied vampires  didn   t you .  what   s good for vampires .      oats thought for a moment .     er   a nice dry coffin  er  plenty of fresh blood  er  overcast skies       his voice trailed off when he saw her expression .     ah   well  it depends exactly where they   re from  i remember .  uberwald is a very big place .  er   cutting off the head and staking them in the heart is generally efficacious .         but that works on everyone     said nanny .      er   in splintz they die if you put a coin in their mouth and cut their head off           not like ordinary people  then     said nanny  taking out a notebook .      er   in klotz they die if you stick a lemon in their mouth           sounds more like it .            after you cut their head off .  i believe that in glitz you have to fill their mouth with salt  hammer a carrot into both ears  and then cut off their head .         i can see that must   ve been fun finding that out .         and in the valley of the ah they believe it   s best to cut off the head and boil it in vinegar .         you   re going to need someone to carry all this stuff  agnes     said nanny ogg .      but in kashncari they say you should cut off their toes and drive a nail through their neck .         and cut their head off .         apparently you don   t have to .         toes is easy     said nanny .     old windrow over in bad ass cut off two of his with a spade and he weren   t even trying .         and then  of course  you can defeat them by stealing their left sock     said oats .      sorry .     said agnes .     i think i misheard you there .         um   they   re pathologically meticulous  you see .  some of the gypsy tribes in borogravia say that if you steal their sock and hide it somewhere they   ll spend the rest of eternity looking for it .  they can   t abide things to be out of place or missing .         i wouldn   t have put this down as a very widespread belief     said nanny .      oh  they say in some villages that you can even slow them down by throwing poppyseed at them     said oats .     then they   ll have a terrible urge to count every seed .  vampires are very anal retentive  you see .         i shouldn   t like meeting one that was the opposite     said nanny .      yes  well  i don   t think we   re going to have time to ask the count for his precise address     said agnes quickly .     we   re going to go in  fetch magrat and get back here  all right .  why are you such a vampire expert  oats .         i told you  i studied this sort of thing at college .  we have to know the enemy if we   re to combat evil forces   vampires  demons  wit       he stopped .      do go on     said nanny ogg  as sweet as arsenic .      but with witches i   m just supposed to show them the error of their ways .     oats coughed nervously .      that   s something to look forward to  then     said nanny .     what with me not havin    my fireproof corsets on .  off you go  then   all three of you .         there   s three of us .     said oats .   agnes felt her left arm tremble .  against every effort of will her wrist bent  her palm curled up and she felt a finger straining to unfold .  only nanny ogg noticed .      like having your own chaperone all the time  ain   t it     she said .      what was she talking about .     said oats  as they headed for the castle .      her mind   s wandering     said agnes  loudly .       there were covered ox carts rumbling up the street to the castle .  agnes and oats stood to one side and watched them .   the drivers didn   t seem interested in the bystanders .  they wore drab  ill fitting clothing  but an unusual touch was the scarf each one had wrapped around his neck so tightly that it might have been a bandage .      either there   s a plague of sore throats in uberwald or there will be nasty little puncture wounds under those  i   ll bet     said agnes .      er   i do know a bit about the way they   re supposed to control people     said oats .      yes .         it sounds silly  but it was in an old book .         well .         they find single minded people easier to control .         single minded .     said agnes suspiciously .  more carts rolled past .      it doesn   t sound right  i know .  you   d think strong minded people would be harder to affect .  i suppose a big target is easier to hit .  in some of the villages  apparently  vampire hunters get roaring drunk first .  protection  you see .  you can   t punch fog .      so we   re fog .  said perdita .  so   s he  by the look of him     agnes shrugged .  there was a certain bucolic look to the faces of the cart drivers .  of course  you got that in lancre too  but in lancre it was overlaid by a mixture of guile  common sense and stubborn rock headedness .  here the eyes behind the faces had a switched off look .   like cattle  said perdita .      yes     said agnes .      pardon .     said oats .      just thinking aloud        and she thought of the way one man could so easily control a herd of cows  any one of which could have left him as a small damp depression in the ground had it wanted to .  somehow  they never got around to thinking about it .   supposing they are better than us  she thought .  supposing that  compared to them  we   re just     you   re too close to the castle  snapped perdita .  you   re thinking cow thoughts .   then agnes realized that there was a squad of men marching behind the carts .  they didn   t look at all like the carts    drivers .   and these  said perdita  are the cattle prods .   they had uniforms  of a sort  with the black and white crest of the magpyrs  but they weren   t a body of men that looked smart in a uniform .  they looked very much like men who killed other people for money  and not even for a lot of money .  they looked  in short  like men who   d cheerfully eat a puppy sandwich .  several of them leered at agnes when they went past  but it was only a generic leer that was simply leered on the basis that she had a dress on .   more wagons came up behind them .      nanny ogg says you must take time by the foreskin     agnes said  and darted forward as the last wagon rumbled past .      she does .         i   m afraid so .  you get used to it .      she caught the back of the cart and pulled herself up  beckoning him hastily to follow .      are you trying to impress me .     he said as she hauled him on board .      not you     she said .  and realized  at this point  that what she was sitting on was a coffin .   there were two of them in the back of the cart  packed around with straw .      are they moving the furniture in .     said oats .      er   i think   it might   be occupied     said agnes .   she almost shrieked when he removed the lid .  the coffin was empty .      you idiot .  supposing there was someone in there .         vampires are weak during the day .  everyone knows that     said oats reproachfully .      i can   feel them here   somewhere     said agnes .  the rattling of the cart changed as it rumbled onto the cobblestones of the courtyard .      get off the other one and i   ll have a look .         but supposing        he pushed her off and raised the lid before she could protest further .     no  no vampire in here  either     he said .      supposing one   d just reached out and grabbed you by the throat .         om is my shield     said oats .      really .  that   s nice .         you may chortle           i didn   t chortle .         you can if you want to .  but i   m sure we are doing the right thing .  did not sonaton defeat the beast of batrigore in its very cave .         i don   t know .         he did .  and didn   t the prophet urdure vanquish the dragon of sluth on the plain of gidral after three days    fighting .         i don   t know that we   ve got that much time           and wasn   t it true the sons of exequial beat the hosts of myrilom .         yes .         you   ve heard of that .         no .  listen  we   ve stopped .  i don   t particularly want us to be found  do you .  not right now .  and not by those guards .  they didn   t look like nice men at all .      they exchanged a meaningful glance over the coffins  concerning a certain inevitability about the immediate future .      they   ll notice they   re heavier  won   t they .     said oats .      those people driving the carts didn   t look as though they notice anything very much .      agnes stared at the coffin beside her .  there was some dirt in the bottom  but it was otherwise quite clean and had a pillow at the head end .  there were also some side pockets in the lining .      it   s the easiest way in     she said .     you get into this one  i   ll get into that one .  and  look   those people you just told me about   were they real historical characters .         certainly .  they           well  don   t try to imitate them yet  all right .  otherwise you   ll be a historical character too .      she shut the lid  and still felt there was a vampire around .   her hand touched the side pocket .  there was something soft yet spiky there .  her fingers explored it in fascinated horror and discovered it to be a ball of wool with a couple of long knitting needles stuck through it  suggesting either a very domesticated form of voodoo or that someone was knitting a sock .   who knitted socks in a coffin .  on the other hand  perhaps even vampires couldn   t sleep sometimes  and tossed and turned all day .   she braced herself as the coffin was picked up and she tried to occupy her mind by working out where it was being taken .  she heard the sound of footsteps on the cobbles  and then the ring of the flagstones on the main steps  echoing in the great hall  a sudden dip     that meant the cellars .  logical  really  but not good .   you   re doing this to impress me  said perdita .  you   re doing it to try to be extrovert and dynamic .   shut up  agnes thought .   a voice outside said     put them down there and puth off .      that was the one who called himself igor .  agnes wished she   d thought of a weapon .      get rid of me  would they .     the voice went on  against a background of disappearing footsteps .     thith ith all going to end in tearth .  it   th all very well for them  but who hath to go and thweep up the dutht  eh .  that   th what i   d like to know .  who   th it hath to pull their headth out of the pickle jarth .  who   th it hath to find them under the ithe .  i mutht   ve pulled out more thtaketh than i   ve had wriggly dinnerth        light flooded in as the coffin lid was removed .   igor stared at agnes .  agnes stared at igor .   igor unfroze first .  he smiled   he had a geometrically interesting smile  because of the row of stitches right across it   and said     dear me  thomeone   th been lithening to too many thtorieth .  got any garlic .         masses     agnes lied .      won   t work .  any holy water .         gallons .         it        a coffin lid smacked down on igor   s head  making an oddly metallic sound .  he reached up slowly to rub the spot  and then turned around .  this time the lid smacked into his face .      oh   thit     he said  and folded up .  oats appeared  face aglow with adrenaline and righteousness .      i smote him mightily .         good  good  let   s get out of here .  help me up .         my wrath descended upon him like           it was a heavy lid and he   s not that young     said agnes .     look  i used to play down here  i know how to get to the back stairs           he   s not a vampire .  he looks like one .  first time i   ve ever seen a patchwork man           he   s a servant .  now  please come       agnes paused .     can you make holy water .         what  here .         i mean bless it  or dedicate it to om  or   boil the hell out of it  perhaps     said agnes .      there is a small ceremony i can       he stopped .     that   s right .  vampires can be stopped by holy water .         good .  we   ll go via the kitchens  then .      the huge kitchens were almost empty .  they never bustled these days  since the royal couple were not the sort who demanded three meat courses with every meal  and at the moment there was only mrs .  scorbic the cook in there  calmly rolling out pastry .      afternoon  mrs .  scorbic     said agnes  deciding the best course was to march past and rely on the authority of the pointy hat .     we   ve just dropped in for some water  don   t worry  i know where the pump is  but if you   ve got a couple of empty bottles that would be helpful .         that   s right  dear     said mrs .  scorbic .   agnes stopped and turned .   mrs .  scorbic was famously acerbic  especially on the subject of soya  nut cutlets  vegetarian meals and any vegetable that couldn   t be boiled until it was yellow .  even the king hesitated to set foot in her kitchen  but whereas he only got an angry silence  lesser mortals got the full force of her generalized wrath .  mrs .  scorbic was permanently angry  in the same way that mountains are permanently large .   today she was wearing a white dress  a white apron  a big white mob cap and a white bandage around her throat .  she also looked  for want of any better word  happy .   agnes urgently waved oats toward the pump .     find something to fill up     she hissed  and then said brightly     how are you feeling  mrs .  scorbic .         all the better for you asking  miss .         i expect you   re busy with all these visitors .         yes  miss .      agnes coughed .     and  er  what did you give them for breakfast .      the cook   s huge pink brow wrinkled .     can   t remember  miss .         well done .      oats nudged her .     i   ve filled up a couple of empty bottles and i said the purification rite of om over them .         and that will work .         you must have faith .      the cook was watching them amiably .      thank you  mrs .  scorbic     said agnes .     please get on with   whatever you were doing .         yes  miss .     the cook turned back to her rolling pin .   plenty of meals on her  said perdita .  cook and larder all in one .      that was tasteless .     said agnes .      what was .     said the priest .      oh   just a thought i had .  let   s go up the back stairs .      they were bare stone  communicating with the public bits of the keep via a door at every level .  on the other side of those doors it was still bare stone  but a better class of masonry altogether and with tapestries and carpets .  agnes pushed open a door .   a couple of the uberwald people were ambling along the corridor beyond  carrying something covered in a cloth .  they didn   t spare the newcomers a glance as agnes led the way to the royal apartments .   magrat was standing on a chair when they came in .  she looked down at them while little painted wooden stars and animals tangled themselves around her upraised arm .      wretched things     she said .     you   d think it would be easy  wouldn   t you .  hello  agnes .  could you hold the chair .         what are you doing .     said agnes .  she looked carefully .  there was no bandage around magrat   s neck .      trying to hook this mobile onto the chandelier     said magrat .     uh   that   s done it .  but it tangles up all the time .  verence says it   s very good for young children to see lots of bright colors and shapes .  it speeds development  he says .  but i can   t find millie anywhere .      there   s a castle full of vampires  and she   s decorating the playroom  said perdita .  what   s wrong with this woodcut .   somehow  agnes couldn   t bring herself to blurt out a warning .  apart from anything else  the chair looked wobbly .      little esme   s only two weeks old     said agnes .     isn   t that a bit young for education .         never too early to start  he says .  what can i do for you .         we need you to come with us .  right now .         why .     said magrat  and to agnes   s relief she stepped down from the chair .      why .  magrat  there   s vampires in the castle .  the magpyr family are vampires .         don   t be silly  they   re very pleasant people .  i was talking to the countess only this morning           what about .     agnes demanded .     i bet you can   t remember .         i am queen  agnes     said magrat reproachfully .      sorry  but they affect people   s minds           yours .         um  no  not mine .  i have   i   m   it seems i   m immune     agnes lied .      and his .     said magrat sharply .      i am protected by my faith in om     said oats .   magrat raised her eyebrows at agnes .     is he .      agnes shrugged .     apparently .      magrat leaned closer .     he   s not drunk  is he .  he   s holding two beer bottles .         they   re full of holy water     agnes whispered .      verence said omnianism seemed a very sensible and stable religion     hissed magrat .   they both looked at oats  mentally trying the words on him for size .      are we leaving .     he said .      of course not     snapped magrat  straightening up .     this is silly  agnes .  i   m a married woman  i   m queen  i   ve got a little baby .  and you come in here telling me we   ve got vampires .  i   ve got guests here and           the guests are vampires  your majesty     said agnes .     the king invited them .         verence says we have to learn to deal with all sorts of people           we think granny weatherwax is in very bad trouble     said agnes .   magrat stopped .     how bad .     she said .      nanny ogg is very worried .  quite snappish .  she says it needs three of us to find granny .         well  i           and granny   s taken the box  whatever that means     said agnes .      the one she keeps in the dresser .         yes .  nanny wouldn   t tell me much about what was in it .      magrat opened up her hands like an angler measuring a medium sized fish .      the polished wooden box .  about this size .         i don   t know  i   ve never seen it .  nanny seemed to think it was important .  she didn   t say what was in it     agnes repeated  just in case magrat hadn   t got the hint .   magrat clasped her hands together and looked down  biting her knuckles .  when she looked up her face was set with purpose .  she pointed at oats .      you find a bag or something and empty into it all the stuff in the top drawer over there  and take the potty  and the little truck  oh  and the stuffed animals  and the bag of nappies  and the bag for used nappies  and the bath  and the bag with the towels  and the box of toys  and the wind up things  and the musical box  and the bag with the little suits  oh  and the woolly hat  and you  agnes  find something we can make into a sling .  you came up the back stairs .  we   ll go down the same way .         what do we need a sling for .      magrat leaned over the crib and picked up the baby  wrapped in a blanket .      i   m not going to leave her here  am i .     she said .   there was a clatter from the direction of mightily oats .  he already had both arms full  and a large stuffed rabbit in his teeth .      do we need all of that .     said agnes .      you never know     said magrat .      even the box of toys .         verence thinks she might be an early developer     said magrat .      she   s a couple of weeks old .         yes  but stimulus at an early age is vital to the development of the growing brain     said magrat  laying baby esme on the table and shuffling her into a romper suit .     also  we have to get on top of her hand   eye coordination as soon as possible .  it   s no good just letting things slide .  oh yes   if you can bring the little slide  too .  and the yellow rubber duck .  and the sponge in the shape of a teddy bear .  and the teddy bear in the shape of a sponge .      there was another crash from the mound around oats .      why   s the box so important .     said agnes .      not important as such     said magrat .  she looked over her shoulder .     oh  and put in that rag doll  will you .  i   m sure she   s focusing on it .  oh blast   the red bag has got the medicines in it  thank you   what was it you asked me .         granny   s box     agnes hinted .      oh  it   s   just important to her .         it   s magical .         what .  oh no .  no as far as i know .  but everything in it belongs to her  you see .  not to the cottage     said magrat  picking up her daughter .     who   s a good girl  then .  you are .     she looked around .     have we forgotten anything .      oats spat out the rabbit .     possibly the ceiling     he said .      then let   s go .          magpies flocked around the castle tower .  most magpie rhymes peter out at around ten or twelve  but here were hundreds of birds  enough to satisfy any possible prediction .  there are many rhymes about magpies  but none of them is very reliable because they are not the ones the magpies know themselves .   the count sat in the darkness below  listening to their minds .  images flashed behind his eyes .  this was the way to run a country  he reflected .  human minds were so hard to read  unless they were so close that you could see the words just hovering below actual vocalization .  but the birds could get everywhere  see every worker in the fields and hunter in the forest .  they were good listeners  too .  much better than bats or rats .  once again  tradition was overturned .   no sign of granny  though .  some trick  perhaps .  it didn   t matter .  eventually she   d find him .  she wouldn   t hide for long .  it wasn   t in her nature .  weatherwaxes would always stand and fight  even when they knew they would be beaten .  so predictable .   several of the birds had seen a busy little figure trudging across the kingdom  leading a donkey laden with falconry gear .  the count had taken a look at hodgesaargh  found a mind crammed end to end with hawks  and dismissed him .  he and his silly birds would have to go eventually  of course  because he made the magpies nervous .  he made a note to mention this to the guards .          ooaauooow .         but there was probably no combination of vowels that could do justice to the cry nanny ogg made on seeing a young baby .  it included sounds known only to cats .      isn   t she a little precious     nanny crooned .     i   ve probably got a sweetie somewhere           she   s not on solids     said magrat .      still keeping you up at nights .         and days .  but she   s slept well today  thank goodness .  nanny  give her to mr .  oats and let   s sort this out right away .      the young priest took the baby nervously  holding it  as some men do  as if it would break or at least explode .      there  there  there     he said  vaguely .      now   what   s this about granny .     said magrat .   they told her  interrupting one another at important points .      the gnarly ground over toward the top of the forest .     said magrat  when they were nearly finished .      that   s right     said nanny .      what is gnarly ground .     said agnes .      there   s a lot of magic in these mountains  right .     said nanny .     and everyone knows mountains get made when lumps of land bang together  right .  well  when the magic gets trapped you   sort of   get a bit of land where the space is   sort of   scrunched up  right .  it   d be quite big if it could but it   s like a bit of gnarly wood in an ol    tree .  or a used hanky   all folded up small but still big in a different way .         but i   ve been up there and it   s just a bit of moorland .         you   ve got to know the right direction     said nanny .     damn hard to scry into a place like that .  it goes all wobbly .  it   s like tryin    to look at something close up and a long way away at the same time .  it makes your crystal ball water .      she pulled the green ball toward her .      now  you two push an    i   ll steer           er  are you going to do some magic .     said oats  behind them .      what   s the problem .     said nanny .      i mean  does it involve  er       he colored up     er   removing your garments and dancing around and summoning lewd and salacious creatures .  only i   m afraid i couldn   t be a party to that .  the book of om forbids consorting with false enchanters and deceitful soothsayers  you see .         i wouldn   t consort with false enchanters neither     said nanny .     their beards fall off .         we   re real     said magrat .      and we certainly don   t summon lewd and salacious creatures     said agnes .      unless we want to     said nanny ogg  almost under her breath .      well   all right  then     said oats .   as they unwound the power  agnes heard perdita think i don   t like magrat .  she   s not like she used to be .  well  of course she   s not .  but she   s taking charge  she   s not cringing slightly like she used to  she   s not wet .  that   s because she   s a mother  agnes thought .  mothers are only slightly damp .   she was not  herself  hugely in favor of motherhood in general .  obviously it was necessary  but it wasn   t exactly difficult .  even cats managed it .  but women acted as if they   d been given a medal that entitled them to boss people around .  it was as if  just because they   d got the label which said    mother     everyone else got a tiny part of the label that said    child        she gave a mental shrug  and concentrated on the craft in hand .   light grew and faded inside the green globe .  agnes had only scryed a few times before  but she didn   t remember the light pulsing like this .  every time it dissolved into an image the light flickered and bounced to somewhere else   a patch of heather   a tree   boiling clouds     and then granny weatherwax came and went .  the image appeared and was gone in an instant  and the glow that rolled in with a finality told agnes that this was all  folks .      she was lying down     said magrat .     it was all fuzzy .         then she   s in one of the caves .  she said once she goes up there to be alone with her thoughts     said nanny .     and did you catch that little twitch .  she   s trying to keep us out .         the caves up there are just scoops in the rock     said agnes .      yes   and no     said nanny .     did i see her holding a card in her hands .         the    i ate   nt dead    card .     said magrat .      no  she   d left that in the cottage .         just when we really need her  she goes away into a cave .         does she know we need her .  did she know about the vampires .     said agnes .      can   t we go and ask her .     said magrat .      we can   t fly all the way     said nanny  scratching her chin .     can   t fly prop   ly over gnarly ground .  the broomsticks act funny .         then we   ll walk the rest     said magrat .     it   s hours to sunset .         you   re not coming  are you .     said agnes  aghast .      yes  of course .         but what about the baby .         she seems to like it in the sling and it keeps her warm and it   s not as if there   s monsters up there     said magrat .     anyway  i think it   s possible to combine motherhood and a career .         i thought you   d given up witchcraft     said agnes .      yes   well   yes .  let   s make sure granny   s all right and get this all sorted out  and then obviously i   ll have other things to do           but it could be dangerous .     said agnes .     don   t you think so  nanny .      nanny ogg turned her chair and looked at the baby .      cootchie cootchie .     she said .   the small head looked around and esme opened her blue eyes .   nanny ogg stared thoughtfully .      take her with us     she said at last .     i used to take our jason everywhere when he was tiny .  they like being with their mum .      she gave the baby another long hard look .      yes     she went on     i think that   d be a damn good idea .         er   i feel perhaps there is little that i   d be able to do     oats said .      oh  it   d be too dangerous to take you     said nanny  dismissively .      but of course my prayers will go with you .         that   s nice .     nanny sniffed .       drizzling rain soaked hodgesaargh as he trudged back to the castle .  the damp had got into the lure  and the noise it made now could only attract some strange  lost creature  skulking in ancient estuaries .  or possibly a sheep with a very sore throat .   and then he heard the chattering of magpies .   he tied the donkey to a sapling and stepped out into a clearing .  the birds were screaming in the trees around him  but erupted away at the sight of king henry on her perch on the donkey .   crouched against a mossy rock was      a small magpie .  it was bedraggled and wrong  as if put together by someone who had seen one but didn   t know how it was supposed to work .  it struggled when it saw him  there was a fluffing of feathers and  now  a smaller version of king henry was trying to unfold its tattered wings .   he backed away .  on her perch  the hooded eagle had its head turned to the strange bird        which was now a pigeon .  a thrush .  a wren     a sudden intimation of doom made hodgesaargh cover his eyes  but he saw the flash through the skin of his fingers  felt the thump of the flame  and smelled the scorched hairs on the back of his hand .   a few tufts of grass smoldered on the edge of a circle of scorched earth .  inside it a few pathetic bones glowed red hot and then crumbled into fine ash .   away in the forest  the magpies screamed .  count magpyr stirred in the darkness of his room and opened his eyes .  the pupils widened to take in more light .      i think she has gone to ground     he said .      that was remarkably quick     said the countess .     i thought you said she was quite powerful .         oh  indeed .  but human .  and she   s getting older .  with age comes doubt .  it   s so simple .  all alone in that barren cottage  no company but the candlelight   it   s so simple to open up all the little cracks and let her mind turn in on itself .  it   s like watching a forest fire when the wind changes  and suddenly it   s roaring down on all the houses you thought were built so strongly .         so graphically put .         thank you .         you were so successful in escrow  i know           a model for the future .  vampires and humans in harmony at last .  there is no need for this animosity  just as i have always said .      the countess walked over to the window and gingerly pulled aside the curtain .  despite the overcast sky  gray light filtered in .      there   s no requirement to be so cautious about this  either     said her husband  coming up behind her and jerking the curtain aside .  the countess shuddered and turned her face away .      you see .  still harmless .  every day  in every way  we get better and better     said count magpyr cheerfully .     self help .  positive thinking .  training .  familiarity .  garlic .  a pleasant seasoning .  lemons .  merely an acquired taste .  why  yesterday i mislaid a sock and i simply don   t care .  i have lots of socks .  extra socks can be arranged .     his smile faded when he saw his wife   s expression .      the word    but    is on the tip of your tongue     he said flatly .      i was just going to say that there were no witches in escrow .         and the place is all the better for it .         of course  but           there you go again  my dear .  there is no room for    but    in our vocabulary .  verence was right  oddly enough .  there   s a new world coming  and there won   t be any room in it for those ghastly little gnomes or witches or centaurs and especially not for the firebirds .  away with them .  let us progress .  they are unfitted for survival .         you only wounded that phoenix  though .         my point exactly .  it allowed itself to be hurt  and therefore extinction looms .  no  my dear  if we won   t fade with the old world we must make shift in the new .  witches .  i   m afraid witches are all in the past now .          the broomsticks in the present landed just above the treeline  on the edge of the moor .  as agnes had said  it was barely big enough to deserve the term .  she could even hear the little mountain brook at the far end .      i can   t see anything gnarly looking     said agnes .  she knew it was a stupid thing to say  but the presence of magrat was getting on her nerves .   nanny looked up at the sky .  the other two followed her gaze .      you   ve got to get your eye in  but you   ll see it if you watch     she said .     you can only see it if you stands on the moor .      agnes squinted at the overcast .      oh   i think i can     said magrat .   i bet she doesn   t  said perdita  i can   t .   and then agnes did .  it was tricky to spot  like a join between two sheets of glass  and it seemed to move away whenever she was certain she could see it  but there was an   inconsistency  flickering in and out on the edge of vision .   nanny licked a finger and held it up to the wind .  then she pointed .      this way .  an    shut your eyes .         there   s no path     said magrat .      that   s right .  you hold on to my hand  agnes will hold onto yours .  i   ve been this way a few times .  it ain   t hard .         it   s like a children   s story     said agnes .      yes  we   re down to the bone now  all right     said nanny .     and   off we go        agnes felt the heather brush her feet as she stepped forward .  she opened her eyes .   moorland stretched away on every side  even behind them .  the air was darker  the clouds heavier  the wind sharper .  the mountains looked a long way away .  there was a distant thunder of water .      where are we now .     said magrat .      still here     said nanny .     i remember my dad saying sometimes a deer or somethin    would run into gnarly ground if it was bein    hunted .         it   d have to be pretty desperate     said agnes .  the heather was darker here  and scratched so much it was almost thorny .     everything   s so   nasty looking .         attitude plays a part     said nanny .  she tapped something with her foot .   it was   well  it had been a standing stone  agnes thought  but now it was a lying stone .  lichen grew thickly all over it .      the marker .  hard to get out again if you don   t know about it     said nanny .     let   s head for the mountains .  esme all wrapped up  magrat .  little esme  i mean .         she   s asleep .         yeah     said nanny  in what agnes thought was an odd tone of voice .     just as well  really .  let   s go .  oh   i thought we might need these        she fumbled in the bottomless storeroom of her knicker leg and produced a couple of pairs of socks so thick that they could have stood up by themselves .      lancre wool     she said .     our jason knits    em of an evenin    and you know what strong fingers he   s got .  you could kick your way through a wall .      the heather ripped fruitlessly at the wire like wool as the women hurried over the moor .  there was still a sun here  or at least a bright spot in the overcast  but darkness seemed to come up from beneath the ground .   agnes    said perdita   s voice  in the privacy of her shared brain .   what .  thought agnes .   nanny   s worried about something to do with the baby and granny .  have you noticed .   agnes thought  i know nanny keeps looking at little esme as if she   s trying to make up her mind about something  if that   s what you mean .   well  i think it   s to do with borrowing     she thinks granny   s using the baby to keep an eye on us .   i don   t know .  but something   s happening     the roar ahead grew louder .      there   s a little stream  isn   t there .     said agnes .      that   s right     said nanny .     just here .      the moor fell away .  they stared into the abyss  which didn   t stare back .  it was huge .  white water was just visible far below .  cold damp air blew past their faces .      that can   t be right     said magrat .     that   s wider and deeper than lancre gorge .      agnes looked down into the mist .  it   s a couple of feet deep  perdita told her .  i can see every pebble .      perdita thinks it   s a   well  an optical illusion     agnes said aloud .      she could be right     said nanny .     gnarly ground  see .  bigger on the inside .      magrat picked up a rock and tossed it in .  it bounced off the wall a few times  tumbling end over end  and then nothing was left but a stony echo .  the river was too far down even to see the splash .      it   s very realistic  isn   t it     she said weakly .      we could use the bridge     said nanny  pointing .   they regarded the bridge .  it had a certain negative quality .  that is to say  while it was possible at the limits of probability that if they tried to cross the chasm by walking out over thin air this might just work   because of sudden updrafts  or air molecules suddenly all having a crazy idea at the same time   trying to do the same thing via the bridge would clearly be laughable .   there was no mortar in it .  the pillars had been piled up out of rocks laid like a drystone wall  and then a series of big flat stones dropped across the top .  the result would have been called primitive even by people who were too primitive to have a word yet for    primitive .     it creaked ominously in the wind .  they could hear stone grind against stone .      that   s not right     said magrat .     it wouldn   t stand up to a gale .         it wouldn   t stand up to a dead calm     said agnes .     i don   t think it   s really real .         ah  i can see where that   d make crossing it a bit tricky  then     said nanny .   it   s just a slab laid over a ditch  perdita insisted .  i could cart wheel over it .  agnes blinked .      oh  i understand     she said .     this is some sort of test  is it .  it is  isn   t it .  we   re worried  so fear makes it a deep gorge .  perdita   s always confident  so she hardly notices it           i   d like to notice it   s there     said magrat .     it   s a bridge .         we   re wasting time     said agnes .  she strode out over the slabs of stone and stopped halfway .      rocks a bit  but it   s not too bad     she called back .     you just have to        the slab shifted under her  and tipped her off .   she flung out her hands and caught the edge of the stone by sheer luck .  but  strong though her fingers were  a lot of agnes was penduluming underneath .   she looked down .  she didn   t want to  but it was a direction occupying a lot of the world .   the water   s about a foot below you  it really is  said perdita .  all you have to do is drop  and you   d be good at that     agnes looked down again .  the drop was so long that probably no one would hear the splash .  it didn   t just look deep  it felt deep .  clammy air rose around her .  she could feel the sucking emptiness under her feet .      magrat threw a stone down there .     she hissed .   yes  and i saw it fall a few inches .      now  i   m lyin    flat and magrat   s holdin    on to my legs     said nanny ogg conversationally  right above her .     i   m going to grab your wrists and  you know  i reckon if you swings a little sideways you ought to get your foot on one of the stone pillars and you   ll be right as ninepence .         you don   t have to talk to me as if i   m some kind of frightened idiot .     snapped agnes .      just tryin    to be pleasant .         i can   t move my hands .         yes  you can .  see  i   ve got your arm now .         i can   t move my hands .         don   t rush  we   ve got all day     said nanny .     whenever you   re ready .      agnes hung for a while .  she couldn   t even sense her hands now .  that presumably meant that she wouldn   t feel it when her grip slipped .   the stones groaned .      er   nanny .         yep .         can you talk to me a bit more as if i   m some kind of frightened idiot .         okay .         er   why do they say    right as ninepence    .  as opposed to  say  tenpence .         interestin    .  maybe it   s           and can you speak up .  perdita   s shouting at me that if i drop eighteen inches i   ll be standing in the stream .         do you think she   s right .         not about the eighteen inches .      the bridge creaked .      people seldom are     said nanny .     are you getting anywhere  dear .  only i can   t lift you up  you see .  and my arms are going numb  too .         i can   t reach the pillar .         then let go     said magrat  from somewhere behind nanny .      magrat .     snapped nanny .      well  perhaps it is only a little stream to perdita .  gnarly ground can be two things at the same time  can   t it .  so if that   s how she sees it   well  can   t you let her get on with it .  let her sort it out .  can   t you let her take over .         she only does that when i   m really under stress .  shut up .         i only           not you  her .  oh no        her left hand  white and almost numb  pulled itself off the stone and out of nanny   s grip .      don   t let her do this to us .     agnes shrieked .     i   ll fall hundreds of feet onto sharp rocks .         yes  but since you   re going to do that anyway  anything   s worth a try  isn   t it .     said nanny .     i should shut your eyes  if i was you        the right hand came loose .   agnes shut her eyes .  she fell .   perdita opened her eyes .  she was standing in the stream .      damn .     and agnes would never say    damn     which was why perdita did so at every suitable occasion .   she reached up to the slab just above her  got a grip  and hauled herself up .  then  catching sight of nanny ogg   s expression  she jerked her hands around into a new position and kicked her legs up .   that stupid agnes never realizes how strong she is  perdita thought .  there   s all these muscles she   s afraid of using     she pushed gently until her toes pointed at the sky and she was doing a handstand on the edge .  the effect  she felt  was spoilt by her skirt falling over her eyes .     you   ve still got that tear in yer knickers     said nanny sharply .   perdita flicked herself onto her feet .   magrat had her eyes tight shut .     she didn   t do a handstand on the edge  did she .         she did     said nanny .     now then  a   perdita  stop that showing off  we   ve wasted too much time .  let agnes have the body back  you know it   s hers really        perdita did a cartwheel .     this body   s wasted on her     she said .     and you should see the stuff she eats .  do you know she   s still got two shelves full of soft toys .  and dolls .  and she wonders why she can   t get along with boys .         nothing like being stared at by a teddy bear to put a young man off his stroke     said nanny ogg .     remember old mrs .  sleeves  magrat .  used to need two of us when she had one of her nasty turns .         what   s that got to do with toys .     said perdita suspiciously .      and what   s it   oh yes     said magrat .      now  i recall that old bellringer down in ohulan     said nanny  leading the way .     he had no fewer than seven personalities in his head .  three of    em were women and four of    em were men .  poor old chap .  he said he was always the odd one out .  he said they let him get on with all the work and the breathin    and eatin    and they had all the fun .  remember .  he said it was hellish when he had a drink and they all started fightin    for a tastebud .  sometimes he couldn   t hear himself think in his own head  he said   now .  now .  now .      agnes opened her eyes .  her jaw hurt .   nanny ogg was peering at her closely  while rubbing some feeling back into her wrist .  from a couple of inches away  her face looked like a friendly pile of elderly laundry .      yes  that   s agnes     she said  standing back .     her face goes sharper when it   s the other one .  see .  i told you she   d be the one that came back .  she   s got more practice .      magrat let go of her arms .  agnes rubbed her chin .      that hurt     she said reproachfully .      just a bit of tough love     said nanny .     can   t have that perdita running around at a time like this .         you just sort of grabbed the bridge and came right back up     said magrat .      i felt her stand on the ground .     said agnes .      and that too  then     said nanny .     come on .  not far now .  sometimes .  and let   s just take it easy  shall we .  some of us might have further to fall than others .      they edged forward  despite an increasingly insistent voice in agnes   s head that kept telling her she was being a stupid coward and of course she wouldn   t be hurt .  she tried to ignore it .   the caves that agnes remembered hadn   t been much more than rock overhangs .  these were caverns .  the difference is basically one of rugged and poetic grandeur .  these had a lot of both .      gnarly ground   s a bit like icebergs     said nanny  leading them up a little gully to one of the largest .      nine tenths of it is under water .     said agnes .  her chin still hurt .      there   s more to it than meets the eye  i mean .         there   s someone there .     said magrat .      oh  that   s the witch     said nanny .     she   s not a problem .      light from the entrance fell on a hunched figure  sitting among pools of water .  closer to  it looked like a statue  and perhaps not quite as human as the eye at first suggested .  water glistened on it  drops formed on the end of the long hooked nose and fell into a pool with the occasional plink .      i come up here with a young wizard once  when i was a girl     said nanny .     he liked nothing so much as bashing at rocks with his little hammer   well  almost nothing     she added  with a smile toward the past and then a happy sigh .     he said the witch was just a lot of ol    stuff from the rocks  left there by the water drippin    .  but my granny said it was a witch that sat up here to think about some big spell  and she turned to stone .  person   ly  i keep an open mind .         it   s a long way to bring someone     said agnes .      oh  there was a lot of us kids at home and it was rainin    a lot and you need a lot of privacy for really good geology     said nanny vaguely .     i think his hammer   s still around here somewhere .  he quite forgot about it after a while .  mind how you tread  the rocks is very slippery .  how   s young esme doing  magrat .         oh  gurgling away .  i   ll have to feed her soon .         we   ve got to look after her     said nanny .      well  yes .  of course .      nanny clapped her hands together and pulled them apart gently .  the glow between them wasn   t the showy light that wizards made  but a grainy graveyard glimmer .  it was just enough to ensure that no one fell down a hole .      probably some dwarfs in a place like this     said magrat  as they picked their way along a tunnel .      shouldn   t think so .  they don   t like places that don   t stay the same .  no one comes up here now but animals and granny when she wants to be alone with her thoughts .         and you when you were banging rocks     said magrat .      hah .  but it was different then .  there was flowers on the moor and the bridge was just stepping stones .  that   s    cos i was in love .         you mean it really does change because of the way you feel .     said agnes .      you spotted it .  it   s amazing how high and rocky the bridge can be if you   re in a bad mood  i know that .         i wonder how high it was for granny  then .         probably clouds could go underneath  girl .      nanny stopped where the path forked  and then pointed .      i reckon she   s gone this way .  hold on        she thrust out an arm .  stone groaned  and a slab of roof thudded down  throwing up spray and pebbles .      so we   ll just have to climb over this bit  then     nanny went on  in the same matter of fact tone of voice .      something   s trying to push us out     said agnes .      but it won   t     said nanny .     and i don   t think it   ll harm us .         that was a big slab .     said agnes .      yeah .  but it missed us  didn   t it .      there was an underground river farther on  sheer white water blurred with speed .  it poured around and almost over a dam of driftwood  topped by an inviting long log .      look  this isn   t safe for the baby .     said agnes .     do you both see that .  you   re her mother  magrat .         yes  i know  i was there     said magrat  with infuriating calm .     but this doesn   t feel unsafe .  granny   s here somewhere .         that   s right     said nanny .     really close now  i think .         yes  but she can   t control rivers and rocks       agnes began .      here .  dunno .  very   responsive place  this .      they inched their way across the log  passing the baby from one to the other .   agnes leaned against the stone wall .     how much farther .         well  tecnic   ly a few inches     said nanny .     that   s helpful to know  isn   t it .         is it just me     said magrat     or is it getting warmer .         now that     said agnes  pointing ahead     i don   t believe .      at the end of a slope a crevasse has opened in the rock .  red light spilled out of it .  as they stared at it  a ball of flame rolled up and burst across the ceiling .      oh deary deary me     said nanny  who had taken a turn to carry the baby .     an    it   s not even as if there   s any volcanoes anywhere near here .  what can she be thinking .     she headed purposefully toward the fire .      careful .     agnes shouted .     perdita says it   s real .         what   s that got to do with the price of fish .     said nanny  and stepped into the fire .   the flames snapped out .   the other two stood in the chilly  damp gloom .   magrat shuddered .     nanny  you are carrying the baby .         the harm you come to here is what you brings with you     said nanny .     and it   s granny   s thoughts that are shaping this place .  but she wouldn   t raise a hand to a child .  couldn   t do it .  hasn   t got it in her .         this place is reacting to what she   s thinking .     said agnes .      i reckon so     said nanny  setting off again .      i   d hate to be inside her head .         you nearly are     said nanny .     come on .  we   ve passed the fire .  i don   t think there   ll be anything else .      they found her in a cavern .  it had sand on the floor  smooth and unmarked by anything except one set of footprints .  her hat had been placed neatly beside her .  her head rested on a rolled up sack .  she held a card in stiff hands .   it read   goe away     that is not very helpful     said magrat  and sat down with the baby across her lap .     after all this  too .         can   t we wake her up .     said agnes .      that   s dangerous     said nanny ogg .     trying to call her back when she ain   t ready to come .  tricky .         well  can we at least take her out of here .         she won   t bend round corners but  hah  maybe we could use her as a bridge     said nanny .     no  she came here for a reason        she pulled the sack out from under granny   s head  which did not move  and opened it .      wrinkly apple  bottle of water and a cheese sandwich you could bend horseshoes round     she said .     and her old box .      she set it down on the floor between them .      what is in there .     said agnes .      oh  keepsakes .  memorororabililia  like i said .  that sort of thing     said nanny .     she always says it   s full of things she   s got no further use for .     she drummed her fingers on the box as if accompanying a thought on the piano  and then picked it up .      should you do that .     said agnes .      no     said nanny .  she lifted out a bundle of papers tied with ribbon and put them on one side .   they all saw the light shining up from underneath .  nanny reached in and took out a small glass medicine bottle  tightly corked  and held it up .  a little glow inside was quite bright in the gloom of the cave .      seen this bottle before     said nanny .     she   s got all kinds of odds and ends in here .  never noticed it glowing  though .      agnes took the bottle .  inside there was what looked like a piece of fern  or   no  it was a feather  quite black except for the very tip which was as yellow and bright as a candle flame .      do you know what it is .         no .  she   s always pickin    up stuff .  she   s had the bottle a long time     cos i   ve seen it in there           i faw her fick it uff       magrat removed a safety pin from her mouth .     i saw her pick that thing up years ago     she tried again .     it was around this time of year  too .  we were walking back through the woods and there was a shooting star and this sort of light fell off it and we went to look and there it was .  it looked like a flame but she was able to pick it up .         sounds like a firebird feather     said nanny .     there used to be old stories about them .  they pass through here .  but if you touch their feathers  you   d better be damn sure of yourself  because the old stories say they burn in the presence of evil           firebird .  you mean a phoenix .     said agnes .     hodgesaargh was going on about one .         haven   t seen one go over for years     said nanny .     sometimes you   d see two or three at a time when i was girl  just lights flying high up in the sky .         no  no  the phoenix   there   s only one of it  that   s the whole point     said agnes .      one of anything   s no bloody use     said nanny .   granny weatherwax smacked her lips  like someone emerging from a very deep sleep .  her eyelids flickered .      ah  i knew opening her box   d work     said nanny happily .   granny weatherwax   s eyes opened .  she stared straight up for a moment  and then swiveled them toward nanny ogg .      w   t   r     she mumbled .  agnes hastily passed her the water bottle .  she touched granny   s fingers  and they were as chilly as stone .   the old witch took a gulp .      oh .  it   s you three     she whispered .     why did you come here .         you told us to     said agnes .      no i didn   t .     granny snapped .     wrote you a note  did i .         no  but the stuff       agnes stopped .     well  we thought you wanted us to .         three witches .     said granny .     well  no reason why not .  the maiden  the mother and the           go carefully     nanny ogg warned .         the other one     said granny .     that   s up to you  i   m sure .  it   s not something about which i would venture any sort of opinion .  so i expect you   ve got some dancin    to be doing  and good day to you .  i   ll have my pillow back  thank you very much .         you know there   s vampires in lancre .     nanny demanded .      yes .  they got invited .         you know they   re taking over .         yes .         so why did you run away up here .     said agnes .   the temperature of a deep cave should remain constant  but suddenly this one was a lot colder .      i can go where i like     said granny .      yes  but you ought       agnes began .  she wished she could bite the word back  but it was too late .      oh  ought  is it .  where does it say ought .  i don   t remember it saying ought anywhere .  anyone going to tell me where it says ought .  there   s lots of things that ought  i dare say .  but they ain   t .         you know a magpie stole your invite .     said nanny .     shawn delivered it okay  but them thieving devils had it away and into a nest .      she flourished the crumpled  smudged yet gold laden invitation .   in the moment of silence agnes fancied she could hear the stalactites grow .      yes  of course i did     said granny .     worked that out first thing .     but the moment had been just slightly too long  and just slightly too quiet .      and you know verence got an omnian priest in to do the naming of young esme .      again   fractionally too long  infinitesimally too silent .      you know i put my mind to business     said granny .  she glanced at the baby sitting on magrat   s lap .      why   s she got a pointy head .     she said .      it   s the little hood nanny knitted for her     said magrat .     it   s meant to look like that .  would you like to hold her .         she looks comfortable where she is     said granny diffidently .   she didn   t know the baby   s name .  perdita whispered .  i told you .  nanny thinks granny   s been in the baby   s mind  i can tell by the way she   s been looking at her  but if she did she   d know the name and she doesn   t  i swear .  she wouldn   t do anything that might hurt a child     granny shook herself .     anyway  if there   s a problem  well  you   ve got your three witches .  it doesn   t say anywhere that one of them ought     she nodded at agnes     to be granny weatherwax .  you sort it out .  i   ve been witching in these parts for altogether too long and it   s time to   move on   do something else           you   re going to hide up here .     said magrat .      i   m not going to keep on repeating myself  my girl .  people aren   t going to tell me what i ought to do no more .  i know what   s ought and what   s not .  your husband invited vampires into the country  did he .  that   s modern for you .  well  everyone else knows that a vampire don   t have no power over you    less you invite it in  and if it   s a king as does the inviting  then they   ve got their teeth into the whole country .  and i   m an ol    woman living in the woods and i   ve got to make it all better .  when there   s three of you .  i   ve had a lifetime of ought from can to can   t and now it   s over  and i   ll thank you for gettin    out of my cave .  and that   s an end of it .      nanny glanced at the other two and shrugged .      come on  then     she said .     if we get a wiggle on we can be back at the broomsticks before dark .         is that all .     said magrat .      things come to an end     said granny .     i   m going to rest up here and then i   m on my way .  plenty of places to go .      now get her to tell you the truth  said perdita .  agnes bit down .  ought had been bad enough .      so we   ll be getting along     said nanny .     come on .         but           but me no buts     said nanny .     as granny would have said .         that   s right .     said granny  lying back .   as they filed back into the caves agnes heard perdita start counting .   magrat patted her pockets .  nanny patted her knickerlegs .   magrat said     oh  i must have le           blow  i left my pipe back there     said nanny  so quickly that the sentence overtook the one in front .   five seconds  said perdita .     i didn   t see you take it out     said agnes .   nanny gave her a piercing look .     really .  then i   d better go and leave it there  hadn   t i .  was there something you   d left too  magrat .  never mind  i   ll be sure to look for it  whatever it was going to be .         well .     said magrat  as nanny darted back .      granny was certainly not telling the truth     said agnes .      of course she wasn   t  she never does     said magrat .     she expects you to work it out for yourself .         but she   s right about us being three witches .         yes  but i never intended to come back to it  i   ve got other things to do .  oh  perhaps when esme   s older i thought  maybe  a bit of part time aromatherapy or something  but not serious full time witching .  this power of three business is   well  it   s very old fashioned        and what have we got now .  perdita chimed in .  the knowing but technically inexperienced young woman  the harassed young mother and the silver haired golden ager   doesn   t exactly sound mythic  does it .  but magrat just bundled up her little baby as soon as she heard granny was in trouble and she didn   t even stop to worry about her husband        wait a moment   listen     said agnes .      what for .         just listen   the sound echoes in these caves            nanny ogg sat down on the sand and wriggled slightly to settle in firmly .  she took out her pipe .      so     she said to the recumbent figure     apart from all that  how are you feeling .      there was no reply .      saw mrs .  patternoster this morning     nanny went on chattily .     her from over in slice .  just passed the time of day .  mrs .  ivy is bearing up well  she says .      she blew out a cloud of smoke .      i put her right about a few things     she said .   there was still silence from the shadowy figure .      the naming went off all right .  the priest   s as wet as a snow omelet  though .         i can   t beat    em  gytha     said granny .     i can   t beat    em  and that   s a fact .      one of nanny ogg   s hidden talents was knowing when to say nothing .  it left a hole in the conversation that the other person felt obliged to fill .      they   ve got minds like steel .  i can   t touch    em .  i   ve been tryin    everything .  every trick i   ve got .  they   ve been searching for me but they can   t focus right when i   m in here .  the best one nearly got to me at the cottage .  my cottage .      nanny ogg understood the horror .  a witch   s cottage was her fortress .      i   ve never felt anything like it  gytha .  he   s had hundreds of years to get good .  you noticed the magpies .  he   s using    em as eyes .  and he   s clever  too .  he   s not going to fall to a garlic sandwich  that one .  i can pick up that much .  these vampires has learned .  that   s what they   ve never done before .  i can   t find a way into    em anywhere .  they   re more powerful  stronger  they think quick   i tell you  going mind to mind with him   s like spittin    at a thunderstorm .         so what   re you going to do .         nothing .  there   s nothing i can do .  can   t you understand what i   ve been tellin    you .  don   t you know i   ve been lying here all day tryin    to think of something .  they know all about magic  borrowing   s second nature to them  they   re fast  they think we   re like cattle that can talk   i never expected anything like this  gytha .  i   ve thought about it round and round and there   s not a thing i can see to do .         there   s always a way     said nanny .      i can   t see it     said granny .     this is it  gytha .  i might as well lie here until the water drips on me and i go into stone like the ol    witch at the door .         you   ll find a way     said nanny .     weatherwaxes don   t let    em selves get beaten .  it   s something in the blood  like i   ve always said .         i am beaten  gytha .  even before i start .  maybe someone else has a way  but i haven   t .  i   m up against a mind that   s better   n mine .  i just about keep it away from me but i can   t get in .  i can   t fight back .      the chilly feeling crept over nanny ogg that granny weather wax meant it .      i never thought i   d hear you say that     she muttered .      off you go .  no sense in keepin    the baby out in the cold .         and what are you going to do .         maybe i shall move on .  maybe i   ll just stop here .         can   t stop here forever  esme .         ask her that is by the door .      that seemed to be all there was going to be .  nanny walked out  found the others looking slightly too innocent in the next cave  and led the way to the open air .      found your pipe  then     said magrat .      yes  thank you .         what   s she going to do .     said agnes .      you tell me     said nanny .     i knows you was listenin    .  you wouldn   t be witches if you wasn   t listenin    somehow .         well  what can we do that she can   t .  if she   s beaten  then so are we  aren   t we .         what did granny mean     from can to can   t    .     said magrat .      oh  from the first moment in the morning when you can see to the last moment in the evenin    when you can   t     said nanny .      she   s really feeling low  isn   t she .      nanny paused by the stone witch .  her pipe had gone out .  she struck a match on the hooked nose .      there   s three of us     she said .     the right number .  so we   ll start by having a proper coven meetin              aren   t you worried .     said agnes .     she   s   giving up           then it   s up to us to carry on  isn   t it .     said nanny .       nanny had placed the cauldron in the middle of the floor for the look of the thing  although an indoor coven meeting didn   t feel right  and one without granny weatherwax felt worse .   perdita said it made them look like soppy girls playing at it .  the only fire in the room was in the huge black iron range  the very latest model  recently installed for nanny by her loving sons .  on it  the kettle began to boil .      i   ll make the tea  shall i .     said magrat  getting up .      no  you sit down .  it   s agnes   s job to make the tea     said nanny .     you   re the mother  so it   s your job to pour .         what   s your job  nanny .     said agnes .      i drinks it     said nanny promptly .     right .  we   ve got to find out more while they   re still actin    friendly .  agnes  you go back to the castle with magrat and the baby .  she needs extra help anyway .         what good will that do .         you told me yourself     said nanny .     vampires don   t affect you .  as soon as they try to see agnes   s mind it sinks down and up pops perdita like a seesaw .  just when they   re looking at perdita  here comes agnes again .  young vlad   s definitely got his eye on you  ain   t he .         certainly not .         yeah  right     said nanny .     men always like women that   ve got a bit of mystery to    em .  they like a challenge  see .  and while he   s got his eye on you keeping your eye on magrat  you   ve got your other eye on him  understand .  everyone   s got a weakness .  maybe we   ll not see the back of these vampires by going over to the curtains and saying    my  isn   t it stuffy in here     but there   s got to be some other way .         and if there isn   t .         marry him     said nanny firmly .  magrat gasped .  the teapot rattled in her hand .      that   s horrible .     she said .      i   d rather kill myself     said agnes .  in the morning  said perdita .      dun   t have to be a long marriage     said nanny .     put a pointy stake in your garter and our lad   ll be getting cold even before they   ve finished cutting up the wedding cake .         nanny .         or maybe you could just sort of   make him change his ways a bit     nanny went on .     it   s amazing what a wife can do if she knows her own mind  or minds in your case  o   course .  take king verence the first  for one .  he used to toss all his meat bones over his shoulder until he was married and the queen made him leave them on the side of the plate .  i   d only bin married to the first mr .  ogg for a month before he was getting out of the bath if he needed to pee .  you can refine a husband .  maybe you could point him in the direction of blutwurst and black puddings and underdone steak .         you really haven   t got any scruples  have you  nanny     said agnes .      no     said nanny  simply .     this is lancre we   re talkin    about .  if we was men  we   d be talking about layin    down our lives for the country .  as women  we can talk about laying down .         i just don   t want to hear this     said magrat .      i ain   t asking her to do what i wouldn   t do     said nanny .      really .  then why           because no one wants me to do it     said nanny .     but if i was fifty years younger i reckon i could have sonny jim bitin    turnips by midsummer .         you mean just because she   s a woman she should use sexual wiles on him .     said magrat .     this is so   so   well  it   s so nanny ogg  that   s all i can say .         she should use any wile she can lay her hands on     said nanny .     i don   t care what granny said  there   s always a way .  like the hero in tsort or wherever it was  who was completely invincible except for his heel and someone stuck a spear in it and killed him           what are you expecting her to do  prod him all over .         i never understood that story  anyway     said nanny .     i mean  if i knew i   d got a heel that would kill me if someone stuck a spear in it  i   d go into battle wearing very heavy boots           you don   t know what he   s like     said agnes  ignoring the diversion .     he looks at me as if he   s undressing me with his eyes .         eyes is allowed     said nanny .      and he   s laughing at me all the time .  as if he knows i don   t like him and that adds to the fun .         now you get into that castle .     nanny growled .     for lancre .  for the king .  for everyone in the country .  and if he gets too much  let perdita take over     cos i reckon there   s some things she   s better at .      in the shocked silence  there was a faint clinking noise from nanny   s sideboard .   magrat coughed .     j just like a the old days     she said .     arguing all the time .      nanny stood up and unhooked a cast iron saucepan from the beam over the kitchen range .      you can   t treat people like this     said agnes  sullenly .      i can     said nanny  tiptoeing in the direction of the sideboard .     i   m the other one now  see .      ornaments flew and shattered as she brought the saucepan down hard  bottom upward .      got you  you little blue devil .     she shouted .     don   t think i didn   t see you .      the saucepan rose .  nanny leaned her weight on the handle but it still moved slowly along the dresser  rocking slightly from side to side  until it reached the edge .   something red and blue dropped onto the floor and started moving toward the closed door .   at the same time greebo shot past agnes  accelerating .  and then  just as he was about to spring  he changed his mind .  all four feet extended their claws at the same time and bit into the floorboards .  he rolled  sprang onto his feet  stopped  and started to wash himself .   the red and blue blur hit the door and picked itself up  becoming a blue man  six inches tall  with red hair .  he carried a sword about the same size as himself .      ach  hins tak yer scaggie  yer dank yowl callyake .     he screamed .      oh  it   s you     said nanny  relaxing .     do you want a drink .      the sword was lowered slightly  but with a definite hint that it could be raised again at a moment   s notice .         tazit .      nanny reached down to the crate by her chair and sorted through the bottles .      scumble .  my best .  vintage     she said .   the wee man   s tiny eyes lit up .     las    tuesda .         right .  agnes  open that sewing box and pass me a thimble  will you .  come away here  man     said nanny  uncorking the bottle well away from the fire and filling up the thimble .     ladies  this here   s   let   s see them tattoos   yeah  this here   s one of the nac mac feegle .  the little bastards comes down and raids my still about once a year .         yings  yow graley yin .  suz ae rikt dheu     said the blue man  taking the thimble .      what is he .     said magrat .      they   re gnomes     said nanny .   the man lowered the thimble .     pictsies .         pixies  if you insist     said nanny .     they live up on the high moors over toward uberwald           ach .  bae  yon snae rikt speel  y   ol behennit .  feggers .  yon ken sweal boggin bludsuckers owl dhu tae        nanny nodded while she listened .  halfway through the little man   s rant she topped up his thimble .      ah  right     she said  when he seemed to have finished .     well  he says the nac mac feegle have been forced out by the vampires  see .  they   ve been driving all the       her lips moved as she tried out various translations        old people           that   s very cruel .     said magrat .      no   i mean   old races .  the people that live in   the corners .  you know  the ones you don   t see around a lot   centaurs  bogeys  gnomes           pictsies .         yeah  right   driving    em out of the country .         why should they do that .         probably not fashionable anymore     said nanny .   agnes looked hard at the pixie .  on a scale of ethereal from one to ten he looked as if he was on some other scale  probably one buried in deep ocean sludge .  the blueness of his skin  she could see now  was made up of tattoos and paint .  his red hair stuck out at all angles .  his sole concession to the temperature was a leather loincloth .  he saw her looking at him .      yist  awa    fra    yeeks  ye stawking gowt that   ya .  bigjobs .         er  sorry     said agnes .      good language  ain   t it .     said nanny .     a hint o    heather and midden .  but when you   ve got the nac mac feegle on your side  you   re doing okay .      the pixie waved the empty thimble at nanny .      ghail o    bludy    lemonade     callyake .         ah  no foolin    you  you want the real stuff     said nanny .  she pulled back a chair cushion  and produced a black glass bottle with its cork held on by wire .      you   re not giving him that  are you .     said magrat .     that   s your medicinal whisky .         and you always tell people it   s strictly for external use only     said agnes .      ah  the nac mac feegle are a hardheaded race     said nanny  handing it down to the tiny man .  to agnes   s amazement  he grasped a bottle bigger than himself with insolent ease .     there you go  man .  share it with your mates     cos i know they   re around here somewhere .      there was a clink from the dresser .  the witches looked up .  hundreds of pixies had simply appeared among the ornaments .  most of them wore pointed hats that curved so that the point was practically pointing down  and they all carried swords .      amazin    how they can just fade into the foreground like that     said nanny .     that   s what   s kept    em so safe all these years .  that and killin    most people who saw    em  of course .      greebo  very quietly  went and sat under her chair .      so   you gentlemen have been turned out by the vampires  have ye .     said nanny  as the bottle bobbed through the throng .  a roar went up .      blaznet .         ach  yon weezit fash    deveel .         arnoch  a hard tickut .         bigjobs .         i daresay you can stop in lancre     said nanny  above the din .      just a moment  nanny       magrat began .   nanny waved a hand at her hurriedly .     there   s that island up on the lake     she went on  raising her voice .     it   s where the herons nest .  just the place  eh .  lots of fish  lots of hunting up the valley .      the blue pixies went into a huddle .  then one of them looked up .      priznae .  yowl   s nae brennit  moy ghail .         oh  you   d be left to yourself     said nanny .     but no stealing cattle  eh .         these steal cattle .     said agnes .     full size cattle .  how many of them does it take .         four .         four .         one under each foot .  seen    em do it .  you see a cow in a field  mindin    its own business  next minute the grass is rustlin     some little bugger shouts    hup  hup  hup    and the poor beast goes past voom .  without its legs movin        said nanny .     they   re stronger   n cockroaches .  you step on a pixie  you   d better be wearing good thick soles .         nanny  you can   t give them the island .  it doesn   t belong to you .     said magrat .      it doesn   t belong to anyone     said nanny .      it belongs to the king .         ah .  well  what   s his is yours  so give    em the island and verence can sign a bit o    paper later on .  it   s worth it     nanny added .     a rent of not stealing our cows is well worth it .  otherwise you   ll see cows zippin    around very fast .  backward  sometimes .         without their legs moving .     said agnes .      right .         well       magrat began .      and they   ll be useful     nanny added  lowering her voice .     fighting   s what they like best .         whist  yon fellaight fra    aquesbore .         drinkin   s what they like best     nanny corrected herself .      nae  hoon a scullen .         drinkin    and fightin   s what they like best     said nanny .      an    snaflin    coobeastie .         and stealing cows     said nanny .     drinkin     fightin    and stealin    cows is what they like best .  listen  magrat  i   d rather have    em in here pissin    out than outside pissin    in .  there   s more of them and they   ll make your ankles all wet .         but what can they do .     said magrat .      well   greebo   s frightened of    em     said nanny .   greebo was two worried eyes  one yellow  one pearly white  in the shadows .  the witches were impressed .  greebo had once brought down an elk .  there was practically nothing that he wouldn   t attack  including architecture .      i   d have thought they   d have no trouble with vampires  then     said agnes .      ach  c   na flitty flitty .  ye think we   re flowers o    the forest fairies .     sneered a blue man .      they can   t fly     said nanny .      it   s quite a nice island  even so       magrat mumbled .      gel  your husband was messin    around with politics  which is why we   re in this trouble  and to get you   ve got to give .  now he   s ill and you   re queen so you can do as you like  right .  there   s no one who can tell you what to do  isn   t that so .         yes  i suppos           so damn well give    em the island and then they   ve got somethin    here to fight for .  otherwise they   ll just push on through anyway and nick all our livestock on the way .  dress that up in fancy talk  and you   ve got politics .         nanny .     said agnes .      yup .         don   t get angry  but you don   t think granny   s doing this on purpose  do you .  keeping back  i mean  so that we have to form a three and work together .         why   d she do that .         so we develop insights and pull together and learn valuable lessons     said magrat .   nanny paused with his pipe halfway to her lips .     no     she said     i don   t reckon granny   d be thinking like that  because that   s soppy garbage .  here  you blokes   here   s the key to the drinks cupboard in the scullery .  bugger off and have fun  don   t touch the stuff in the green bottles  because it   s   oh  i expect you   ll be all right .      there was a blue blur  and the room was cleared .      we got things granny ain   t got     said nanny .      yes .     said agnes .      magrat   s got a baby .  i   ve got no scruples .  and we   ve both got you .         what good will i be .         well  for one thing   you   re in two minds about everything        there was a tinkle of glass from the scullery  and a scream of    ach  ya skivens .  yez lukin    at a faceful o    heid .         crives .  sezu .  helweit .  summun hol    me cote .  gude .  now  summun hol    his arms .         stitch this  f   ra ma brinnit goggel .     some more glass broke .      we   ll all go back into the castle     said nanny .     on our terms .  face this count down .  and we   ll take garlic and lemons and all the other stuff .  and some of mr .  oats   s holy water .  you can   t tell me all that stuff together won   t work .         and they   ll let us in  will they .     said agnes .      they   ll have a lot to think about     said nanny .     what with a mob at the gates .  we can nip in round the back .         what mob .     said magrat .      we   ll organize one     said nanny .      you don   t organize a mob  nanny     said agnes .     a mob is something that happens spontaneously .      nanny ogg   s eyes gleamed .      there   s seventy nine oggs in these parts     she said .     spon taneous it is  then .      her gaze fell for a moment on the forest of familial pictures  and then she removed a boot and hammered on the wall beside her .  after a few seconds they heard a door bang and footsteps pass in front of the window .   jason ogg  blacksmith and head male of the ogg clan  poked his head around the front door .      yes  mum .         there   s going to be a spontaneous mob stormin    the castle in  oh  half an hour     said nanny .     put the word out .         yes  mum .         tell every one i said it ain   t compuls   ry for them to be there  of course     nanny added .  jason glanced at the hierarchy of oggs .  nanny didn   t have to add anything more to that sentence .  everyone knew the cat   s box sometimes needed lining .      yes  mum .  i   ii tell    em you said they didn   t have to come if they don   t want to .         good boy .         is it flaming torches or  you know  scythes and stuff .         that   s always tricky     said nanny .     but i   d say both .         battering ram  mum .         er   no  i don   t think so .         good .  it is my door  after all     said magrat .      anythin    special for people to yell  mum .         oh  general yellin     i think .         anything to throw .         just rocks on this occasion     said nanny .      not large ones .     said magrat .     some of the stonework around the main gate is quite fragile .         okay  nothin    harder than sandstone  understand .  and tell our kev roll out a barrel of my number three beer     said nanny .     better pour a bottle of brandy in it to keep out the chill .  it can really strike right through your coat when you   re hanging around outside a castle chantin    and wavin    .  and get our nev to run up to poorchick   s and say mrs .  ogg presents her compliments and we want half a dozen big cheeses and ten dozen eggs  and tell mrs .  carter will she be so good as to let us have a big jar of those pickled onions she does so well .  it   s a shame that we have not time to roast something  but i suppose you have to put up with that sort of inconvenience when you   re being spontaneous .     nanny ogg winked at agnes     yes  mum .         nanny .     said magrat  when jason had hurried away .      yes  dear .         a couple of months ago  when verence suggested that tax on liquor exports  there was a big crowd protesting in the courtyard and he said     oh well  if that   s the will of the people              well  it was the will of the people     said nanny .      oh .  right .  good .         only sometimes they temp   ry forget what their will is     said nanny .     now  you can leave young esme next door with jason   s wife           i   m keeping her with me     said magrat .     she   s happy enough on my back .         you can   t do that .     said agnes .      don   t you dare argue with me  agnes nitt     said magrat  drawing herself up .     and not a word out of you  nanny .         wouldn   t dream of it     said nanny .     the nac mac feegle always take their babies into battle  too .  mind you  for use as a weapon if it comes to it .      magrat relaxed a little .     she said her first word this morning     she said  looking proud .      what  at fourteen days .     said nanny doubtfully .      yes .  it was    blup .            blup .         yes .  it was   more of a bubble than a word  i suppose .         let   s get the stuff together     said nanny  standing up .     we   re a coven  ladies .  we   re a trio .  i miss granny as much as you do  but we   ve got to deal with things as she would .     she took a few deep breaths .     i can   t be having with this .         it sounds better the way she says it     said agnes .      i know .          hodgesaargh ate his meal in the servants    dining room off the kitchen  and ate alone .  there were new people around  but hodge saargh generally didn   t pay much attention to non falconers .  there were always other people in the castle  and they had jobs to do  and if pressed hodgesaargh would vaguely acknowledge the fact that if he left his laundry in a sack by the kitchen door every week  it   d be washed and dried two days later .  there were his meals .  the game he left on the cold slab in the long pantry got dealt with .  and so on .   he was returning to the mews when one of the shadows pulled him into the darkness  with a hand clamped over his mouth .      mph .         it   s me .  mrs .  ogg     said nanny .     you all right  hodgesaargh .         mph     and by this  hodgesaargh contrived to indicate that he was fine except for someone   s thumb blocking his breathing .      where are the vampires .         mph .      nanny released her grip .      vampires .     the falconer panted .     they the ones that walk around slowly .         no  that   s the   food     said nanny .     any swish looking buggers about as well .  any soldiers .      there was a soft thud from somewhere in the shadows  and someone said    blast  i   ve dropped the nappy bag .  did you see where it rolled .         er  there   s some new ladies and gentlemen     said hodge saargh .     they   re hanging around the kitchens .  there   s some men in chain mail  too .         damn .     said nanny .      there   s the little door off the main hall     said magrat .     but that   s always locked on the inside .      agnes swallowed .     all right .  i   ll go in and unlock it  then .      nanny tapped her on the shoulder .     you   ll be all right .         well  they can   t control me           they can grab you  though .      vlad won   t want you hurt  said perdita .  you saw the way he looked at us        i   think i   ll be all right     said agnes .      you know your own minds best  i   m sure     said nanny .     got the holy water .         let   s hope it works better than the garlic     said agnes .      good luck .     nanny cocked her head .     sounds like the mob is spontaneously arriving at the gate .  go .      agnes ran off into the rain  around the castle to the doors of the kitchen .  they were wide open .  she made it to the corridor beyond the kitchens when a hand grabbed her shoulder  and then in a blur of speed two young men were standing in front of her .   they were dressed something like the young opera goers she   d seen in ankh morpork  except that their fancy waistcoats would have been considered far too fast by the staider members of the community  and they wore their hair long like a poet who hopes that romantically flowing locks will make up for a wretched inability to find a rhyme for    daffodil .         why are you in such a hurry  girl .     one said .   agnes sagged .     look     she said     i   m very busy .  can we speed this up .  can we dispense with all the leers and    i like a girl with spirit    stuff .  can we get right to the bit where i twist out of your grip and kick you in the        one of them struck her hard across the face .      no     he said .      i   ll tell vlad of you .     perdita screamed in agnes   s voice .   the other vampire hesitated .      hah .  yes  he knows me .     said agnes and perdita together .     hah .      one of the vampires looked her up and down .      what  you .     he said .      yes  her     said a voice .   vlad strolled toward them  thumbs hooked into the pockets of his waistcoat .      demone .  crimson .  to me  please .      the two went and stood meekly in front of him .  there was a blur  and then his thumbs were back in his waistcoat and the two vampires were in mid crumple and sinking to the floor .      this is the kind of thing we don   t do to our guests     said vlad  stepping over demone   s twitching body and holding out his hands to agnes .     did they hurt you .  say the word  and i   ll turn them over to lacrimosa .  she   s just discovered you have a torture chamber here .  and to think we thought lancre was backward .         oh  that old thing     said agnes  weakly .  crimson was making bubbling noises .  i didn   t even see his hands move  said perdita .     er   it   s been there for centuries           oh really .  she did say there weren   t enough straps and buckles .  still  she is   inventive .  just say the word .      say the word  perdita prompted  that   d be two less of them .      er   no     said agnes .  ah   moral cowardice from the fat girl .     er   who are they .         oh  we brought some of the clan in on the carts .  they can make themselves useful  father said .         oh .  they   re relatives .     granny weatherwax would   ve said yes  perdita whispered .   vlad coughed gently .     by blood     he said .     yes .  in a way .  but   subservient .  do come this way .      he gently took her arm and led her back up the passage  treading heavily on crimson   s twitching hand as he did do .      you mean vampirism is like   pyramid selling .     said agnes .  she was alone with vlad .  admittedly  this had the edge over being alone with the other two  but somehow at a time like this it seemed vital to hear the sound of her own voice  if only to remind herself that she was alive .      i   m sorry .     said vlad .     who sells pyramids .         no  i mean   you bite five necks  and in two months    time you get a lake of blood of your very own .      he smiled  but a little cautiously .     i can see we will have a lot to learn     he said .     i understood every word in that sentence  but not the sentence itself .  i   m sure there is a lot you could teach me .  and  indeed  i could teach you           no     said agnes  flatly .      but when we   oh  what is that moron doing now .      a cloud of dust was advancing from the direction of the kitchens .  in the middle of it  holding a bucket and a shovel  was igor .      igor .         yeth  marthter .         you   re putting down dust again  aren   t you           yeth  marthter .         and why are you putting down dust  igor .     said vlad icily .      you   ve got to have dutht  marthter .  it   th tradi        igor  mother told you .  we don   t want dust .  we don   t want huge candlesticks .  we don   t want eyeholes cut in all the pictures  and we certainly don   t want your wretched box of damn spiders and your stupid little whip .      in the ringing  red hot silence igor looked down at his feet .         thpiderth webth ith what people ecthpect  marthter       he mumbled .      we don   t want them .            the old count liked my thpiderth       said igor  his voice like some little insect that would nevertheless not be squashed .      it   s ridiculous  igor .            he uthed to thay     good webth today  igor              look  just   just go away  will you .  see if you can   t sort out that dreadful smell from the garderobe .  mother says it makes her eyes water .  and stand up straight and walk properly .     vlad called after him .     no one   s impressed by the limp .      agnes saw igor   s retreating back pause for a moment  and she expected him to say something .  but then he continued his wobbly walk .      he   s such a big baby     said vlad  shaking his head .     i   m sorry you had to see that .         yes  i think i   m sorry too     said agnes .      he   s going to be replaced .  father   s only been keeping him on out of sentiment .  i   m afraid he came with the old castle  along with the creaking roof and the strange smell halfway up the main stairs which  i have to say  is not as bad as the one we   ve noticed here .  oh dear   look at this  will you .  we turn our back for five minutes        there was a huge and very dribbly candle burning in a tall black candlestick .      king verence had all those oil lamps put in  a lovely modern light  and igor   s been going around replacing them with candles again .  we don   t even know where he gets them from .  lacci thinks he saves his earwax        they were in the long room beside the great hall now .  vlad lifted the candlestick up so that the flame   s glow lit the wall .      ah  they   ve put the pictures up .  you ought to get to know the family        the light fell on a portrait of a tall  thin  gray haired man in evening dress and a red lined cloak .  he looked quite distinguished in a distant  aloof sort of way .  there was the glimmer of a lengthened canine on his lower lip .      my great uncle     said vlad .     the last   incumbent .         what   s the sash and star he   s wearing .     said agnes .  she could hear the sounds of the mob  far off but growing louder .      the order of gvot .  he built our family home .  don   tgonearthe castle  we call it .  i don   t know whether you   ve heard of it .         it   s a strange name .         oh  he used to laugh about it .  the local coachmen used to warn visitors  you see .     don   t go near the castle     they   d say .     even if it means spending a night up a tree  never go up there to the castle     they   d tell people .     whatever you do  don   t set foot in that castle .     he said it was marvelous publicity .  sometimes he had every bedroom full by nine p . m .  and people would be hammering on the door to get in .  travelers would go miles out of their way to see what all the fuss was about .  we won   t see his like again  with any luck .  he did rather play to the crowd  i   m afraid .  rose from the grave so often that he had a coffin with a revolving lid .  ah   aunt carmilla        agnes stared at a very severe woman in a figure hugging black dress and deep plum lipstick .      she was said to bathe in the blood of up to two hundred virgins at a time     vlad said .     i don   t believe that .  use more than eighty virgins and even quite a large bath will overflow  lacrimosa tells me .         these little details are important     said agnes  buoyed up by the excitement of terror .     and  of course  it is so hard to find the soap .         killed by a mob  i   m afraid .         people can be so ungrateful .         and this       the light passed along the hall       is my grandfather        a bald head .  dark rimmed  staring eyes .  two teeth like needles  two ears like batwings  fingernails that hadn   t been trimmed for years        but half the picture   s just bare canvas     said agnes .      the family story is that old magyrato got hungry     said vlad .     a very direct approach to things  my grandfather .  see the reddish brown stains just here .  very much in the old style .  and here   well  some distant ancestor  that   s all i know .      this picture was mostly dark varnish .  there was a suggestion of a beak on a hunched figure .   vlad turned away  quickly .     we   ve come a long way  of course     he said .     evolution  father says .         they look very   powerful     said agnes .      oh yes .  so very powerful  and yet so very  very dumb     said vlad .     my father thinks stupidity is somehow built into vampirism  as if the desire for fresh blood is linked to being as thick as a plank .  father is a very unusual vampire .  he and mother raised us   differently .         differently     said agnes .      vampires aren   t very family orientated .  father says that   s natural .  humans are raising their successors  you see  but we live for a very long time so a vampire is raising competitors .  there   s not a lot of family feeling  you could say .         really .     in the depths of her pocket  agnes   s fingers closed around the bottle of holy water .      but father said self help was the only way out .  break the cycle of stupidity  he said .  little traces of garlic were put into our food to get us used to it .  he tried early exposure to various religious symbols   oh dear  we must have had the oddest nursery wallpaper in the world  never mind the jolly frieze of gertie the dancing garlic   and i have to say that their efficacy isn   t that good in any case .  he even made us go out and play during the day .  that which does not kill us  he   d say  makes us strong        agnes   s arm whirled out .  the holy water spiraled out of the bottle and hit vlad full in the chest .   he threw his arms wide and screamed as water cascaded down and poured into his shoes .   she   d never expected it to be this easy .   he raised his head and winked at her .      look at this waistcoat .  will you look at this waistcoat .  do you know what water does to silk .  you just never get it out .  no matter what you do  there   s always a mark .     he looked at her frozen expression  and sighed .      i suppose we   d better get some things off our chest  hadn   t we .     he said .  he looked up at the wall  and took down a very large and spiky ax .  he thrust it at her .      take this and cut my head off  will you .     he said .     look  i   ll loosen my cravat .  don   t want blood on it  do we .  there .  see .         are you trying to tell me that you were brought up with this  too .     she said hotly .     what was it  a little light hatchet practice after breakfast .  cut your head off a little bit every day and the real thing won   t hurt .      vlad rolled his eyes .     everyone knows that cutting off a vampire   s head is internationally acceptable     he said .     i   m sure nanny ogg would be swinging right now .  come along  there   s a lot of muscle in those rather thick arms  i   m        she swung .   he reached around from behind her and whisked the ax out of her arms .         sure     he finished .     we are also very  very fast .      he tested the blade with his thumb .     blunt  i notice .  my dear miss nitt  it may just be more trouble than it   s worth to try to get rid of us  do you see .  now  old magyrato there would not have made the kind of offer we are making to lancre .  dear me  no .  are we ravaging across the country .  no .  forcing our way into bedrooms .  certainly not .  what   s a little blood  for the good of the community .  of course verence will have to be demoted a little but  let   s face it  the man is rather more of a clerk than a king .  and   our friends may find us grateful .  what is the point of resisting .         are vampires ever grateful .         we can learn .         you   re just saying that in exchange for not actually being evil you   ll simply be bad  is that it .         what we are saying  my dear  is that our time has come     said a voice behind them .   they both turned .   the count had stepped into the gallery .  he was wearing a smoking jacket .  there was an armed man strolling on either side of him .      oh dear  vlad   playing with your food .  good evening  miss nitt .  we appear to have a mob at the gates  vlad .         really .  that   s exciting .  i   ve never seen a real mob .         i wish your first could have been a better one     said the count  and sniffed .     there   s no passion in it .  still  it   d be too tiresome to let it go on all through dinner .  i shall tell them to go away .      the doors of the hall swung open without apparent aid .      shall we go and watch .     said vlad .      er  i think i   ll go and powder my  i   ll just go and   i   ll just be a minute     said agnes  backing away .   she darted down the little corridor that led to the small door  and drew the bolts .      about time     said nanny  hurrying in .     it   s really clammy out here .         they   ve gone to look at the mob .  but there   s other vampires here  not just the guards .  the rest must   ve come in on the carts .  they   re like   not quite servants but they take orders .         how many are there .     said magrat .      i haven   t found out .  vlad is trying to get to know me better .         good plan     said nanny .     see if he talks in his sleep .         nanny .         let   s see his lordship in action  shall we .     said nanny .     we can nip into the old guardroom alongside the door and look through the squint .         i want to get verence .     said magrat .      he   s not going anywhere     said nanny  striding into the little room by the door .     and i don   t reckon they   re planning to kill him .  anyway  he   s got some protection now .         i think these really are new vampires     said agnes .     they really aren   t like the old sort .         then we face    em here and now     said nanny .     that   s what esme would do  sure enough .         but are we strong enough .     said agnes .  granny wouldn   t have asked  said perdita .      there   s three of us  isn   t there .     said nanny .  she produced a flask  and uncorked it .     and a bit of help .  anyone else want some .         that   s brandy  nanny .     said magrat .     do you want to face the vampires drunk .         sounds a whole lot better than facin    them sober     said nanny  taking a gulp and shuddering .     only sensible bit of advice agnes got from mister oats  i reckon .  vampire hunters need to be a little bit tipsy  he said .  well  i always listen to good advice            even inside mightily oats   s tent the candle streamed in the wind .  he sat gingerly on his camp bed  because sudden movements made it fold up with nail blackening viciousness  and leafed through his notebooks in a state of growing panic .   he hadn   t come here to be a vampire expert .     revenants and ungodly creatures    had been a one hour lecture from deaf deacon thrope every fortnight  for om   s sake .  it hadn   t even counted toward the final examination score .  they   d spent twenty times that on comparative theology  and right now he wished  he really wished that they   d found time to tell him  for example  exactly where the heart was and how much force you needed to drive a stake through it .   ah   here they were  a few pages of scribble  saved only because the notes for his essay on thrum   s lives of the prophets were on the other side .         the blood is the life   vampires are subservient to the one who turned them into a vampire   allyl disulphide  active ingredient in garlic   porphyria  lack of .  learned reaction .    native soil v .  important   as many as possible will drink of a victim so that he is the slave of all      clustersuck      blood as an unholy sacrament   vampire controls  bats  rats  creatures of the night  weather   contrary to legend  most victims merely become passive  not vampires   intended vampire suffers terrible torments   craving for blood   socks   garlic  holy icons   sunlight   deadly .    kill vampire  release all victims   physical strength          why hadn   t anyone told them this was important .  he   d covered half the page with a drawing of deacon thrope  which was practically a still life .   oats dropped the book into his pocket and grasped his medallion hopefully .  after four years of theological college he wasn   t at all certain of what he believed  and this was partly because the church had schismed so often that occasionally the entire curriculum would alter in the space of one afternoon .  but also     they had been warned about it .  don   t expect it  they   d said .  it doesn   t happen to anyone except the prophets .  om doesn   t work like that .  om works from inside .      but he   d hoped that  just once  that om would make himself known in some obvious and unequivocal way that couldn   t be mistaken for wind or a guilty conscience .  just once  he   d like the clouds to part for the space of ten seconds and a voice to cry out     yes  mightily praiseworthy are ye who exalteth om oats .  it   s all completely true .  incidentally  that was a very thoughtful paper you wrote on the crisis of religion in a pluralistic society .      it wasn   t that he   d lacked faith .  but faith wasn   t enough .  he   d wanted knowledge .   right now he   d settle for a reliable manual of vampire disposal .   he stood up .  behind him  unheeded  the terrible camp bed sprang shut .   he   d found knowledge  and knowledge hadn   t helped .   had not jotto caused the leviathan of terror to throw itself onto the land and the seas to turn red with blood .  had not orda  strong in his faith  caused a sudden famine throughout the land of smale .   they certainly had .  he believed it utterly .  but a part of him also couldn   t forget reading about the tiny little creatures that caused the rare red tides off the coast of urt and the effect this apparently had on local sea life  and about the odd wind cycle that sometimes kept rainclouds away from smale for years at a time .   this had been   worrying .   it was because he was so very good at old languages that he   d been allowed to study in the new libraries that were springing up around the citadel  and this had been fresh ground for worry  because the seeker after truth had found truths instead .  the third journey of the prophet cena  for example  seemed remarkably like a retranslation of the testament of sand in the laotan book of the whole .  on one shelf alone he found forty three remarkably similar accounts of a great flood  and in every single one of them a man very much like bishop horn had saved the elect of mankind by building a magical boat .  details varied  of course .  sometimes the boat was made of wood  sometimes of banana leaves .  sometimes the news of the emerging dry land was brought by a swan  sometimes by an iguana .  of course these stories in the chronicles of other religions were mere folktales and myth  while the voyage detailed in the book of cena was holy truth .  but  nevertheless     oats had gone on to be fully ordained  but he   d progressed from slight reverend to quite reverend a troubled young man .  he   d wanted to discuss his findings with someone  but there were so many schisms going on that no one would stand still long enough to listen .  the hammering of clerics as they nailed their own versions of the truth of om on the temple doors was deafening  and for a brief while he   d even contemplated buying a roll of paper and a hammer of his own and putting his name on the waiting list for the doors  but he   d overruled himself .   because he was  he knew  in two minds about everything .   at one point he   d considered asking to be exorcised but had drawn back from this because the church traditionally used fairly terminal methods for this and in any case serious men who seldom smiled would not be amused to hear that the invasive spirit he wanted exorcised was his own .   he called the voices the good oats and the bad oats .  the trouble was  each of them agreed with the terminology but applied it in different ways .   even when he was small there   d been a part of him that thought the temple was a silly boring place  and tried to make him laugh when he was supposed to be listening to sermons .  it had grown up with him .  it was the oats that read avidly and always remembered those passages which cast doubt on the literal truth of the book of om   and nudged him and said  if this isn   t true  what can you believe .   and the other half of him would say  there must be other kinds of truth .   and he   d reply  other kinds than the kind that is actually true  you mean .   and he   d say  define actually .   and he   d shout  well  actually omnians would have tortured you to death  not long ago  for even thinking like this .  remember that .  remember how many died for using the brain which  you seem to think  their god gave them .  what kind of truth excuses all that pain .   he   d never quite worked out how to put the answer into words .  and then the headaches would start  and the sleepless nights .  the church schismed all the time these days  and this was surely the ultimate one  starting a war inside one   s head .   to think he   d been sent here for his health  because brother melchio had got worried about his shaky hands and the way he talked to himself .   he did not gird his loins  because he wasn   t certain how you did that and had never dared ask  but he adjusted his hat and stepped out into the wild night under the thick  uncommunicative clouds .       the castle gates swung open  and count magpyr stepped out  flanked by his soldiers .   this was not according to the proper narrative tradition .  although the people of lancre were technically new to all this  down at genetic level they knew that when the mob is at the gate the mobee should be screaming defiance in a burning laboratory or engaged in a cliffhanger struggle with some hero on the battlements .   he shouldn   t be lighting a cigar .   they fell silent  scythes and pitchforks hovering in mid shake .  the only sound was the cracking of the torches .   the count blew a smoke ring .      good evening     he said  as it drifted away .     you must be the mob .      someone at the back of the crowd  who hadn   t been keeping up to date  threw a stone .  count magpyr caught it without looking .      the pitchforks are good     he said .     i like the pitchforks .  as pitchforks they certainly pass muster .  and the torches  well  that goes without saying .  but the scythes   no  no  i   m afraid not .  they simply will not do .  not a good mob weapon  i have to tell you .  take it from me .  a simple sickle is much better .  start waving scythes around and someone could lose an ear .  do try to learn .      he ambled over to a very large man who was holding a pitchfork .      and what is your name  young man .         er   jason ogg  sir .         the blacksmith .         yessir .         wife and family doing well .         yessir .         well done .  got everything you need .         er   yessir .         good man .  carry on .  if you could keep the noise down over dinner  i would be grateful  but of course i appreciate you have a vital traditional role to play .  i   ll have the servants bring out some mugs of hot toddy shortly .     he knocked the ash off his cigar .     oh  and may i introduce you to sergeant kraput  known to his friends as    bent bill     i believe  and this gentlemen here picking his teeth with his knife is corporal svitz  who i understand has no friends at all .  i suppose it is faintly possible that he will make some here .  they and their men  who i suppose could be called soldiers in a sort of informal  easy come easy go  cut and thrust sort of way      here corporal svitz leered and flicked a gobbet of anonymous rations from a yellowing molar      will be going on duty in  oh  about an hour .  purely for reasons of security  you understand .         an    then we   ll gut yer like a clam and stuff yer with straw     said corporal svitz .      ah .  this is technical military language of which i know little     said the count .     i do so hope there is no unpleasantness .         i don   t     said sergeant kraput .      what scamps they are     said the count .     good evening to you all .  come  gentlemen .      he stepped back into the courtyard .  the gates  their wood so heavy and toughened with age that it was like iron  swung shut .   on the other side of it was silence  followed by the puzzled mumbling of players who have had their ball confiscated .   the count nodded at vlad and flung out his hands theatrically .      ta da .  and that is how we do it           and d   you think you   d do it twice .     said a voice from the steps .   the vampires looked up at the three witches .      ah  mrs .  ogg     said the count  waving the soldiers away impatiently .     and your majesty .  and agnes   now   was it three for a girl .  or three for a funeral .      the stone cracked under nanny   s feet as magpyr walked forward .      do you think i   m stupid  dear ladies .     he said .     did you really think i   d let you run around if there was the least chance that you could harm us .      lightning crackled across the sky .      i can control the weather     said the count .     and lesser creatures which  let me tell you  includes humans .  and yet you plot away and think you can have some kind of   of duel .  what a lovely image .  however        the witches were lifted off their feet .  hot air curled around them .  a rising wind outside made the torches of the mob stream flames like flags .      what happened to us harnessing the power of all three of us together .     hissed magrat .      that rather depended on him standing still .     said nanny .      stop this at once .     magrat shouted .     and how dare you smoke in my castle .  that can have a very serious effect on people around you .         is anyone going to say    you   ll never get away with it    .     said the count  ignoring her .  he walked up the steps .  they bobbed helplessly along ahead of him  like so many balloons .  the hall doors slammed shut after him .      oh  someone must     he said .      you won   t get away with this .      the count beamed .     and i didn   t even see your lips move           depart from here and return to the grave whence thou camest  unrighteous revenant .         where the hell did he come from .     said nanny  as mightily oats dropped to the ground in front of the vampires .   he was creeping along the minstrel gallery  said perdita to agnes .  sometimes you just don   t pay attention .   the priest   s coat was covered with dust and his collar was torn  but his eyes blazed with holy zeal .   he thrust something in front of the vampire   s face .  agnes saw him glance down hurriedly at a small book in his other hand .      er      get thee hence  thou worm of rheum  and vex not              excuse me .     said the count .            trouble no more the              could i just make a point .               thou spirit that troubles thee  thou      what .      the count took the notebook out of oats   s suddenly unresisting hand .      this is from ossory   s malleus malificarum     he said .     why do you looked so surprised .  i helped write it  you silly little man .         but   you   but that was hundreds of years ago .     oats managed .      so .  and i contributed to auriga clavorum maleficarum  torquus simiae malificarium    the whole damn arca instru mentorum  in fact .  none of those stupid fictions work on vampires  didn   t you even know that .     the count almost growled .     oh  i remember your prophets .  they were mad bearded old men with the sanitary habits of a stoat but  by all that   s crazed  they had passion .  they didn   t have holy little minds full of worry and fretfulness .  they spoke the idiot words as though they believed them  with specks of holy foam bubbling away in the corners of their mouth .  now they were real priests  bellies full of fire and bile .  you are a joke .      he tossed the notebook aside and took the pendant .     and this is the holy turtle of om  which i believe should make me cringe back in fear .  my  my .  not even a very good replica .  cheaply made .      oats found a reserve of strength .  he managed to say    and how would you know  foul fiend .         no  no  that   s for demons     sighed the count .   he handed the turtle back to oats .      a commendable effort  none the less     he said .     if i ever want a nice cup of tea and a bun and possibly also a cheery singsong  i will be sure to patronize your mission .  but  at the moment  you are in my way .      he hit the priest so hard that oats slid under the long table .      so much for piety     the count said .     all that remains now is for granny weatherwax to turn up .  it should be any minute now .  after all  did you think she   d trust you to get it right .      the sound of the huge iron doorknocker reverberated through the hall .   the count nodded happily .     and that will be her     he said .     of course it will .  timing is everything .      the wind roared in when the doors were opened  swirling twigs and rain and granny weatherwax  blown like a leaf .  she was soaked and covered in mud  her dress torn in several places .   agnes realized that she   d never actually seen granny weath erwax wet before  even after the worst storm  but now she was drenched .  water poured off her and left a trail on the floor .      mistress weatherwax .  so good of you to come     said the count .     such a long walk on a dark night .  do sit by the fire for a while and rest .         i   ll not rest here     said granny .      at least have a drink or something to eat  then .         i   ll not eat nor drink here .         then what will you do .         you know well why i   ve come .      she looks small  said perdita .  and tired  too .      ah  yes .  the set piece battle .  the great gamble .  the weath erwax trademark .  and   let me see   your shopping list today will be      if i win i will expect you to free everyone and go back to uberwald     am i right .         no .  i will expect you to die     said granny .   to her horror  agnes saw the old woman was swaying slightly .   the count smiled .     excellent .  but   i know how you think  mistress weatherwax .  you always have more than one plan .  you   re standing there  clearly one step away from collapse  and yet   i   m not entirely certain that i believe what i   m seeing .         i couldn   t give a damn what you   re certain of     said granny .     but you daren   t let me walk out of here  i do know that .     cos you can   t be sure of where i   ll go  or what i   ll do .  i could be watching you from any pair of eyes .  i might be behind any door .  i have a few favors i might call in .  i could come from any direction  at any time .  an    i   m good at malice .         so .  if i was so impolite  i could kill you right now .  a simple arrow would suffice .  corporal svitz .      the mercenary gave the wave that was as good as he   d ever get to a salute  and raised his crossbow .      are you sure .     said granny .     is your ape sure he   d have time for a second shot .  that i   d still be here .         you   re not a shape changer  mistress weatherwax .  and by the look of it you   re in no position to run .         she   s talking about moving her self into someone else   s head     said vlad .   the witches looked at one another .      sorry  esme     said nanny ogg  at last .     i couldn   t stop meself thinking .  i don   t think i drunk quite enough .         oh yes     said the count .     the famous borrowing trick .         but you don   t know where  you don   t know how far     said granny wearily .     you don   t even know what kind of head .  you don   t know if it has to be a head .  all you know about me is what you can get out of other people   s minds  and they don   t know all about me .  not by a long way .         and so your self is put elsewhere     said the count .     primitive .  i   ve met them  you know  on my travels .  strange old men in beads and feathers who could put their inner self into a fish  an insect   even a tree .  and as if it mattered .  wood burns .  i   m sorry  mistress weatherwax .  as king verence is so fond of saying  there   s a new world order .  we are it .  you are history        he flinched .  the three witches dropped to the ground .      well done     he said .     a shot across my bows .  i felt that .  i actually felt it .  no one in uberwald has ever managed to get through .         i can do better   n that     said granny .      i don   t think you can     said the count .     because if you could you would have done so .  no mercy for the vampire  eh .  the cry of the mob throughout the ages .      he strolled toward her .     do you really think we   re like some inbred elves or gormless humans and can be cowed by a firm manner and a bit of trickery .  we   re out of the casket now  mistress weatherwax .  i have tried to be understanding toward you  because really we do have a lot in common  but now        granny   s body jerked back like a paper doll caught by a gust of wind .   the count was halfway toward her  hands in the pockets of his jacket .  he broke his step momentarily .      oh dear  i hardly felt that one     he said .     was that your best .      granny staggered  but raised a hand .  a heavy chair by the wall was picked up and tumbled across the room .      for a human that was quite good     said the count .     but i don   t think you can keep on sending it away .      granny flinched  and raised her other hand .  a huge chandelier began to swing .      oh dear     said the count .     still not good enough .  not nearly good enough .      granny backed away .      but i will promise you this     said the count .     i won   t kill you .  on the contrary        invisible hands picked her up and slammed her against the wall .   agnes went to step forward  but magrat squeezed her arm .      don   t think of it as losing  granny weatherwax     said the count .     you will live forever .  i would call that a bargain  wouldn   t you .      granny managed a sniff of disapproval .      i   d call that unambitious     she said .  her face screwed up in pain .      goodbye     said the count .   the witches felt the mental blow .  the hall wavered .   but there was something else  on a realm outside normal space .  something bright and silvery  slipping like a fish        she   s gone     whispered nanny .     she sent her self some where           where .  where .     hissed magrat .      don   t think about it .     said nanny .   magrat   s expression froze .      oh no       she began .      don   t think it .  don   t think it .     said nanny urgently .     pink elephants .  pink elephants .         she wouldn   t           lalalala .  ee ie ee ie oh .     shouted nanny  dragging her toward the kitchen door .     come on  let   s go .  agnes  it   s up to you two .      the door slammed behind them .  agnes heard the bolts slide home .  it was a thick door and they were big bolts  the builders of lancre castle hadn   t understood the concept of planks less than three inches thick or locks that couldn   t withstand a battering ram .   the situation would  to an outsider  have seemed very selfish .  but logically  three witches in danger had been reduced to one witch in danger .  three witches would have spent too much time worrying about one another and what they were going to do .  one witch was her own boss .   agnes knew all this  and it still seemed selfish .   the count was walking toward granny .  out of the corner of her eye agnes could see vlad and his sister approaching her .  there was a solid door behind her .  perdita wasn   t coming up with any ideas .   so she screamed .   that was a talent .  being in two minds wasn   t a talent  it was merely an affliction .  but agnes   s vocal range could melt earwax at the top of the scale .   she started high and saw that she   d judged right .  just after the point where bats and woodworm fell out of the rafters  and dogs barked down in the town  vlad clapped his hands over his ears .   agnes gulped for breath .      another step and i   ll do it louder .     she shouted .   the count picked up granny weatherwax as though she were a toy .      i   m sure you will     he said .     and sooner or later you will run out of breath .  vlad  she followed you home  you may keep her  but she   s your responsibility .  you have to feed her and clean out her cage .      the younger vampire approached cautiously .      look  you   re really not being sensible     he hissed .      good .      and then he was beside her .  but perdita had been expecting this even if agnes hadn   t  and as he arrived her elbow was already well into its thrust and caught him in the stomach before he could stop it .   she strode forward as he doubled up  noting that inability to learn was a vampire trait that was hard to shake off .   the count laid granny weatherwax on the table .      igor .     he shouted .     where are you  you stupid        yeth  marthter .      the count spun around .      why do you always turn up behind me like that .         the old count alwayth   ecthpected it of me  marthter .  it   th a profethional thing .         well  stop it .         yeth  marthter .         and the ridiculous voice  too .  go and ring the dinner gong .         yeth  marrrtthhter .         and i   ve told you before about that walk .     the count shouted  as igor limped across the hall .     it   s not even amusing .      igor walked past agnes lisping nastily under his breath .   vlad caught up with agnes as she strode toward the table  and she was slightly glad because she didn   t know what she   d do when she got there .      you must go     he panted .     i wouldn   t have let him hurt you  of course  but father can get   testy .         not without granny .      a faint voice in her head said  leave   me     that wasn   t me  perdita volunteered .  i think that was her .   agnes stared at the prone body .  granny weatherwax looked a lot smaller when she was unconscious .      would you like to stay to dinner .     said the count .      you   re going to   after all this talk  you   re going to   suck her blood .         we are vampires  miss nitt .  it   s a vampire thing .  a little   sacrament  shall we say .              how can you .  she   s an old lady .      he spun around and was suddenly standing too close to her .      the idea of a younger aperitif is attractive  believe me     he said .     but vlad would sulk .  anyway  blood develops   character  just like your old wines .  she won   t be killed .  not as such .  at her time of life i should welcome a little immortality .         but she hates vampires .         this may present her with a problem when she comes around  since she will be a rather subservient one .  oh dear       the count reached down and picked up oats from under the table by one arm .     what a bloodless performance .  i remember omnians when they were full of certainty and fire and led by men who were courageous and unforgiving  albeit quite unbelievably insane .  how they would despair of all this milk and water stuff .  take him away with you  please .         shall i see you again tomorrow .     said vlad  proving to agnes that males of every species could possess a stupidity gene .      you won   t be able to turn her into a vampire .     she said  ignoring him .      she won   t be able to help it     said the count .     it   s in the blood  if we choose to put it there .         she   ll resist .         that would be worth seeing .      the count dropped oats onto the floor again .      now go away  miss nitt .  take your soggy priest .  tomorrow  well  you can have your old witch back .  but she   ll be ours .  there   s a hierarchy .  everyone knows that   who knows anything about vampires .      behind him oats was being sick .   agnes thought of the hollow eyed people now working in the castle .  no one deserved that .   she grabbed the priest by the back of his jacket and held him like a bag .      goodbye  miss nitt     said the count .   she hauled the limp oats to the main doors .  now it was raining hard outside  great heavy unmerciful rain slanting out of the sky like steel rods .  she kept close to the wall for the slight shelter that this gave and propped him up under the gush from a gargoyle .   he shuddered .     oh  that poor old woman     he moaned  slumping forward so that a flattened star of rain poured off his head .      yes     said agnes .  the other two had run off .  they   d shared a thought   and perdita had too .  they   d all felt the shock as granny set her mind free and   well  the baby was even called esme  wasn   t she .  but   she couldn   t have imagined granny   s voice in her head .  she had to be somewhere close        i really made a terrible mess of it  didn   t i     said oats .      yes     said agnes  vaguely .  no  lending her self to the baby did have a sort of rightness to it  a folklore touch  a romantic ring  and that   s why nanny and magrat would probably believe it and that was why granny wouldn   t do it .  granny had no romance in her soul  agnes thought .  but she did have a very good idea of how to manipulate the romance in other people .   so   where else was she .  something had happened .  she   d put the essence of herself somewhere for safety  and no matter what she   d told the count she couldn   t have put it very far away .  it had to be in something alive  but if it was in a human the owner wouldn   t even know it        if only i   d used the right exorcism       oats mumbled .      wouldn   t have worked     said agnes sharply .     i don   t think they   re very religious vampires .         it   s probably only once in his life that a priest gets a chance like this           you were just the wrong person     said agnes .     if a pamphlet had been the right thing to scare them away  then you   d have been the very best man for the job .      she stared down at oats .  so did perdita .      brother melchio is going to get very abrupt about this     he said  pulling himself to his feet .     oh  look at me  all covered in mud .  er   why are you looking at me like that .         oh   just an odd thought .  the vampires still don   t affect your head .         what do you mean .         they don   t affect your mind .  they don   t know what you   re thinking .         hah .  most of the time even i don   t know what i   m thinking     said oats miserably .      really .     said agnes .  really .  said perdita .      he was right     mumbled oats  not listening .     i   ve let everyone down  haven   t i .  i should have stayed in the college and taken that translating post .      there wasn   t even any thunder and lightning with the rain .  it was just hard and steady and grim .      but i   m   ready to have another go     said oats .      you are .  why .         did not kazrin return three times into the valley of mahag  and wrest the cup of hiread from the soldiers of the oolites while they slept .         did he .         yes .  i   m   i   m sure of it .  and did not om say to the prophet brutha     i will be with you in dark places    .         i imagine he did .         yes  he did .  he must have done .         and     said agnes     on that basis you   d go back in .         yes .         why .         because if i didn   t  what use am i .  what use am i anyway .         i don   t think we   d survive a second time     said agnes .     they let us go this time because it was the cruel thing to do .  dang .  i   ve got to decide what to do now  and it shouldn   t be me .  i   m the maiden  for goodness    sake .     she saw his expression and added  for reasons she   d find hard to explain at the moment     a technical term for the junior member of a trio of witches .  i shouldn   t have to decide things .  yes  i know it   s better than making the tea .         er   i didn   t say anything about making the tea           no  sorry  that was someone else .  what is it she wants me to do .      especially since now you think you know where she   s hiding  said perdita .   there was a creak  and they heard the hall doors open .  light spilled out  shadows danced in the mist raised by the driving rain  there was a splash and the doors shut again .  as they closed  there was the sound of laughter .   agnes hurried to the bottom of the steps  with the priest squelching along beside her .   there was already a wide and muddy puddle at this end of the courtyard .  granny weatherwax lay in it  her dress torn  her hair uncoiling from its rock hard bun .   there was blood on her neck .      they didn   t even lock her in a cell or something     said agnes  steaming with rage .     they just threw her like   like a meat bone .         i suppose they think she is locked up now  the poor soul     said oats .     let   s get her undercover  at least           oh   yes   of course .      agnes took hold of granny   s legs  and was amazed that someone so thin could be so heavy .      perhaps there   d be someone in the village .     said oats  staggering under his end of the load .      not a good idea     said agnes .      oh  but surely           what would you say to them .     this is granny  can we leave her here  oh  and when she wakes up she   ll be a vampire    .         ah .         it   s not as though people are that happy to see her anyway  unless they   re ill        agnes peered around through the rain .      come on  let   s go around to the stables and the mews  there   s sheds and things            king verence opened his eyes .  water was pouring down the window of his bedroom .  there was no light but that which crept in under the door  and he could just make out the shapes of his two guards  nodding in their seats .   a windowpane tinkled .  one of the uberwaldians went and opened the window  looked out into the wild night  found nothing of interest and shuffled back to his seat .   everything felt very   pleasant .  it seemed to verence that he was lying in a nice warm bath  which was very relaxing and comfortable .  the cares of the world belonged to someone else .  he bobbed like happy flotsam on the warm sea of life .   he could hear very faint voices  apparently coming from somewhere below his pillow .      rikt  gi    tae yon helan bigjobs .         ach  fashit keel .         hyup .         nach oona whiel ta    tethra   yin  tan  tetra .         hyup .  hyup .      something rustled on the floor .  the chair of one man jerked up into the air and bobbed at speed to the window .      hyup .     the chair and its occupant crashed through the glass .   the other guard managed to get to his feet  but something was growing in the air in front of him .  to verence  an alumnus of the fools    guild  it looked very much like a very tall human pyramid made up of very small acrobats .      hup .  hup .         hyup .         hup .      it grew level with the guard   s face .  the single figure at the top yelled     what ya lookin    a     chymie .  ha    a wee tastie .     and launched itself directly at a point between the man   s eyes .  there was a little cracking noise  and the man keeled over backward .      hup .  hup .         hyup .      the living pyramid dissolved to floor level .  verence heard tiny pattering feet and suddenly there was a small heavily tattooed man  in a blue pointy hat  standing on his chin .      seyou  kingie .  awa    echt ta    branoch  eh .         well done     verence murmured .     how long have you been a hallucination .  jolly good .         ken ye na    saggie  ye spargit .         that   s the way     said verence dreamily .      auchtahelweit .         hyup .  hyup .      verence felt himself lifted off the bed .  hundreds of little hands passed him from one to the other and he was glided through the window and out into the void .   it was a sheer wall and  he told himself dreamily  he had no business drifting down it so slowly  to cries of    ta ya .  ta me .  hyup .     tiny hands caught his collar  his nightshirt  his bed socks        good show     he murmured  as he slid gently to the ground and then  six inches above ground level  was carried off into the night .       there was a light burning in the rain .  agnes hammered on the door  and the wet wood gave away to the slightly better vision of hodgesaargh the falconer .      we   ve got to come in .     she said .      yes  miss nitt .      he stood back obediently as they carried granny into the little room .      she been hurt  miss .         you do know there   s vampires in the castle .     said agnes .      yes  miss .     said hodgesaargh .  his voice suggested that he   d just been told a fact  and he was waiting with polite interest to be told whether this was a good fact or a bad fact .      they bit granny weatherwax .  we need to let her lie down somewhere .         there   s my bed  miss .      it was small and narrow  designed for people who went to sleep because they were tired .      she might bleed on it a bit     said agnes .      oh  i bleed on it all the time     said hodgesaargh cheerfully .     and on the floor .  i   ve got any amount of bandages and ointment  if that will be any help .         well  it won   t do any harm     said agnes .     er   hodgesaargh  you do know vampires suck people   s blood  do you .         yes  miss .  they   ll have to queue up behind the birds for mine  then .         it doesn   t worry you .         mrs .  ogg made me a huge tub of ointment  miss .      that seemed to be that .  provided they didn   t touch his birds  hodgesaargh didn   t much mind who ran the castle .  for hundreds of years the falconers had simply got on with the important things  like falconry  which needed a lot of training  and left the kinging to amateurs .      she   s soaking wet     said oats .     at least let   s wrap her up in a blanket or something .         and you   ll need some rope  said agnes .      rope .         she   ll wake up .         you mean   we ought to tie her up .         if a vampire wants to turn you into a vampire  what happens .      oats   s hands clasped his turtle pendant for comfort as he tried to remember .     i   think they put something in the blood     he said .     i think if they want to turn you into a vampire you get turned .  that   s all there is to it .  i don   t think you can fight it when it   s in the blood .  you can   t say you don   t want to join .  i don   t think it   s a power you can resist .         she   s good at resisting     said agnes .      that good .     said oats .       one of the uberwald people shuffled along the corridor .  it stopped when it heard a sound  looked around  saw nothing that had apparently made a noise  and plodded on again .   nanny ogg stepped out of the shadows  and then beckoned magrat to follow her .      sorry  nanny  it   s very hard to keep a baby quiet           shh .  there   s quite a bit of noise coming from the kitchens .  what could vampires want to cook .         it   s those people they   ve brought with them     hissed magrat .     they   ve been moving in new furniture .  they   ve got to be fed  i suppose .         yeah  like cattle .  i reckon our best bet is to walk out bold as brass     said nanny .     these folk don   t look like they   re big on original thinkin    .  ready .     she absentmindedly took a swig from the bottle she was carrying .     you just follow me .         but look  what about verence .  i can   t just leave him .  he   s my husband .         what will they do to him that you could prevent if you was here .     said nanny .     keep the baby safe  that   s the important thing .  it always has been .  anyway   i told you  he   s got protection .  i saw to that .         what  magic .         much better   n that .  now  you just follow me and act snooty .  you must   ve learned that  bein    a queen .  never let    em even think you haven   t got a right to be where you are .      she strode out into the kitchen .  the shabbily dressed people there gave her a dull eyed look  like dogs waiting to see if a whipping was in prospect .  on the huge stove  in place of mrs .  scorbic   s usual array of scoured clean pots  was a large  blackened cauldron .  the contents were a basic gray .  nanny wouldn   t have stirred it for a thousand dollars .      just passing through     she said  sharply .     get on with whatever you were doing .      the heads all turned to watch them .  but toward the back of the kitchen a figure unfolded from the old armchair where mrs .  scorbic sometimes held court and ambled toward them .      oh blast  it   s one of the bloody hangers on     said nanny .     he   s between us and the door           ladies .     said the vampire  bowing .     may i be of assistance .         we were just leaving     said magrat haughtily .      possibly not     said the vampire .         scuse me  young man     said nanny  in her soft old biddy voice     but where are you from .         uberwald  madam .      nanny nodded  and referred to a piece of paper she   d pulled out of her pocket .     that   s nice .  what part .         klotz .         really .  that   s nice .     scuse me .     she turned her back and there was a brief twanging of elastic before she turned around again  all smiles .      i just likes to take an interest in people     she said .     klotz  eh .  what   s the name of that river there .  the um .  the eh .         the ah     said the vampire .   nanny   s hand shot forward and wedged something yellow between the vampire   s teeth .  he grabbed her  but  as she was dragged forward  she hit him on the top of the head .   he fell to his knees  clutching at his mouth and trying to scream through the lemon he   d just bitten into .      seems an odd superstition  but there you are     said nanny  as he started to foam around the lips .      you have to cut their heads off  too     said magrat .      really .  well  i saw a cleaver back there           shall we just go .     magrat suggested .     before someone else comes  perhaps .         all right .  he   s not a high up vampire  anyway     said nanny dismissively .     he   s not even wearing a very interestin    waistcoat .      the night was silver with rain .  heads down  the witches dashed through the murk .      i   ve got to change the baby .         for a raincoat   d be favorite     muttered nanny .     now .         it   s a bit urgent           all right  then  in here        they ducked into the stables .  nanny peered back into the night  and shut the door quietly .      it   s very dark     whispered magrat .      i could always change babies by feel when i was young .         i   d prefer not to have to .  hey   there   s a light        the weak glow of a candle was just visible at the far end of the loose boxes .   igor was brushing the horses until they shone .  his muttering kept time with the strokes of the brush .  something seemed to be on his mind .      thilly voithe  eh .  thilly walk .  what the hell doth he know .  jumped up whipper thnapper .  igor thtop thith  igor thtop that   all thethe kidth thwanning around  trying to puth me around   there   th a covenant in thethe thingth .  the old marthter knew that .  a thervant ith not a thlave        he glanced around .  a piece of straw drifted to the ground .   he began brushing again .     huh .  fetch thith  fetch that   never a morthel of rethpect  oh no        igor stopped and pulled another piece of straw off his sleeve .         and another thing        there was a creak  a rush of air  the horse reared in its stall and igor was borne to the ground  his head feeling as though it were caught in a vice .      now  if i brings my knees together     said a cheerful female voice above him     it   s very probable i could make your brains come right down your nose  but i know that ain   t going to happen  because i   m sure we   re all friends here .  say yes .            th .         that   s the best we   re going to get  i expect .      nanny ogg got up and flicked straw off her dress .      i   ve been in cleaner haylofts     she said .     up you get  mr .  igor .  and if you   re thinking of anything clever  my colleague over there is holdin    a pitchfork and she ain   t much good at aiming so who knows what part of you she might hit .         ith that a baby thee   th carrying .         we   re very modern     said nanny .     we   ve got hedge money and everything .  and now we   ll have your coach  igor .         will we .     said magrat .     where   re we going .         it   s a wicked night .  i don   t want to keep the babby out  and i don   t know where we   d be safe near here .  maybe we can get down onto the plains before morning .         i won   t leave lancre .         save the child     said nanny .     make sure there   s going to be a future .  besides       she mouthed something at magrat which igor did not catch .      we can   t be sure of that     said magrat .      you know the way granny thinks     said nanny .     she   ll want us to keep the baby safe     she added  loudly .     so hitch up the horses  mr .  igor .         yeth  mithtreth     said igor meekly .      are you kicking my bucket  igor .          no  it   th a pleathure to be commanded in a clear  firm authoritative voithe  mithtreth     said igor  lurching over to the bridles .     none of this    would you mind       rubbith .  an igor liketh to know where he thtandth .         slightly lopsidedly .     said magrat .      the old marthter uthed to whip me every day .     said igor proudly .      you liked that .     said magrat .      of courthe not .  but it   th proper .  he wath a gentleman  whothe bootth i wath not fit to lick clean           but you did  though .     said nanny .   igor nodded .     every morning .  uthed to get a lovely thine  too .         well  help us out and i   ll see you   re flogged with a scented bootlace     said nanny .      thankth all the thame  but i   m leathing anyway     said igor  tightening a strap .     i   m thick up to here with thith lot .  they thouldn   t be doing thith .  they   re a dithgrathe to the thpethieth .      nanny wiped her face .     i like a man who speaks his mind     she said     and is always prepared to lend a towel   did i say towel .  i mean hand .         are you going to trust him .     said magrat .      i   m a good judge of character  me     said nanny .     and you can always rely a man with stitches all around his head .             waley  waley  waley .         ta    can onlie be one t   ousan .         bigjobs .      a fox peered cautiously around a tree .   through the rain swept woods a man was moving at speed  while apparently lying down .  he wore a nightcap  the bobble of which bounced on the ground .   by the time the fox realized what was going on  it was too late .  a small blue figure leapt out from under the rushing man and landed on its nose  smaking it between the eyes with his head .      seeyu .  grich    ta    bones outa t   is yan .      the nac mac feegle leapt down as the fox collapsed  grabbed its tail with one hand and ran after the others  punching the air triumphantly .      obhoy .  we    gan eat t   nicht .          they   d pulled the bed out into the middle of the room .  now agnes and oats sat on either side of it  listening to the distant sounds of hodgesaargh feeding the birds .  there was the rattle of tins and the occasional yelp as he tried to remove a bird from his nose .      sorry .     said agnes .      pardon .         i thought you whispered something     said agnes .      i was  er  saying a short prayer     said oats .      will that help .     said agnes .      er   it helps me .  the prophet brutha said that om helps those who help one another .         and does he .         to be honest  there are a number of opinions of what was meant .         how many .         about one hundred and sixty  since the schism of ten thirty a . m .   february twenty third .  that was when the re united free chelonianists  hubward convocation  split from the re united free chelonianists  rimward convocation  .  it was rather serious .         blood spilled .     said agnes .  she wasn   t really interested  but it took her mind off whatever might be waking up in a minute .      no  but there were fisticuffs and a deacon had ink spilled on him .         i can see that was pretty bad .         there was some serious pulling of beards as well .         gosh .     sects maniacs  said perdita .      you   re making fun of me     said oats solemnly .      well  it does sound a little   trivial .  you   re always arguing .         the prophet brutha said    let there be ten thousand voices        said the priest .     sometimes i think he meant that it was better to argue amongst ourselves than go out putting unbelievers to fire and the sword .  it   s all very complicated .     he sighed .     there are a hundred pathways to om .  unfortunately  i sometimes think someone left a rake lying across a lot of them .  the vampire was right .  we   ve lost the fire           but you used to burn people with it .         i know   i know        agnes saw a movement out of the corner of her eye .   steam was rising from under the blanket they   d pulled over granny weatherwax .   as agnes looked down  granny   s eyes sprang open and swiv eled from side to side .   her mouth moved once or twice .      and how are you  miss weatherwax .     said mightily oats in a cheerful voice .      she was bitten by a vampire .  what sort of question is that .     agnes hissed .      one that   s better than    what are you    .     oats whispered .   granny   s hand twitched .  she opened her mouth again  arched her body against the rope and then slumped back against the pillow .   agnes touched her forehead  and drew her hand back sharply .      she   s burning up .  hodgesaargh .  bring some water .         coming  miss .         oh no       whispered oats .  he pointed to the ropes .  they were unknotting themselves  stealthily moving across one another like snakes .   granny half rolled  half fell out of the bed  landing on her hands and knees .  agnes went to pick her up and received a blow from an elbow that sent her across the room .   the old witch dragged the door open and crawled out into the rain .  she paused  panting  as the drops hit her .  agnes swore that some of them sizzled .   granny   s hands slipped .  she landed in the mud and struggled to push herself upright .   blue green light spilled out from the mews   s open door .  agnes looked back inside .  hodgesaargh was staring at a jamjar  in which a point of white light was surrounded by a pale blue flame that stretched well beyond the jar  and curled and pulsed .      what   s that .         my phoenix feather  miss .  it   s burning the air .      outside  oats had pulled granny upright and had got his shoulder under one of her arms .      she said something     he said .        i am     i think           she might be a vampire .         she just said it again .  didn   t you hear .      agnes moved closer  and granny   s limp hand was suddenly gripping her shoulder .  she could feel the heat of it through her sodden dress and made out the word in the hiss of the rain .      iron .     said oats .     did she say iron .         there   s the castle forge next door     said agnes .     let   s get her in there .      the forge was dark and cold  its fire only lit when there was occasional work to be done .  they pulled granny inside  and she slipped out of their grip and landed on hands and knees on the flagstones .      but iron   s no good against vampires  is it .     said agnes .     i   ve never heard of people using iron        granny made a noise somewhere between a snort and a growl .  she pulled herself across the floor  leaving a trail of mud  until she reached the anvil .   it was simply a great long lump of iron to accommodate the half skilled metal bashing occasionally needed to keep the castle running .  still kneeling  granny grabbed at it with both hands and laid her forehead against it .      granny  what can       agnes began .      go where the others   are     granny weatherwax croaked .     it   ll need three   witches if this goes   wrong   you   ll have to face   something terrible           what terrible thing .         me .  do it now .      agnes backed away .  on the black iron  by granny   s fingers  little flecks of rust were spitting and jumping .      i   d better go .  keep an eye on her .         but what if       oats began .   granny flung her head back  her eyes screwed shut .      get away .     she screamed .   agnes went white .      you heard what she said .     she shouted  and ran out into the rain .   granny   s head slumped forward against the iron again .  around her fingers red sparks danced on the metal .      mister priest     she said  in a hoarse whisper .     somewhere in this place is an ax .  fetch it here .      oats looked around desperately .  there was an ax  a small double headed one  lying by a grindstone .      er  i   ve found one     he ventured .   granny   s head jerked back .  her teeth were gritted  but she managed to say     sharpen it .      oats glanced at the grindstone and licked his lips nervously .      sharpen it right now  i said .      he pulled off his jacket  rolled up his sleeves  took up the ax and put a foot on the wheel   s treadle .   sparks leapt off the blade as the wheel spun .      then find some wood an      cut a point on it .  and find   a hammer        the hammer was easy .  there was a rack of tools by the wheel .  a few seconds    desperate rummaging in the debris by the wall produced a fence post .      madam  what are you wanting me to           something   will get up   presently     granny panted .     make sure   you know well   what it is           but you   re not expecting me to behead           i   m commandin    you  religious man .  what do you really   believe .  what did you   think it was all about .  singing songs .  sooner or later   it   s all down to   the blood        her head lolled against the anvil .   oats looked at her hands again .  around them the iron was black  but just a little way from her fingers there was a faint glow to the metal  and the rust sizzled .  he touched the anvil gingerly  then pulled his hand away and sucked at his fingers .      mistress weatherwax a bit poorly  is she .     said hodgesaargh  coming in .      i think you could certainly say that  yes .         oh dear .  want some tea .         what .         it   s a nasty night .  if we   re stopping up i   ll put the kettle on .         do you realize  man  that she might get up from there a blood thirsty vampire .         oh .     the falconer looked down at the still figure and the smoking anvil .     good idea to face her with a cup of tea inside you  then     he said .      do you understand what   s going on here .      hodgesaargh took another slow look at the scene .     no     he said .      in that case              s not my job to understand this sort of thing     said the falconer .     i wasn   t trained .  probably takes a lot of training  understanding this .  that   s your job .  and her job .  can you understand what   s going on when a bird   s been trained and   ll make a kill and still came back to the wrist .         well  no           there you are  then .  so that   s all right .  cup of tea  was it .      oats gave up .     yes  please .  thank you .      hodgesaargh bustled off .   the priest sat down .  if the truth were known  he wasn   t sure he understood what was happening .  the old woman had been burning up and in pain  and now   the iron was getting hot  as if the pain and the heat had been moved away .  could anyone do that .  well  of course  the prophets could  he told himself conscientiously  but that was because om had given them the power .  but by all accounts the old woman didn   t believe in anything .   she was very still now .   the others had talked about her as though she was some great magician  but the figure he   d seen in the hall had been just a tired  worn out old woman .  he   d seen people down in the hospice in aby dyal  stiff and withdrawn until the pain was too great and all they had left was a prayer and then   not even that .  that seemed to be where she was now .   she was really still .  oats had only seen stillness like that when movement was no longer an option .  up the airy mountain and down the rushy glen ran the nac mac feegle  who seemed to have no concept of stealth .  progress was a little slower now  because some of the party broke away occasionally to have a fight amongst themselves or an impromptu hunt  and in addition to the king of lancre there was now  bobbing through the heather  the fox  a stunned stag  a wild boar  and a weasel who   d been suspected of looking at a nac mac feegle in a funny way .   verence saw  muzzily  that they were heading for a bank at the edge of a field  long deserted and overgrown  topped with some ancient thorn trees .   the pixies stopped with a jolt when the king   s head was a few inches away from a large rabbit hole .      danna fittit .         g   shovitt  s   yust .      verence   s head was banged hopefully against the wet soil once or twice .      hakkis lugs awa    .         bigjobs .      one of the pixies shook his head .     canna    do   t  ken .  els    y   ole carlin   ll hae oor guts fae garters        unusually  the nac mac feegle fell silent for a moment .  then one of them said     na one   s got tha    much guts  right eno    .         an    b   side  she   ll gi   us uskabarch muckell .  we oathit .  y   canna    cross a hag .         al    at it noo  then        verence was dropped on the ground .  there was a brief sound of digging  and mud showered over him .  then he was picked up again and carried through a much enlarged hole  his nose brushing tree roots in the ceiling .  behind him there was the sound of a tunnel being rapidly filled in .   then there was just a bank where rabbits obviously lived  topped with thorn trees .  unseen in the wild night  the occasional wisp of smoke drifted among the trunks .       agnes leaned against the castle wall  which was streaming with water  and fought for breath .  granny hadn   t just told her to go away .  the command had hit her brain like a bucket of ice .  even perdita had felt it .  there was no question of not obeying .   where would nanny have gone .  agnes felt a pressing desire to be near her .  nanny ogg radiated a perpetual field of it   ll be all rightness .  if they   d got out through the kitchens she could be anywhere     she heard the coach rattle out through the arch that led to the stables .  it was just a looming shape  shrouded in spray from the rain  as it bounced across the cobbles of the courtyard .  a figure by the driver  holding a sack over its head against the wind and rain  might have been nanny .  it hardly mattered .  no one would have seen agnes running through the puddles and waving .   she trooped back to the arch as the coach disappeared down the hill .  well  they had been trying to get away  hadn   t they .  and stealing a vampire   s coach had a certain nanny ogg style     someone gripped both her arms from behind .  instinctively she tried to thrust back with her elbows .  it was like trying to move against rock .      why  miss agnes nitt     said vlad  coldly .     a pleasant stroll to take in a little rain .         they   ve got away from you .     she snapped .      you think so .  father could send that coach right into the gorge in a moment if he wanted to     said the vampire .     but he won   t .  we much prefer the personal touch .         the in your neck approach     said agnes .      hah  yes .  but he really is trying to be reasonable .  so i can   t persuade you to become one of us  agnes .         what  someone who lives by taking life from other people .         we don   t usually go as far as that anymore     said vlad  dragging her forward .     and when we do   well  we make sure that we only kill people who deserve to die .         oh well  that   s all right then  isn   t it     said agnes .     i   m sure i   d trust a vampire   s judgment .         my sister can be a bit too   rigorous at times  i admit .         i   ve seen the people you brought with you .  they practically moo .         oh  them .  the domestics .  well .  it   s not much different from the lives they would have had in any case .  better  in fact .  they are well fed  sheltered              milked .         and is that bad .      agnes tried to twist out of his grip .  just here  there was no castle wall .  there hadn   t been any need .  lancre gorge was all the wall anyone could need  and vlad was walking her right to the sheer drop .      what a stupid thing to say .     she said .      is it .  i understand you   ve traveled  agnes     said vlad  as she struggled .     so you   ll know that so many people lead little lives  always under the whip of some king or ruler or master who won   t hesitate to sacrifice them in battle or turn them out when they can   t work anymore .      but they can run away  perdita prompted .      but they can run away .         really .  on foot .  with a family .  and no money .  mostly they never even try .  most people put up with most things  agnes .         that   s the most unpleasant  cynical        accurate  perdita said .         accur   no .      vlad raised his eyebrows .     you have such a strange mind  agnes .  of course  you are not one of the   cattle .  i expect that no witch is .  you people tend to know your own mind .     he gave her a toothy grin  and on a vampire this was not pleasant .     i wish i did .  come along .      there was no resisting the pull  unless she wanted to be dragged along the ground .      father   s very impressed with you witches     he said  over his shoulder .     he says we should make you all vampires .  he says you   re halfway there anyway .  but i   d much rather you came to see how marvelous it could be .         you would  would you .  i   d like to be constantly craving blood .         you constantly crave chocolate  don   t you .         how dare you .         blood tends to be low in carbohydrates .  your body will adapt .  the pounds will just drop away           that   s sickening .         you   ll have complete control over yourself           i   m not listening .         all it takes is a little prick           it   s not going to be yours  mister .         hah .  wonderful .     said vlad and  dragging agnes behind him  he leapt into the lancre gorge .       granny weatherwax opened her eyes .  at least  she had to assume they were open .  she   d felt the lids move .   darkness lay in front of her .  it was velvet black  starless  a hole in space .  but there was light behind her .  she was standing with her back to the light  she could sense it  see it on her hands .  it was streaming past  outlining the darkness that was the long rich deep shadow of her on the        black sand .  it crunched under her boots as she shifted her weight .   this was a test .  everything was a test .  everything was a competition .  life put them in front of you every day .  you watched yourself all the time .  you had to make choices .  you never got told which ones were right .  oh  some of the priests said you got given marks afterward  but what was the point of that .   she wished her mind was working faster .  she couldn   t think properly .  her head felt full of fog .   this   wasn   t a real place .  no  that wasn   t the right way of thinking about it .  it wasn   t a usual place .  it might be more real than lancre .  across it her shadow stretched  waiting     she glanced up at the tall  silent figure beside her .   good evening .      oh   you again .      another choice  esmerelda weatherwax .      light and dark .  it   s never as simple as that  you know  even for you .      death sighed .  not even for me .   granny tried to line up her thoughts .   which light and which dark .  she hadn   t been prepared for this .  this didn   t feel right .  this wasn   t the fight she had expected .  whose light .  whose mind was this .   silly question .  she was always her .   never lose your grip on that     so   light behind her  darkness in front     she   d always said witches stood between the light and the dark .      am i dyin    .      yes .      will i die .      yes .   granny thought this over .      but from your point of view  everyone is dying and everyone will die  right .      yes .      so you aren   t actually bein    a lot of help  strictly speakin    .      i   m sorry  i thought you wanted the truth .  perhaps you were expecting jelly and ice cream .      hah        there was no movement in the air  no sound but her own breathing .  just the brilliant white light on one side  and the heavy darkness on the other   waiting .   granny had listened to people who   d nearly died but had come back  possibly because of a deft thump in the right place or the dislodging of some wayward mouthful that   d gone down the wrong way .  sometimes they talked about seeing a light     that   s where she ought to go  a thought told her .  but   was the light the way in  or the way out .   death snapped his fingers .   an image appeared on the sand in front of them .  she saw herself  kneeling in front of the anvil .  she admired the dramatic effect .  she   d always had a streak of theatrics  although she   d never admit it  and she appreciated in a disembodied way the strength with which she had thrust her pain into the iron .  someone had slightly spoiled the effect by putting a kettle on one end .   death reached down and took a handful of sand .  he held it up  and let it slip between his fingers .   choose  he said .  you are good at choosing  i believe .      is there any advice you could be givin    me .     said granny .   choose right .   granny turned to face the sheer white brilliance  and closed her eyes .   and stepped backward .   the light dwindled to a tiny distant point  and vanished .   the blackness was suddenly all around  closing in like quicksand .  there seemed to be no way  no direction .  when she moved she did not sense movement .   there was no sound but the faint trickle of sand inside her head .   and then  voices from her shadow .         because of you  some died who may have lived        the words lashed at her  leaving livid lines across her mind .      some lived who surely would have died     she said .   the dark pulled at her sleeves .         you killed           no .  i showed the way .            hah .  that   s just words           words is important     granny whispered into the night .         you took the right to judge others           i took the duty .  i   ll own up to it .            i know every evil thought you   ve ever had           i know .            the ones you   d never dare tell anyone           i know .            all the little secrets  never to be told           i know .            how often you longed to embrace the dark           yes .            such strength you could have           yes .            embrace the dark           no .            give in to me           no            lilith weatherwax did .  alison weatherwax did           that   s never been proved .            give in to me           no .  i know you .  i   ve always known you .  the count just let you out to torment me  but i   ve always known you were there .  i   ve fought you every day of my life and you   ll get no victory now .      she opened her eyes and stared into the blackness .      i knows who you are now  esmerelda weatherwax     she said .     you don   t scare me no more .      the last of the light vanished .   granny weatherwax hung in the dark for a time she couldn   t measure .  it was as if the absolute emptiness had sucked all the time and direction into it .  there wasn   t anywhere to go  because there wasn   t any anywhere .   after what may have been days or seconds  she began to hear another sound  the faintest of whispers on the borders of hearing .  she pushed toward it .   words were rising through the blackness like little wriggling golden fish .   she fought her way toward them  now that there was a direction .   the slivers of light turned into sounds .         and asketh you in your infinite compassion to see your way clear to possibly intervening here        not normally the kind of words she   d associate with light .  perhaps it was the way they were said .  but they had a strange echo to them  a second voice  woven in amongst the first voice  glued to every syllable           what compassion .  how many people prayed at the stake .  how foolish i look  kneeling like this        ah   one mind  split in half .  there were more agneses in the world than agnes dreamed of  granny told herself .  all the girl had done was give a thing a name  and once you gave a thing a name you gave it a life     there was something else near by  a glimmer a few photons across  which winked out as she looked for it again .  she turned her attention away for a moment  then jerked it back .  again  the tiny spark blinked out .   something was hiding .   the sand stopped rushing .  time was up .   now to find out what she was .   granny weatherwax opened her eyes  and there was light .       the coach swished to a halt on the mountain road .  water poured around its wheels .   nanny got out and paddled over to igor  who was standing where the road wasn   t .   water was foaming where it should have been .      can we get acroth .     said igor .      probably  but it   ll be worse down below  where there   s really bad run off     said nanny .     the plains have been cut off all winter before now        she looked at the other way .  the road wound farther into the mountains  awash but apparently sound .      where   s the nearest village that way .     she said .     one with a good stone building in it .  slake  isn   t it .  there   s a coaching inn up there .         that   th right .  thlake .         well  we ain   t going anywhere on foot in this weather     said nanny .     slake it   s got to be  then .      she got back into the coach and felt it turn around .      is there a problem .     said magrat .     why are we going uphill .         road   s washed out     said nanny .      we   re heading into uberwald .         yes .         but there   s werewolves and vampires and           yes  but not everywhere .  we should be safe on the main road .  anyway  there   s not much of a choice .         i suppose you   re right     said magrat reluctantly .      and it could be worse     said nanny .      how .         well   there could be snakes in here with us .          agnes saw the rocks rush past  looked down and saw the foam of the swollen river .   the world spun around her when vlad stopped in mid air .  water washed over her toes .      let there be   lightness     he said .     you   d like to be as light as the air  wouldn   t you  agnes .         we   we   ve got broomsticks       agnes panted .  her life had just flashed past her eyes and wasn   t it dull .  perdita added .      useless cumbersome stupid things     he said .     and they can   t do this        the walls of the gorge went past in a blur .  the castle dropped away .  clouds drenched her .  then they unrolled as a silver white fleece  under the silent cold light of the moon .   vlad wasn   t beside her .  agnes slowed in her rise  flung out her arms to grip what wasn   t there  and began to fall back     he appeared  laughing  and grabbed her around the waist .         can they .     he said .   agnes couldn   t speak .  her life passing in front of her eyes one way had met it passing in front of her eyes going in the opposite direction  and words would fail her now until she could decide when now was .      and you haven   t seen anything yet     said vlad .  wisps of cloud coiled behind them as he raced forward .   the clouds vanished under agnes .  they might have been as thin as smoke but their presence  their imitation of groundness  had been a comfort .  now they were a departing edge  and far below were the moonlit plains .      ghjgh     gurgled agnes  too tense and terrified even to scream .  wheee .  crowed perdita  inside .      see that .     said vlad  pointing .     see the light all around the rim .      agnes stared  because anything now was better than looking down .   the sun was under the disc .  around the dark rim  though  it found its way up through the endless waterfall  creating a glowing band between the nighttime ocean and the stars .  it was  indeed  beautiful  but agnes felt that beauty was even more likely to be in the eye of the beholder if the feet of the beholder were on something solid .  at ten thousand feet up  the eye of the beholder tends to water .   perdita thought it was beautiful .  agnes wondered if  should agnes end up as a circle of pink splash marks on the rocks  perdita would still be there .      everything you want     whispered vlad .     forever .         i want to get down     said agnes .   he let go .   there was this about agnes   s shape .  it was a good one for falling .  she turned automatically belly down  hair streaming behind her  and floated in the rushing wind .   oddly enough  the terror had gone .  that had been fear of a situation out of her control .  now  arms outspread  skirts whipping her legs  eyes streaming in the freezing air  she could at least see what the future held even if it was not big enough to hold very much .   perhaps she could hit a snowbank  or deep water     it might have been worth a try  said perdita .  he doesn   t seem entirely bad .      shut up .      it   d just be nice if you could stop looking as though you were wearing saddlebags under your skirt        shut up .      and it   d be nice if you didn   t hit the rocks like a balloon full of water        shut up .  anyway  i can see a lake .  i think i can sort of angle across toward it .      at this speed it will be like hitting the ground .      how do you know that .  i don   t know that .  so how do you know .      everyone knows that .   vlad appeared alongside agnes  lounging on the air as though it were a sofa .      enjoying it .     he said .      it   s fine so far     said agnes  not looking at him .   she felt him touch her wrist .  there was no real sense of pressure  but the fall stopped .  she felt as light as the air again .      why are you doing this .     she said .     if you   re going to bite me  then get it over with .         oh  but i couldn   t be having with that .         you did it to granny .     said agnes .      yes  when it   s but against someone   s will   well  they end up so   compliant .  little more than thinking food .  but someone who embraces the night of their own volition   ah  that   s another thing entirely  my dear agnes .  and you   re far too interesting to be a slave .         tell me     said agnes  as a mountaintop floated by     have you had many girlfriends .      he shrugged .     one or two .  villages girls .  housemaids .         and what happened to them  may i ask .         don   t look at me like that .  we still find employment for them in the castle .      agnes loathed him .  perdita merely hated him  which is the opposite pole to love and just as attractive .      but nanny said if the worst came to the worst   and then he   ll trust you   and they   ve already got granny        if i   m a vampire     she said     i won   t know good from evil .         that   s a bit childish  isn   t it .  they   re only ways of looking at the same thing .  you don   t always have to do what the rest of the world wants you to do .         are you still toying with her .      lacrimosa was walking toward them on the air .  agnes saw the other vampires behind her .      bite her or let her go     the girl went on .     good grief  she   s so blobby .  come on  father wants you .  they   re heading for our castle .  isn   t that just too stupid .         this is my affair  lacci     said vlad .      every boy should have a hobby  but   really     said lacrimosa  rolling her black rimmed eyes .   vlad grinned at agnes .      come with us     he said .   granny did say you need to be with the others  perdita pointed out .      yes  but how will i find them when we   re there .     said agnes aloud .      oh  we   ll find them     said vlad .      i meant           do come .  we don   t intend to hurt your friends        much     said lacrimosa .      or   we could leave you here     said vlad  smiling .   agnes looked around .  they had touched down on the mountain peak  above the clouds .  she felt warm and light  which was wrong .  even on a broomstick she   d never felt like this  she   d always between aware of gravity sucking her down  but with the vampire holding her arm every part of her felt that it could float forever .   besides  if she didn   t go with them  it was going to be either a very long or an extremely short journey down to the ground .   besides  she would find the other two  and you couldn   t do that when you were dying in some crevasse somewhere .   besides  even if he did have small fangs and a terrible taste in waistcoats  vlad actually seemed attracted to her .  it wasn   t even as if she had a very interesting neck .   she made up both minds .      if you attached a piece of string to her i suppose we could tow her like some sort of balloon     said lacrimosa .   besides  there was always the chance that  at some point  she might find herself in a room with lacrimosa .  when that happened  she wouldn   t need garlic  or a stake  or an ax .  just a little talk about people who were too unpleasant  too malicious  too thin .  just five minutes alone .   and perhaps a pin  said perdita .       under the rabbit hole  down below the bank  was a wide  low roofed chamber .  tree roots wound among the stones in the wall .   there were plenty of such things around lancre .  the kingdom had been there many years  ever since the ice withdrew .  tribes had pillaged  tilled  built and died .  the clay walls and reed thatch of the living houses had long since rotted and been lost but  down under the moundy banks  the abodes of the dead survived .  no one knew now who   d been buried there .  occasionally the spoil heap outside a badger sett would reveal a piece of bone or a scrap of corroded armor .  the lancrastians didn   t go digging themselves  reckoning in their uncomplicated country way that it was bad luck to have your head torn off by a vengeful underground spirit .   one or two of the old barrows had been exposed over the years  their huge stones attracting their own folklore .  if you left your unshod horse at one of them overnight  and placed a sixpence on the stone  in the morning the sixpence would be gone and you   d never see your horse again  either     down on the earth floor under the bank a fire was burning darkly  filling the barrow with smoke which exited through various hidden crannies .  there was a pear shaped rock beside it .   verence tried to sit up  but his body didn   t want to obey .      dinna scanna    whista     said the rock .   it unfolded its legs .  it was  he realized  a woman  or at least a female  blue like the other pixies but at least a foot high and so fat that it was almost spherical .  it looked exactly like the little figurines back in the days of ice and mammoths  when what men really looked for in a woman was quantity .  for the sake of modesty  or merely to mark the equator  it wore what verence could only think of as a tutu .  the whole effect reminded him of a spinning top he   d had when he was a child .      the kelda says     said a cracked voice by his ear     that ye   must get   ready .      verence turned his head the other way and tried to focus on a small wizened pixie right in front of his nose .  its skin was faded .  it had a long white beard .  it walked with two sticks .      ready .  for what .         good .     the old pixie banged its sticks on the ground .     craik   n shaden ach  feegle .      the blue men rushed at verence from the shadows .  hundreds of hands grabbed him .  their bodies formed a human pyramid  pulling him upright against the wall .  some clung to the tree roots that looped across the ceiling  tugging on his nightshirt to keep him vertical .   a crowd of others ran across the floor with a full sized crossbow and propped it on a stone close to him .      er   i say       verence murmured .   the kelda waddled into the shadows and returned with her pudgy fists clenched .  she went to the fire and held them over the flames .      yin .     said the old pixie .      i say   that   s aimed right at my           yin .     shouted the nac mac feegle .         ton .         ton .         um  it   s  er  right           tetra .      the kelda dropped something on the fire .  a white flame roared up  etching the room in black and white .  verence blinked .   when he managed to see again there was a crossbow bolt sticking in the wall just by his ear .   the kelda growled some order  while white light still danced around the walls .  the bearded pixie rattled his sticks again .      now ye must walk awa    .  noo .      the feegle let verence go .  he took a few tottering steps and collapsed on the floor  but the pixies weren   t watching him .   he looked up .   his shadow twisted on the wall where it had been pinned .  it writhed for a moment  trying to clutch at the arrow with insubstantial hands  and then faded .   verence raised his hand .  there seemed to be a shadow there  too  but at least this one looked as if it was the regular kind .   the old pixie hobbled over to him .      all fine now     he said .      you shot my shadow .     said verence .      aye  ye could call it a shade     said the pixie .     it   s the    fluence they put on ye .  but ye   ll be up and aboot in no time .         a boot .         aboot the place     said the pixie evenly .     all hail  your kingy .  i   m big aggie   s man .  ye   d call me the prime minister  i   m hazardin    .  will ye no    have a huge dram and a burned bannock while yer waitin    .      verence rubbed his face .  he did feel better already .  the fog was drifting away .      how can i ever repay you .     he said .   the pixie   s eyes gleamed happily .      oh  there   s a wee bitty thing the carlin    ogg said you could be givin    us  hardly important at all     he said .      anything     said verence .   a couple of pixies came up staggering under a rolled up parchment  which was unfolded in front of verence .  the old pixie was suddenly holding a quill pen .      it   s called a signature     he said  as verence stared at the tiny handwriting .     an    make sure ye initial all the sub clauses and codicils .  we of the nac mac feegle are a simple folk     he added     but we write verra comp lic ated documents .          mightily oats blinked at granny over the top of his praying hands .  she saw his gaze slide sideways to the ax  and then back to her .      you wouldn   t reach it in time     said granny  without moving .     should   ve got hold of it already if you were goin    to use it .  prayer   s all very well .  i can see where it can help you get your mind right .  but an ax is an ax no matter what you believes .      oats relaxed a little .  he   d expected a leap for the throat .      if hodgesaargh   s made any tea  i   m parched     said granny .  she leaned against the anvil  panting .  out of the corner of her eye she saw his hand move slowly .      i   ll get   i   ll ask   i   ll           man with his head screwed on properly  that falconer .  a biscuit wouldn   t come amiss .      oats   s hand reached the ax handle .      still not quick enough     said granny .     keep hold of it  though .  ax first  pray later .  you look like a priest .  what   s your god .         er   om .         that a he god or a she god .         a he .  yes .  a he .  definitely a he .     it was one thing the church hadn   t schismed over  strangely .     er   you don   t mind  do you .         why should i mind .         well   your colleagues keep telling me the omnians used to burn witches           they never did     said granny .      i   m afraid i have to admit that the records show           they never burned witches     said granny .     probably they burned some old ladies who spoke up or couldn   t run away .  i wouldn   t look for witches bein    burned     she added  shifting position .     i might look for witches doin    the burning  though .  we ain   t all nice .      oats remembered the count talking about contributing to the arca instrumentorum     those books were ancient .  but so were vampires  weren   t they .  and they were practically canonical .  the freezing knife of doubt wedged itself deeper in his brain .  who knew who really wrote anything .  what could you trust .  where was the holy writ .  where was the truth .   granny pulled herself to her feet and tottered over the bench  where hodgesaargh has left his jar of flame .  she examined it carefully .   oats tightened his grip on the ax .  it was  he had to admit  slightly more comforting than prayer at the moment .  perhaps you could start with the small truths .  like  he had an ax in his hand .      i wa   want to be certain     he said .     are you   are you a vampire .      granny weatherwax appeared not to hear the question .      where   s hodgesaargh with that tea .     she said .   the falconer came in with a tray .      nice to see you up and about  mistress weatherwax .         not before time .      the tea slopped as she took the proffered cup .  her hand was shaking .      hodgesaargh .         yes  mistress .         so you   ve got a firebird here  have you .         no  mistress .         i saw you out huntin    it .         and i found it  miss .  but it had been killed .  there was nothing but burnt ground  miss .         you   d better tell me all about it .         is this the right time .     said oats .      yes     said granny weatherwax .   oats sat and listened .  hodgesaargh was an original storyteller and quite good in a very specific way .  if he   d had to recount the saga of the tsortean war  for example  it would have been in terms of the birds observed  every cormorant noted  every pelican listed  every battlefield raven taxonomically placed  no tern unturned .  some men in armor would have been involved at some stage  but only because the ravens were perching on them .      the phoenix doesn   t lay eggs     said oats at one point .  this was a point a few points after the point where he asked the falconer if he   d been drinking .      she   s a bird     said hodgesaargh .     that   s what birds do .  i   ve never seen a bird that doesn   t lay eggs .  i collected the eggshell .      he scuttled off into the mews .  oats smiled nervously at granny weatherwax .      probably a bit of chicken shell     he said .     i   ve read about the phoenix .  it   s a mythical creature  a symbol  it           can   t say for sure     said granny .     i   ve never seen one that close to .      the falconer returned  clutching a small box .  it was full of tufts of fleece  in the middle of which was a pile of shell fragments .  oats picked up a couple .  they were a silvery gray and very light .      i found them in the ashes .         no one   s ever claimed to have found phoenix eggshell before     said oats accusingly .      didn   t know that  sir     said hodgesaargh innocently .     other wise i wouldn   t have looked .         did anyone else ever look  i wonder .     said granny .  she poked at the fragments .     ah       she said .      i thought p   raps the phoenixes used to live somewhere very dangerous       hodgesaargh began .      everywhere   s like that when you   re newborn     said granny .     i can see you   ve been thinking  hodgesaargh .         thank you  mistress weatherwax .         shame you didn   t think further     granny went on .      mistress .         there   s the bits of more than one egg here .         mistress .         hodgesaargh     said granny patiently     this phoenix laid more than one egg .         what .  but it can   t .  according to mythology       oats began .      oh  mythology     said granny .     mythology   s just the folktales of people who won    cos they had bigger swords .  they   re just the people to spot the finer points of ornithology  are they .  anyway  one of anything ain   t going to last for very long  is it .  firebirds have got enemies  same as everything else .  give me a hand up  mister oats .  how many birds in the mews  hodgesaargh .      the falconer looked at his fingers for a moment .      fifty .         counted    em lately .      they stood and watched while he walked from post to post .  then they stood and watched while he walked back and counted them again .  then he spent some time looking at his fingers .      fifty one .     said granny  helpfully .      i don   t understand it  mistress .         you   d better count them by types  then .      this produced a count of nineteen lappet faced worriers where there should have been eighteen .      perhaps one flew in because it saw the others     said oats .     like pigeons .         it doesn   t work like that  sir     said the falconer .      one of    em won   t be tethered     said granny .     trust me .      they found it at the back  slightly smaller that the other worriers  hanging meekly from its perch .   fewer birds could sit more meekly than the lancre wow hawk  or lappet faced worrier  a carnivore permanently on the lookout for the vegetarian option .  it spent most of its time asleep in any case  but when forced to find food it tended to sit on a branch out of the wind somewhere and wait for something to die .  when in the mews the worriers would initially perch like other birds and then  talons clamped around the pole  doze off peacefully upside down .  hodgesaargh bred them because they were found only in lancre and he liked the plumage  but all reputable falconers agreed that for hunting purposes the only way you could reliably bring down prey with a wowhawk was by using it in a slingshot .   granny reached out toward it .      i   ll fetch you a glove     said hodgesaargh  but she waved him away .   the bird hopped onto her wrist .   granny gasped  and little threads of green and blue burned like marsh gas along her arm for a moment .      are you all right .     said oats .      never been better .  i   ll need this bird  hodgesaargh .         it   s dark  mistress .         that won   t matter .  but it   ll need to be hooded .         oh  i never hood wowhawks  mistress .  they   re never any trouble .         this bird   this bird     said granny     is a bird i reckon no one   s ever seen before .  hood it .      hodgesaargh hesitated .  he recalled the circle of scorched earth and  before it  something looking for a shape in which it could survive        it is a wowhawk  isn   t it  mistress .         and what makes you ask that .     said granny slowly .     after all  you   re the falconer in these parts           because i found   in the woods   i saw           what did you see  hodgesaargh .      hodgesaargh gave up in the face of her stare .  to think that he   d tried to capture a phoenix .  at least the worst the other birds could do would be to draw blood .  supposing he   d been holding it   he was overcome by a very definite burning desire to get this bird out of here .   strangely  though  the other birds weren   t disturbed at all .  every hooded head was turned toward the little bird on granny weatherwax   s wrist .  every blind  hooded head .   hodgesaargh picked up another hood .  as he fastened it over the bird   s head he thought  for a moment  that there was a flash of gold from underneath .   he put that down as not his business .  he   d survived quite happily in the castle for many years by knowing where his business was  and he was suddenly very clear that it wasn   t here  thank goodness .   granny took a few deep breaths .      right     she said .     now we   ll go up to the castle .         what for .  why .     said oats .      good grief  man  why d   you think .         the vampires are gone     said the priest .     while you were   getting better .  mr .  hodges   aargh found out .  they   ve just left the soldiers and the  er  servants .  there was a lot of noise and the coach went  too .  there   s guards all over the place .         how did the coach get out  then .         well  it was the vampires    coach and their servant was driving it  but jason ogg said he saw mrs .  ogg  too .      granny steadied herself against the wall .      where did they go .         i thought you could read their minds or something     said oats .      young man  right now i don   t think i can read my own mind .         look  granny weatherwax  it   s obvious to me you   re still weak from loss of blood           don   t you dare tell me what i am     said granny .     don   t you dare .  now  where would gytha ogg   ve taken them .         i think           uberwald     said granny .     that   ll be it .         what .  how can you know that .         because nowhere in the village   d be safe  she wouldn   t go up to the gnarly ground on a night like this and with a baby to carry as well  and heading down onto the plains   d be downright daft    cos there   s no cover and i wouldn   t be surprised if the road is washed out by now .         but that   ll be right into danger .         more dangerous than here .     said granny .     they know about vampires in uberwald .  they   re used to    em .  there   s safe places .  pretty strong inns all along the coach road  for a start .  nanny   s practical .  she   ll think of that  i   m betting .     she winced  and added     but they   ll end up in the vampires    castle .         oh  surely not .         i can feel it in my blood     said granny .     that   s the trouble with gytha ogg .  far too practical .     she paused .     you mentioned guards .         they   ve locked themselves in the keep  mistress     said a voice in the doorway .  it was shawn ogg  with the rest of the mob behind him .  he advanced awkwardly  one hand held in front of him .      that   s a blessing  then     said granny .      but we can   t get in  mistress     said shawn .      so .  can they get out .         well   no  not really .  but the armory   s in there .  all our weapons .  and they   re boozing .         what   s that you   re holding .      shawn looked down .     it   s the lancrastian army knife     he said .     er   i left my sword in the armory  too .         has it got a tool for extracting soldiers from castles .         er   no .      granny peered closer .     what   s the curly thing .     she said .      oh  that   s the adjustable device for winning ontological arguments     said shawn .     the king asked for it .         works  does it .         er   if you twiddle it properly .         and this .         that is the tool for extracting the essential truth from a given statement     said shawn .      verence asked for that one too  did he .         yes  granny .         useful to a soldier  is it .     said oats .  he glanced at granny .  she   d changed as soon as the others had entered .  before  she   d been bowed and tired .  now she was standing tall and haughty  supported in a scaffolding of pride .      oh yes  sir     cos of when the other side are yelling     we   re gonna cut yer tonk   yer tongue off        shawn blushed and corrected himself     and things like that           yes .         well  you can tell if they   re going to be right     said shawn .      i need a horse     said granny .      there   s old poorchick   s plough horse       shawn began .      too slow .         i   er   i   ve got a mule     said oats .     the king was kind enough to let me put it in the stables .         neither one thing nor t   other  eh .     said granny .     it suits you .  that   ll do for me  then .  fetch it up here and i   ll be off to get the girls back .         what .  i thought you wanted it to take you up to your cottage .  into uberwald .  alone .  i couldn   t let you do that .         i ain   t asking you to let me do anything .  now off you go and fetch it  otherwise om will be angry  i expect .         but you can hardly stand up .         certainly i can .  off you go .      oats turned to the assembled lancrastians for support .      you wouldn   t let a poor old lady go off to confront monsters on a wild night like this  would you .      they watched him owlishly for a while just in case something interestingly nasty was going to happen to him .   then someone near the back said     so why should we care what happens to monsters .      and shawn ogg said     that   s granny weatherwax  that is .         but she   s an old lady .     oats insisted .   the crowd took a few steps back .  oats was clearly a dangerous man to be around .      would you go out alone on a night like this .     he said .   the voice at the back said     depends if i knew where granny weatherwax was .         don   t think i didn   t hear that  bestiality carter     said granny  but there was just a hint of satisfaction in her voice .     now  are we fetchin    your mule  mr .  oats .         are you sure you can walk .         of course i can .      oats gave up .  granny smirked triumphantly at the crowd and strode through them and toward the stables  with him trotting after her .   when he hurried around the corner he almost collided with her  standing as stiff as a rod .      is there anyone watchin    me .     she said .      what .  no  i don   t think so .  apart from me  of course .         you don   t count     said granny .   she sagged  and almost collapsed .  he caught her  and she pummeled him on the arm .  the wowhawk flapped its wings desperately .      let go .  i just lost my footin     that   s all .         yes  yes  of course .  you just lost your footing     he said soothingly .      and don   t try to humor me  either .         yes  yes  all right .         it   s just that it don   t do to let things slide  if you must know .         like your foot did just then           exactly .         so perhaps i   ll take your arm  because it   s very muddy .      he could just make out her face .  it was a picture  but not one you   d hang over the fireplace .  some sort of inner debate was raging .      well  if you think you   re going to fall over       she said .      that   s right  that   s right     said oats  gratefully .     i nearly hurt my ankle back there as it is .         i   ve always said young people today don   t have the stamina     said granny  as if testing out an idea .      that   s right  we don   t have the stamina .         and your eyesight is prob   ly not as good as mine owin    to too much readin        said granny .      blind as a bat  that   s right .         all right .      and so  at cross purposes  and lurching occasionally  they reached the stables .   the mule shook its head at granny weatherwax when they arrived at its loose box .  it knew trouble when it saw her .      it   s a bit cantankerous     said oats .      is it .     said granny .     then we shall see what we can do .      she walked unsteadily over to the creature and pulled one of its ears down to the level of her mouth .  she whispered something .  the mule blinked .      that   s sorted out  then     she said .     help me up .         just let me put the bridle on           young man  i might be temp   ry not at my best  but when i need a bridle on any creature they can put me to bed with a shovel .  give me a hand up  and kindly avert your face whilst so doing .      oats gave up  and made a stirrup of his hands to help her into the saddle .      why don   t i come with you .         there   s only one mule .  anyway  you   d be a hindrance .  i   d be worrying about you all the time .      she slid gently off the other side of the saddle and landed in the straw .  the wowhawk fluttered up and perched on a beam  and if oats had been paying attention he   d have wondered how a hooded bird could fly so confidently .      drat .         madam  i do know something about medicine .  you are in no state to ride anything .         not right now  i admit     said granny  her voice slightly muffled .  she pulled some straw away from her face and waved a hand wildly to be helped up .     but you just wait until i find my feet           all right .  all right .  supposing i ride and you hang on behind me .  you can   t weigh more than the harmonium  and he managed that all right .      granny looked owlishly at him .  she seemed drunk  at that stage when hitherto unconsidered things seem a good idea  like another drink .  then she appeared to reach a decision .      oh   if you insist        oats found a length of rope and  after some difficulties caused by granny   s determined belief that she was doing him some sort of favor  got her strapped into a pillion position .      just so long as you understand that i didn   t ax you to come along and i don   t need your help     said granny .      ax .         ask  then     said granny .     slipped into a bit of rural there .      oats stared ahead for a while .  then he dismounted  lifted granny down  propped her up while she protested  disappeared into the night  came back shortly carrying the ax from the forge  used more rope to tie it to his waist  and mounted up again .      you   re learnin        said granny .   as they left she raised an arm .  the wowhawk fluttered down and settled on her wrist .       the air in the rocking coach was acquiring a distinct personality .   magrat sniffed .     i   m sure i changed esme not long ago        after a fruitless search of the baby they looked under the seat .  greebo was lying asleep with his legs in the air .      isn   t that just like him .     said nanny .     he can   t see an open door without going through it  bless    im .  and he likes to be near his mum .         could we open a window .     said magrat .      the rain   ll get in .         yes  but the smell will go out .     magrat sighed .     you know  we   ve left at least one bag of toys .  verence was really very keen on those mobiles .         i still think it   s a bit early to start the poor little mite on education     said nanny  as much to take magrat   s mind off the current dangers as from a desire to strike a blow for ignorance .      environment is so very important     said magrat solemnly .      did i hear he told you to read improvin    books and listen to posh music while you were expecting .     said nanny  as the coach rushed through a puddle .      well  the books were all right  but the piano doesn   t work properly and all i could hear was shawn practicing the trumpet solo     said magrat .      it   s not his fault if no one wants to join in     said nanny .  she steadied herself as the coach lurched .     good turn of speed on this thing .         i wish we hadn   t forgotten the bath  too     magrat mused .     and i think we left the bag with the toy farm .  and we   re low on nappies           let   s have a look at her     nanny said .   baby esme was passed across the swaying coach .      yes  let   s have a look at you       said nanny .   the small blue eyes focused on nanny ogg .  the pink face on the small lolling head gave her a speculative look  working out whether she   d do as a drink or a toilet .      that   s good  at this age     said nanny .     focusing like that .  unusual in a babby .         if she is at this age     said magrat darkly .      hush  now .  if granny   s in there  she   s not interfering .  she never interferes .  anyway  it wouldn   t be her mind in there  that   s not how she works it .         what is it  then .         you   ve seen her do it .  what do you think .         i   d say   all the things that make her her     magrat ventured .      that   s about right .  she wraps    em all up and puts    em safe somewhere .         you know how she can even be silent in her own special way .         oh yes .  no one can be quiet like esme .  you can hardly hear yourself think for the silence .      they bounced in their seats as the coach sprang in and out of a pothole .      nanny .         yes  love .         verence will be all right  won   t he .         yep .  i   d trust them little devils with anything except a barrel of stingo or a cow .  even granny says the kelda   s damn good           the kelda .         sort of a wise lady .  i think the current one   s called big aggie .  you don   t see much of their women .  some say there   s only ever one at a time  and she   s the kelda an    has a hundred kids at a go .         that sounds   very       magrat began .      nah  i reckons they   re a bit like the dwarfs and there   s hardly any difference except under the loincloth     said nanny .      i expect granny knows     said magrat .      and she ain   t sayin        said nanny .     she says it   s their business .         and   he   ll be all right with them .         oh yes .         he   s very   kind  you know .     magrat   s sentence hung in the air .      that   s nice .         and a good king  as well .      nanny nodded .      it   s just that i wish people took him   more seriously     magrat went on .      it   s a shame     said nanny .      he does work very hard .  and he worries about everything .  but people just seem to ignore him .      nanny wondered how to approach it .      he could try having the crown taken in a bit     she ventured  as the coach bounced over another rut .     there   s plenty of dwarfs up at copperhead   d be glad to make it smaller for him .         it is the traditional crown  nanny .         yes  but if it wasn   t for his ears it   d be a collar on the poor man     said nanny .     he could try bellowing a bit more  too .         oh  he couldn   t do that  he hates shouting .         that   s a shame .  people like to see a bit of bellowing in a king .  the odd belch is always popular  too .  even a bit of carousing   d help  if he could manage it .  you know  quaffing and such .         i think he thinks that isn   t what people want .  he   s very conscious of the needs of today   s citizen .         ah  well  i can see where there   s a problem  then     said nanny .     people need something today but they generally need something else tomorrow .  just tell him to concentrate on bellowing and carousing .         and belching .         that   s optional .         and           yes  dear .         he   ll be all right  will he .         oh yes .  nothing   s going to happen to him .  it   s like that chess stuff  see .  let the queen do the fightin        cos if you lose the king you   ve lost everything .         and us .         oh  we   re always all right .  you remember that .  we happen to other people .          a lot of people were happening to king verence .  he lay in a sort of warm  empty daze  and every time he opened his eyes it was to see scores of the feegle watching him in the firelight .  he overheard snatches of conversation or  more correctly  argument .         he   s oor kingie noo .         aye  sortaley .         that pish of a hobyah .         hushagob .  d   man   s sicken  can y   no vard .         aye  mucken .  born sicky  imhoe .      verence felt a small yet powerful kick on his foot .      see you  kingie .  a   ye a lang stick o   midlin or wha     bigjobs .         yes  well done     he mumbled .   the interrogating feegle spat near his ear .      ach  i wouldna    gi   ye skeppens for him        there was a sudden silence  a real rarity in any space containing at least one feegle .  verence swiveled his eyes sideways .   big aggie had emerged from the smoke .   now that he could see her clearly  the dumpy creature looked like a squat version of nanny ogg .  and there was something about the eyes .  verence was technically an absolute ruler and would continue to be so provided he didn   t make the mistake of repeatedly asking lancrastians to do anything they didn   t want to do .  he was aware that the commander in chief of his armed forces was more inclined to take orders from his mum than his king .   whereas big aggie didn   t even have to say anything .  everyone just watched her  and then went and got things done .   big aggie   s man appeared at her side .      ye   ll be wantin    to save yer ladie and yer bairn  big aggie   s thinkin        he said .   verence nodded .  he didn   t feel strong enough to do anything else .      but ye   ll still be verra crassick from loss o    blud  big aggie reckons .  the heelins put something in their bite that makes ye biddable .      verence agreed absolutely .  anything anyone said was all right by him .   another pixie appeared through the smoke  carrying an earthenware bowl .  white suds slopped over the top .      ye canna be kinging lyin    down     said big aggie   s man .     so she   s made up some brose for ye        the pixie lowered the bowl  which looked as though it was full of cream  although dark lines spiraled on its surface .  its bearer stood back reverentially .      what   s in it .     verence croaked .      milk     said big aggie   s man  promptly .     and some o    big aggie   s brewin    .  an    herbs .      verence grasped the last word thankfully .  he shared with his wife the curious but unshakeable conviction that anything with herbs in it was safe and wholesome and nourishing .      so you   ll be having a huge dram     said the old pixie .     and then we   ll be finding you a sword .         i   ve never used a sword     said verence  trying to pull himself into a sitting position .     i   i believe violence is the last resort           ach  weel  so long as ye   ve brung yer bucket and spade     said big aggie   s man .     now you just drink up  kingie .  ye   ll soon see things differently .          the vampires glided easily over the moonlit clouds .  there was no weather up here and  to agnes   s surprise  no chill either .      i thought you turned into bats .     she shouted to vlad .      oh  we could if we wanted to     he laughed .     but that   s a bit too melodramatic for father .  he says we should not conform to crass stereotypes .      a girl glided alongside them .  she looked rather like lacrimosa  that is  she looked like someone who admired the way lacrimosa looked and so had tried to look like her .  i bet she   s not a natural brunette  said perdita .  and if i used that much mascara i   d at least try not to look like harry the happy panda .      this is morbidia     said vlad .     although she   s been calling herself tracy lately  to be cool .  mor   tracy  this is agnes .         what a good name .     said morbidia .     how clever of you to come up with it .  vlad  everyone wants to stop off at escrow .  can we .         it   s my real       agnes began  but her words were carried away on the wind .      i thought we were going to the castle     said vlad .      yes  but some of us haven   t fed for days and that old woman was hardly even a snack and the count won   t allow us to feed in lancre yet and he says it   ll be all right and it   s not much out of our way .         oh .  well  if father says        morbidia swooped away .      we haven   t been to escrow for weeks     said vlad .     it   s a pleasant little town .         you   re going to feed there .     said agnes .      it   s not what you think .         you don   t know what i think .         i can guess  though .     he smiled at her .     i wonder if father said yes because he wants you to see .  it   s so easy to be frightened of what you don   t know .  and then  perhaps  you could be a sort of ambassador .  you could tell lancre what life under the magpyrs is really like .         people being dragged out of their beds  blood on the walls  that sort of thing .         there you go again  agnes .  it   s most unfair .  once people find out you   re a vampire they act as if you   re some kind of monster .      they curved gently through the night air .      father   s rather proud of his work in escrow     said vlad .     i think you   ll be impressed .  and then perhaps i could dare hope           no .         i   m really being rather understanding about this  agnes .         you attacked granny weatherwax .  you bit her .         symbolically .  to welcome her into the family .         oh really .  oh  that makes it all better  does it .  and she   ll be a vampire .         certainly .  a good one  i suspect .  but that   s only horrifying if you think being a vampire is a bad thing .  we don   t .  you   ll come to see that we   re right  in time     said vlad .     yes  escrow would be good for you .  for us .  we shall see what can be done        agnes stared .   he does smile nicely    he   s a vampire .  all right  but apart from that    oh  apart from that  eh .  nanny would tell you to make the most of it .  that might work for nanny  but can you imagine kissing that .  yes  i can .  i will admit  he does smile nicely  and he looks good in those waistcoats  but look at what he is   do you notice .  notice what .  there   s something different about him .  he   s just trying to get around us  that   s all .  no   there   s something   new        father says escrow is a model community     said vlad .     it shows what happens if ancient enmity is put aside and humans and vampires learn to live in peace .  yes .  it   s not far now .  escrow is the future .          a low ground mist drifted between the trees  curling up in little tongues as the mule   s hooves disturbed it .  rain dripped off the twigs .  there was even a bit of sullen thunder now  not the outgoing sort that cracks the sky but the other sort  which hangs around the horizons and gossips nastily with other storms .   mightily oats had tried a conversation with himself a few times  but the problem with a conversation was that the other person had to join in .  occasionally he heard a snore from behind him .  when he looked around  the wowhawk on her shoulder flapped its wings in his face .   sometimes the snoring would stop with a grunt  and a hand would tap him on a shoulder and point out a direction which looked like every other direction .   it did so now .      what   s that you   re singing .     granny demanded .      i wasn   t singing very loudly .         what   s it called .         it   s called    om is in his holy temple .            nice tune     said granny .      it keeps my spirits up     oats admitted .  a wet twig slapped his face .  after all  he thought  i may have a vampire behind me  however good she is .      you take comfort from it  do you .         i suppose so .         even that bit about    smiting evil with thy sword    .  that   d worry me  if i was an omnian .  do you get just a little sort of tap for a white lie but minced up for murder .  that   s the sort of thing that   d keep me awake o    nights .         well  actually   i shouldn   t be singing it at all  to be honest .  the convocation of ee struck it from the songbook as being incompatible with the ideals of modern omnianism .         that line about crushing infidels .         that   s the one  yes .         you sung it anyway  though .         it   s the version my grandmother taught me     said oats .      she was keen on crushing infidels .         well  mainly i think she was in favor of crushing mrs .  ahrim next door  but you   ve got the right idea  yes .  she thought the world would be a better place with a bit more crushing and smiting .         prob   ly true .         not as much smiting and crushing as she   d like  though  i think     said oats .     a bit judgmental  my grandmother .         nothing wrong with that .  judging is human .         we prefer to leave it ultimately to om     said oats and  out here in the dark  that statement sounded lost and all alone .      bein    human means judgin    all the time     said the voice behind him .     this and that  good and bad  making choices every day   that   s human .         and are you so sure you make the right decisions .         no .  but i do the best i can .         and hope for mercy  eh .      the bony finger prodded him in the back .      mercy   s a fine thing  but judgin    comes first .  otherwise you don   t know what you   re bein    merciful about .  anyway  i always heard you omnians were keen on smitin    and crushin    .         those were   different days .  we use crushing arguments now .         and long pointed debates  i suppose .         well  there are two sides to every question           what do you do when one of    em   s wrong .     the reply came back like an arrow .      i meant that we are enjoined to see things from the other person   s point of view     said oats  patiently .      you mean that from the point of view of a torturer  torture is all right .         mistress weatherwax  you are a natural disputant .         no i ain   t .         you   d certain enjoy yourself at the synod  anyway .  they   ve been known to argue for days about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin .      he could almost feel granny   s mind working .  at last she said     what size pin .         i don   t know that  i   m afraid .         well  if it   s an ordinary household pin  then there   ll be sixteen .         sixteen angels .         that   s right .         why .         i don   t know .  perhaps they like dancing .      the mule picked its way down a bank .  the mist was getting thicker here .      you   ve counted sixteen .     said oats eventually .      no  but it   s as good an answer as any you   ll get .  and that   s what your holy men discuss  is it .         not usually .  there is a very interesting debate raging at the moment about the nature of sin  for example .         and what do they think .  against it  are they .         it   s not as simple as that .  it   s not a black and white issue .  there are so many shades of gray .         nope .         pardon .         there   s no grays  only white that   s got grubby .  i   m surprised you don   t know that .  and sin  young man  is when you treat people as things .  including yourself .  that   s what sin is .         it   s a lot more complicated than that           no .  it ain   t .  when people say things are a lot more complicated than that  they means they   re getting worried that they won   t like the truth .  people as things  that   s where it starts .         oh  i   m sure there are worse crimes           but they starts with thinking about people as things        granny   s voice trailed off .  oats let the mule walk on for a few minutes  and then a snort told him that granny had awoken again .      you strong in your faith  then .     she said  as if she couldn   t leave things alone .   oats sighed .     i try to be .         but you read a lot of books  i   m thinking .  hard to have faith  ain   t it  when you read too many books .      oats was glad she couldn   t see his face .  was the old woman reading his mind through the back of his head .      yes     he said .      still got it  though .         yes .         why .         if i didn   t  i wouldn   t have anything .      he waited for a while  and then tried a counterattack .      you   re not a believer yourself  then  mistress weatherwax .      there was a few moments    silence as the mule picked its way over the mossy tree roots .  oats thought he heard  behind them  the sound of a horse  but then it was lost in the sighing of the wind .      oh  i reckon i believes in tea  sunrises  that sort of thing     said granny .      i was referring to religion .         i know a few gods in these parts  if that   s what you mean .      oats sighed .     many people find faith a great solace     he said .  he wished he was one of them .      good .         really .  somehow i thought you   d argue .         it   s not my place to tell    em what to believe  if they act decent .         but it   s not something that you feel drawn to  perhaps  in the darker hours .         no .  i   ve already got a hot water bottle .      the wowhawk fluttered its wings .  oats stared into the damp  dark mist .  suddenly he was angry .      and that   s what you think religion is  is it .     he said  trying to keep his temper .      i gen   rally don   t think about it at all     said the voice behind him .   it sounded fainter .  he felt granny clutch his arm to steady herself        are you all right .     he said .      i wish this creature would go faster   i ain   t entirely myself .         we could stop for a rest .         no .  not far now .  oh  i   ve been so stupid        the thunder grumbled .  he felt her grip lessen  and heard her hit the ground .   oats leapt down .  granny weatherwax was lying awkwardly on the moss  her eyes closed .  he took her wrist .  there was a pulse there  but it was horribly weak .  she felt icy cold .   when he patted her face she opened her eyes .      if you raise the subject of religion at this point     she wheezed     i   ll give you such a hidin          her eyes shut again .   oats sat down to get his breath back .  icy cold   yes  there was something cold about all of her  as though she always pushed heat away .  any kind of warmth .   he heard the sound of the horse again  and the faint jingle of a harness .  it stopped a little way away .      hello .     said oats  standing up .  he strained to see the rider in the darkness  but there was just a dim shape farther along the track .      are you following us .  hello .      he took a few steps and made out the horse  head bowed against the rain .  the rider was just a darker shadow in the night .   suddenly awash with dread  oats ran and slithered back to granny   s silent form .  he struggled out of his drenched coat and put it over her  for whatever good that would do  and looked around desperately for anything that could make a fire .  fire  that was the thing .  it brought life and drove away the darkness .   but the trees were tall firs  dripping wet with dank bracken underneath among the black trunks .  there was nothing that would burn here .   he fished hurriedly in his pocket and found a waxed box with his last few matches in it .  even a few dry twigs or a tuft of grass would do  anything that   d dry out another handful of twigs     rain oozed through his shirt .  the air was full of water .   oats hunched over so that his hat kept the drips off  and pulled out the book of om for the comfort that it brought .  in times of trouble  om would surely show the way        i   ve already got a hot water bottle        damn you     he said  under his breath .   he opened the book at random  struck a match and read         and in that time  in the land of the cyrinites  there was a multiplication of camels        the match hissed out .   no help there  no clue .  he tried again .         and looked upon gul arah  and the lamentation of the desert  and rode then to        oats remembered the vampire   s mocking smile .  what words could you trust .  he struck the third match with shaking hands and flicked the book open again and read  in the weak dancing light         and brutha said to simony     where there is darkness we will make a great light           the match died .  and there was darkness .   granny weatherwax groaned .  at the back of his mind  oats thought he could hear the sounds of hooves  slowly approaching .   oats knelt in the mud and tried a prayer  but there was no answering voice from the sky .  there never had been .  he   d been told never to expect one .  that wasn   t how om worked anymore .  alone of all the gods  he   d been taught  om delivered the answers straight into the depths of the head .  since the prophet brutha  om was the silent god .  that   s what they said .   if you didn   t have faith  then you weren   t anything .  there was just the dark .   he shuddered in the gloom .  was the god silent  or was there no one to speak .   he tried praying again  more desperately this time  fragments of childish prayer  losing control of the words and even of their direction  so that they tumbled out and soared away into the universe addressed simply to the occupier .   the rain dripped off his hat .   he knelt and waited in the wet darkness  and listened to his own mind  and remembered  and took out the book of om once more .   and made a great light .       the coach thundered through pine trees by a lake  struck a tree root  lost a wheel and skidded to a halt on its side as the horses bolted .   igor picked himself up  lurched to the coach and raised a door .      thorry about that     he said .     i   m afraid thith alwayth happenth when the marthter ithn   t on board .  everyone all right down there .      a hand grabbed him by the throat .      you could have warned us .     nanny growled .     we were thrown all over the place .  where the hell are we .  is this slake .      a match flared and igor lit a torch .      we   re near the cathle     he said .      whose .         the magpyrth .         we   re near the vampires    castle .         yeth .  i think the old marthter did thomething to the road here .  the wheelth alwayth come off  ath thure ath eggth ith eggth .  bringth in the vithitorth  he thed .         it didn   t occur to you to mention it .     said nanny  climbing out and giving magrat a hand .      thorry .  it   th been a buthy day        nanny took the torch .  the flames illuminated a crude sign nailed to a tree .         don   t go near the castle .  .        nanny read .     nice of them to put an arrow pointing the way to it  too .         oh  the marthter did that     said igor .     otherwithe people wouldn   t notice it .      nanny peered into the gloom .     and who   s in the castle now .         a few thervantth .         will they let us in .         that   th not a problem .     igor fished in his noisome shirt and pulled out a very big key on a string .      we going to go into their castle .     said magrat .      looks like it   s the only place around     said nanny ogg .  heading up the track .     the coach is wrecked .  we   re miles from anywhere else .  do you want to keep the baby out all night .  a castle   s a castle .  it   ll have locks .  all the vampires are in lancre .  and           well .         it   s what esme would   ve done .  i feels it in my blood .      a little way off something howled .  nanny looked at igor .      werewolf .     she said .      that   th right .         not a good idea to hang around  then .      she pointed to a sign painted on a rock .         don   t take thi   quicke  t route to the ca  tle        she read aloud .     you   ve got to admire a mind like that .  definitely a student of human nature .         won   t there be a lot of ways in .     said magrat  as they walked past a sign that said  don   t go nere the coach park     yds .  on left .      igor .     said nanny .      vampireth uthed to fight amongtht themthelveth     said igor .     there   th only one way in .         oh  all right  if we must     said magrat     you take the rocker  and the used nappy bag .  and the teddies .  and the thing that goes round and round and plays noises when she pulls the string        a sign near the drawbridge said la  t chance not to go near the ca  tle  and nanny ogg laughed and laughed .      the count   s not going to be very happy about you  igor     she said  as he unlocked the doors .      thod him     he said .     i   m going to pack up my thtuff and head for blintth .  there   th alwayth a job for an igor up there .  more lightning thtriketh per year than anywhere in the mountainth  they thay .      nanny ogg wiped her eye .     good job we   re soaked already     she said .     all right  let   s get in .  and  igor  if you haven   t been thtraight with us  sorry  straight with us  i   ll have your guts for garters .      igor looked down bashfully .     oh  that   th more than a man could pothibly hope for     he murmured .   magrat giggled and igor pushed open the door and hurriedly shuffled inside .      what .     said nanny .      haven   t you noticed the looks he   s been giving you .     said magrat  as they followed the lurching figure .      what  him .     said nanny .      could be carrying a torch for you     said magrat .      i thought it was just to see where he   s going .     said nanny  a little bit of panic in her voice .     i mean  i haven   t got my best drawers on or anything .         i think he   s a bit of a romantic  actually     said magrat .      oh  i don   t know  i really don   t     said nanny .     i mean  it   s flattering and everything  but i really don   t think i could be goin    out with a man with a limp .         limp what .      nanny ogg had always considered herself unshockable  but there   s no such thing .  shocks can come from unexpected directions .      i am a married woman     said magrat  smiling at her expression .  and it felt good  just once  to place a small tintack in the path of nanny   s carefree amble through life .      but is   i mean  is verence  you know  all right in the           oh yes .  everything   s   fine .  but now i understand what your jokes were about .         what  all of them .     said nanny  like someone who   d found all the aces removed from their favorite pack of cards .      well  not the one about the priest  the old woman and the rhinoceros .         i should just about hope so .     said nanny .     i didn   t understand that one until i was forty .      igor limped back .      there   th jutht the thervantth     he said .     you could thtay down in my quarterth in the old tower .  there   th thick doorth .         mrs .  ogg would really like that     said magrat .     she was saying just now what good legs you   ve got  weren   t you  nanny           do you want thome .     said igor earnestly  leading the way up the steps .     i   ve got plenty and i could do with the thpathe in the ithehouthe .         you what .     said nanny  stopping dead .      i   m your man if there   th any organ you need     said igor .   there was a strangled coughing noise from magrat .      you   ve got   bits of people stored on ice .     said nanny  horrified .     bits of strange people .  chopped up .  i   m not taking another step .      now igor looked horrified .      not thtrangerth     he said .     family .         you chopped up your family .     nanny backed away .   igor waved his hands frantically .      it   s a tradithion .     he said .     every igor leaveth hith body to the family .  why wathte good organth .  look at my uncle igor  he died of buffaloeth  tho there wath a perfectly good heart and thome kidneyth going begging  pluth he   d thtill got grandad   th handth and they were damn good handth  let me tell you .     he sniffed .     i with i   d had them  he wath a great thurgeon .         we ll   i suppose every family says things like    he   s got his father   s eyes          nanny began .      no  my thecond couthin igor got them .         but   but   who does the cutting and sewing .     said magrat .      i do .  an igor learnth houthehold thurgery on hith father   th knee     said igor .     and then practitheth on hith grandfather   th kidneyth .            scuse me     said nanny .     what did you say your uncle died of .         buffaloeth     said igor  unlocking another door .      he broke out in them .         a herd fell on him .  a freak acthident .  we don   t talk about it .         sorry  are you telling us you do surgery on yourself .     said magrat .      it   th not hard when you know what you   re doing .  thome timeth you need a mirror  of courth  and it helpth if thomeone can put a finger on the knotth .         isn   t it painful .         oh no  i always tell them to take it away jutht before i pull the thtring tight .      the door creaked open .  it was a long  tortured groaning noise .  in fact there was more creak than door  and it went on just a few seconds after the door had stopped .      that sounds dreadful     said nanny .      thank you .  it took dayth to get right .  creakth like that don   t jutht happen by themthelveth .      there was a woof from the darkness and something leapt at igor  knocking him off his feet .      got off  you big thoppy .      it was a dog .  or several dogs rolled  as it were  into one .  there were four legs  and they were nearly all the same length although not  agnes noted  all the same color .  there was one head  although the left ear was black and pointed while the right ear was brown and white and flopped .  it was a very enthusiastic animal in the department of slobber .      thith ith thcrapth     said igor  fighting to get to his feet in a hail of excited paws .     he   th a thilly old thing .         scraps   yes     said nanny .     good name .  good name .         he   th theventy eight yearth old     said igor  leading the way down a winding staircase .     thome of him .         very neat stitching     said magrat .     he looks well on it  too .  happy as a dog with two   oh  i see he does have two           i had one thpare     said igor  leading the way with scraps bounding along beside him .     i thought  he   th tho happy with one  jutht think of the fun he could have with two        nanny ogg   s mouth didn   t even get half open        don   t you even think of saying anything  gytha ogg .     snapped magrat .      me .     said nanny innocently .      yes .  and you were .  i could see you .  you know he was talking about tails  not   anything else .         oh  i thought about that long ago     said igor .     it   th obviouth .  thaveth wear and tear  pluth you can uthe one while you   re replathing the other .  i ecthperimented on mythelf .      their footsteps echoed on the stairs .      now  what are we talking about here  exactly .     said nanny  in a quiet i   m only asking out of interest tone of voice .      heartth     said igor .      oh  two hearts .  you   ve got two hearts .         yeth .  the other one belonged to poor mr .  thwinetth down at the thawmill  but hith wife thed it wath no uthe to him after the acthident  what with him not having a head to go with it .         you   re a bit of a self made man on the quiet  aren   t you     said magrat .      who did your brain .     said nanny .      can   t do brainth yourthelf     said igor .      only   you   ve got all those stitches           oh  i put a metal plate in my head     said igor .     and a wire down my neck all the way to my bootth .  i got fed up with all thothe lightning thtriketh .  here we are .     he unlocked another groaning door .     my little plathe .      it was a dank vaulted room  clearly lived in by someone who didn   t spent a lot of social time there .  there was a fireplace with a dog basket in front of it  and a bed with a mattress and one blanket .  crude cupboards lined one wall .      there   th a well under that cover there     he said     and there   th a privy through there           what   s through that door .     said nanny  pointing to one with heavy bolts across it .      nothing     said igor .   nanny shot him a glance .  but the bolts were very firmly on this side .      this looks like a crypt     she said .     with a fireplace .         when the old count wath alive he liked to get warm of an evening before going out     said igor .     golden dayth  them wath .  i wouldn   t give you tuppenth for the new vampireth .  d   you know  they wanted me to get rid of thcrapth .      scraps leapt up and tried to lick nanny   s face .      i thaw lacrimotha kick him onthe     said igor darkly .  he rubbed his hands together .     can i get you ladieth anything to eat .         no     said nanny and magrat together .   scraps tried to lick igor .  he was a dog with a lot of lick to share .      thcrapth play dead     said igor .  the dog dropped and rolled over with his legs in the air .      thee .     said igor .     he rememberth .         won   t we be cornered down here if the magpyrs come .     said magrat .      they don   t come down here .  it   th not modern enough for them     said igor .     and there   th wayth out if they do .      magrat glanced at the bolted door .  it didn   t look the kind of way out anyone would want to take .      what about weapons .     she said .     i shouldn   t think there   d be any anti vampire stuff in a vampire   s castle  would there .         why  thertainly     said igor .      there is .         ath much ath you want .  the old marthter wath very keen on that .  when we had vithitorth ecthpected  he alwayth thed     igor  make thertain the windowth are clean and there   th lotth of lemonth and bitth of ornament that can be turned into religiouth thymbolth around the plathe .     he enjoyed it when people played by the ruleth .  very fair  the old marthter .         yeah  but that   d mean he   d die  wouldn   t it .     said nanny .  she opened a cupboard and a stack of wrinkled lemons fell out .   igor shrugged .     you win thome  you lothe thome     he said .     the old marther uthed to thay     igor  the day vampireth win all the time  that   th the day we   ll be knocked back beyond return .     mind you  he got annoyed when people pinched hith thockth .  he   d thay     thod  that wath thilk  ten dollarth a pair in ankh morpork .            and he probably spent a lot of money on blotting paper  too     said nanny .  another cupboard revealed a rack of stakes  along with a mallet and a simple anatomical diagram with an x over the heart area .      the chart wath my idea  mithith ogg     said igor proudly .     the old marthter got fed up with people just hammering the thtaketh in any old where .  he thed he didn   t mind the dying  that wath quite rethtful  but he did object to looking like a colander .         you   re a bright chap  aren   t you  igor     said nanny .   igor beamed .     i   ve got a good brain in my head .         chose it yourself  did you .  no  only joking .  you can   t do brains .         i   ve got a dithtant couthin at untheen univerthity  you know .         really .  what   s he do there .         floatth around in hith jar     said igor  proudly .     thall i thow you the holy water thellar .  the old marthter build up a very good collection .         sorry .  a vampire collected holy water .     said magrat .      i think i   m beginning to understand     said nanny .     he was a sportsman  right .         egthactly .         and a good sportsman always gives the valiant prey a decent chance     said nanny .     even if it means having a cellar of chateau nerf de pope .  sounds an intelligent bird  your old boy .  not like this new one .  he   s just clever .         i don   t follow you     said magrat .      being killed   s nothing to a vampire     said nanny .     they always find a way of coming back .  everyone knows that  who knows anything about vampires .  if they   re not too hard to kill and it   s all a bit of an adventure for people  well  like as not they   ll just stake him or chuck him in the river and go home .  then he has a nice restful decade or so  bein    dead  and comes back from the grave and away he goes again .  that way he never gets totally wiped out and the lads of the village get some healthy exercise .         the magpyrs will come after us     said magrat  clutching the baby to her .     they   ll see we   re not in lancre and they   ll know we couldn   t have gone down to the plains .  they   ll find the smashed coach  too .  they   ll find us  nanny .      nanny looked at the array of jars and bottles  and the stakes neatly arranged in order of size .      it   ll take them a little while     she said .     we   ve got time to get   prepared .      she turned around with a bottle of blessed water in one hand  a crossbow loaded with a wooden bolt  and a bag of musty lemons in her mouth .      eg oo it i ay     she said .      pardon .     said magrat .   nanny spat out the lemons .      now we   ll try things my way     she said .     i   m not good at thinkin    like granny but i   m bloody good at actin    like me .  head ology   s for them as can handle it .  let   s kick some bat .          the wind soughed across the moors on the edge of lancre  and hissed through the heather .   around some old mounds  half buried in brambles  it shook the wet branches of a single thorn tree  and shredded the curling smoke that drifted up through the roots .   there was a single scream .   down below  the nac mac feegle were doing their best  but strength is not the same as weight and mass and even with pixies hanging on to every limb and big aggie herself sitting on verence   s chest he was still hard to control .      i think mebbe the drink was a wee bitty too trackle .     said big aggie   s man  looking down at verence   s bloodshot eyes and foaming mouth .     i   m sayin     mebbe it was wrong jus    giving him fifty times more than we tak    .  he   s not used to it        big aggie shrugged .   in the far corner of the barrow half a dozen pixies backed out of the hole they   d hacked into the next chamber  dragging a sword .  for bronze  it was quite well preserved   the old chieftains of lancre reckoned to be buried with their weapons in order to fight their enemies in the next world  and since you didn   t become a chieftain of ancient lancre without sending a great many enemies to the next world  they liked to take weapons that could be relied upon to last .   under the direction of the old pixie  they maneuvered it within reached of verence   s flailing hand .      are ye scrat .     said big aggie   s man .     yin .  tan .  tetra .      the feegle leapt away in every direction .  verence rose almost vertically  bounced off the roof  grabbed the sword  hacked madly until he   d cut a hole through to the outside world  and escaped into the night .   the pixies clustered around the walls of the barrow turned their eyes to their kelda .   big aggie nodded .      big aggie says ye   d best see him come to nae harm     said the old pixie .   a thousand small but very sharp weapons waved in the smoky air .      hoons .         kill    em a    .         nac mac feegle .      a few seconds later the chamber was empty .       nanny hurried across the castle   s main hall  burdened with stakes  and stopped dead .      what the hell   s that thing .     she said .     takes up a whole wall .         oh  that wath the old count   th pride and joy     said igor .     he wathn   t very modern  he alwayth thaid  but the thentury of the fruitbat had it   th compenthathionth .  thometimeth he   d play with it for hourth on end        it was an organ  or possibly what an organ hoped to be when it grew up  because it dominated the huge room .  a music lover to the core  nanny couldn   t help trotting over to inspect it .  it was black  its pipes framed and enclosed in intricate ebony fretwork  with the stops and keyboard made of dead elephant .      how does it work .     she said .      water power     said igor proudly .     there   th an underground river .  the marthter had thith made thpethially to hith own de thign        nanny ran her fingers over a brass plate screwed above the keyboard .   it read  hlisten to zer chiltren off der night   vot vonderful mhusick dey make .  mnftrd .  by bergholt stuttley johnson  ankh morpork .      it   s a johnson     she breathed .     i haven   t got my hands on a johnson for ages       she looked closer .     what   s this .     scream      .     thunderclap       .     wolf howl      .  there   s a whole set of stops just marked    creaky floors    .  can   t you play music on this thing .         oh yeth .  but the old marthter wath more interethted in   effectth .      there was still a dust covered sheet of music on the stand  which someone had been filling in carefully  with many crossings out .         return of the bride of the revenge of the son of count magpyr        nanny said aloud  noting that    from        fathoms  .      had been written in subsequently and then crossed out .        sonata for thunderstorm  trapdoors and young women in skimpy clothing .     bit of an artist too  then  your old master .         in a   thpethial way     said igor wistfully .   nanny stepped back .      magrat   s going to be safe  isn   t she .     she said  picking up the stakes again .      it   th a mob proof door     said igor .     and thcrapth ith nine thirty eighth rottweiler .         which parts  as a matter of interest .         two legth  one ear  lotth of tubeth and lower jaw     said igor promptly  as they hurried off again .      yes  but he   s got a spaniel brain     said nanny .      it   th in the bone     said igor .     he holdth people in hith jawth and beatth them thentheleth with hith tailth .         he wags people to death .         thometimeth he drownth them in dribble     said igor .       the rooftops of escrow loomed out of the darkness as the vampires drifted lower .  a few windows were glowing with candlelight when agnes   s feet touched the ground .   vlad dropped down beside her .      of course  you can   t see it at its best in this weather     he said .     some quite good architecture in the town square  and a very fine town hall .  father paid for the clock .         really .         and the bell tower  naturally .  local labor  of course .         vampires have a lot of cash  do they .     said agnes .  the town looked quite large  and pretty much like the country towns down on the plains save for a certain amount of gingerbread carving on the eaves .      well  the family has always owned land     said vlad  ignoring the sarcasm .     the money mounts up  you know .  over the centuries .  and obviously we   ve not enjoyed a particularly active social life .         or spent much on food     said agnes .      yes  yes  very good        a bell started to toll  somewhere above them .      now you   ll see     said vlad .     and you   ll understand .          granny weatherwax opened her eyes .  there were flames roaring right in front of her .      oh     she said .     so be it  then           ah .  feeling better  are we .     said oats .   her head spun round .  then she looked down at the steam rising from her dress .   oats ducked between the branches of two firs and threw another armful of dead wood on the flames .  it hissed and spluttered .      how long was i   resting .     said granny .      about half an hour  i   d say .     red light and black shadows danced among the trees .  the rain had turned to sleet  but it was flashing into steam overhead .      you did well to get a fire going in this murk     said granny .      i thank om for it     said oats .      very kind of him  i   m sure .  but we   ve got to   get on .     granny tried to stand up .     not far now .  all downhill           the mule ran away     said oats .      we   ve got feet  haven   t we .  i feel better for the   rest .  the fire   s put a   bit of life into me .         it   s too dark and far too wet .  wait until morning .      granny pulled herself up .     no .  find a stick or something i can lean on .  go on .         well   there   s a hazel grove just along the slope  but           just the thing  a good bit of hazel .  well  don   t just stand there .  i   m feeling better every minute .  off you go .      he disappeared into the dripping shadows .   granny flapped her skirts in front of the blaze to circulate some warm air  and something small and white flew up from the ashes  dancing in the fire and sleet .   she picked it up from the moss where it had landed .   it was a piece of thin paper  the charred corner of a page .  she could just make out  in the red light  the words       of om   aid unto   ossory smote       the paper was attached to a burnt strip of leather binding .   she regarded it for a while  and then dropped it carefully into the flames as the sound of crackling twigs indicated oats   s return .      can you even find the way in all this .     he said  handing her a long hazel pole .      yes .  you go on one side of me  and i   ve got this staff .  then it   s just a walk in the woods  eh .         you don   t look better .         young man  if we   re going to wait for me to look interestin    we   ll be here for years .      she raised a hand and the wowhawk flew down out of the shadows .      good thing you were able to get a fire going  all the same     she said  without turning round .      i have always found that if i put my trust in om a way will be found     said oats  hurrying after her .      i reckon om helps those who helps themselves     said granny .       throughout the town of escrow the windows glowed .  lamps were lit and there was the sound of doors being unbolted .  over all  the bell went on ringing out through the fog .      normally we congregate in the town square     said vlad .      it   s the middle of the night .     said agnes .      yes  but it doesn   t happen very often  and our covenant says never more than twice in a month     said vlad .     do you see how prosperous the place is .  people are safe in escrow .  they   ve seen reason .  no shutters on the windows  do you see .  they don   t have to bar their windows or hide in the cellar  which i have to admit is what people do in the   less well regulated areas of our country .  they exchanged fear for security .  they       he stumbled  and steadied himself against a wall .  then he rubbed his forehead .     sorry .  i felt a little   strange .  what was i saying .         how should i know .     snapped agnes .     you were talking about how happy everyone is because the vampires visit  or something .         oh yes .  yes .  because of cooperation  not enmity .  because       he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his face .        because   well  you   ll see   is it rather cold here .         just clammy     said agnes .      let   s get to the square     vlad muttered .     i   m sure i shall feel better .      it was just ahead .  torches had been lit .  people had congregated there  most of them with blankets across their shoulders or a coat over their night clothes  standing around in aimless groups like people who   d heard the fire alarm but hadn   t seen the smoke .   one of two of them caught sight of vlad and there was a certain amount of coughing and shuffling .   other vampires were descending through the mist .  the count landed gently and nodded to agnes .      ah  miss nitt     he said vaguely .     are we all here  vlad .      the bell stopped .  a moment later lacrimosa descended .      you   ve still got her .     she said to vlad  raising her eyebrows .     oh well           i will just have a brief chat to the mayor     said the count .     he appreciates being kept informed .      agnes watched him walk toward a small  dumpy man who  despite getting out of bed in the middle of a wet night  seemed to have had the foresight to put on a gold chain of office .   she noticed the vampires taking up positions in a line in front of the bell tower  about four or five feet apart .  they joked and called out to one another  except for lacrimosa  who was glaring directly at her .   the count was deep in conversation with the mayor  who was staring down at his own feet .   now  across the square  the people were beginning to form lines .  a couple of small children pulled away from their parents    hands and chased one another up and down the lines of people  laughing .   and the suspicion bloomed slowly in agnes like a great black  red edged rose .   vlad must have felt her body stiffen  because his grip tightened on her arm .      i know what you   re thinking       he began .      you don   t know what i   m thinking but i   ll tell you what i   m thinking     she said  trying to keep the tremble out of her voice .     you   re           listen  it could be so much worse  it used to be so much worse        the count bustled .     good news     he said     three children have just turned twelve .     he smiled at agnes .     we have a little   ceremony  before the main lottery .  a rite of passage  as it were .  i think they look forward to it  to tell you the truth .      he   s watching you to see how you react  said perdita .  vlad is just stupid and lacrimosa would weave your hair into a face flannel if she had the chance but this one will go for the throat if you so much as blink at the wrong time   so don   t blink at the wrong time  thank you  because even figments of the imagination want to live     but agnes felt the terror rising around her .  and it was wrong  the wrong kind of terror  a numbing  cold  sick feeling that froze her where she stood .  she had to do something  do anything  break its horrible grip     it was vlad who spoke .      it   s nothing dramatic     he said quickly .     a little drop of blood   father went to the school and explained all about citizenship           how nice     she croaked .     do they get a badge .     it must have been perdita behind that  she couldn   t imagine agnes being so tasteless  even in the cause of sarcasm .      hah  no .  but what a good idea     said the count  giving her another quick smile .     yes   perhaps a badge  or a small plaque .  something to be treasured in later life .  i shall make a mental note of this .  and so   let us begin .  ah  the mayor has assembled the dear children        there was a shout somewhere at the back of the crowd and  for a moment  agnes caught sight of a man trying to press forward .  the mayor nodded at a couple of the nearby men .  they hurried back into the crowd .  there was a scuffle in the shadows .  she thought she heard a woman   s scream  suddenly muffled .  a door slammed .   as the mayor turned back  he met agnes   s stare .  she looked away  not wanting to see that expression .  people were good at imagining hells  and some they occupied while they were alive .      shall we get on .     said the count .      will you let go of my arm  vlad .     said agnes  sweetly .   they   re just waiting for you to react  whispered perdita .  oh  said agnes inside her head  so i should just stand here and watch .  like everybody else .  i just thought i   d point it out .  what   s been done to them .  they   re like pigs queuing for hogswatch .  i think they saw reason  said agnes .  oh well   just wipe that smile off lacrimosa   s face  that   s all i ask     they could move very fast .  even a scream wouldn   t work .  she might be able to get in one good wallop  and that would be it .  and perhaps she   d wake up as a vampire  and not know the difference between good and evil .  but that wasn   t the point .  the point was here and now  because here and now she did .   she could see every drop of moisture hanging in the air  smell the woodsmoke from damped down fires  hear the rats in the thatch of the houses .  her senses were working overtime  to make the most of the last few seconds        i don   t see why .     lacrimosa   s voice cut through the mist like a saw .   agnes blinked .  the girl had reached her father and was glaring at him .      why do you always start .     she demanded .      lacrimosa .  what has got into you .  i am the head of the clan .         oh really .  forever .      the count looked astonished .     well  yes .  of course .         so we   ll always be pushed around by you  forever .  we   ll just be your children forever .         my dear  what do you think you           and don   t try that voice on me .  that only works on the meat .  so i   ll be sent to my room for being disobedient forever .         we did let you have your own rack           oh yes .  and for that i have to nod and smile and be nice to meat .         don   t you dare talk to your father like that .     screamed the countess .      and don   t talk about agnes like that .     snarled vlad .      did i use the word agnes .  did i refer to her in any way .     said lacrimosa  coldly .     i don   t believe i did .  i wouldn   t dream of mentioning her at all .         i can   t be having with this arguing .     shouted the count .      that   s it  isn   t it .     said lacrimosa .     we don   t argue .  we just do what you say  forever .         we agreed           no  you agreed  and no one disagreed with you .  vlad was right .         indeed .     said the count  turning to his son .     right about what  pray .      vlad   s mouth opened and shut once or twice as he hastily assembled a coherent sentence .     i may have mentioned that the whole lancre business might be considered unwise           oh     said the countess .     you know so much about wisdom all of a sudden and you   re barely two hundred .         unwise .     said the count .      i   d say stupid .     said lacrimosa .     little badges .  gifts .  we don   t give anything .  we   re vampires .  we take what we want  like this        she reached out  grabbed a man standing near her  and turned  mouth open and hair flying .   and stopped  as if she   d been frozen .   then she buckled  one hand reaching for her throat  and glared at her father .      what   did you do .     she gasped .     my throat   feels   you did something .      the count rubbed his forehead and pinched the bridge of his nose .     lacci           and don   t call me that .  you know how i hate that .      there was a brief scream from one of the lesser vampires behind them .  agnes couldn   t remember his name  it was probably fenrir or maledicta or something  but she did recall that he preferred to be known as gerald .  he sagged to his knees  clawing at his throat .  none of the other vampires looked very happy  either .  a couple of them were kneeling and groaning  to the bewilderment of the citizens .      i don   t   feel very well     said the countess  swaying slightly .     i did say i didn   t think wine was a good idea        the count turned and stared at agnes .  she took a step back .      it   s you  isn   t it     he said .      of course it is .     moaned lacrimosa .     you know that old woman put herself somewhere  and she must   ve known vlad was soppy on that lump .      she   s not in here  is she .  said perdita .  don   t you know .  agnes thought  backing away again .  well  i don   t think she is  but is it me doing the thinking .  look  she   s hidden herself in that priest  we know it .  no  we don   t  you just thought that   d be a smart thing for her to do because everyone would think she   s hiding in the baby .      why don   t you just crawl back into your coffin and rot  you slimy little maggot     agnes said .  it wasn   t that good  but im promptu insults are seldom well crafted .   lacrimosa leapt at her  but something else was wrong .  instead of gliding through the air like velvet death she lurched like a bird with a broken wing .  but fury let her rear up in front of agnes  one claw out to scratch     agnes hit her as hard as she could and felt perdita get behind the blow as well .  it shouldn   t have been possible for it to connect  the girl was quick enough to run around agnes three times before it could  but it did .   the people of escrow watched a vampire stagger back  bleeding .   the mayor raised his head .   agnes went into a crouch  fists raised .      i don   t know where granny weatherwax went     she said .     maybe she is in here with me  eh .     a flash of mad inspiration struck her and she added  in granny   s sharp tones     and if you strike me down again i   ll bite my way up through your boots .         a nice try  miss nitt     said the count  striding toward her .     but i don   t think so        he stopped  clutching at the gold chain that was suddenly around his neck .   behind him the mayor hauled on it with all his weight  forcing the vampire to the ground .   the citizens looked at one another  and all moved at once .   vampires rose into the air  trying to gain height  kicking at clutching hands .  torches were snatched from walls .  the night was suddenly full of screams .   agnes looked up at vlad  who was staring in horror .  lacrimosa was surrounded by a closing ring of people .      you   d better run     she said     or they   ll        he turned and lunged  and the last thing she saw was teeth .       the track downhill was worse that the climb .  springs had erupted in every hollow  and every path was a rivulet .   as granny and oats lurched from mud slough to bog  oats reflected on the story in the book of om   the story  really   about the prophet brutha and his journey with om across the burning desert  which had ended up changing omnianism forever .  it had replaced swords with sermons  which at least caused fewer deaths except in the case of the really very long ones  and had broken the church into a thousand pieces which had then started arguing with one another and finally turned out oats  who argued with himself .   oats wondered how far across the desert brutha would have got if he   d been trying to support granny weatherwax .  there was something unbending about her  something hard as rock .  by about halfway the blessed prophet might  he felt guiltily  have yielded to the temptation to   well  at least say something unpleasant  or give a meaningful sigh .  the old woman had got very crotchety since being warmed up .  she seemed to have something on her mind .   the rain had stopped but the wind was sharp  and there were still occasional stinging bursts of hail .      won   t be long now     he panted .      you don   t know that     said granny  splashing through black  peaty mud .      no  you   re absolutely right     said oats .     i was just saying that to be cheerful .         hasn   t worked     said granny .      mistress weatherwax  would you like me to leave you here .     said oats .   granny sniffed .     wouldn   t worry me     she said .      would you like me to .     said oats .      it   s not my mountain     said granny .     i wouldn   t be one to tell people where they should be .         i   ll go if you want me to     said oats .      i never asked you to come     said granny simply .      you   d be dead if i hadn   t .         that   s no business of yours .         my god  mistress weatherwax  you try me sorely .         your god  mister oats  tries everyone .  that   s what gods generally do  and that   s why i don   t truck with    em .  and they lays down rules all the time .         there have to be rules  mistress weatherwax .         and what   s the first one that your om requires  then .         that believers should worship no other god but om     said oats promptly .      oh yes .  that   s gods for you .  very self centered  as a rule .         i think it was to get people   s attention     said oats .     there are many commandments about dealing well with other people  if that   s what you   re getting at .         really .  and    spose someone doesn   t want to believe in om and tries to live properly .         according to the prophet brutha  to live properly is to believe in om .         oho  that   s clever .  he gets you coming and going     said granny .     it took a good thinker to come up with that .  well done .  what other clever things did he say .         he doesn   t say things to be clever     said oats hotly .     but  since you ask  he said in his letter to the simonites that it is through other people that we truly become people .         good .  he got that one right .         and he said that we should take light into dark places .      granny didn   t say anything .      i thought i   d mention that     said oats     because when you were   you know  kneeling  back in the forge   you said something very similar        granny stopped so suddenly that oats nearly fell over .      i did what .         you were mumbling and           i was talkin    in my   sleep .         yes  and you said something about darkness being where the light needs to be  which i remember because in the book of om           you listened .         no  i wasn   t listening  but i couldn   t help hearing  could i .  and you sounded as if you were having an argument with someone           can you remember everything i said .         i think so .      granny staggered on a little  and stopped in a puddle of black water that began to rise over her boots .      can you forget .     she said .      pardon .         you wouldn   t be so unkind as to pass on to anyone else the ramblings of a poor ol    woman who was probably off her head  would you .     said granny  slowly .   oats thought for a moment .     what ramblings were these  mistress weatherwax .      granny seemed to sag with relief .      ah .  good thing you asked  really  bein    as there weren   t any .      black bubbles arose from the bog around granny weatherwax as the two of them watched each other .  some sort of truce had been declared .      i wonder  young man  if you would be so good as to pull me out .      this took some time and involved a branch from a nearby tree and  despite oats   s best efforts  granny   s first foot came out of its boot .  and once one boot has said goodbye in a peat bog  the other one is bound to follow out of fraternal solidarity .   granny ended up on what was comparatively dry and comparatively land wearing a pair of the heaviest looking socks oats had ever seen .  they looked as if they could shrug off a hammer blow .      they was good boots     said granny  looking at the bubbles .     oh well  let   s get on .      she staggered a little as she set off again  but to oats   s admiration managed to stay upright .  he was beginning to form yet another new opinion of the old woman  who caused a new opinion to arise about once every half hour  and it was this  she needed someone to beat .  if she didn   t have someone to beat  she   d probably beat herself .      shame about your little book of holy words       she said  when she was farther down the track .   there was a long pause before oats replied .      i can easily get another     he said levelly .      must be hard  not having your book of words .         it   s only paper .         i shall ask the king to see about getting you another book of words .         i wouldn   t trouble him .         terrible thing to have to burn all them words  though .         the worthwhile ones don   t burn .         you   re not too stupid  for all that you wear a funny hat     said granny .      i know when i   m being pushed  mistress weatherwax .         well done .      they walked on it silence .  a shower of hail bounced off granny   s pointed hat and oats   s wide brim .   then granny said     it   s no good you trying to make me believe in om  though .         om forbid that i should try  mistress weatherwax .  i haven   t even given you a pamphlet  have i .         no  but you   re trying to make me think    oo  what a nice young man  his god must be something special if nice young men like him helps old ladies like me     aren   t you .         no .         really .  well  it   s not working .  people you can believe in  sometimes  but not gods .  and i   ll tell you this  mister oats        he sighed .     yes .      she turned to face him  suddenly alive .     it   d be as well for you if i didn   t believe     she said  prodding him with a sharp finger .     this om   anyone seen him .         it is said three thousand people witnessed his manifestation at the great temple when he make the covenant with the prophet brutha and saved him from death by torture on the iron turtle           but i bet that now they   re arguing about what they actually saw  eh .         well  indeed  yes  there are many opinions           right .  right .  that   s people for you .  now if i   d seen him  really there  really alive  it   d be in me like a fever .  if i thought there was some god who really did care two hoots about people  who watched    em like a father and cared for    em like a mother   well  you wouldn   t catch me sayin    things like    there are two sides to every question    and    we must respect other people   s beliefs .     you wouldn   t find me just being gen   rally nice in the hope that it   d all turn out right in the end  not if that flame was burning in me like an unforgivin    sword .  and i did say burnin     mister oats     cos that   s what it   d be .  you say that you people don   t burn folk and sacrifice people anymore  but that   s what true faith would mean  y   see .  sacrificin    your own life  one day at a time  to the flame  declarin    the truth of it  workin    for it  breathin    the soul of it .  that   s religion .  anything else is just   is just bein    nice .  and a way of keepin    in touch with the neighbors .      she relaxed slightly  and went on in a quieter voice     anyway  that   s what i   d be  if i really believed .  and i don   t think that   s fashionable right now     cos it seems that if you sees evil now you have to wring your hands and say    oh deary me  we must debate this .     that my two penn   orth  mister oats .  you be happy to let things lie .  don   t chase faith     cos you   ll never catch it .     she added  almost as an aside     but  perhaps  you can live faithfully .      her teeth chattered as a gust of icy wind flapped her wet dress around her legs .      you got another book of holy words on you .     she added .      no     said oats  still shocked .  he thought  my god  if she ever finds a religion  what would come out of these mountains and sweep across the plains .  my god   i just said    my god           a book of hymns  maybe .     said granny .      no .         a slim volume o    prayers  suitable for every occasion .         no  granny weatherwax .         damn .     granny slowly collapsed backward  folding up like an empty dress .   he rushed forward and caught her before she landed in the mud .  one thin white hand gripped his wrist so hard that he yelped .  then she relaxed  and sagged in his grasp .   something made oats look up .   a hooded figure sat on a white horse a little way away  outlined in the faintest blue fire .      go away .     he screamed .     you be gone right now or   or        he lowered the body onto some tufts of grass  grabbed a handful of mud and flung it into the gloom .  he ran after it  punching wildly at a shape which was suddenly no more than shadows and curling mist .   he dashed back  picked up granny weatherwax  slung her over his shoulder and ran on  downhill .   the mist behind him formed a shape on a white horse .   death shook his head .   it wasn   t even as if i said anything  he said .       waves of black heat broke over agnes  and then there was a pit  and a fall into hot  suffocating darkness .   she felt the desire .  it was tugging her forward like a current .   well  she thought dreamily  at least i   ll lose some weight     yes  said perdita  but all the eyeliner you   ll have to wear must add a few pounds     the hunger filled her now  accelerating her .   and there was light  behind her  shining past her .  she felt the fall gradually slow as if she   d hit invisible feathers  and then the world spun and she was rising again  moving up faster than an eagle stoops  toward an expanding circle of cold white     it couldn   t possibly be words that she heard .  there was no sound but a faint rushing noise .  but it was the shadow of words  the effect they leave in the mind after they had been said  and she felt her own voice rushing in to fill the shape that had appeared there .  i   can   t   be   having   with   this     light exploded .   and someone was about to hammer a stake through her heart .      stdt .     she said  knocking the hand away .  she spluttered for a moment and then spat the lemon out of her mouth .     hey  stop that .     she tried again  this time with all the authority she could muster .     what the heck are you doing .  do i look like a vampire .      the man with the stake and mallet hesitated  and then tapped a finger to the side of his neck .   agnes reached to hers  and found two raised weals .     he must have missed .     she said  pushing the stake away and sitting up .     who took my stocking off .  who took off my left stocking .  is that boiling vinegar i can smell .  what   re all these poppy seeds doing poured down my bra .  if it wasn   t a woman who took my stocking off there   s going to be some serious trouble  i can tell you .      the crowd around the table looked at one another  suddenly uncertain in the face of her rage .  agnes glanced up as something brushed her ear .  hanging over her were stars and crosses and circles and more complex designs she recognized as religious symbols .  she   d never felt inclined to believe in religion  but she knew what it looked like .      and this is just a very tasteless display     she said .      she doesn   t act like a vampire     said a man .     she doesn   t look like one .  and she did fight the others .         we saw that one bite her .     said a woman .      bad aim in poor light     said agnes  knowing that it wasn   t .  there was a hunger welling up .  it was not like the black urge she   d felt in the dark  but sharp and urgent all the same .  she had to give into it .      i   d kill for a cup of tea     she added .   that seemed to clinch it .  tea wasn   t the liquid usually associated with vampires .      and for goodness    sake let me shake some of these poppy seeds out     she went on  adjusting her bosom    i feel like a wholemeal loaf .      they moved aside as she swung her legs off the table  which now meant that she could see the vampire lying on the floor .  she nearly thought of it as the other vampire .   it was a man wearing a long frock coat and a fancy waistcoat  both covered in mud and blood  there was a stake through his heart .  further identification  though  would have to await finding where they   d put his head .      i see you got one  then     she said  trying not to be sick .      got two     said the man with the hammer .     set fire to the other one .  they killed the mayor and mr .  vlack .         you mean the rest got away .     said agnes .      yes .  they   re still strong but they can   t fly much .      agnes indicated the headless vampire .     er   is that one vlad .     she said .      which one was he .         the one that   bit me .  tried to bite me     she corrected herself .      we can check .  piotr  show her the head .      a young man obediently went to the fireplace  pulled on a glove  lifted the lid of a big saucepan and held up a head by its hair .      that   s not vlad     said agnes  swallowing .  no  said perdita  vlad was taller .      they   ll be heading back to their castle     said piotr .     on foot .  you should see them trying to fly .  it   s like watching chickens panicking .         the castle       said agnes .      they   ll have to make it before cock crow     said piotr  with some satisfaction .     and they can   t cut through the woods     cos of the werewolves .         what .  i thought werewolves and vampires would get along fine     said agnes .      oh  maybe it looks like that     said piotr .     but they   re watching one another all the time to see who   s going to be the first to blink .     he looked around the room .     we don   t mind the werewolves     he went on  to general agreement .     they leave us alone most of the time because we don   t run fast enough to be interesting .      he looked agnes up and down .      what was it you did to the vampires .     he said .      me .  i didn   t do   i don   t know     said agnes .      they couldn   t even bite us properly .         and they were squabbling like kids when they left     said the man with the mallet .      you   ve got a pointy hat     said piotr .     did you put a spell on them .         i   i don   t know .  i really don   t .     and then natural honesty met witchcraft .  one aspect of witchcraft is the craftiness  and it   s seldom unwise to take the credit for unexplained but fortuitous events .     i may have done     she added .      well  we   re going after them     said piotr .      won   t they have got well away .         we can cut through the woods .          blood tinted the rain that ran off the wound on jason ogg   s shoulder .  he dabbed at it with a cloth .      reckon i   ll be hammerin    left handed for a week or two     he said  wincing .      they got very good fields of fire     said shawn  who had taken refuge behind the beer barrel used so recently to wet the baby   s head .     i mean  it   s a castle .  a frontal attack simply won   t work .      he sighed  and shielded his guttering candle to keep the wind from blowing it out .  they   re tried a frontal attack nevertheless  and the only reason no one had been killed was that the drink seemed to be flowing freely within the keep .  as it was  one or two people would be limping for a while .  then they   d tried what jason persisted in referring to as a backal attack  but there were arrow slots even over the kitchens .  one man creeping up to the walls very slowly   a sidle attack  as shawn had thought of it   had worked  but since all the doors were very solidly barred this had just meant that he   d stood there feeling like a fool .   he was trying to find some help in the ancient military journals of general tacticus  whose intelligent campaigning had been so successful that he   d lent his very name to the detailed prosecution of martial endeavor  and had actually found a section headed what to do if one army occupies a well fortified and superior ground and the other does not  but since the first sentence read    endeavor to be the one inside    he   d rather lost heart .   the rest of the lancre militia cowered behind buttresses and upturned carts  waiting for him to lead them .   there was a respectful clang as big jim beef  who was acting as cover for two other part time soldiers  saluted his commander .      i reckon     he ventured     dat it we got big fire   s goin    in frun    of the doors we could smoke dem out .         good idea     said jason .      that   s the king   s door     shawn protested .     he   s already been a bit sharp with me for not cleaning the privy pit this week           he can send mum the bill .         that   s seditious talk  jason .  i could have you arr   i could arr   mum would have something to say about you talking like that .         where is the king  anyway .     said darren ogg .     sittin    back and lettin    mum sort everything out while we get shot at .         you know he   s got a weak chest     said shawn .     he does very well considering he        he stopped as a sound rolled out across the countryside .  it had a hoarse  primal quality  the sound of an animal who is in pain but who also intends to pass it on as soon as possible .  the men looked around nervously .   verence came thundering through the gates .  shawn recognized him only by the embroidery on his nightshirt and his fluffy slippers .  he held a long sword over his head in both hands and was running straight for the door of the keep  trailing a scream behind him .   the sword struck the wood .  shawn heard the whole door shudder .      he   s gone mad .     shouted darren .     let   s grab the poor creature before he gets shot .      a couple of them scurried across to the struggling king  who was standing horizontally on the door in an effort to get the sword out .      now  see here  your maj   aargh .         ach  tak a faceful o   heid .      darren staggered back  clutching at his face .   little shapes swarmed across the courtyard after the king  like some kind of plague .      gibbins .         fackle .         nac mac feegle .      there was another scream as jason  trying to restrain his monarch   s enthusiasm  found that while the touch of a monarch may indeed cure certain scalp conditions  the scalp of a king itself is capable of spreading someone   s nose into an interesting flat shape .   arrows thudded into the ground around them .   shawn grabbed big jim .     they   re all going to get shot  drink or not .     he shouted above the din .     you come with me .         what we gonna do .         clean the privies .      the troll scuttled after him as he edged his way around the keep  to where the gong tower loomed against the night in all its odiferous splendor .  it was the bane of shawn   s life .  all the keep   s garderobes discharged into it .  one of his jobs was to clean it out and take the contents to the pits in the gardens where verence   s efforts at composting were gradually turning them into  well  lancre .   but now that the castle was a lot busier than it used to be his weekly efforts with shovel and wheelbarrow weren   t the peaceful and solitary interludes they had been .  of course he   d let the job sort of   pile up these last few weeks  but did they expect him to do everything .   he waved big jim toward the door at the bottom of the tower .  fortunately  trolls have not much interest in organic odors  although they can easily distinguish types of limestone by smell .      i want you to open it when i say     he said  tearing a strip off his shirt and wrapping it around an arrow .  he searched his pockets for a match .     and when you   ve opened the door     he went on  as the cloth caught     i want you to run away very  very fast  right .  okay   open the door .      big jim pulled at the handle .  there was a very faint whoosh as the door swung back .      run .     shawn shouted .  he drew back the bowstring  and fired through the doorway .   the flaming arrow vanished into the noisome darkness .  there was a pause of a few heartbeats .  then the tower exploded .   it happened quite slowly .  the green blue light mushroomed up from story to story in an almost leisurely way  blowing out stones at every level to give the tower a nice sparkling effect .  the roofing leads opened up like a daisy .  a faint flame speared the clouds .  then time  sound and motion came back with a thump .   after a few seconds the main doors burst open and the soldiers ran out .  the first one was smacked between the eyes by a ballistic king .   shawn had just started to run back to the fight when someone landed on his shoulders  bearing him to the ground .      well  well  one of the toy soldiers     sneered corporal svitz  leaping up and drawing his sword .   as he raised it shawn rolled and struck upward with the lancrastian peace time army knife .  he might have had time to select the device for dfissecting paradoxes  or the appli ance for detecting small grains of hope  or the spiral thing for ascertaining the reality of being  but as it happened it was the instrument for ending arguments very quickly that won the day .   presently  there came a short sharp shower of soft rain .   well   certainly a shower .   definitely soft  anyway .       agnes hadn   t seen a mob like this before .  mobs  in her limited experience  were noisy .  this one was silent .  most of the town was in it  and to agnes   s surprise they   d brought along many of the children .   it didn   t surprise perdita .  they   re going to kill the vampires  she said  and the children will watch .   good  thought agnes  that   s exactly right .   perdita was horrified .  it   ll give them nightmares .   no  thought agnes .  it   ll take the nightmares away .  sometimes  everyone has to know the monster is dead  and remember  so that they can tell their grandchildren .      they tried to turn people into things     she said aloud .      sorry  miss .     said piotr .      oh   just thinking aloud .      and where had she got that other idea  perdita wondered  the one where she   d told the villagers to send runners out to other towns to report on the night   s work .  that was unusually nasty of her .   but she remembered the look of horror on the mayor   s face  and  later  the blank engrossed expression when he was trying to throttle the count with his chain of office .  the vampire had killed him with a blow that had almost broken him in half .   she fingered the wounds on her neck .  she was pretty certain vampires didn   t miss  but vlad must have done  because she clearly wasn   t a vampire .  she didn   t even like the idea of rare steak .  she   d tried to see if she could fly  when she thought people weren   t looking  but she was as attractive to gravity as ever .  the blood sucking   no  never that  even if it was the ultimate diet program  but she   d have liked the flying .   it   s changed you  said perdita .      how .         sorry  miss .      you   re sharper   edgier   nastier .      maybe it   s about time i was  then .         sorry  miss .         oh  nothing .  do you have a spare sickle .          the vampires traveled fast but erratically  appearing not so much to fly as to be promising entries in the world long jump championships .      we   ll burn that ungrateful place to the ground     moaned the countess  landing heavily .      afterward we   ll burn that place to the ground     said lacrimosa .     this is what kindness leads to  father  i do hope you   re paying attention .         after you paid for that bell tower  too     said the countess .   the count rubbed his throat  where the links of the gold chain still showed as a red weal .  he wouldn   t have believed that a human could be so strong .      yes  that might be a good course of action     he said .     we would have to make sure the news got around  of course .         you think this news won   t get around .     said lacrimosa  landing beside him .      it will be dawn soon  lacci     said the count  with heavy patience .     because of my training  you will regard it as rather a nuisance  not a reason to crumble into a little pile of dust .  reflect on this .         that weatherwax woman did this  didn   t she     said lacri mosa  ignoring this call to count her blessings .     she put her self somewhere and she   s attacking us .  she can   t be in the baby .  i suppose she wasn   t in your fat girl  vlad .  plenty of room in there .  are you listening  brother .         what .     said vlad  distantly  as they turned a corner in the road and saw the castle ahead of them .      i saw you give in and bite her .  so romantic .  they still dragged her off  though .  they   ll have to use quite a long stake to hit any useful organ .         she   d have put her self somewhere close     said the count .     it stands to reason .  it must   ve been someone in the hall           one of the other witches  surely     said the countess .      i wonder           that stupid priest     said lacrimosa .      that would probably appeal to her     said the count .     but i suspect not .         not   igor .     said his daughter .      i wouldn   t give that a moment   s thought     said the count .      i still think it was fat agnes .         she wasn   t that fat     said vlad sulkily .      you   d have got tired of her in the end and we   d have ended up with her always getting in the way  just the others     said lacrimosa .     traditionally a keepsake is meant to be a lock of their hair  not their entire skull           she   s different .         just because you can   t read her mind .  how interesting would that be .         at least i did bite someone     said vlad .     what was wrong with you .         yes  you were acting very strangely  lacci     said the count  as they reached the drawbridge .      if she was hiding in me i   d know .     snarled lacrimosa .      i wonder if you would     said the count .     she just has to find a weak spot           she   s just a witch  father .  honestly  we   re acting as though she   s got some sort of terrible power           perhaps it was vlad   s agnes after all     said the count .  he gave his son a slightly longer stare than was strictly necessary .      we   re nearly at the castle     said the countess  trying to rally them .     we   ll all feel better for an early day .         our best coffins got taken to lancre     said lacrimosa sullenly .     someone was so sure of themselves .         don   t you adopt that tone with me  young woman .     said the count .      i   m two hundred years old     said lacrimosa .     pardon me  but i think i can choose any tone i like .         that   s no way to speak to your father .         really  mother  you might at least act as if you had two brain cells of your own .         it is not your father   s fault that everything   s gone wrong .         it has not all gone wrong  my dear .  this is just a temporary setback .         it won   t be when the escrow meat tell their friends .  come on  vlad  stop moping and back me up here           if they tell them  what can they do .  oh  there will be a little bit of protesting  but then the survivors will see reason     said the count .     in the meantime  we have those witches waiting for us .  with the baby .         and we   ve got to be polite to them  i suppose .         oh  i don   t think we need to go that far     said the count .     let them live  perhaps        something bounced on the bridge beside him .  he reached down to pick it up  and dropped it with a yelp .      but   garlic shouldn   t burn       he began .      thith ith water from the holy turtle pond of thquintth     said a voice above them .     blethed by the bithop himthelf in the year of the trout .     there was a glugging noise and the sound of someone swallowing .     that wath a good year for beatitude     igor went on .     but you don   t have to take my word for it .  duck  you thuckerth .      the vampires dived for cover as the bottle  turning over and over  arced down from the battlements .   it shattered on the bridge  and most of the contents hit a vampire  who burst into flame as if hit by burning oil .      now really  cryptopher  there   s no call for that sort of thing     said the count  as the blazing figure screamed and spun around in a circle .     it   s all in your mind  you know .  positive thinking  that   s the ticket           he   s turning black     said the countess .     aren   t you going to do something .         oh  very well .  vlad  just kick him off the drawbridge  will you .      the luckless cryptopher was pushed  squirming  into the chasm .      you know  that should not have happened     said the count  looking at his blistered fingers .     he obviously was not   truly one of us .     far below  there was a splash .   the rest of the vampires scrambled for the cover of the gate arch as another bottle exploded near the count .  a drop splashed his leg  and he glanced down at the little wisp of smoke .      some error appears to have crept in     he said .      i   ve never been one to put myself forward     said the countess     but i strongly suggest you find a new plan  dear .  one which works  perhaps .         i have one already formed     he said  tapping his knuckles against the huge oak gates .     if everyone would perhaps stand aside        up on the battlement igor nudged nanny ogg  who lowered a decanter of water from the holy fountain of seven handed sek and followed his pointing thumb .    clouds were suddenly spiraling  with blue light flashing inside them .      there   th going to be a thtorm .     he said .     the top of my head   th tingling .  run .      they reached the tower just as a single bolt of lightning blew the doors apart and shattered the stones where they had been standing .      well  that was easy     said nanny  lying full length on the floor .      they can control the weather     said igor .      blast .     said nanny .     that   s right .  everyone knows that  who knows anything about vampires .         thorry .  but they won   t be able to try that on the inthide doorth .  come on .         what   s that smell .     said nanny  sniffing .     igor  your boots are on fire .         damn .  and thethe feet were nearly new thicth montth ago     said igor  as nanny   s holy water sizzled over the smoking leather .     it   th my wire  it pickth up thtray currentth .         what happened  someone was hit by a falling buffalo .     said nanny  as they hurried down the stairs .      it wath a tree     said igor reproachfully .     mikhail thwenitth up at the logging camp  the poor man .  practically nothing left  but hith parentth thaid i could have hith feet to remember him by .         that was strangely kind of them .         well  i gave him a thpare arm after the acthe acthident a few yearth ago and when old mr .  thwenitth   th liver gave out i let him have the one mr .  kochak left to me for giving mithith kochak a new eye .         people round here don   t so much die as pass on     said nanny .      what goeth around cometh around     said igor .          and your new plan is    .     said lacrimosa  stepping across the rubble .      we   ll kill everyone .  not an original plan  i admit  but tried and tested     said the count .  this met with general approval  but his daughter looked unsatisfied .      what  everyone .  all at once .         oh  you can save some for later if you must .      the countess clutched his arm .      oh  this does so remind me of our honeymoon     she said .     don   t you remember those wonderful nights in grjsknvij .         oh  fresh morning of the world indeed     said the count  solemnly .      such romance   and we met such lovely people  too .  do you remember mr .  and mrs .  harker .         very fondly .  i recall they lasted nearly all week .  now  listen all of you .  holy symbols will not hurt us .  holy water is just water   yes  i know  but cryptopher just wasn   t concentrating .  garlic is just another member of the allium family .  do onions hurt us .  are we frightened of shallots .  no .  we   ve just got a bit tired  that   s all .  malicia  call up the rest of the clan .  we will have a little holiday from reason .  and afterward  in the morning  there will be room for a new world order i can   t be having with this at all        he rubbed his forehead .  the count prided himself on his mind  and tended it carefully .  but right now it felt exposed  as though someone was looking over his shoulder .  he wasn   t certain he was thinking right .  she couldn   t have got into his head  could she .  he   d had hundreds of years of experience .  there was no way some village witch could get past his defenses .  it stood to reason     his throat felt parched .  at least he could obey the call of his nature .  but this time it was an oddly disquieting one .      do we have any   tea .     he said .      what is tea .     said the countess .      it   grows on a bush  i think     said the count .      how do you bite it  then .         you   er   lower it into boiling water  don   t you .     the count shook his head  trying to free himself of this demonic urge .      while it   s still alive .     said lacrimosa  brightening up .         sweet biscuits       mumbled the count .      i think you should try to get a grip  dear     said the countess .      this   tea     said lacrimosa .     is it   brown .            yes       whispered the count .      because when we were in escrow i was going to put the bite on one of them and i had this horrible mental picture of a cup full of the wretched stuff     said his daughter .   the count shook himself again .      i don   t know what   s happening to me     he said .     so let   s stick to what we do know  shall we .  obey our blood            the second casualty in the battle for the castle was vargo  a lank young man who actually become a vampire because he thought he   d meet interesting girls  or any girls at all  and had been told he looked good in black .  and then he   d found that a vampire   s interests always center  sooner or later  on the next meal  and hitherto he   d never really thought of the neck as the most interesting organ a girl could have .   right now all he wanted to do was sleep  so as the vampires surged into the castle proper he sauntered gently away in the direction of his cellar and nice comfortable coffin .  of course he was hungry  since all he   d got in escrow was a foot in the chest  but he had just enough sense of self preservation to let the others get on with the hunting so that he could turn up later for the feast .   his coffin was in the center of the dim cellar  its lid lying carelessly on the floor beside it .  he   d always been messy with the bedclothes  even as a human .   vargo climbed in  twisted and turned a few times to get comfortable on the pillow  then pulled the lid down and latched it .   as the eye of narrative drew back from the coffin on its stand  two things happened .  one happened comparatively slowly  and this was vargo   s realization that he never recalled the coffin having a pillow before .   the other was greebo deciding that he was as mad as hell and wasn   t going to take it anymore .  he   d been shaken around in the wheely thing and then sat on by nanny  and he was angry about that because he knew  in a dim animal way  that scratching nanny might be the single most stupid thing he could do in the whole world  since no one else was prepared to feed him .  this hadn   t helped his temper .   then he   d encountered a dog  which had tried to lick him .  he   d scratched and bitten it a few times  but this had no effect apart from encouraging it to try to be more friendly .   he   d finally found a comfy resting place and had curled up into a ball  and now someone was using him as a cushion     there wasn   t a great deal of noise .  the coffin rocked a few times  and then pivoted around .   greebo sheathed his claws  and went back to sleep .             burn  with a clear bright light        splash  suck  splash .         and i in mine   om be praised .      squelch  splash .   oats had worked his way through most of the hymns he knew  even the old ones which you shouldn   t really sing anymore but you nevertheless remembered because the words were so good .  he sang them loudly and defiantly  to hold back the night and the doubts .  they helped take his mind off the weight of granny weatherwax .  it was amazing how much she   d apparently gained in the last mile or so  especially whenever he fell over and she landed on top of him .   he lost one of his own boots in a mire .  his hat was floating in a pool somewhere .  thorns had ripped his coat to tatters     he slipped and fell once again as the mud shifted under his feet .  granny rolled off  and landed in a clump of sedge .   if brother melchio could only see him now     the wowhawk swooped past and landed on the branch of a dead tree  a few yards away .  oats hated the thing .  it appeared demonic .  it flew even though it surely couldn   t see through the hood .  worse  whenever he thought about it  as now  the hooded head turned to fix him with an invisible stare .  he took off his other useless shoe  its shiny leather all stained and cracked  and flung it inexpertly .      go away  you wicked creature .      the bird didn   t stir .  the shoe flew past it .   then  as he tried to get to his feet  he smelled burning leather .   two wisps of smoke were curling up from either side of the hood .   oats reached to his neck for the security of the turtle  and it wasn   t there .  it has cost him five obols in the citadel  and it was too late now to reflect that perhaps he shouldn   t have hung it from a chain worth a tenth of an obol .  it was probably lying in some pool  or buried in some muddy  squelching marsh     now the leather burned away  and the yellow glow from the holes was so bright he could barely see the outline of the bird .  it turned the dank landscape into lines and shadows  put a golden edge on every tuft of grass and stricken tree   and winked out so quickly that it left oats   s eyes full of purple explosions .   when he   d recovered his breath and his balance  the bird was swooping away down the moor .   he picked up granny weatherwax   s unconscious body and ran after it .   the track did lead downhill  at least .  mud and bracken slipped under his feet .  streams were running from every hole and gully .  half the time it seemed to him that he wasn   t walking  merely controlling a slide  bouncing off rocks  slithering through puddles of mud and leaves .   and then there was the castle  seen through a gap in the trees  lit by a flash of lightning .  oats staggered through a clump of thorn bushes  managed to keep upright down a slope of loose boulders  and collapsed on the road with granny weatherwax on top of him .   she stirred .         holiday from reason   kill them all   can   t be havin    with this       she murmured .   the wind blew a branchful of raindrops on her face  and she opened her eyes .  for a moment they seemed to oats to have red pupils  and then the icy blue gaze focused on him .      are we here  then .         yes .         what happened to your holy hat .         it got lost     said oats abruptly .  granny peered closer .      your magic amulet   s gone too     she said .     the one with the turtle and the little man on it .         it   s not a magic amulet  mistress weatherwax .  please .  a magic amulet is a symbol of primitive and mechanistic superstition  whereas the turtle of om is   is   is   well  it   s not  do you understand .         oh  right .  thank you for explaining     said granny .     help me up  will you .      oats was having some difficulty with his temper .  he   d carried the old bit   biddy for miles  he was frozen to the bone  and now they were here she acted as if she   d somehow done him a favor .      what   s the magic word .     he snarled .      oh  i don   t think a holy man like you should be having with magic words     said granny .     but the holy words are  do what i tell you or get smitten .  they should do the trick .      he helped her to her feet  alive with badly digested rage  and supported her as she swayed .   there was a scream from the castle  suddenly cut off .      not female     said granny .     i reckon the girls have started .  let   s give    em a hand  shall we .      her arm shook as she raised it .  the wowhawk fluttered down and settled on her wrist .      now help get me to the gate .         don   t mention it  glad to be of service     oats mumbled .  he looked at the bird  whose hood swiveled to face him .      that   s the   other phoenix  isn   t it     he said .      yes     said granny  watching the door .     a phoenix .  you can   t have just one of anything .         but it looks like a little hawk .         it was born among hawks  so it looks like a hawk .  if it was hatched in a hen roost it   d be a chicken .  stands to reason .  and a hawk it   ll remain  until it needs to be a phoenix .  they   re shy birds .  you could say a phoenix is what it may become           too much eggshell           yes  mister oats .  and when does the phoenix sometimes lay two eggs .  when it needs to .  hodgesaargh was right .  a phoenix is of the nature of birds .  bird first  myth second .      the doors were hanging loose  their iron reinforcements twisted out of shape and their timbers smoldering  but some effort had been made to pull them shut .  over what remained of the arch  a bat carved in stone told visitors everything they needed to know about this place .   on granny   s wrist the hood of the hawk was crackling and smoking .  as he watched  little flames erupted from the leather again .      it knows what they did     said granny .     it was hatched knowing .  phoenixes share their minds .  and they don   t tolerate evil .      the head turned to look at oats with its white hot stare and  instinctively  he backed away and tried to cover his eyes .      use the doorknocker     said granny  nodding to the big iron ring hanging loosely from one splintered door .      what .  you want me to knock on the door .  of a vampire   s castle .         we   re not going to sneak in  are we .  anyway  you omnians are good at knocking on doors .         well  yes     said oats     but normally just for a shared prayer and to interest people in our pamphlets       he let the knocker fall a few times  the boom echoing around the valley       not to have my throat ripped out .         think of this as a particularly difficult street     said granny .     try again   mebbe they   re hidin    behind the sofa  eh .         hah .         you   re a good man  mister oats .     said granny  conversationally  as the echoes died away .     even without your holy book and holy amulet and holy hat .         er   i try to be       he ventured .      well   this is where you find out     said granny .     to the fire we come at last  mister oats .  this is where we both find out .          nanny raced up some stairs  a couple of vampires at her heels .  they were hampered because they hadn   t got to grips with not being able to fly  but there was something else wrong with them as well .      tea .     one screamed .     i must have   tea .      nanny pushed open the door to the battlements .  they followed her  and tripped over igor   s leg as he stepped out of the shadows .   he raised two sharpened table legs .      how d   you want your thtaketh  boyth .     he shouted excitedly  as he struck .     you thould have thed you liked my thpiderth .      nanny leaned against the wall to get her breath back .      granny   s somewhere here     she panted .     don   t ask me how .  but those two were craving a cup of tea  and i reckon only esme could mess up someone   s head like that        the sounds of the doorknocker boomed around the courtyard below .  at the same time the door at the other end of the battlements opened .  half a dozen vampires advanced .      they   re acting very dumb  aren   t they     said nanny .     give me a couple more stakes .         run out of thtaketh  nanny .         okay  then  pass me a bottle of holy water   hurry up           none left  nanny .         we   ve got nothing .         got   n orange  nanny .         what for .         run out of lemonth .         what good with an orange do if i hit a vampire in the mouth with it .     said nanny  eyeing the approaching creatures .   igor scratched his head .     well  i thuppothe they won   t catch coldth tho eathily        the knocking reverberated around the castle again .  several vampires were creeping across the courtyard .   nanny caught a flicker of light around the edge of the door .  instinct took over .  as the vampires began to run  she grabbed igor and pulled him down .   the arch exploded  every stone and plank drifting away on an expanding bubble of eyeball searing flame .  it lifted the vampires off their feet and they screamed as the fire carried them up .   when the brightness had faded a little nanny peered carefully into the courtyard .   a bird  house sized  wings of flame wider than the castle  reared in the broken doorway .       mightily oats pushed himself up onto his hands and knees .  hot flames roared around him  thundering like fiercely burning gas .  his skin should be blackening already  but against all reason the fire felt no more deadly than a hot desert wind .  the air smelled of camphor and spices .   he looked up .  the flames wrapped granny weatherwax  but they looked oddly transparent  not entirely real .  here and there little gold and green sparks glittered on her dress  and all the time the fire whipped and tore around her .   she looked down at him .     you   re in the wings of the phoenix now  mister oats     she shouted  above the noise     and you ain   t burned .      the bird flapping its wings on her wrist was incandescent .      how can           you   re the scholar .  but male birds are always ones for the big display  aren   t they .         males .  this is a male phoenix .         yes .      it leapt .  what flew   what flew  as far as oats could see  was a great bird shape of pale flame  with the little form of the real bird inside like the head of a comet .  he added to himself  if that is indeed the real bird     it swooped up into the tower .  a yell  cut off quickly  indicated that a vampire hadn   t been fast enough .      it doesn   t burn itself .     oats said  weakly .      shouldn   t think so     said granny  stepping over the wreckage .     wouldn   t be much point .         then it must be magical fire           they say that whether it burns you or not is up to you     said granny .     i used to watch them as a kid .  my granny told me about    em .  some cold nights you see them dancin    in the sky over the hub  burnin    green and gold           oh  you mean the aurora coriolis     said oats  trying to make his voice sound matter of fact .     but actually that   s caused by magic particles hitting the           dunno what it   s caused by     said granny sharply     but what it is  is the phoenix dancin    .     she reached out .     i ought to hold your arm .         in case i fall over .     said oats  still watching the burning bird .      that   s right .      as he took her weight the phoenix above them flung back its head and screamed at the sky .      and to think i thought it was an allegorical creature     said the priest .      well .  even allegories have to live     said granny weatherwax .       vampires are not naturally cooperative creatures .  it   s not in their nature .  every other vampire is a rival for the next meal .  in fact  the ideal situation for a vampire is a world in which every other vampire has been killed off and no one seriously believes in vampires anymore .  they are by nature as cooperative as sharks .   vampyres are just the same  the only real difference being that they can   t spell properly .   the remnant of the clan scurried through the keep and headed for a door that for some reason had been left ajar .   the bucket containing a cocktail of waters blessed by a knight of offler  a high priest of io and a man so generically holy that he hadn   t cut his hair or washed for seventy years  landed on the first two to run through .   they did not include the count and his family  who had moved as one into a side tower .  there   s no point in having underlings if you don   t let them be the first to go through suspicious doors .      how could you have been so       lacrimosa began  and to her shock got a slap across the face from her father .      all we need to do is remain calm     said the count .     there   s no need to panic .         you struck me .         and most satisfying it was  too     said the count .     careful thought is what will save us .  that is why we will survive .         it   s not working .     said lacrimosa .     i   m a vampire .  i   m supposed to crave blood .  and all i can think about is a cup of tea with three sugars in it  whatever the hell that is .  that old woman   s doing something to us  can   t you see .         not possible     said the count .     oh  she   s sharp for a human  but i don   t reckon there   s any way she could get into your head or mine           you   re even talkin    like her .     shouted lacrimosa .      be resolute  my dear     said the count .     remember   that which does not kill us can only make us stronger .         and that which does kill us leaves us dead .     snarled lacri mosa .     you saw what happened to the others .  you got your fingers burned .         a moment   s lapse of concentration     said the count .     that old witch is not a threat .  she   s a vampire .  subservient to us .  she   ll be seeing the world differently           are you mad .  something killed cryptopher .         he let himself be frightened .      the rest of the family looked at the count .  vlad and lacrimosa exchanged a glance .      i am supremely confident     said the count .  his smile looked like a death mask  waxen and disturbingly tranquil .     my mind is like a rock .  my nerve is firm .  a vampire with his wits about him  or her  of course  can never be defeated .  didn   t i teach you this .  what   s this one .      his hand flew from his pocket  holding a square of white cardboard .      oh  father this is really no time for       lacrimosa froze  then jerked her arm in front of her face .     put it away .  put it away .  it   s the agatean chlong of destiny .         exactly  which is merely three straight lines and two curved lines pleasantly arranged which              i   d never have known about if you hadn   t told me  you old fool .     screamed the girl  backing away .   the count turned to his son .      and do you       he began .  vlad sprang back  putting his hand over his eyes .      it hurts .     he shouted .      dear me  the two of you haven   t been practicing       the count began  and turned the card around so that he could look at it .   he screwed up his eyes and turned his face away .      what have you done to us .  .     lacrimosa screamed .     you   ve taught us how to see hundreds of the damned holy things .  they   re everywhere .  every religion has a different one .  you taught us that  you stupid bastard .  lines and crosses and circles   oh my       she caught sight of the stone wall behind her astonished brother  and shuddered .     everywhere i look i see something holy .  you   ve taught us to see patterns .     she snarled at her father  teeth exposed .      it   ll be dawn soon     said the countess nervously .     will it hurt .         it won   t .  of course it won   t .     shouted count magpyr  as the others glanced up at the pale light coming through a high window .     it   s a learned psychochromatic reaction .  a superstition .  it   s all in the mind .         what else is in our minds  father .     said vlad coldly .   the count was circling  trying to keep an eye on lacrimosa .  the girl was flexing her fingers and snarling .      i said           nothing   s in our minds that we didn   t put there .     the count roared .     i saw that old witch   s mind .  it   s weak .  she relies on trickery .  she couldn   t possibly find a way in .  i wonder if there are other agendas here .      he bared his teeth at lacrimosa .   the countess fanned herself desperately .     well  i think we   re all getting a little bit overexcited     she said .     i think we should all settle down and have a nice cup of   a nice   of tea   a cup of           we   re vampires .     lacrimosa shouted .      then let   s act like them .     screamed the count .       agnes opened her eyes  kicked up  and the man with the hammer and stake lost all interest in vampires and in consciousness as well .      whsz       agnes removed from her mouth what was  this time  a fig .     can you get it into your stupid heads that i   m not a vampire .  and this isn   t a lemon .  it   s a fig .  and i   d watch that bloke with the stake .  he   s altogether too keen on it  i reckon there   s some psychology there           i wouldn   t have let him use it     said piotr  close by her ear .     but you did act very odd and then you just collapsed .  so we thought we   d better see what woke up .      he stood up .  the citizens of escrow stood watching among the trees  their faces gaunt in the flickering torchlight .      it   s all right  she   s still not one     he said .  there was some general relaxation .   you really have changed  said perdita .      you   re not affected .     said agnes .  she felt as if she was on the end of a string with someone jerking the other end .   no .  i   m the bit of you that watches  remember .      what .     said piotr .      i really  really hope this wears off     said agnes .     i keep tripping over my own feet .  i   m walking wrong .  my whole body feels wrong .         er   can we go on to the castle .     said piotr .      she   s already there     said agnes .     i don   t know how  but        she stopped  and looked at the worried faces  and for a moment she found herself thinking in the way granny weatherwax thought .      yes     she said  more slowly .     i reckon   i mean  i think we ought to get there right away .  people have to kill their own vampires .          nanny hurried down the steps again .      i told you .     she said .     that   s esme weatherwax down there  that is .  i told you .  i knew she was just biding her time .  hah  i   d like to see the bloodsucker who could put one over on her .         i wouldn   t     said igor  fervently .   nanny stepped over a vampire who hadn   t noticed  in the shadows  a cunning combination of a tripwire  a heavy weight and a stake  and opened a door into the courtyard .      coo ee  esme .      granny weatherwax pushed oats away and stepped forward .      is the baby all right .     she said .      magrat and es   young esme are locked up in the crypt .  it   s a very strong door     said nanny .      and thcrapth ith guarding them     said igor .     he   th a wonderful guard dog .      granny raised her eyebrows and looked igor up and down .      i don   t think i know this   these gentlemen     she said .      oh  this is igor     said nanny .     a man of many parts .         so it seems     said granny .   nanny glared at mightily oats .     what did you bring him for .     she said .      couldn   t seem to shake him off     said granny .      i always try hiding behind the sofa  myself     said nanny .  oats looked away .   there was a scream from somewhere on the battlements .  the phoenix had spotted another vampire .      all over now bar sweeping up the dust  then     said nanny .     they didn   t seem very smart           the count   s still here     said granny flatly .      oh  i vote we just set fire to the place and go home     said nanny .     it   s not as though he   ll be coming back to lancre in a hurry           there   th a crowd coming     said igor .      i can   t hear anything     said nanny .      i   ve got very good ear   th     said igor .      ah  well  of course some of us don   t get to choose     said nanny .   there was a clattering of footsteps across the bridge and people were suddenly swarming over the rubble .      isn   t that agnes .     said nanny .  normally  there   d be no mistaking the figure advancing across the courtyard  but there was something about the walk  the way every foot thudded down as though the boots were not on speaking terms with the earth .  and the arms  too  swung in a way        i can   t be having with this .     agnes shouted  marching up to granny .     i can   t think straight .  it   s you  isn   t it .      granny reached out and touched the wounds on her neck .      ah  i see     she said .     one them bit you  yes .         yes .  and somehow you spoke to me .         not me .  that was something in your blood talkin     i reckon     said granny .     who   re all these people .  why   s that man trying to set fire to the wall .       don   t he know stone don   t burn .         oh  that   s claude  he   s a bit single minded .  just let me know if he picks up a stake  will you .  look  they   re from escrow  it   s a town not far away   the magpyrs treated them like   well   pets .  farm animals .  just like they were trying to do back home .         we ain   t leaving until we   ve dealt with the count     said granny .     otherwise he   ll be sneaking back           er  excuse me     said oats  who seemed to have been thinking about something .     excuse me  but did someone mention that the queen was locked up in the crypt .         safe as houses     said nanny .     huge thick door and you can bar it from the inside .         how safe are houses from vampires .     said oats .   granny   s head turned sharply .     what do you mean .      oats took a step backward .      ah  i know what he means     said nanny .     it   s all right  we   re not daft  she won   t open up until she   s knows it   s us           i meant  how does the door stop vampires .         stop them .  it   s a door .         so   they can   t turn themselves into some sort of mist  then .     said oats  frying in the joint radiation of their stares .     only i thought that vampires could  you see .  i thought everyone knew that who knows anything about vampires        granny turned on igor .     d   you know anything about this .      igor   s mouth opened and shut a few times .      the old count never did anything like that     he said .      yes     said nanny     but he played fair .      there was a rising howl from the depths of the castle  cut off suddenly .      that was thcrapth .     said igor  breaking into a run .      thcraapthhh .     said agnes  wrinkling her brow .  nanny grabbed her arm and dragged her after igor .   granny swayed a little .  her eyes had an unfocused look .   oats glanced at her  made up his mind  staggered rather theatrically and sprawled in the dust .   granny blinked  shook her head and glared down at him .      hah .  all too much for you  eh .     she said hoarsely .   trembling fingers reached down for oats .  he took them  taking care not to pull  and stood up .      if you could just give me a hand     he said  as her grateful weight hit his shoulder .      right     said granny .     now let   s find the kitchens .         huh .  what do we want with the kitchens .         after a night like this we could all do with a cup of tea     said granny .       magrat leaned against the door as a second thump rattled the bolts .  beside her  scraps started to growl .  perhaps it was something to do with his extensive surgery  but scraps growled in half a dozen different pitches all at once .   then there was silence  which was even more terrifying than the thumping .   a faint noise made her look down .  a green smoke was pouring through the keyhole .   it was thick  and had an oily quality     she darted across the room and snatched up a jar that had contained lemons so sportingly provided by the mysterious old count that igor thought so highly of .  she wrenched off the lid and held it under the keyhole .  when the smoke had filled it up she dropped a few cloves of garlic in and slammed the lid back on .   the jar rocked urgently on the floor .   then magrat glanced at the lid of the well .  when she lifted it up  she heard rushing water a long way below .  well  that was likely  wasn   t it .  there must be lots of underground rivers in the mountains .   she held the jar over the center of the hole  and let it go .  then she slammed the lid back down .   young esme gurgled in the corner .  magrat hurried over to her and shook a rattle .      look at the pretty bunny rabbit     she said  and darted back again .   there was whispering on the other side of the door .  then nanny ogg   s voice said     it   s all right  dear  we   ve got them .  you can open the door now .  lawks .      magrat rolled her eyes .      is that really you  nanny .         that   s right  dear .         thank goodness .  just tell me the joke about the old woman  the priest and the rhinoceros  then  and i   ll let you in .      there was a pause  and some more whispering .      i don   t think we   ve got time for that  dear     said the voice .      ha ha  nice try     said magrat .     i   ve dropped one of you in the river .  who was it .      after some silence the voice of the count said     we thought the countess could persuade you to listen to reason .         not in a jar she can   t     said magrat .     and i   ve got more jars if you want to try it again .         we had hoped that you would be sensible about this     said the count .     however        the door slammed back  pulling the bolts out of the wall .   magrat grabbed the baby and stepped backward  her other hands raised .      you come near me and i   ll stab you with this .     she shouted .      it   s a teddy bear     said the count .     i   m afraid it wouldn   t work  even if you sharpened it .          the door was so hard that the wood was like stone with a grain .  someone had once thought hard about the maximum amount of force a really determined mob would be able to apply  and had then overdesigned .   it hung open .      but we heard her put the bars across .     wailed nanny .   a variously colored lump was sprawled in front of the door .  igor knelt down and picked up a limp paw .      they kill thcrapth .  the bathtardth .         they   ve got magrat and the babby .     snapped nanny .      he wath my only friend .      nanny   s arm shot out and  despite his bulk  igor was lifted up by his collar .      you   re going to have one very serious enemy really soon  my lad  unless you help us out right now .  oh  for heaven   s sake       with her spare hand she reached into her knickerleg and produced a large crumpled handkerchief .     have a good blow  will you .      there was a noise like a foghorn being trodden on .      now  where would they take them .  the place is swarming with righteous peasants .     said nanny  when he   d finished .      he wath alwayth ready with hith waggy tailth and hith cold nothe       igor sobbed .      where  igor .      igor pointed with his finger  or at least one that he currently owned  to the far door .      that goeth to the vaultth     he said .     an    they can get out through the iron gate down in the valley .  you   ll never catch them .         but it   s still bolted     said agnes .      then they   re thtill in the cathtle  which ith thtupid        he was interrupted by several huge organ chords  which made the floor rumble .      any of the escrow folk big musicians .     said nanny  lowering igor .      how do i know .     said agnes  as another couple of descending chords brought dust down from the ceiling .     they wanted to hammer a stake in me and boil my head .  that is not the time to ask them to give a little whistle .      the organ piped its summons once more .      why   d they stay .     said nanny .     they could be dug in deep somewhere by now   oh           granny wouldn   t run     said agnes .      no  granny weatherwax likes a showdown     said nanny  grinning artfully .     and they   re thinkin    like her .  somehow  she   s making them think like her           she thinks like her  too     said agnes .      let   s hope she   s had more practice  then     said nanny .     come on .          lacrimosa pulled an organ stop marked    ghastly face at win dow    and was rewarded with a chord  a crash of thunder and a slightly mechanical scream .      thank goodness we don   t take after your side of the family  father  that   s all i can say     she said .     although i suppose it could be fun if we could arrange some sort of mechanical linkage to the torture chamber .  that certainly wasn   t a very realistic scream .         this is ridiculous     said vlad .     we   ve got the child .  we   ve got the woman .  why don   t we just leave .  there   re plenty of other castles .         that would be running away     said the count .      and surviving     said vlad  rubbing his head .      we don   t run     said the count .     and   no  step back  please        this was to the mob  which was hovering uncertainly just inside the doors .  mobs become uncertain very quickly  in view of the absence of a central brain  and in this case the hesitation was caused by the sight of magrat and the baby .   vlad had a bruise on his forehead .  a push and go wooden duck on wheels can cause quite a lot of damage if wielded with enough force .      well done     said the count  cradling baby esme on one arm .  magrat writhed to escape the grip of his other hand  but it clamped her wrist like steel .     you see .  absolute obedience .  it   s just as in chess .  if you take the queen  you   ve as good as won .  it doesn   t matter if a few pawns are lost .         that   s a very nasty way to talk about mother     said vlad .      i am very attached to your mother     said the count .     and she   ll find a way to return  in the fullness of time .  a voyage will be good for her health .  some fisherman will find the jar and next thing you know she   ll be back with us  fat and healthy   ah  the inestimable mrs .  ogg           don   t you go smarming me .     snapped nanny  pushing her way through the bewildered crowd .     i   m fed up with you smarming at me smarmily as if you were mister smarm .  now you just free the both of them or           ah  so quickly we get to or     sighed the count .     but i will say  you will all leave the castle  and then we shall see .  perhaps we shall let the queen go .  but the little princess   isn   t she charming .  she can remain as our guest .  she   ll brighten the place up           she   s coming back to lancre with us  you bastard .     screamed magrat .  she twisted in the count   s grip and tried to slap him  but agnes saw her face whiten as his hand tightened on her wrist .      that   s very bad language for a queen     said the count .     and i am still very strong  even for a vampire .  but you   re right .  we shall all go back to lancre .  one big happy family  living in the castle .  i must say this place is losing its attractions .  oh  don   t blame yourself  mrs .  ogg .  i   m sure others will do that for you        he stopped .  a sound that had been on the edge of hearing was getting louder .  it had a rhythmic  almost tinny sound .   the crowd parted .  granny weatherwax walked forward  slowly stirring     no milk in this place     she said     not to be wondered at  really .  i sliced a bit of lemon  but it   s not the same  i always think .      she laid the spoon in the saucer with a clink that echoed around the hall  and gave the count a smile .      am i too late .     she said .       the bolts rattled back  one by one .            th gone too far     igor muttered .     the old marthter wouldn   t        the door creaked back on lovingly rusted hinges .  cool dry air puffed out of the darkness .   igor fumbled with some matches and lit a torch .         it   th all very well wanting a nithe long retht  but thith ith a dithgrathe        he ran along the dark corridors  half rough masonry  half sheer naked rock  and reached another chamber which was completely empty apart from a large stone sarcophagus in the center  on the side of which was carved magpyr .   he stuffed the torch into a bracket  removed his coat  and after considerable pushing heaved the stone lid aside .      thorry about thith  marthter     he grunted as it thudded to the ground .   inside the coffin  gray dust twinkled in the torchlight .         coming up here  mething everything up       igor picked up his coat and took a thick wad of material out of his pocket .  he unrolled it on the edge of the stone .  now the light glinted off an array of scalpels  scissors and needles .         threatening little babieth now   you never done that   only adventurouth femaleth over the age of theventeen and looking good in a nightie  you alwayth thed        he selected a scalpel and  with some care  nicked the little finger of his left hand .   a drop of blood appeared  swelled and dropped onto the dust  where it smoked .      that one   th for thcrapth     said igor with grim satisfaction .   by the time he   d reached the door white mist was already pouring over the edge of the coffin .          i   m an old lady     said granny weatherwax  looking around sternly .     i   d like to sit down  thank you so very much .      a bench was rushed forward .  granny sat  and eyed the count .      what were you saying .     she said .      ah  esmerelda     said the count .     at last you come to join us .  the call of the blood is too strong to be disobeyed  yes .         i hope so     said granny .      we   re all going to walk out of here  miss weatherwax .         you   re not leaving here     said granny .  she stirred the tea again .  the eyes of all three vampires swiveled to follow the spoon .      you have no choice but to obey me .  you know that     said the count .      oh  there   s always a choice     said granny .   vlad and lacrimosa leaned down on either side of their father .  there was some hurried whispering .  the count looked up .      no  you couldn   t have resisted it     he said .     not even you .         i won   t say it didn   t cost me     said granny .  she stirred the tea again .   there was more whispering .      we do have the queen and the baby     said the count .     i believe you think highly of them .      granny raised the cup halfway to her lips .     kill    em     she said .     it won   t benefit you .         esme .     snapped nanny ogg and magrat together .   granny put the cup back in the saucer .  agnes thought she saw vlad sigh .  she could feel the pull herself     i know what she did  whispered perdita .  so do i  thought agnes .      he   s bluffing     granny said .      oh .  you   d like a vampire queen one day  would you .     said lacrimosa .      had one once  in lancre     said granny  conversationally .     poor woman got bitten by one of you people .  got by on blue steak and such .  never laid a tooth on anyone  the way i heard it .  griminir the impaler  she was .         the impaler .         oh  i just said she wasn   t a bloodsucker .  i didn   t say she was a nice person     said granny .     she didn   t mind shedding blood  but she drew the line at drinking it .  you don   t have to  neither .         you know nothing about true vampires .         i know more   n you think  and i know about gytha ogg     said granny .  nanny ogg blinked .   granny weatherwax raised the teacup again  and then lowered it .     she likes a drink .  she   ll tell you it has to be the best brandy       nanny nodded affirmation       and that   s certainly what she desires  but really she   ll settle for beer just like everyone else .     nanny ogg shrugged as granny went on     but you wouldn   t settle for black puddings  would you  because what you really drink is power over people .  i know you like i know myself .  and one of the things i know is that you ain   t going to hurt a hair of that child   s head .  leastways     and here granny absentmindedly stirred the tea again     if she had any yet  you wouldn   t .  you can   t  see .      she picked up the cup and carefully scraped it on the edge of the saucer .  agnes saw lacrimosa   s lips part  hungrily .      so all i   m really here for  d   you see  is to see whether you get justice or mercy     said nanny .     it   s just a matter of choosing .         you really think we wouldn   t harm meat .     said lacrimosa  striding forward .     watch .      she brought her hand down hard toward the baby  and then jerked back as if she   d been stung .      can   t do it     said granny .      i nearly broke my arm .         shame     said granny calmly .      you   ve put some   something magical in the child  have you .     said the count .      can   t imagine who   d think i   d do such a thing     said granny  while behind her nanny ogg looked down at her boots .     so here   s my offer  you see .  you hand back magrat and the baby and we   ll chop your heads off .         and that   s what you call justice  is it .     said the count .      no  that   s what i call mercy     said granny .  she put the cup back in the saucer .      for goodness    sake  woman  are you going to drink that damn tea or not .     roared the count .   granny sipped it  and made a face .      why  what have i been thinkin    of .  i   ve been so busy talking  it   s got cold     she said  and daintily tipped the contents of the cup onto the floor .   lacrimosa groaned .      it   ll probably wear off soon     granny went on  in the same easy voice .     but until it does  you see  you   ll not harm a child  you   ll not harm magrat  you hate the thought of drinking blood  and you won   t run because you   ll never run from a challenge           what will wear off .     said vlad .      oh  they   re strong  your walls of thought     said granny dreamily .     i couldn   t get through them .      the count smiled .   granny smiled  too .     so i didn   t     she added .       the mist rolled through the crypt  flowing along the floor  walls and ceiling .  it poured up the steps and along a tunnel  the billows boiling ahead on one another as though engaged in a war .   an unwary rat  creeping across the flagstones  was too late .  the mist flowed over it .  there was a squeak  cut off  and when the mist had gone a few small white bones were all that remained .   some equally small bones  but fully assembled and wearing a black hooded robe and carrying a tiny scythe  appeared out of nowhere and walked over to them .  skeletal claws tippy tapped on the stone .      squeak .     said the ghost of the rat pathetically .   squeak  said the death of rats .  this was really all it needed to know .          you wanted to know where i   d put my self     said granny .     i didn   t go anywhere .  i just put it in something alive  and you took it .  you invited me in .  i   m in every muscle in your body and i   m in your head  oh yes .  i was in the blood  count .  in the blood .  i ain   t been vampired .  you   ve been weatherwaxed .  all of you .  and you   ve always listened to your blood  haven   t you .      the count stared at her  open mouthed .   the spoon dropped out of her saucer and tinkled onto the floor  raising a wave in a thin white mist .  it was rolling in from the walls  leaving a shrinking circle of black and white tiles in the middle of which were the vampires .   igor pushed his way through the crowd until he was alongside nanny .      it   th all right     he said     i couldn   t let it go on  it wath dithgratheful        the mist rose in a boiling tower  there was a moment of discontinuity  a feeling of sliced time  and then a figure stood behind vlad and lacrimosa .  he was rather taller than most men  and wearing evening dress that might have been in style once upon a time .  his hair was streaked with gray and brushed back over his ears in a way that gave the impression his head had been designed for its aerodynamic efficiency .   beautifully manicured hands gripped the shoulders of the younger vampires .  lacrimosa turned to scratch him  and cowered when he snarled like a tiger .   then the face returned to something closer to human  and the newcomer smiled .  he seemed genuinely pleased to see everyone .      good morning     he said .      another bloody vampire .     said nanny .      not any old vampire     said igor  hopping from one foot to the other .     it   th the old marthter .  old red eyeth ith back .      granny stood up  ignoring the tall figure firmly holding the two suddenly docile vampires .  she advanced on the count .      i know all about what you can and can   t do     she said     because you let me in .  an    that means you can   t do what i can   t do .  an    you think just like me  the difference bein    i   ve done it longer and i   m better   n you at it .         you   re meat     snarled the count .     clever meat .         and you invited me in     said granny .     i   m not the sort to go where i   m not welcome  i   m sure .      in the count   s arms the baby started to cry .  he stood up .      how sure are you that i won   t harm this child .     he said .      i wouldn   t .  so you can   t .      the count   s face contorted as he wrestled with his feelings and also with magrat  who was kicking him in the shins .      it could have worked       he said  and for the first time the certainty had been drained from his voice .      you mean it could have worked for you .     shouted agnes .      we are vampires .  we cannot help what we are .         only animals can   t help what they are     said granny .     will you give me the child now .         if i       the count began  and then straightened up .     no .  i don   t have to bargain .  i can fight you  just as you fought me .  and if i walk out of here now  i don   t think there   s anyone who   ll dare stop me .  look at you   all of you   and look at me .  and now look at   him .     he nodded at the figure holding vlad and lacri mosa as still as statues .     is that what you want .         sorry   who is this we   re supposed to be looking at .     said granny .     oh   igor   s    old master    .  the old count magpyr  i believe .      the old count nodded gracefully .     your servant  madam     he said .      i doubt it     said granny .      oh  no one minded him     said piotr  from among the escrow citizens .     he only ever came around every few years and anyway if you remembered about the garlic he wasn   t a problem .  he didn   t expect us to like him .      the old count smiled at him .      you look familiar .  one of the ravi family  aren   t you .         piotr  sir .  son of hans .         ah yes .  very similar bone structure .  do remember me to your grandmother .         she passed away ten years ago  sir .         oh really .  i am so sorry .  time goes so quickly when you   re dead .     the old master sighed .     a very fine figure in a nightdress  as i recall .         oh  he was all right     said someone else in the crowd .     we got a nip every now and again but we got over it .         that   s a familiar voice     said the vampire .     are you a veyzen .         yessir .         related to arno veyzen .         great granddaddy  sir .         good man .  killed me stone dead seventy five years ago .  stake right through the heart from twenty paces .  you should be proud .      the man in the crowd beamed with ancestral pride .      we   ve still got the stake hung up over the fireplace  yer honor     he said .      well done .  good man .  i like to see the old ways kept up        count magpyr screamed .      you can   t possibly prefer that .  he   s a monster .         but he never made an appointment .     shouted agnes  even louder .     i bet he never thought it was all just an arrangement .      count magpyr was edging toward the door with his hostages .      no     he said     this is not how it   s going to happen .  if anyone really believes that i won   t harm my charming hostages  perhaps you will try to stop me .  does anyone really believe that old woman .      nanny ogg opened her mouth  caught granny   s eye  and shut it again .  the crowd parted behind the count as he dragged magrat toward the door .   he walked into the figure of mightily oats .      have you ever thought of letting om into your life .     said the priest .  his voice trembled .  his face glistened with sweat .      oh   you again .     said the count .     if i can resist her  little boy  you are not a problem .      oats held his ax before him as if it were made of some rare and delicate metal .      begone  foul fiend       he began .      oh  dear me     said the count  thrusting the ax aside .     and don   t you learn anything  you stupid man .  little stupid man who has a little stupid faith in a little stupid god .         but it   lets me see things as they are     oats managed .      really .  and you think you can stand in my way .  an ax isn   t even a holy symbol .         oh .     oats looked crestfallen .  agnes saw his shoulders sag as he lowered the blade .   then he looked up  smiled brightly and said     let   s make it so .      agnes saw the blade leave a gold trail in the air as it swept around .  there was a soft  almost silken sound .   the ax dropped onto the flagstones .  in the sudden silence  it clanged like a bell .  then oats reached out and snatched the child from the vampire   s unresisting hands .  he held her out to magrat  who took her in shocked silence .   the first sound after that was the rustle of granny   s dress as she stood up and walked over to the ax .  she nudged it with her foot .      if i   ve got a fault     she said  contriving to suggest that this was only a theoretical possibility     it   s not knowing when to turn and run .  and i tends to bluff on a weak hand .      her voice echoed in the hall .  no one else had even breathed out yet .   she nodded at the count  who   d slowly raised his hands to the red wound that ran all around his neck .      it was a sharp ax     she said .     who says there   s no mercy in the world .  just don   t nod  that   s all .  and someone   ll take you down to a nice cold coffin and i daresay fifty years   ll just fly past and maybe you   ll wake with enough sense to be stupid .      there was a murmur from the mob as they came back to life .  granny shook her head .      they want you deader than that  i see     she said  as the count gazed ahead of him with frozen  desperate eyes and the blood welled and seeped between his fingers .     an    there   s ways .  oh yes .  we could burn you to ashes and scatter them in the sea        this met with a general sigh of approval .         or throw    em up in the air in the middle of a gale        this got a smattering of applause .         or just pay some sailor to drop you over the edge .     this even got a few whistles .     of course  you   d come back alive again  i suppose  one day .  but just floating in space for millions of years  oh  that sounds very boring to me .     she raised a hand to silence the crowd .      no .  fifty years to think about things  that   s about right .  people need vampires     she said .     they helps    em remember what stakes and garlic are for .      she snapped her fingers at the crowd .     come on  two of you take him down to the vaults .  show some respect for the dead           that   s not enough .     said piotr  stepping forward .     not after all he           then when he comes back you deal with him yourself .     snapped granny loudly .     teach your children .  don   t trust the cannibal just    cos he   s usin    a knife and fork .  and remember that vampires don   t go where they   re not invited .      they backed away .  granny relaxed a little .      this time round  it   s up to me .  my   choice .     she leaned closer to the count   s horrible grimace .     you tried to take my mind away from me     she said  in a lower voice .     and that   s everything to me .  reflect on that .  try to learn .     she stood back .     take him away .      she turned away  to the tall figure .     so   you   re the old master  are you .     she said .      alison weatherwax .     said the old master .     i have a good memory for necks .      granny froze for a second .      what .  no .  er   how do you know the name .         why  she passed through here  what  fifty years ago .  we met briefly  and then she cut off my head and stuck a stake in my heart .     the count sighed happily .     a very spirited woman .  you   re a relative  i presume .  i lose track of generations  i   m afraid .         granddaughter     said granny weakly .      there   s a phoenix outside the castle  igor tells me           it   ll leave  i expect .      the count nodded .     i   ve always rather liked them     he said  wistfully .     there were so many of them when i was young .  they made the nights   pretty .  so pretty .  everything was so much simpler then       his voice trailed off  and then came back louder .     but now  apparently  we   re in modern times .         that   s what they say     murmured granny .      well  madam  i   ve never taken too much notice of them .  fifty years later they never seem so modern as all that .     he shook the younger vampires like dolls .     i do apologize for my nephew   s behavior .  quite out of keeping for a vampire .  would you people from escrow like to kill these two .  it   s the least i could do .         ain   t they your relatives .     said nanny ogg  as the crowd surged forward .      oh yes .  but we   ve never been much of a species for playing happy families .      vlad looked imploringly at agnes  and reached out to her .      you wouldn   t let them kill me  would you .  you wouldn   t let them do this to me .  we could have   we might   you wouldn   t  would you .      the crowd hesitated .  this sounded like an important plea .  a hundred pairs of eyes stared at agnes .   she took his hand .  i suppose we could work on him  said perdita .  but agnes thought about escrow  and the queues  and the children playing while they waited  and how evil might come animal sharp in the night  or grayly by day on a list        vlad     she said gently  looking deep into his eyes     i   d even hold their coats .         a fine sentiment but that ain   t happenin        said granny  behind her .     you take    em away  count .  teach    em the old ways .  teach    em stupidity .      the count nodded  and grinned toothily .      certainly .  i shall teach them that to live you have to rise again           hah .  you don   t live  count .  the phoenix lives .  you just don   t know you   re dead .  now get along with you .      there was another moment sliced out of time and then a flock of magpies rose up from where the three vampires had been  screaming and chattering  and disappeared in the darkness of the roof .      there   s hundreds of them .     said agnes to nanny .      well  vampires can turn into things     said nanny .     everyone knows that  who knows anything about vampires .         and what do three hundred magpies mean .         they mean it   s time to put covers on all the furniture     said nanny .     and that it   s time for me to have a very big drink .      the crowd began to break up  aware that the show was over .      why didn   t she just let us wipe them out .     hissed piotr by agnes   s ear .     death   s too good for them .         yes     said agnes .     i suppose that   s why she didn   t let them have it .      oats hadn   t moved .  he was still staring straight ahead of him  but his hands were shaking .  agnes led him gently to a bench  and eased him down .      i killed him  didn   t i     he whispered .      sort of     said agnes .     it   s a bit hard to tell with vampires .         there was just nothing else to do .  everything just went   the air just went gold  and there was just this one moment to do something           i don   t think anyone   s complaining     said agnes .  you   ve got to admit he   s quite attractive  whispered perdita .  if only he   d do something about that boil     magrat sat down on the other side of oats  clutching the baby .  she breathed deeply a few times .      that was very brave of you     she said .      no  it wasn   t     said oats hoarsely .     i thought mistress weather wax was going to do something           she did     said magrat  shivering .     oh  she did .      granny weatherwax sat down on the other end of the bench and pinched the bridge of her nose .      i just want to go home now     she said .     i just want to go home and sleep for a week .     she yawned .     i   m dyin    for a cuppa .         i thought you   d made one .     said agnes .     you had us slavering for it .         where   d i get tea here .  it was just some mud in water .  but i know nanny keeps a bag of it somewhere on her person .     she yawned again .     make the tea  magrat .      agnes opened her mouth  but magrat waved her into silence and then handed her the baby .      certainly  granny     she said  gently pushing agnes back into her seat .     i   ll just find out where igor keeps the kettle  shall i .          mightily oats stepped out onto the battlements .  the sun was well up  and a breeze was blowing in over the forests of uberwald .  a few magpies chattered in the trees nearest the castle .   granny was leaning with her elbows on the wall  and staring out over the thinning mists .      it looks like it   s going to be a fine day     said oats  happily .  and he did feel happy  to his amazement .  there was sharpness to the air  and the sense of the future brimming with possibilities .  he remembered the moment when he   d swung the ax  when both of him had swung it  together .  perhaps there was a way        there   s a storm coming down from the hub later     said granny .      well   at least that   ll be good for the crops  then     said oats .   something flickered overhead .  in the new daylight the wings of the phoenix were hard to see  mere yellow shimmers in the air  with the tiny shape of the little hawk in the center as it circled high over the castle .      why would anyone want to kill something like that .     said oats .      oh  some people   ll kill anything for the fun of it .         is it a true bird or is it something that exists within a           it   s a thing that is     said granny sharply .     don   t go spilling allegory all down your shirt .         well  i feel   blessed to have seen it .         really .  i gen   rally feel the same about the sunrise     said granny .     you would too  at my time of life .     she sighed  and then seemed to be speaking mainly to herself .     she never went to the bad  then  whatever people said .  and you   d have to be on your toes with that ol    vampire .  she never went to the bad .  you heard him say that  right .  he said it .  he didn   t have to .         er   yes .         she   d have been older   n me  too .  bloody good witch  was nana alison .  sharp as a knife .  had her funny little ways  o    course  but who hasn   t .         no one i know  certainly .         right .  you   re right .     granny straightened up .     good     she said .        er           yes .      oats was looking down at the drawbridge and the road to the castle .      there   s a man in a nightshirt covered in mud and waving a sword down there     he said     followed by a lot of lancre people and some   little blue men        he looked down again .     at least it looks like mud     he added .      that   ll be the king     said granny .     big aggie   s given him some of her brose  by the sound of it .  he   ll save the day .         er   hasn   t the day been saved .         oh  he   s the king .  it looks like it might be a nice day  so let him save it .  you   ve got to give kings something to do .  anyway  after a drink from big aggie he won   t know what day it is .  we   d better get down there .         i feel i should thank you     said oats  when they reached the spiral staircase .      for helping you across the mountains  you mean .         the world is   different .     oats   s gaze went out across the haze  and the forests  and the purple mountains .     everywhere i look i see something holy .      for the first time since he   d met her  he saw granny weather wax smile properly .  normally her mouth went up at the corners just before something unpleasant was going to happen to someone who deserved it  but this time she appeared to be pleased with what she   d heard .      that   s a start  then     she said .       the magpyrs    coach had been righted and dragged up to the castle .  now it returned  with jason ogg at the reins .  he was concentrating on avoiding the bumps .  they made his bruises tender .  besides  the royal family was on board and he was feeling extremely loyal at the moment .   jason ogg was very big and very strong and  therefore  not a violent man  because he did not need to be .  sometimes he was summoned down to the pub to sort out the more serious fights  which he usually did by picking up both contestants and holding them apart until they stopped struggling .  if that didn   t work  he   d bang them together a few times  in as friendly a way as possible .   aggressiveness did not normally impress him  but since in yesterday   s battle at lancre castle he   d had to physically lift verence off the ground in order to stop him slaughtering enemies  friends  furniture  walls and his own feet  he was certainly seeing his king in a new light .  it had turned out to be an extremely short battle .  the mercenaries had been only too keen to surrender  especially after shawn   s assault .  the real fight had been to keep verence away from them long enough to allow them to say so .   jason was impressed .   king verence  inside the coach  laid his head in his wife   s lap and groaned as she wiped his brow with a cloth     at a respectable distance  the coach was followed by a cart containing the witches  although what it contained mostly was snore .   granny weatherwax had a primal snore .  it had never been tamed .  no one had ever had to sleep next to it  to curb its wilder excesses by means of a kick  a prod in the small of the back or a pillow used as a bludgeon .  it had had years in a lonely bedroom to perfect the knark  the graaah and the gnoc  gnoc  gnoc unimpeded by the nudges  jabs and occasional attempts at murder that usually moderate the snore impulse over time .   she sprawled in the straw at the bottom of the cart  mouth open  and snored .      you half expect to find the shafts sawed through  don   t you     said nanny  who was leading the horse .     still  you can hear it doin    her good .         i   m a bit worried about mister oats  though     said agnes .     he   s just sitting there and grinning .      oats was sitting with his legs over the tail of the cart  staring happily at the sky .      did he hit his head .     said nanny .      i don   t think so .         let him be  then .  at least he ain   t settin    fire to anything   oh  here   s an old friend        igor  tongue protruding from the corner of his mouth in the ferocity of his concentration  was putting the finishing touches to a new sign .  it read why not vysyt our gifte shoppe .  he stood up and nodded as the cart drew near .      the old marthter came up with some new ideath while he wath dead     he said  feeling that some explanation was called for .     thith afternoon i   ve got to thtart building a funfair  whatever that ith .         that   s basic   ly swings     said nanny .   igor brightened up .     oh  i   ve plenty of rope and i   ve alwayth been a dab hand at nootheth     he said .      no  that   s not       agnes began  but nanny ogg cut in quickly .      i s   pose it all depends on who   s going to have the fun     she said .     well  be seeing you  igor .  don   t do anything i wouldn   t do  if you ever find anything i wouldn   t do .         we   re very sorry about scraps     said agnes .     perhaps we can find you a puppy or           thankth all the thame  but no .  there   th only one thcrapth .      he waved to them until they were round the next bend .   as agnes turned round again she saw the three magpies .  they were perched on a branch over the road .         three for a funeral          she began .   a stone whirred up .  there was an indignant squawk and a shower of feathers .      two for mirth     said nanny  in a self satisfied voice .      nanny  that was cheating .         witches always cheat     said nanny ogg .  she glanced back at the sleeping figure behind them .     everyone knows that   who knows anything about witches .      they went home to lancre .       it had been raining again .  water had seeped into oats   s tent and also into the harmonium  which now emitted an occasional squashed frog burp when it was played .  the songbooks also smelled rather distressingly of cat .   he gave up on them and turned to the task of disassembling his camp bed  which had skinned two knuckles and crushed one finger when he put it up and still looked as though it was designed for a man shaped like a banana .   oats was aware that he was trying to avoid thinking .  on the whole  he was happy with this .  there was something pleasing about simply getting on with simple tasks  and listening to his own breath .  perhaps there was a way     from outside there was the faint sound of something wooden hitting something hollow  and whispering on the evening air .   he peered through the tent flap .   people were filing stealthily into the field .  the first few were carrying planks .  several were pushing barrels .  he stood with his mouth open as the very rough benches were constructed and began to fill up .   a number of the men had bandages across their noses  he noticed .   then he heard the rattle of wheels and saw the royal coach lurch through the gateway .  this woke him up and he scurried back into the tent  pulling damp clothes out of his bag in a frantic search for a clean shirt .  his hat had never been found and his coat was caked with mud  the leather of his shoes was cracked and the buckles had instantly tarnished in the acid marshes  but surely a clean shirt     sometime tried to knock on the damp canvas and then  after an interval of half a second  stepped into the tent .      are you decent .     said nanny ogg  looking him up and down .     we   re all out here waitin     you know .  lost sheep waitin    to be shorn  you might say     she added  her manner suggesting very clearly that she was doing something that she personally disapproved of  but doing it just the same .   oats turned around .      mrs .  ogg  i know you don   t like me very much           don   t see why i should like you at all     said nanny .     what with you tagging after esme and her havin    to help you all that way across the mountains like that .      the response was screaming up oats   s throat before he noticed the faint knowing look in nanny   s eyes  and he managed to turn it into a cough .      er   yes     he said .     yes .  silly of me  wasn   t it .  er   how many are out there  mrs .  ogg .         oh  a hundred  maybe a hundred and fifty .      levers  thought oats  and had a fleeting vision of the pictures in nanny   s parlor .  she controls the levers of lots of people .  but someone pulled her lever first  i   ll bet .      and what do they expect of me .         says evensong on the poster     said nanny simply .     even beer would be better .      so he went out and saw the watching faces of a large part of lancre   s population lined up in the late afternoon light .  the king and queen were in the front row .  verence nodded regally at oats to signal that whatever it was that he intended ought to start around now .   it was clear from the body language of nanny ogg that any specifically omnian prayers would not be tolerated  and oats made do with a generic prayer of thanks to any god that may be listening and even to the ones that weren   t .   then he pulled out the stricken harmonium and tried a few chords until nanny elbowed him aside  rolled up her sleeves  and coaxed notes out of the damp bellows that oats never even knew were in there .   the singing wasn   t very enthusiastic  though  until oats tossed aside the noisome songbook and taught them some of the songs he remembered from his grandmother  full of fire and thunder and death and justice and tunes you could actually whistle  with titles like    om shall trample the ungodly    and    lift me to the skies    and    light the good light .     they went down well .  lancre people weren   t too concerned about religion  but they knew what it ought to sound like .   while he led the singing  with the aid of a long stick and the words of the hymns scrawled on the side of his tent  he scanned his   well  he decided to call it his congregation .  it was his first real one .  there were plenty of women  and a lot of very well scrubbed men  but one face was patently not there .  its absence dominated the scene .   but  as he raised his eyes upward in mid song  he did notice an eagle far overhead  a mere speck gyrating across the darkening sky  possibly hunting for lost lambs .   and then it was over and people left  quietly  with the look of those who   d done a job which had not not been unpleasant but which was nevertheless over .  the collection plate produced two pennies  some carrots  a large onion  a small loaf  a pound of mutton  a jug of milk and a pickled pig   s trotter .      we   re not really a cash economy     said king verence  stepping forward .  he had a bandage across his forehead .      oh  it   ll make a good supper  sire     said oats  in the madly cheerful voice that people use when addressing royalty .      surely you   ll dine with us .     said magrat .      i   er   was planning to leave at first light  sire .  so i really ought to spend the evening packing and setting fire to the camp bed .         leaving .  but i thought you were staying here .  i   ve taken   community soundings     said the king     and i think i can say that popular opinion is with me on this .      oats looked at magrat   s face  which said plainly  granny doesn   t object .      well  i  er   i expect i shall pass through again  sire     he said .     but   to tell you the truth  i was thinking of heading on to uberwald .         that   s a hellish place  mr .  oats .         i   ve thought about it all day  sire  and i   m set on it .         oh .     verence looked nonplussed  but kings learn to swing back upright .     i   m sure you know your own mind best .     he swayed slightly as magrat   s elbow grazed his ribs .     oh   yes   we heard you lost your  er  holy amulet and so this afternoon we  that is to say the queen and miss nitt   got shawn ogg to make this in the mint        oats unwrapped the black velvet scroll .  inside  on a golden chain  was a small golden double headed ax .   he stared at it .      shawn isn   t very good at turtles     said magrat  to fill the gap .      i shall treasure it     said oats  at last .      of course  we appreciate it   s not very holy     said the king .   oats waved a hand dismissively .     who knows  sire .  holiness is where you find it     he said .   behind the king  jason and darren ogg were standing respectfully to attention .  both still had plasters stuck across their noses .  they moved aside hurriedly to make way for the king  who didn   t seem to notice .   nanny ogg struck a chord on the harmonium when the royal couple had departed with their retinue .      if you drop in to our jason   s forge first thing when you   re leavin    i   ll see to it he fixes the bellows on this contraption     she said diffidently  and oats realized that in the context of nanny ogg this was as close as he was going to get to three rousing cheers and the grateful thanks of the population .      i was so impressed that everyone turned up on their own free will     he said .     spontaneously  as it were .         don   t push your luck  sonny boy     said nanny  getting up .      nice to have met you  mrs .  ogg .      nanny walked away a few steps  but oggs never left anything unsaid .      i can   t say as i approve of you     she said  stiffly .     but should you ever come knockin    on an ogg door in these parts you   ll   get a hot meal .  you   re too skinny .  i   ve seen more meat on a butcher   s pencil .         thank you .         not necessarily puddin    as well  mark you .         of course not .         well  then       nanny ogg shrugged .     best of luck in uber wald  then .         om will go with me  i   m sure     said oats .  he was interested in how annoyed you could make nanny by speaking calmly to her  and wondered if granny weatherwax had tried it .      i hope he does     said nanny .     i person   ly don   t want him hanging around here .      when she   d gone oats lit a fire of the horrible bed and stuck the songbooks around it to dry out .      hello        the thing about a witch in darkness is that all you see is her face  bobbing toward you  surrounded by black .  then a little contrast reasserted itself  and an area of shadow detached from the rest and became agnes .      oh  good evening     said oats .     thank you for coming .  i   ve never heard anyone singing in harmony with themselves before .      agnes coughed nervously .      are you really going on into uberwald .         there   s no reason to stay here  is there .      agnes   s left arm twitched a few times .  she steadied it with her right hand .      s   pose not     she said  in a small voice .     no .  shut up .  this is not the time .         i beg your pardon .         i was  um  just talking to myself     said agnes  wretchedly .     look  everyone knows you helped granny .  they just pretend they don   t .         yes .  i know .         you don   t mind .      oats shrugged .  agnes coughed .      i thought perhaps you were going to stay on here for a while .         there   d be no point  i   m not needed here .         i shouldn   t think vampires and so on would be very keen on singing hymns     said agnes quietly .      perhaps they can learn something else     said oats .     i shall see what may be done .      agnes stood hesitantly for a few moments .      i   ve got to give you this     she said  suddenly handing over a small bag .  oats reached inside and took out a small jar .   inside  a phoenix feather burned  lighting up the field with a clear  cool light .      it   s from       agnes began .      i know who it   s from     said oats .     is mistress weatherwax all right .  i didn   t see her here .         er   she   s been having a rest today .         well  thank her from me  will you .         she said it   s to take into dark places .      oats laughed .      er   yes .  er   i might come and see you off in the morning       said agnes  uncertainly .      that would be nice of you .         so   until   you know           yes .      agnes seemed to be struggling with some inner resistance .  then she said     and  er   there   s something i   ve been meaning to   i mean  perhaps you could           yes .      agnes   s right hand dived urgently into her pocket and she pulled out a small package wrapped in greased paper .      it   s a poultice     she blurted out     it   s a very good recipe and the book says it always works and if you heat it up and leave it on it   ll do wonders for your boil .      oats took it gently .     it   s just possible that   s the nicest thing anyone   s ever given me     he said .      er   good .  it   s from   er   both of us .  goodbye .      oats watched her leave the circle of light  and then something drew his eye upward again .   the circling eagle had risen above the shadow of the mountains and into the light of the setting sun .  for a moment it flashed gold  and then dropped into the dark again .       from up here the eagle could see for miles across the mountains .   over uberwald  the threatened storm had broken .  lightning scribbled across the sky .   some of it crackled around the highest tower of don   tgonearthe castle  and on the rain hat that igor wore to stop his head rusting .  it raised little balls of glowing light on the big telescopic iron spike as  taking care to stand on his portable rubber mat  he patiently wound it upward .   at the foot of the apparatus  which was already humming with high tension  was a bundle wrapped in a blanket .   the spike locked itself in position .  igor sighed  and waited .       down  boy .  down  i say .  will you stop   let go .  let go this minute .  all right  look   fetch .  fetch .  there we go     death watched scraps bound away .   he wasn   t used to this .  it wasn   t that people weren   t sometimes glad to see him  because the penultimate moments of life were often crowded and complex and a cool figure in black came as something of a relief .  but he   d never encountered quite this amount of enthusiasm or  if it came to it  this amount of flying mucus .  it was disconcerting .  it made him feel he wasn   t doing his job properly .   there   s a satisfactory dog .  now   drop .  let go  please .  did you hear me say let go .  let go this minute .   scraps bounced away .  this was far too much fun to end .   there was a soft chiming from within his robe .  death rubbed his hand on the cloth in an effort to get it dry and brought out a lifetimer  its sand all pooled in the bottom bulb .  but the glass itself was misshapen  twisted  covered in welts of raised glass and  as death watched  it filled up with crackling blue light .   normally  death was against this sort of thing but  he reasoned as he snapped his fingers  at the moment it looked as though it was the only way he   d get his scythe back .       the lightning hit .   there was a smell of singed wool .   igor waited awhile and then trudged round to the bundle  trailing molten rubber behind him .  kneeling down  he carefully unwrapped the blanket .   scraps yawned .  a large tongue licked igor   s hand .   as he smiled with relief there came  from far down below in the castle  the sound of the mighty organ playing    toccata for young women in underwired nighdresses .          the eagle swooped on into the bowl of lancre .   the long light glowed on the lake  and on the big v shaped ripple  made up of many small v shaped ripples  that arrowed through the water toward the unsuspecting island .   the voices echoed around the mountains .      see you  otter .         taggit  jins ma greely .         wee free men .         nac mac feegle .      the eagle passed overhead  dropping fast and steep now .  it drifted silently over the shadowy woods  curved over the trees  and landed suddenly on a branch beside a cottage in a clearing .   granny weatherwax awoke .   her body did not move  but her gaze darted this way and that  sharply  and in the gloom her nose looked more hooked than normal .  then she settled back  and her shoulders lost the hunched  perching look .   after a while she stood up  stretched  and went to the doorway .   the night felt warmer .  she could feel greenness in the ground  uncoiling .  the year was past the edge  heading away from the dark   of course  dark would come again  but that was in the nature of the world .  many things were beginning .   when at last she   d shut the door she lit the fire  took the box of candles out of the dresser and lit every single one and put them around the room  in saucers .   on the table  the pool of water that had accumulated in the last two days rippled and rose gently in the middle .  then a drip soared upward and plopped into the damp patch in the ceiling .   granny wound up the clock  and started the pendulum .  she left the room for a moment and came back with a square of cardboard attached to a loop of elderly string .  she sat down in the rocking chair and reached down into the hearth for a stick of half burned wood .   the clock ticked as she wrote .  another drop left the table and plunged toward the ceiling .   then granny weatherwax hung the sign around her neck  and lay back with a smile .  the chair rocked for a while  a counterpoint to the dripping of the table and the ticking of the clock  and then slowed .   the sign read   i still ate   nt dead  the light faded from can to can   t .   after a few minutes an owl woke up in a nearby tree and sailed out over the forests .       about the author   terry pratchett   s novels

others just make you walk in a funny way and avoid fruit .       sometimes  of course  to say     please stop doing it .          it struck people as odd that  while lancre people refused pointblank to have any truck with democracy  on the basis that governing was what the king ought to do and they   d be sure to tell him if he went wrong  they didn   t make very good servants .  oh  they could cook and dig and wash and footle and buttle and did it very well but could never quite get the hang of the serving mentality .  king verence was quite understanding about this  and put up with shawn ushering guests into the dining room with a cry of    lovely grub  get it while it   s hot .         apart from the ones containing small postal orders attached to letters which  generally  said pretty much the same thing  dear mum and dad  i am doing pretty well in ankh morpork and this week i earned a whole seven dollars         when there was nothing much else to occupy her time granny weatherwax sent her mind borrowing  letting it piggyback inside the heads of other creatures .  she was widely accepted as the most skilled exponent of the art that the ramtops had seen for centuries  being practically able to get inside the minds of things that didn   t even have minds .  the practice meant  among other things  that lancre people were less inclined toward the casual cruelty to animals that is a general feature of the rural idyll  on the basis that the rat you throw a brick at today might turn out to be the witch you need some toothache medicine from tomorrow .   it also meant that people calling on her unexpectedly would find her stretched out apparently cold and lifeless  heart and pulse barely beating .  the sign had saved a lot of embarrassment .       it was obvious to king verence that even if every adult were put under arms the kingdom of lancre would still have a very small and insignificant army  and he   d therefore looked for other ways to put it on the military map .  shawn had come up with the idea of the lancrastrian army knife  containing a few essential tools and utensils for the soldier in the field  and research and development work had been going on for some months now .  one reason for the slow progress was that the king himself was taking an active interest in the country   s only defense project  and shawn was receiving little notes up to three times every day with further suggestions for improvement .  generally they were on the lines of     a device  possibly quite small  for finding things that are lost     or    a curiously shaped hook like thing of many uses .     shawn diplomatically added some of them but lost as many notes as he dared  lest he design the only pocket knife on wheels .       the leitmotif of the guild of barber surgeons      on the rare maps on the ramtops that existed  it was spelled   berwald .  but lancre people had never got the hang of accents and certainly didn   t agree with trying to balance two dots on another letter  where they   d only roll off and cause unnecessary punctuation .       lancre people considered that anything religious that wasn   t said in some ancient and incomprehensible speech probably wasn   t the genuine article .       this was because lancre people had a fresh if somewhat sideways approach to names  generally just picking a sound they liked .  sometimes there was a logic to it  but only by accident .  there   d be a chlamydia weaver toddling around today if her mother hadn   t suddenly decided that sally was easier to spell .       king verence was very keen that someone should compose a national anthem for lancre  possibly referring to its very nice trees  and had offered a small reward .  nanny ogg reasoned that it would be easy money because national anthems only ever have one verse or  rather  all have the same second verse  which goes    nur   hnur   mur   nur nur  hnur   nur   nur  hnur    at some length until everyone remembers the last line of the first verse and sings it as loudly as they can .       in a society that had progressed beyond the privy and the earth closet she would have said    pulling my chain .          the role of the lower intestine in the efforts to built a better nation is one that is often neglected by historians .       igor had two thumbs on his right hand .  if something was useful  he always said  you may as well add another .
