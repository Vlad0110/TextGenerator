muttered to himself     i knew it .  i   m sweating .     he paused  straightened up  wiped the perspiration from his brow with the back of his hand  then looked dourly at the moisture that covered it .     i hate sweating     he said to no one  throwing it out as a cosmic law .  and once again he felt annoyance with the universe for making something both essential and unpleasant .  one never perspired  unless one wished to  of course  in the city  where temperature and humidity were absolutely controlled and where it was never absolutely necessary for the body to perform in ways that made heat production greater than heat removal .  now that was civilized .  he looked out into the field  where a straggle of men and women were  more or less  in his charge .  they were mostly youngsters in their late teens  but included some middle aged people like himself .  they were hoeing inexpertly and doing a variety of other things that robots were designed to do  and could do much more efficiently had they not been ordered to stand aside and wait while the human beings stubbornly practiced .  there were clouds in the sky and the sun  at the moment  was going behind one of them .  he looked up uncertainly .  on the one hand  it meant the direct heat of the sun  and the sweating  would be cut down .  on the other hand  was there a chance of rain .  that was the trouble with the outside .  one teetered forever between unpleasant alternatives .  it always amazed baley that a relatively small cloud could cover the sun completely  darkening earth from horizon to horizon yet leaving most of the sky blue .  he stood beneath the leafy canopy of the tree  a kind of primitive wall and ceiling  with the solidity of the bark comforting to the touch  and looked again at the group  studying it .  once a week they were out there  whatever the weather .  they were gaining recruits  too .  they were definitely more in number than the stout hearted few who had started out .  the city government  if not an actual partner in the endeavor  was benign enough to raise no obstacles .  to the horizon on baley   s right  eastward  as one could tell by the position of the late afternoon sun  he could see the blunt  many fingered domes of the city  enclosing all that made life worthwhile .  he saw  as well  a small moving speck that was too far off to be made out clearly .  from its manner of motion and from indications too subtle to describe  baley was quite sure it was a robot  but that did not surprise him .  the earth   s surface  outside the cities  was the domain of robots  not of human beings  except for those few  like himself  who were dreaming of the stars .  automatically  his eyes turned back toward the hoeing star dreamers and went from one to the other .  he could identify and name each one .  all working  all learning how to endure the outside  and   he frowned and muttered in a low voice     where   s bentley .     and another voice  sounding behind with a somewhat breathless exuberance  said     here i am  dad .     baley whirled .     don   t do that  ben .        do what .        sneak up on me like that .  it   s hard enough trying to keep my equilibrium in the outside without my having to worry about surprises  too .        i wasn   t trying to surprise you .  it   s tough to make much noise walking on the grass .  one can   t help that .    bust don   t you think you ought to go in  dad .  you   ve been out two hours now and i think you   ve had enough .        why .  because i   m forty five and you   re a punk kid of nineteen .  you think you have to take care of your decrepit father  do you .     ben said     yes  i guess that   s it .  and a bit of good detective work on your part  too .  you cut right through to the nub .     ben smiled broadly .  his face was round  his eyes sparkling .  there was a lot of jessie in him  baley thought  a lot of his mother .  there was little trace of the length and solemnity of baley   s own face .  and yet ben had his father   s way of thinking .  he could at times furrow into a grave solemnity that made it quite clear that he was of perfectly legitimate origin .     i   m doing very well     said baley .     you are  dad .  you   re the best of us  considering         considering what .        your age  of course .  and i   m not forgetting that you   re the one who started this .  still  i saw you take cover under the tree and i thought  well  maybe the old man has had enough .        i   ll    old man    you     said baley .  the robot he had noted in the direction of the city was now close enough to be made out clearly  but baley dismissed it as unimportant .  he said     it makes sense to get under a tree once in a while when the sun   s too bright .  we   ve got to learn to use the advantages of the outside  as well as learning to bear its disadvantages .    and there   s the sun coming out from behind that cloud .        yes  it will do that .    well  then  don   t you want to go in .        i can stick it out .  once a week  i have an afternoon off and i spend it here .  that   s my privilege .  it goes with my c   rating .        it   s not a question of privilege  dad .  it   s a question of getting overtired .        i feel fine  i tell you .        sure .  and when you get home  you   ll go straight to bed and lie in the dark .        natural antidote to overbrightness .        and mom worries .        well  let her worry .  it will do her good .  besides  what   s the harm in being out here .  the worst part is i sweat  but i just have to get used to it .  i can   t run away from it .  when i started  i couldn   t even walk this far from the city without having to turn back  and you were the only one with me .  now look at how many we   ve got and how far i can come without trouble .  i can do plenty of work  too .  i can last another hour .  easy .    i tell you  ben  it would do your mother good to come out here herself .        who .  mom .  surely you jest .        some lest .  when the time comes to take off  i won   t be able to go along  because she won   t .        and you   ll be glad of it .  don   t kid yourself  dad .  it won   t be for quite a while  and if you   re not too old now  you   ll be too old then .  it   s going to be a game for young people .        you know     said baley  half balling his fist     you are such a wise guy with your    young people .     have you ever been off earth .  have any of those people in the field been off earth .  i have .  two years ago .  that was before i had any of this acclimatization  and i survived .        i know  dad  but that was briefly  and in the line of duty  and you were taken care of in a going society .  it   s not the same .        it was the same     said baley stubbornly  knowing in his heart that it wasn   t .     and it won   t take us so long to be able to leave .  if i could get permission to go to aurora  we could get this act off the ground .        forget it .  it   s not going to happen that easily .        we   ve got to try .  the government won   t let us go without aurora giving us the go ahead .  it   s the largest and strongest of the spacer worlds and what it says         goes .  i know .  we   ve all talked this over a million times .  but you don   t have to go there to get permission .  there are such things as hyper relays .  you can talk to them from here .  i   ve said that any number of times before .        it   s not the same .  we   ll need face to face contact  and i   ve said that any number of times before .        in any case     said ben     we   re not ready yet .        we   re not ready because earth won   t give us the ships .  the spacers will  together with the necessary technical help .        such faith .  why should the spacers do it .  when did they start feeling kindly toward us short lived earthpeople .        if i could talk to them      ben laughed .     come on  dad .  you just want to go to aurora to see that woman again .     baley frowned and his eyebrows beetled over his deep set eyes .     woman .  jehoshaphat  ben  what are you talking about .        now  dad  just between us  and not a word to mom  what did happen with that woman on solaria .  i   m old enough .  you can tell me .        what woman on solaria .        how can you look at me and deny any knowledge of the woman everyone on earth saw in the hyperwave dramatization .  gladia delmarre .  that woman .        nothing happened .  that hyperwave thing was nonsense .  i   ve told you that a thousand times .  she didn   t look that way .  i didn   t look that way .  it was all made up and you know it was produced over my protests  just because the government thought it would put earth in a good light with the spacers .    and you make sure you don   t imply anything different to your mother .        wouldn   t dream of it .  still  this gladia went to aurora and you keep wanting to go there  too .        are you trying to tell me that you honestly think the reason i want to go to aurora   oh  jehoshaphat .     his son   s eyebrows raised     what   s the matter .        the robot .  that   s r .  geronimo .        who .        one of our department messenger robots .  and it   s out here .  i   m off time and i deliberately left my receiver at home because i didn   t want them to get at me .  that   s my c   privilege and yet they send for me by robot .        how do you know it   s coming to you  dad .        by very clever deduction .  one  there   s no one else here who has any connection with the police department  and two  that miserable thing is heading right toward me .  from that i deduce that it wants me .  i should get on the other side of the tree and stay there .        it   s not a wall  dad .  the robot can walk around the tree .     and the robot called out     master baley  i have a message for you .  you are wanted at headquarters .     the robot stopped  waited  then said again     master baley  i have a message for you .  you are wanted at headquarters .        i hear and understand     baley said tonelessly .  he had to say that or the robot would have continued to repeat .  baley frowned slightly as he studied the robot .  it was a new model  a little more humaniform than the older models were .  it had been uncrated and activated only a month before and with some degree of fanfare .  the government was always trying for something  anything  that might produce more acceptance of robots .  it had a grayish surface with a dull finish and a somewhat resilient touch  perhaps like soft leather  .  the facial expression  while largely changeless  was not quite as idiotic as that of most robots .  it was  though  in actual fact  quite as idiotic  mentally  as all the rest .  for a moment  baley thought of r .  daneel olivaw  the spacer robot who had been on two assignments with him  one on earth and one on solaria  and whom he had last encountered when daneel had consulted him in the mirror image case .  daneel was a robot who was so human that baley could treat him as a friend and could still miss him  even now .  if all robots were like that   baley said     this is my day off  boy .  there is no necessity for me to go to headquarters .     r .  geronimo paused .  there was a trifling vibration in his hands .  baley noticed that and was quite aware that it meant a certain amount of conflict in the robot   s positronic pathways .  they had to obey human beings  but it was quite common for two human beings to want two different types of obedience .  the robot made a choice .  it said     it is your day off  master .    you are wanted at headquarters .     ben said uneasily     if they want you  dad      baley shrugged .     don   t be fooled  ben .  if they really wanted me badly  they   d have sent an enclosed car and probably used a human volunteer  instead of ordering a robot to do the walking  and irritate me with one of its messages .     ben shook his head .     i don   t think so  dad .  they wouldn   t know where you were or how long it would take to find you .  i don   t think they would want to send a human being on an uncertain search .        yes .  well  let   s see how strong the order is .    r .  geronimo  go back to headquarters and tell them i   ll be at work at      .     then sharply     go back .  that   s an order .     the robot hesitated perceptibly  then turned  moved away  turned again  made an attempt to come back toward baley  and finally remained in one spot  its whole body vibrating .  baley recognized it for what it was and muttered to ben     i may have to go .  jehoshaphat .     what was troubling the robot was what the roboticists called an equipotential of contradiction on the second level .  obedience was the second law and r .  geronimo was now suffering from two roughly equal and contradictory orders .  robot block was what the general population called it or  more frequently  roblock for short .  slowly  the robot turned .  its original order was the stronger  but not by much  so that its voice was slurred .     master  i was told you might say that .  if so i was to say      it paused  then added hoarsely     i was to say  if you are alone .     baley nodded curtly to his son and ben didn   t wait .  he knew when his father was dad and when he was a policeman .  ben retreated hastily .  for a moment  baley played irritably with the notion of strengthening his own order and making the roblock more nearly complete  but that would surely cause the kind of damage that would require positronic analysis and reprogramming .  the expense of that would be taken out of his salary and it might easily amount to a year   s pay .  he said     i withdraw my order .  what were you told to say .     r .  geronimo   s voice at once cleared .     i was told to say that you are wanted in connection with aurora .     baley turned toward ben and called out     give them another half hour and then say i want them back in .  i   ve got to leave now .     and as he walked off with long strides  he said petulantly to the robot     why couldn   t they tell you to say that at once .  and why can   t they program you to use a car so that i wouldn   t have to walk .     he knew very well why that wasn   t done .  any accident involving a robot driven car would set off another antirobot riot .  he did not slacken his pace .  there were two kilometers to walk before they even got to the city wall and  thereafter  they would have to reach headquarters through heavy traffic .  aurora .  what kind of crisis was brewing now .     .   it took half an hour for baley to reach the entranceway into the city and he stiffened himself for what he suspected ahead .  perhaps  perhaps  it wouldn   t happen this time .  he reached the dividing plane between outside and city  the wall that marked off chaos from civilization .  he placed his hand over the signal patch and an opening appeared .  as usual  he didn   t wait for the opening to be completed  but slipped in as soon as it was wide enough .  r .  geronimo followed .  the police sentry on duty looked startled  as he always did when someone came in from outside .  each time there was the same look of disbelief  the same coming to attention  the same sudden hand upon the blaster  the same frown of uncertainty .  baley presented his identity card with a scowl and the sentry saluted .  the door closed behind him  and it happened .  baley was inside the city .  the walls closed around him and the city became the universe .  he was again immersed in the endless  eternal hum and odor of people and machinery that would soon fade below the threshold of consciousness  in the soft  indirect artificial light that was nothing at all like the partial and varying glare of the outside  with its green and brown and blue and white and its interruptions of red and yellow .  here there was no erratic wind  no heat  no cold  no threat of rain  here there was instead the quiet permanence of unfelt air currents that kept everything fresh .  here was a designed combination of temperature and humidity so perfectly adjusted to humans it remained unsensed .  baley felt his breath drawn in tremulously and he gladdened in the realization that he was home and safe with the known and knowable .  that was what always happened .  again he had accepted the city as the womb and moved back into it with glad relief .  he knew that such a womb was something from which humanity must emerge and be born .  why did he always sink back this way .  and would that always be .  would it really be that  though he might lead countless numbers out of the city and off the earth and out to the stars  he would not  in the end  be able to go himself .  would he always feel at home only in the city .  he clenched his teeth  but there was no use thinking about it .  he said to the robot     were you brought to this point by car  boy .        yes  master .        where is it now .        i do not know  master .     baley turned to the sentry .     officer  this robot was brought to this spot two hours ago .  what has happened to the car that brought him .        sir  i went on duty less than an hour ago .     actually  it was foolish to ask .  those in the car did not know how long it would take the robot to find him  so they would not wait .  baley had a brief impulse to call in  but they would tell him to take the expressway  it would be quicker .  the only reason he hesitated was the presence of r .  geronimo .  he didn   t want its company on the expressway and yet he could not expect the robot to make its way back to headquarters through hostile crowds .  not that he had a choice .  undoubtedly  the commissioner was not eager to make this easy for him .  he would be annoyed at not having had him on call  free time or not .  baley said     this way  boy .     the city covered over five thousand square kilometers and contained over four hundred kilometers of expressway  plus hundreds of kilometers of feederway  to serve its well over twenty million people .  the intricate net of movement existed on eight levels and there were hundreds of interchanges of varying degrees of complexity .  as a plainclothesman  baley was    expected to know them all   and he did .  put him down blindfolded in any corner of the city  whip off the blindfold  and he could make his way flawlessly to any other designated portion .  there was no question then but that he knew how to get to headquarters .  there were eight reasonable routes he could follow  however  and for a moment he hesitated over which might be least crowded at this time .  only for a moment .  then he decided and said     come with me  boy .     the robot followed docilely at his heels .  they swung onto a passing feeder and baley seized one of the vertical poles  white  warm  and textured to give a good grip .  baley did not want to sit down  they would not be on for long .  the robot had waited for baley   s quick gesture before placing its hand upon the same pole .  it might as well have remained standing without a grip  it would not have been difficult to maintain balance  but baley wanted to take no chance of being separated .  he was responsible for the robot and did not wish to risk being asked to replace the financial loss to the city should anything happen to b .  geronimo .  the feeder had a few other people on board and the eyes of each turned curiously  and inevitably  to the robot .  one by one  baley caught those glances .  baley had the look of one used to authority and the eyes he caught turned uneasily away .  baley gestured again as he swung off the feeder .  it had reached the strips now and was moving at the same speed as the nearest strip  so that there was no necessity for it to slow down .  baley stepped onto that nearest strip and felt the whipping of air once they were no longer protected by plastic enclosure .  he leaned into the wind with the ease of long practice  lifting one arm to break the force at eye level .  he ran the strips downward to the intersection with the expressway and then began the run upward to the speed strip that bordered the expressway .  he heard the teenage cry of    robot .      he had been a teenager himself once  and knew exactly what would happen .  a group of them  two or three or half a dozen  would swarm up or down the strips and somehow the robot would be tripped and would go clanging down .  then  if it ever came before a magistrate  any teenager taken into custody would claim the robot had collided with him and was a menace on the strips  and would undoubtedly be let go .  the robot could neither defend itself in the first instance  nor testify in the second .  baley moved rapidly and was between the first of the teenagers and the robot .  he sidestepped onto a faster strip  brought his arm higher  as though to adjust to the increase in wind speed  and somehow the young man was nudged off course and onto a slower strip for which he was not prepared .  he called out wildly     hey .     as he went sprawling .  the others stopped  assessed the situation quickly  and veered away .  baley said     onto the expressway  boy .     the robot hesitated briefly .  robots were not allowed  unaccompanied  on the expressway .  baley   s order had been a firm one  however  and it moved aboard .  baley followed  which relieved the pressure on the robot .  baley moved brusquely through the crowd of standees  forcing r .  geronimo ahead of him  making his way up to the less crowded upper level .  he held on to a pole and kept one foot firmly on the robot   s  again glaring down all eye contact .  fifteen and a half kilometers brought him to the close point for the police headquarters and he was off .  b .  geronimo came off with him .  it hadn   t been touched  not a scuff .  baley delivered it at the door and accepted a receipt .  he carefully checked the date  the time  and the robot   s serial number  then placed the receipt in his wallet .  before the day was over  he would check and make certain that the transaction had been computer registered .  now he was going to see the commissioner  and he knew the commissioner .  any failing on baley   s part would be suitable cause for demotion .  he was a harsh man  the commissioner .  he considered baley   s past triumphs a personal offense .     .   the commissioner was wilson roth .  he had held the post for two and a half years  since julius enderby had resigned once the furor roused by the murder of a spacer had subsided and the resignation could be safely offered .  baley had never quite reconciled himself to the change .  julius  with all his shortcomings  had been a friend as well as a superior  roth was merely a superior .  he was not even city bred .  not this city .  he had been brought in from outside .  roth was neither unusually tall nor unusually fat .  his head was large  though  and seemed to be set on a neck that slanted slightly forward from his torso .  it made him appear heavy  heavy bodied and heavy headed .  he even had heavy lids half obscuring his eyes .  anyone would think him sleepy  but he never missed anything .  baley had found that out very soon after roth had taken over the office .  he was under no illusion that roth liked him .  he was under less illusion that he liked roth .  roth did not sound petulant  he never did  but his words did not exude pleasure  either .     baley  why is it so hard to find you .     he said .  baley said in a carefully respectful voice     it is my afternoon off  commissioner .        yes  your c   privilege .  you   ve heard of a waver  haven   t you .  something that receives official messages .  you are subject to recall  even on your off time .        i know that very well  commissioner  but there are no longer any regulations concerning the wearing of a waver .  we can be reached without one .        inside the city  yes  but you were outside  or am i mistaken .        you are not mistaken  commissioner .  i was outside .  the regulations do not state that  in such a case  i am to wear a waver .        you hide behind the letter of the statute  do you .        yes  commissioner     said baley calmly .  the commissioner rose  a powerful and vaguely threatening man  and sat on the desk .  the window to the outside  which enderby had installed  had long been closed off and painted over .  in the closed in room  warmer and more comfortable for that   the commissioner seemed the larger .  he said  without raising his voice     you rely  baley  on earth   s gratitude  i think .        i rely on doing my job  commissioner  as best i can and in accord with the regulations .        and on earth   s gratitude when you bend the spirit of those regulations .     baley said nothing to that .  the commissioner said     you are considered as having done well in the sarton murder case three years ago .        thank you  commissioner     said baley .     the dismantling of spacetown was a consequence  i believe .        it was  and that was something applauded by all earth .  you are also considered as having done well on solaria two years ago and  before you remind me  the result was a revision in the terms of the trade treaties with the spacer worlds  to the considerable advantage of earth .        i believe that is on record  sir .        and you are very much the hero as a result .        i make no such claim .        you have received two promotions  one in the aftermath of each affair .  there has even been a hyperwave drama based on the events on solaria .        which was produced without my permission and against my will  commissioner .        which nevertheless made you a kind of hero .     baley shrugged .  the commissioner  having waited for a spoken comment for a few seconds  went on     but you have done nothing of importance in nearly two years .        it is natural for earth to ask what i have done for it lately .        exactly .  it probably does ask .  it knows that you are a leader in this new fad of venturing outside  in fiddling with the soil  and in pretending to be a robot .        it is permitted .        not all that is permitted is admired .  it is possible that more people think of you as peculiar than as heroic .        that is  perhaps  in accord with my own opinion of myself     said baley .     the public has a notoriously short memory .  the heroic is vanishing rapidly behind the peculiar in your case  so that if you make a mistake you will be in serious trouble .  the reputation you rely on         with respect  commissioner  i do not rely on it .        the reputation the police department feels you rely on will not save you and i will not be able to save you .     the shadow of a smile seemed to pass for one moment over baley   s dour features .     i would not want you  commissioner  to risk your position in a wild attempt to save me .     the commissioner shrugged and produced a smile precisely as shadowy and fleeting .     you need not worry about that .        then why are you telling me all this  commissioner .        to warn you .  i am not trying to destroy you  you understand  so i am warning you once .  you are going to be involved in a very delicate matter  in which you may easily make a mistake  and i am warning you that you must not make one .     here his face relaxed into an unmistakable smile .  baley did not respond to the smile .  he said     can you tell me what the very delicate matter is .        i do not know .        does it involve aurora .        r .  geronimo was instructed to tell you that it did  if it had to  but i know nothing about it .        then how can you tell  commissioner  that it is a very delicate matter .        come  baley  you are an investigator of mysteries .  what brings a member of the terrestrial department of justice to the city  when you might easily have been asked to go to washington  as you did two years ago in connection with the solaria incident .  and what makes the person from justice frown and seem ill tempered and grow impatient at the fact that you were not reached instantly .  your decision to make yourself unavailable was a mistake  one that was in no way my responsibility .  it is perhaps not fatal in itself  but you are off on the wrong foot  i believe .        you are delaying me further  however     said baley  frowning .     not really .  the official from justice is having some light refreshment  you know the perks that the terries allow themselves .  we will be joined when that is done .  the news of your arrival has been transmitted  so just continue to wait  as i am doing .     baley waited .  he had known  at the time  that the hyperwave drama  forced upon him against his will  however it might have helped earth   s position  had ruined him in the department .  it had cast him in three dimensional relief against the two dimensional flatness of the organization and had made him a marked man .  he had risen to higher rank and greater privileges  but that  too  had increased department hostility against him .  and the higher he rose  the more easily he would shatter in case of a fall .  if he made a mistake      .   the official from justice entered  looked about casually  walked to the other side of roth   s desk  and took the seat .  as highest classified individual  the official behaved properly .  roth calmly took a secondary seat .  baley remained standing  laboring to keep his face unsurprised .  roth might have warned him  but he had not .  he had clearly chosen his words deliberately  in order to give no sign .  the official was a woman .  there was no reason for this not to be .  any official might be a woman .  the secretary general might be a woman .  there were women on the police force  even a woman with the rank of captain .  it was just that  without warning  one didn   t expect it in any given case .  there were times in history when women entered administrative posts in considerable numbers .  baley knew that  he knew history well .  but this wasn   t one of those times .  she was quite tall and sat stiffly upright in the chair .  her uniform was not very different from that of a man  nor was her hair styling or facial adornment .  what gave her sex away immediately were her breasts  the prominence of which she made no attempt to hide .  she was fortyish  her facial features regular and cleanly chiseled .  she had middle aged attractively  with  as yet  no visible gray in her dark hair .  she said     you are plainclothesman elijah baley  classification c   .     it was a statement  not a question .     yes  ma   am     baley answered  nevertheless .     i am undersecretary lavinia demachek .  you don   t look very much as you did in that hyperwave drama concerning you .     baley had been told that often .     they couldn   t very well portray me as i am and collect much of an audience  ma   am     said baley dryly .     i   m not sure of that .  you look stronger than the baby faced actor they used .     baley hesitated a second or so and decided to take the chance  or perhaps felt he couldn   t resist taking it .  solemnly  he said     you have a cultivated taste  ma   am .     she laughed and baley let out his breath very gently .  she said     i like to think i have .    now what do you mean by keeping me waiting .        i was not informed you would come  ma   am  and it was off time for me .        which you spent outside  i understand .        yes  ma   am .        you are one of those cranks  as i would say were my taste not a cultivated one .  let me ask  instead  if you are one of those enthusiasts .        yes  ma   am .        you expect to emigrate some day and found new worlds in the wildernesses of the galaxy .        perhaps not i  ma   am .  i may prove to be too old  but         how old are you .        forty five  ma   am .        well  you look it .  i am forty five also  as it happens .        you do not look it  ma   am .        older or younger .     she broke into laughter again  then said     but let   s not play games .  do you imply i am too old to be a pioneer .        no one can be a pioneer in our society  without training outside .  the training works best with the young .  my son  i hope  will someday stand on another world .        indeed .  you know  of course  that the galaxy belongs to the spacer worlds .        there are only fifty of them  ma   am .  there are millions of worlds in the galaxy that are habitable  or can be made habitable  and that probably do not possess indigenous intelligent life .        yes  but not one ship can leave earth without spacer permission .     that might be granted  ma   am .        i do not share your optimism  mr .  baley .        i have spoken to spacers who         i know you have     said demachek .     my superior is albert minnim  who  two years ago  sent you to solaria .     she permitted herself a small curve of the lips .     an actor portrayed him in a bit role on that hyperwave drama  one that resembled him closely  as i recall .  he was not pleased  as i also recall .     baley changed the subject .     i asked undersecretary mm mm      he has been promoted  you know .     baley thoroughly understood the importance of grades in classification .     his new title  ma   am .        vice secretary .        thank you .  i asked vice secretary minnim to request permission for me to visit aurora to deal with this subject .        when .        not very long after my return from solaria .  i have renewed the request twice since .        but have not received a favorable reply .        no  ma   am .        are you surprised .        i am disappointed  ma   am .        no point in that .     she leaned back a trifle in the chair .     our relationship with the spacer worlds is very touchy .  you may feel that your two feats of detection have eased the situation  and so they have .  that awful hyperwave drama has also helped .  the total easing  however  has been this much     she placed her thumb and forefinger close together     out of this much     and she spread her hands far apart    under those circumstances     she went on     we could scarcely take the risk of sending you to aurora  the leading spacer world  and having you perhaps do something that could create interstellar tension .     baley   s eyes met hers .     i have been on solaria and have done no harm .  on the contrary         yes  i know  but you were there at spacer request  which is parsecs distant from being there at our request .  you cannot fail to see that .     baley was silent .  she made a soft snorting sound of nonsurprise and said     the situation has grown worse since your requests were placed with  and very correctly ignored by  the vice secretary .  it has grown particularly worse in the last month .        is that the reason for this conference  ma   am .        do you grow impatient  sir .     she addressed him sardonically in the to a superior intonation .     do you direct me to come to the point .        no  ma   am .        certainly you do .  and why not .  i grow tedious .  let me approach the point by asking if you know dr .  han fastolfe .     baley said carefully     i met him once  nearly three years ago  in what was then spacetown .        you liked him  i believe .        he was friendly  for a spacer .     she made another soft snorting sound .     i imagine so .  are you aware that he has been an important political power on aurora over the last two years .        i had heard he was in the government from a  a partner i once had .        from r .  daneel olivaw  your spacer robot friend .        my ex partner  ma   am .        on the occasion when you solved a small problem concerning two mathematicians on board a spacer ship .     baley nodded .     yes  ma   am .        we keep informed  you see .  dr .  han fastolfe has been  more or less  the guiding light of the auroran government for two years  an important figure in their world legislature  and he is even spoken of as a possible future chairman .    the chairman  you understand  is the closest thing to a chief executive that the aurorans have .     baley said     yes  ma   am     and wondered when she would get to the very delicate matter of which the commissioner had spoken .  demachek seemed in no hurry .  she said     fastolfe is a  moderate .  that   s what he calls himself .  he feels aurora  and the spacer worlds generally  have gone too far in their direction  as you  perhaps  feel that we on earth have gone too far in ours .  he wishes to step backward to less robotry  to a more rapid turnover of generations  and to alliance and friendship with earth .  naturally  we support him  but very quietly .  if we were too demonstrative in our affection  that might well be the kiss of death for him .     baley said     i believe he would support earth   s exploration and settlement of other worlds .        i believe so  too .  i am of the opinion he said as much to you .        yes  ma   am  when we met .     demachek steepled her hands and put the tips of her fingers to her chin .     do you think he represents public opinion on the spacer worlds .        i don   t know  ma   am .        i   m afraid he does not .  those who are with him are lukewarm .  those who are against him are an ardent legion .  it is only his political skills and his personal warmth that have kept him as close to the seats of power as he is .  his greatest weakness  of course  is his sympathy for earth .  that is constantly used against him and it influences many who would share his views in every other respect .  if you were sent to aurora  any mistake you made would help strengthen anti earth feeling and would therefore weaken him  possibly fatally .  earth simply cannot take that risk .     baley muttered     i see .        fastolfe is willing to take the risk .  it was he who arranged to have you sent to solaria at a time when his political power was barely beginning and when he was very vulnerable .  but then  he has only his personal power to lose  whereas we must be concerned with the welfare of over eight billion earthpeople .  that is what makes the present political situation almost unbearably delicate .     she paused and  finally  baley was forced to ask the question .     what is the situation that you are referring to  ma   am .        it seems     said demachek     that fastolfe has become implicated in a serious and unprecedented scandal .  if he is clumsy  the chances are that he will undergo political destruction in a matter of weeks .  if he is superhumanly clever  perhaps he will hold out for some months .  a little sooner  a little later  he could be destroyed as a political force on aurora  and that would be a real disaster for earth  you see .        may i ask what he is accused of .  corruption .  treason .        nothing that small .  his personal integrity is  in any case  unquestioned even by his enemies .        a crime of passion  then .  murder .        not quite murder .        i don   t understand  ma   am .        there are human beings on aurora  mr .  baley .  and there are robots  too  most of them something like ours  not very much more advanced in most cases .  however  there are a few humaniform robots  robots so humaniform that they can be taken for human .     baley nodded .     i know that very well .        i suppose that destroying a humaniform robot is not exactly murder in the strict sense of the word .     baley leaned forward  eyes widening .  he shouted     jehoshaphat  woman .  stop playing games .  are you telling me that dr .  fastolfe has killed r .  daneel .     roth leaped to his feet and seemed about to advance on baley  but undersecretary demachek waved him back .  she seemed unruffled .  she said     under the circumstances  i excuse your disrespect  baley .  no  r .  daneel has not been killed .  he is not the only humaniform robot on aurora .  another such robot  not r .  daneel  has been killed  if you wish to use the term loosely .  to be more precise  its mind has been totally destroyed  it was placed into permanent and irreversible roblock .     baley said     and they say that dr .  fastolfe did it .        his enemies are saying so .  the extremists  who wish only spacers to spread through the galaxy and who wish earthpeople to vanish from the universe  are saying so .  if these extremists can maneuver another election within the next few weeks  they will surely gain total control of the government  with incalculable results .        why is this roblock so important politically .  i don   t understand .        i am not myself certain     said demachek .     i do not pretend to understand auroran politics .  i gather that the humaniforms were in some way involved with the extremist plans and that the destruction has infuriated them .     she wrinkled her nose .     i find their politics very confusing and i will only mislead you if i try to interpret it .     baley labored to control himself under the undersecretary   s level stare .  he said in a low voice     why am i here .        because of fastolfe .  once before you went out into space in order to solve a murder and succeeded .  fastolfe wants you to try again .  you are to go to aurora and discover who was responsible for the roblock .  he feels that to be his only chance of turning back the extremists .        i am not a roboticist .  i know nothing about aurora         you knew nothing about solaria  either  yet you managed .  the point is  baley  we are as eager to find out what really happened as fastolfe is .  we don   t want him destroyed .  if he is  earth will be subject to a kind of hostility from these spacer extremists that will probably be greater than anything we have yet experienced .  we don   t want that to happen .        i can   t take on this responsibility  ma   am .  the task is         next to impossible .  we know that  but we have no choice .  fastolfe insists  and behind him  for the moment  stands the auroran government .  if you refuse to go or if we refuse to let you go  we will have to face the auroran fury .  if you do go and are successful  we   ll be saved and you will be suitably rewarded .        and if i go  and fail .        we will do our best to see to it that the blame will be yours and not earth   s .        the skins of officialdom will be saved  in other words .     demachek said     a kinder way of putting it is that you will be thrown to the wolves in the hope that earth will not suffer too badly .  one man is not a bad price to pay for our planet .        it seems to me that  since i am sure to fail  i might as well not go .        you know better than that     said demachek softly .     aurora has asked for you and you cannot refuse .    and why should you want to refuse .  you   ve been trying to go to aurora for two years and you   ve been bitter over your failure to get our permission .        i   ve wanted to go in peace to arrange for help in the settlement of other worlds  not to         you might still try to get their help for your dream of settling other worlds  baley .  after all  suppose you do succeed .  it   s possible  after all .  in that case  fastolfe will be much beholden to you and he may do far more for you than he ever would have otherwise .  and we ourselves will be sufficiently grateful to you to help .  isn   t that worth a risk  even a large one .  however small your chances of success are if you go  those chances are zero if you do not go .  think of that  baley  but please  not too long .     baley   s lips tightened and  finally  realizing there was no alternative  he said     how much time do i have to      and demachek said calmly     come .  haven   t i been explaining that we have no choice  and no time  either .  you leave     she looked at the timeband on her wrist     in just under six hours .        .   the spaceport was at the eastern outskirts of the city in an all but deserted sector that was  strictly speaking  outside .  this was palliated by the fact that the ticket offices and the waiting rooms were actually in the city and that the approach to the ship itself was by vehicle through a covered path .  by tradition  all takeoffs were at night  so that a pall of darkness further deadened the effect of outside .  the spaceport was not very busy  considering the populous character of earth .  earthmen very rarely left the planet and the traffic consisted entirely of commercial activity organized by robots and spacers .  elijah baley  waiting for the ship to be ready for boarding  felt already cut off from earth .  bentley sat with him and there was a glum silence between the two .  finally  ben said     i didn   t think mom would want to come .     baley nodded .     i didn   t think so  either .  i remember how she was when i went to solaria .  this is no different .        did you manage to calm her down .        i did what i could  ben .  she thinks i   m bound to be in a space crash or that the spacers will kill me once i   m on aurora .        you got back from solaria .        that just makes her the less eager to risk me a second time .  she assumes the luck will run out .  however  she   ll manage .   you rally round  ben .  spend some time with her and  whatever you do  don   t talk about heading out to settle a new planet .  that   s what really bothers her  you know .  she feels you   ll be leaving her one of these years .  she knows she won   t be able to go and so she   ll never see you again .        she may not     said ben .     that   s the way it might work out .        you can face that easily  maybe  but she can   t  so just don   t discuss it while i   m gone .  all right .        all right .    i think she   s a little upset about gladia .     baley looked up sharply .     have you been         i haven   t said a word .  but she saw that hyperwave thing  too  you know  and she knows gladia   s on aurora .        what of it .  it   s a big planet .  do you think gladia delmarre will be waiting at the spaceport for me .    jehoshaphat  ben  doesn   t your mother know that hyperwave axle grease was nine tenths fiction .     ben changed the subject with a tangible effort .     it seems funny  you sitting here with no luggage of any kind .        i   m sitting here with too much .  i   ve got the clothes i   m wearing  don   t i .  they   ll get rid of those as soon as i   m on board .  off they go  to be chemically treated .  then dumped into space .  after that  they   ll give me a totally new wardrobe  after i have been personally fumigated and cleaned and polished  inside and out .  i   ve been through that once before .     again silence and then ben said     you know  dad      and stopped suddenly .  he tried again     you know dad      and did no better .  baley looked at him steadily .     what are you trying to say  ben .        dad  i feel like an awful jackass saying this  but i think i   d better .  you   re not the hero type .  even i never thought you were .  you   re a nice guy and the best father there could be  but not the hero type .     baley grunted .     still     said ben     when you stop to think of it  it was you who got spacetown off the map  it was you who got aurora on our side  it was you who started this whole project of settling other worlds .  dad  you   ve done more for earth than everyone in the government put together .  so why aren   t you appreciated more .     baley said     because i   m not the hero type and because this stupid hyperwave drama was foisted on me .  it has made an enemy of every man in the department  it   s unsettled your mother  and it   s given me a reputation i can   t live up to .     the light flashed on his wrist caller and he stood up .     i   ve got to go now  ben .        i know .  but what i want to say  dad  is that   appreciate you .  and this time when you come back  you   ll get that from everybody and not just from me .     baley felt himself melting .  he nodded rapidly  put a hand on his son   s shoulder  and muttered     thanks .  take care of yourself   and your mother  while i   m gone .     he walked away  not looking back .  he had told ben that he was going to aurora to discuss the settlement project .  if that were so  he might come back in triumph .  as it was   he thought  i   ll come back in disgrace  if i come back at all .     daneel    .   it was baley   s third time on a spaceship and the passage of two years had in no way dimmed his memory of the first two times .  he knew exactly what to expect .  there would be the isolation  the fact that no one would see him or have anything to do with him  with the exception  perhaps  of a robot .  there would be the constant medical treatment  the fumigation and sterilization .   no other way of putting it .   there would be the attempt to make him fit to approach the disease conscious spacers who thought of earth people as walking bags of multifarious infections .  there would be differences  too  however .  he would not  this time  be quite so afraid of the process .  surely the feeling of loss at being out of the womb would be less dreadful .  he would be prepared for the wider surroundings .  this time  he told himself boldly  but with a small knot in his stomach  for all that   he might even be able to insist on being given a view of space .  would it look different from photographs of the night sky as seen from outside .  he wondered .  he remembered his first view of a planetarium dome  safely within the city  of course  .  it had given him no sensation of being outside  no discomfort at all .  then there were the two times  no  three  that he had been in the open at night and saw the real stars in the real dome of the sky .  that had been far less impressive than the planetarium dome had been  but there had been a cool wind each time and a feeling of distance  which made it more frightening than the dome  but less frightening than daytime  for the darkness was a comforting wall about him .  would  then  the sight of the stars through a spaceship viewing window seem more like a planetarium or more like earth   s night sky .  or would it be a different sensation altogether .  he concentrated on that  as though to wash out the thought of leaving jessie  ben  and the city .  with nothing less than bravado  he refused the car and insisted on walking the short distance from the gate to the ship in the company of the robot who had come for him .  it was just a roofed over arcade  after all .  the passage was slightly curved and he looked back while he could still see ben at the other end .  he lifted his hand casually  as though he were taking the expressway to trenton  and ben waved both arms wildly  holding up the first two fingers of each hand outspread in the ancient symbol of victory .  victory .  a useless gesture  baley was certain .  he switched to another thought that might serve to fill and occupy him .  what would it be like to board a spaceship by day  with the sun shining brightly on its metal and with himself and the others who were boarding all exposed to the outside .  how would it feel to be entirely aware of a tiny cylindrical world  one that would detach itself from the infinitely larger world to which it was temporarily attached and that would then lose itself in an outside infinitely larger than any outside on earth  until after an endless stretch of nothingness it would find another   he held himself grimly to a steady walk  letting no change in expression show  or so he thought  at least .  the robot at his side  however  brought him to a halt .     are you ill  sir .      not    master     merely    sir .     it was an auroran robot .      i   m all right  boy     said baley hoarsely .     move on .     he kept his eyes turned to the ground and did not lift them again till the ship itself was towering above him .  an auroran ship .  he was sure of that .  outlined by a warm spotlight  it soared taller  more gracefully  and yet more powerfully than the solarian ships had .  baley moved inside and the comparison remained in favor of aurora .  his room was larger than the ones two years before had been  more luxurious  more comfortable .  he knew exactly what was coming and removed all his clothes without hesitation .   perhaps they would be disintegrated by plasma torch .  certainly  he would not get them back on returning to earth  if he returned .  he hadn   t the first time .   he would receive no other clothes till he had been thoroughly bathed  examined  dosed  and injected .  he almost welcomed the humiliating procedures imposed on him .  after all  it served to keep his mind off what was taking place .  he was scarcely aware of the initial acceleration and scarcely had time to think of the moment during which he left earth and entered space .  when he was finally dressed again  he surveyed the results unhappily in a mirror .  the material  whatever it was  was smooth and reflective and shifted color with any change in angle .  the trouser legs hugged his ankles and were  in turn  covered by the tops of shoes that molded themselves softly to his feet .  the sleeves of his blouse hugged his wrists and his hands were covered by thin  transparent gloves .  the top of the blouse covered his neck and an attached hood could  if desired  cover his head .  he was being so covered  not for his own comfort  he knew  but to reduce his danger to the spacers .  he thought  as he looked at the outfit  that he should feel uncomfortably enclosed  uncomfortably hot  uncomfortably damp .  but he did not .  he wasn   t  to his enormous relief  even sweating .  he made the reasonable deduction .  he said to the robot that had walked him to the ship and was still with him     boy  are these clothes temperature controlled .     the robot said     indeed they are  sir .  it is all weather clothing and is considered very desirable .  it is also exceedingly expensive .  few on aurora are in a position to wear it .        that so .  jehoshaphat .     he stared at the robot .  it seemed a fairly primitive model  not very much different from earth models  in fact .  still  there was a certain subtlety of expression that earth models lacked .  it could change expression in a limited way  for instance .  it had smiled very slightly when it indicated that baley had been given that which few on aurora could afford .  the structure of its body resembled metal and yet had the look of something woven  something shifting slightly with movement  something with colors that matched and contrasted pleasingly .  in short  unless one looked very closely and steadily  the robot  though definitely nonhumaniform  seemed to be wearing clothing .  baley said     what ought i to call you  boy .        i am giskard  sir .        r .  giskard .        if you wish  sir .        do you have a library on this ship .        yes  sir .        can you get me book films on aurora .        what kind  sir .        histories  political science  geographies  anything that will let me know about the planet .        yes  sir .        and a viewer .        yes  sir .     the robot left through the double door and baley nodded grimly to himself .  on his trip to solaria  it had never occurred to him to spend the useless time crossing space in learning something useful .  he had come along a bit in the last two years .  he tried the door the robot had just passed through .  it was locked and utterly without give .  he would have been enormously surprised at anything else .  he investigated the room .  there was a hyperwave screen .  he handled the controls idly  received a blast of music  managed to lower the volume eventually  and listened with disapproval .  tinny and discordant .  the instruments of the orchestra seemed vaguely distorted .  he touched other contacts and finally managed to change the view .  what he saw was a space soccer game that was played  obviously  under conditions of zero gravity .  the ball flew in straight lines and the players  too many of them on each side  with fins on backs  elbows  and knees that must serve to control movement  soared in graceful sweeps .  the unusual movements made baley feel dizzy .  he leaned forward and had just found and used the off switch when he heard the door open behind him .  he turned and  because he thoroughly expected to see r .  giskard  he was aware at first only of someone who was not r .  giskard .  it took a blink or two to realize that he saw a thoroughly human shape  with a broad  high cheekboned face and with short  bronze hair lying flatly backward  someone dressed in clothing with a conservative cut and color scheme .     jehoshaphat .     said baley in a nearly strangled voice .     partner elijah     said the other  stepping forward  a small  grave smile on his face .     daneel .     cried baley  throwing his arms around the robot and hugging tightly .     daneel .        .   baley continued to hold daneel  the one unexpected familiar object on the ship  the one strong link to the past .  he clung to daneel in a gush of relief and affection .  and then  little by little  he collected his thoughts and knew that he was hugging not daneel but r .  daneel  robot daneel olivaw .  he was hugging a robot and the robot was holding him lightly  allowing himself to be hugged  judging that the action gave pleasure to a human being and enduring that action because the positronic potentials of his brain made it impossible to repel the embrace and so cause disappointment and embarrassment to the human being .  the insurmountable first law of robotics states     a robot may not injure a human being      and to repel a friendly gesture would do injury .  slowly  so as to reveal no sign of his own chagrin  baley released his hold .  he even gave each upper arm of the robot a final squeeze  so that there might seem to be no shame to the release .     haven   t seen you  daneel     said baley     since you brought that ship to earth with the two mathematicians .  remember .        of a certainty  partner elijah .  it is a pleasure to see you .        you feel emotion  do you .     said baley lightly .     i cannot say what i feel in any human sense  partner elijah .  i can say  however  that the sight of you seems to make my thoughts flow more easily  and the gravitational pull on my body seems to assault my senses with lesser insistence  and that there are other changes i can identify .  i imagine that what i sense corresponds in a rough way to what it is that you may sense when you feel pleasure .     baley nodded .     whatever it is you sense when you see me  old partner  that makes it seem preferable to the state in which you are when you don   t see me  suits me well  if you follow my meaning .  but how is it you are here .        giskard reventlov  having reported you      r .  daneel paused .     purified .     asked baley sardonically .     disinfected     said r .  daneel .     i felt it appropriate to enter then .        surely you would not fear infection otherwise .        not at all  partner elijah  but others on the ship might then be reluctant to have me approach them .  the people of aurora are sensitive to the chance of infection  sometimes to a point beyond a rational estimate of the probabilities .        i understand  but i wasn   t asking why you were here at this moment .  i meant why are you here at all .        dr .  fastolfe  of whose establishment i am part  directed me to board the ship that had been sent to pick you up for several reasons .  he felt it desirable that you have one immediate item of the known in what he was certain would be a difficult mission for you .        that was a kindly thought on his part .  i thank him .     r .  daneel bowed gravely in acknowledgment .     dr .  fastolfe also felt that the meeting would give me     the robot paused      appropriate sensations .        pleasure  you mean  daneel .        since i am permitted to use the term  yes .  and as a third reason  and the most important      the door opened again at that point and r .  giskard walked in .  baley   s head turned toward it and he felt a surge of displeasure .  there was no mistaking r .  giskard as a robot and its presence emphasized  somehow  the robotism of daneel  r .  daneel  baley suddenly thought again   even though daneel was far the superior of the two .  baley didn   t want the robotism of daneel emphasized  he didn   t want himself humiliated for his inability to regard daneel as anything but a human being with a somewhat stilted way with the language .  he said impatiently     what is it  boy .     r .  giskard said     i have brought the book films you wished to see  sir  and the viewer .        well  put them down .  put them down .    and you needn   t stay .  daneel will be here with me .        yes  sir .     the robot   s eyes  faintly glowing  baley noticed  as daneel   s were not  turned briefly to r .  daneel  as though seeking orders from a superior being .  r .  daneel said quietly     it will be appropriate  friend giskard  to remain just outside the door .        i shall  friend daneel     said b .  giskard .  it left and baley said with some discontent     why does it have to stay just outside the door .  am i a prisoner .        in the sense     said r .  daneel     that it would not be permitted for you to mingle with the ship   s company in the course of this voyage  i regret to be forced to say you are indeed a prisoner .  yet that is not the reason for the presence of giskard .    and i should tell you at this point that it might well be advisable  partner elijah  if you did not address giskard  or any robot  as    boy .     baley frowned .     does it resent the expression .        giskard does not resent any action of a human being .  it is simply that    boy    is not a customary term of address for robots on aurora and it would be inadvisable to create friction with the aurorans by unintentionally stressing your place of origin through habits of speech that are nonessential .        how do i address it  then .        as you address me  by the use of his accepted identifying name .  that is  after all  merely a sound indicating the particular person you are addressing  and why should one sound be preferable to another .  it is merely a matter of convention .  and it is also the custom on aurora to refer to a robot as    he     or sometimes    she     rather than as    it .     then  too  it is not the custom on aurora to use the initial    r .     except under formal conditions where the entire name of the robot is appropriate  and even then the initial is nowadays often left out .        in that case  daneel      baley repressed the sudden impulse to say    r .  daneel        how do you distinguish between robots and human beings .        the distinction is usually self evident  partner elijah .  there would seem to be no need to emphasize it unnecessarily .  at least that is the auroran view and  since you have asked giskard for films on aurora  i assume you wish to familiarize yourself with things auroran as an aid to the task you have undertaken .        the task which has been dumped on me  yes .  and what if the distinction between robot and human being is not self evident  daneel .  as in your case .        then why make the distinction  unless the situation is such that it is essential to make it .     baley took a deep breath .  it was going to be difficult to adjust to this auroran pretense that robots did not exist .  he said     but then  if giskard is not here to keep me prisoner  why is it  he   outside the door .        those are according to the instructions of dr .  fastolfe  partner elijah .  giskard is to protect you .        protect me .  against what .    or against whom .        dr .  fastolfe was not precise on that point  partner elijah .  still  as human passions are running high over the matter of jander panell         jander panell .        the robot whose usefulness was terminated .        the robot  in other words  who was killed .        killed  partner elijah  is a term that is usually applied to human beings .        but on aurora distinctions between robots and human beings are avoided  are they not .        so they are .  nevertheless  the possibility of distinction or lack of distinction in the particular case of the ending of functioning has never arisen  to my knowledge .  i do not know what the rules are .     baley pondered the matter .  it was a point of no real importance  purely a matter of semantics .  still  he wanted to probe the manner of thinking of the aurorans .  he would get nowhere otherwise .  he said slowly     a human being who is functioning is alive .  if that life is violently ended by the deliberate action of another human being  we call that    murder    or    homicide .        murder    is  somehow  the stronger word .  to be witness  suddenly  to an attempted violent end to the life of a human being  one would shout    murder .     it is not at all likely that one would shout    homicide .     it is the more formal word  the less emotional word .     r .  daneel said     i do not understand the distinction you are making  partner elijah .  since    murder    and    homicide    are both used to represent the violent ending of the life of a human being  the two words must be interchangeable .  where  then  is the distinction .        of the two words  one screamed out will more effectively chill the blood of a human being than the other will  daneel .        why is that .        connotations and associations  the subtle effect  not of dictionary meaning  but of years of usage  the nature of the sentences and conditions and events in which one has experienced the use of one word as compared with that of the other .        there is nothing of this in my programming     said daneel  with a curious sound of helplessness hovering over the apparent lack of emotion with which he said this  the same lack of emotion with which he said everything  .  baley said     will you accept my word for it  daneel .     quickly  daneel said  almost as though he had just been presented with the solution to a puzzle     without doubt .        now  then  we might say that a robot that is functioning is alive     said baley .     many might refuse to broaden the word so far  but we are free to devise definitions to suit ourselves if it is useful .  it is easy to treat a functioning robot as alive and it would be unnecessarily complicated to try to invent a new word for the condition or to avoid the use of the familiar one .  you are alive  for instance  daneel  aren   t you .     daneel said  slowly and with emphasis     i am functioning .        come .  if a squirrel is alive  or a bug  or a tree  or a blade of grass  why not you .  i would never remember to say  or to think  that i am alive but that you are merely functioning  especially if i am to live for a while on aurora  where i am to try not to make unnecessary distinctions between a robot and myself .  therefore  i tell you that we are both alive and i ask you to take my word for it .        i will do so  partner elijah .        and yet can we say that the ending of robotic life by the deliberate violent action of a human being is also    murder    .  we might hesitate .  if the crime is the same  the punishment should be the same  but would that be right .  if the punishment of the murder of a human being is death  should one actually execute a human being who puts an end to a robot .        the punishment of a murderer is psychic probing  partner elijah  followed by the construction of a new personality .  it is the personal structure of the mind that has committed the crime  not the life of the body .        and what is the punishment on aurora for putting a violent end to the functioning of a robot .        i do not know  partner elijah .  such an incident has never occurred on aurora  as far as i know .        i suspect the punishment would not be psychic probing     said baley .     how about    roboticide    .        roboticide .        as the term used to describe the killing of a robot .     daneel said     but what about the verb derived from the noun  partner elijah .  one never says    to homicide    and it would therefore not be proper to say    to roboticide .        you   re right .  you would have to say    to murder    in each case .        but murder applies specifically to human beings .  one does not murder an animal  for instance .     baley said     true .  and one does not murder even a human being by accident  only by deliberate intent .  the more general term is    to kill .     that applies to accidental death as well as to deliberate murder  and it applies to animals as well as human beings .  even a tree may be killed by disease  so why may not a robot be killed  eh  daneel .        human beings and other animals and plants as well  partner elijah  are all living things     said daneel .     a robot is a human artifact  as much as this viewer is .  an artifact is    destroyed        damaged        demolished     and so on .  it is never    killed .        nevertheless  daneel  i shall say    killed .     jander panell was killed .     daneel said     why should a difference in a word make any difference to the thing described .        that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet .     is that it  daneel .     daneel paused  then said     i am not certain what is meant by the smell of a rose  but if a rose on earth is the common flower that is called a rose on aurora  and if by its    smell    you mean a property that can be detected  sensed  or measured by human beings  then surely calling a rose by another sound combination  and holding all else equal  would not affect the smell or any other of its intrinsic properties .        true .  and yet changes in name do result in changes in perception where human beings are concerned .        i do not see why  partner elijah .        because human beings are often illogical  daneel .  it is not an admirable characteristic .     baley sank deeper into his chair and fiddled with his viewer  allowing his mind  for a few minutes  to retreat into private thought .  the discussion with daneel was useful in itself  for while baley played with the question of words  he managed to forget that he was in space  to forget that the ship was moving forward until it was far enough from the mass centers of the solar system to make the jump through hyperspace  to forget that he would soon be several million kilometers from earth and  not long after that  several light years from earth .  more important  there were positive conclusions to be drawn .  it was clear that daneel   s talk about aurorans making no distinction between robots and human beings was misleading .  the aurorans might virtuously remove the initial    b .      the use of    boy    as a form of address  and the use of    it    as the customary pronoun  but from daneel   s resistance to the use of the same word for the violent ends of a robot and of a human being  a resistance inherent in his programming which was  in turn  the natural consequence of auroran assumptions about how daneel ought to behave  one had to conclude that these were merely superficial changes .  in essence  aurorans were as firm as earthmen in their belief that robots were machines that were infinitely inferior to human beings .  that meant that his formidable task of finding a useful resolution of the crisis  if that were possible at all  would not be hampered by at least one particular misperception of auroran society .  baley wondered if he ought to question giskard  in order to confirm the conclusions he reached from his conversation with daneel  and  without much hesitation  decided not to .  giskard   s simple and rather unsubtle mind would be of no use .  he would    yes  sir    and    no  sir    to the end .  it would be like questioning a recording .  well  then  baley decided  he would continue with daneel  who was at least capable of responding with something approaching subtlety .  he said     daneel  let us consider the case of jander panell  which i assume  from what you have said so far  is the first case of roboticide in the history of aurora .  the human being responsible  the killer  is  i take it  not known .        if     said daneel     one assumes that a human being was responsible  then his identity is not known .  in that  you are right  partner elijah .        what about the motive .  why was jander panel .  killed .        that  too  is not known .        but jander panel .  was a humaniform robot  one like yourself and not one like  for instance  r .  gis   i mean  giskard .        that is so .  jander was a humaniform robot like myself .        might it not be  then  that no case of roboticide was intended .        i do not understand  partner elijah .     baley said  a little impatiently     might not the killer have thought this jander was a human being  that the intention was homicide  not roboticide .     slowly  daneel shook his head .     humaniform robots are quite like human beings in appearance  partner elijah  down to the hairs and pores in our skin .  our voices are thoroughly natural  we can go through the motions of eating  and so on .  and yet  in our behavior there are noticeable differences .  there may be fewer such differences with time and with refinement of technique  but as yet they are many .  you  and other earthmen not used to humaniform robots  may not easily note these differences  but aurorans would .  no auroran would mistake jander  or me  for a human being  not for a moment .        might some spacer  other than an auroran  make the mistake .     daneel hesitated .     i do not think so .  i do not speak from personal observation or from direct programmed knowledge  but i do have the programming to know that all the spacer worlds are as intimately acquainted with robots as aurora is  some  like solaria  even more so  and i deduce  therefore  that no spacer would miss the distinction between human and robot .        are there humaniform robots on the other spacer worlds .        no  partner elijah  they exist only on aurora so far .        then other spacers would not be intimately acquainted with humaniform robots and might well miss the distinctions and mistake them for human beings .        i do not think that is likely .  even humaniform robots will behave in robotic fashion in certain definite ways that any spacer would recognize .        and yet surely there are spacers who are not as intelligent as most  not as experienced  not as mature .  there are spacer children  if nothing else  who would miss the distinction .        it is quite certain  partner elijah  that the  roboticide  was not committed by anyone unintelligent  inexperienced  or young .  completely certain .        we   re making eliminations .  good .  if no spacer would miss the distinction  what about an earthman .  is it possible that         partner elijah  when you arrive in aurora  you will be the first earthman to set foot on the planet since the period of original settlement was over .  all aurorans now alive were born on aurora or  in a relatively few cases  on other spacer worlds .        the first earthman     muttered baley .     i am honored .  might not an earthman be present on aurora without the knowledge of aurorans .        no .     said daneel with simple certainty .     your knowledge  daneel  might not be absolute .        no .     came the repetition  in tones precisely similar to the first .     we conclude  then     said baley with a shrug     that the roboticide was intended to be roboticide and nothing else .        that was the conclusion from the start .     baley said     those aurorans who concluded this at the start had all the information to begin with .  i am getting it now for the first time .        my remark  partner elijah  was not meant in any pejorative manner .  i know better than to belittle your abilities .        thank you  daneel .  i know there was no intended sneer in your remark .    you said just a while ago that the roboticide was not committed by anyone unintelligent  inexperienced  or young and that this is completely certain .  let us consider your remark      baley knew that he was taking the long route .  he had to .  considering his lack of understanding of auroran ways and of their manner of thought  he could not afford to make assumptions and skip steps .  if he were dealing with an intelligent human being in this way  that person would be likely to grow impatient and blurt out information  and consider baley an idiot into the bargain .  daneel  however  as a robot  would follow baley down the winding road with total patience .  that was one type of behavior that gave away daneel as a robot  however humaniform he might be .  an auroran might be able to judge him a robot from a single answer to a single question .  daneel was right as to the subtle distinctions .  baley said     one might eliminate children  perhaps also most women  and many male adults by presuming that the method of roboticide involved great strength  that jander   s head was perhaps crushed by a violent blow or that his chest was smashed inward .  this would not  i imagine  be easy for anyone who was not a particularly large and strong human being .     from what demachek had said on earth  baley knew that this was not the manner of the roboticide  but how was he to tell that demachek herself had not been misled .  daneel said     it would not be possible at all for any human being .        why not .        surely  partner elijah  you are aware that the robotic skeleton is metallic in nature and much stronger than human bone .  our movements are more strongly powered  faster  and more delicately controlled .  the third law of robotics states     a robot must protect its own existence .     an assault by a human being could easily be fended off .  the strongest human being could be immobilized .  nor is it likely that a robot can be caught unaware .  we are always aware of human beings .  we could not fulfill our functions otherwise .     baley said     come  now  daneel .  the third law states     a robot must protect its own existence  as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .     the second law states     a robot must obey the orders given it by a human being  except where such orders would conflict with the first law .     and the first law states     a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     a human being could order a robot to destroy himself  and a robot would then use his own strength to smash his own skull .  and if a human being attacked a robot  that robot could not fend off the attack without harming the human being  which would violate first law .     daneel said     you are  i suppose  thinking of earth   s robots .  on aurora   or on any of the spacer worlds  robots are regarded more highly than on earth and are  in general  more complex  versatile  and valuable .  the third law is distinctly stronger in comparison to the second law on spacer worlds than it is on earth .  an order for self destruction would be questioned and there would have to be a truly legitimate reason for it to be carried through  a clear and present danger .  and in fending off an attack  the first law would not be violated  for auroran robots are deft enough to immobilize a human being without hurting him .        suppose  though  that a human being maintained that  unless a robot destroyed himself  he  the human being  would be destroyed .  would not the robot then destroy himself .        an auroran robot would surely question a mere statement to that effect .  there would have to be clear evidence of the possible destruction of a human being .        might not a human being be sufficiently subtle to so arrange matters in such a way as to make it seem to a robot that that human being was indeed in great danger .  is it the ingenuity that would be required that makes you eliminate the unintelligent  inexperienced  and young .     and daneel said     no  partner elijah  it is not .        is there an error in my reasoning .        none .        then the error may lie in my assumption that he was physically damaged .  he was not  in actual fact  physically damaged .  is that right .        yes  partner elijah .      that meant demachek had had her facts straight  baley thought .      in that case  daneel  jander was mentally damaged .  roblock .  total and irreversible .        roblock .        short for robot block  the permanent shutdown of the functioning of the positronic pathways .        we do not use the word    roblock    on aurora  partner elijah .        what do you say .        we say    mental freeze out .        either way  it is the same phenomenon being described .        it might be wise  partner elijah  to use our expression or the aurorans you speak to may not understand  conversation may be impeded .  you stated a short while ago that different words make a difference .        very well .  i will say    freeze out .       could such a thing happen spontaneously .        yes  but the chances are infinitesimally small  roboticists say .  as a humaniform robot  i can report that i have never myself experienced any effect that could even approach mental freezeout .        then one must assume that a human being deliberately set up a situation in which mental freeze out would take place .        that is precisely what dr .  fastolfe   s opposition contends  partner elijah .        and since this would take robotic training  experience  and skill  the unintelligent  the inexperienced  and the young cannot have been responsible .        that is the natural reasoning  partner elijah .        it might even be possible to list the number of human beings on aurora with sufficient skill and thus set up a group of suspects that might not be very large in number .        that has  in actual fact  been done  partner elijah .        and how long is the list .        the longest list suggested contains only one name .     it was baley   s turn to pause .  his brows drew together in an angry frown and he said  quite explosively     only one name .     daneel said quietly     only one name  partner elijah .  that is the judgment of dr .  han fastolfe  who is aurora   s greatest theoretical roboticist .        but what is  then  the mystery in all this .  whose is the one name .     r .  daneel said     why  that of dr .  han fastolfe  of course .  i have just stated that he is aurora   s greatest theoretical roboticist and  in dr .  fastolfe   s professional opinion   he himself is the only one who could possibly have maneuvered jander panel into total mental freeze out without leaving any sign of the process .  however  dr .  fastolfe also states that he did not do it .        but that no one else could have  either .        indeed  partner elijah .  there lies the mystery .        and what if dr .  fastolfe      baley paused .  there would be no point in asking daneel if dr .  fastolfe was lying or was somehow mistaken  either in his own judgment that no one but he could have done it or in the statement that he himself had not done it .  daneel had been programmed by fastolfe and there would be no chance that the programming included the ability to doubt the programmer .  baley said  therefore  with as close an approach to mildness as he could manage     i will think about this  daneel  and we will talk again .        that is well  partner elijah .  it is  in any case  time for sleep .  since it is possible that  on aurora  the pressure of events may force an irregular schedule upon you  it would be wise to seize the opportunity for sleep now .  i will show you how one produces a bed and how one manages the bedclothes .        thank you  daneel     muttered baley .  he was under no illusion that sleep would come easily .  he was being sent to aurora for the specific purpose of demonstrating that fastolfe was innocent of roboticide  and success in that was required for earth   s continued security and  much less important but equally dear to baley   s heart  for the continued prospering of baley   s own career  yet  even before reaching aurora  he had discovered that fastolfe had virtually confessed to the crime .     .   baley did sleep  eventually  after daneel demonstrated how to reduce the field intensity that served as a form of pseudo gravity .  this was not true antigravity and it consumed so much energy that the process could only be used at restricted times and under unusual conditions .  daneel was not programmed to be able to explain the manner in which this worked and  if he had  baley was quite certain he would not have understood it .  fortunately  the controls could be operated without any understanding of the scientific justification .  daneel said     the field intensity cannot be reduced to zero   at least  not by these controls .  sleeping under zero gravity is not  in any case  comfortable  certainly not for those inexperienced in space travel .  what one needs is an intensity low enough to give one a feeling of freedom from the pressure of one   s own weight  but high enough to maintain an up down orientation .  the level varies with the individual .  most people would feel most comfortable at the minimum intensity allowed by the control  but you might find that  on first use  you would wish a higher intensity  so that you might retain the familiarity of the weight sensation to a somewhat greater extent .  simply experiment with different levels and find the one that suits .     lost in the novelty of the sensation  baley found his mind drifting away from the problem of fastolfe   s affirmation denial  even as his body drifted away from wakefulness .  perhaps the two were one process .  he dreamed he was back on earth  of course   moving along an expressway but not in one of the seats .  rather  he was floating along beside the high speed strip  just over the head of the moving people  gaining on them slightly .  noise of the ground bound people seemed surprised  none looked up at him .  it was a rather pleasant sensation and he missed it upon waking .  after breakfast the following morning   was it morning actually .  could it be morning  or any other time of day  in space .  clearly  it couldn   t .  he thought awhile and decided he would define morning as the time after waking  and he would define breakfast as the meal eaten after waking  and abandon specific timekeeping as objectively unimportant .    for him  at least  if not for the ship .  after breakfast  then  the following morning  he studied the news sheets offered him only long enough to see that they said nothing about the roboticide on aurora and then turned to those book films that had been brought to him the previous day     wake period    .   by giskard .  he chose those whose titles sounded historical and  after viewing through several hastily  he decided that giskard had brought him books for adolescents .  they were heavily illustrated and simply written .  he wondered if that was giskard   s estimate of baley   s intelligence  or  perhaps  of his needs .  after some thought  baley decided that giskard  in his robotic innocence  had chosen well and that there was no point in brooding over a possible insult .  he settled down to viewing with greater concentration and noted at once that daneel was viewing the book film with him .  actual curiosity .  or just to keep his eyes occupied .  daneel did not once ask to have a page repeated .  nor did he stop to ask a question .  presumably  he merely accepted what he read with robotic trust and did not permit himself the luxury of either doubt or curiosity .  baley did not ask daneel any questions concerning what he read  though he did ask for instructions on the operation of the print out mechanism of the auroran viewer  with which he was not familiar .  occasionally  baley stopped to make use of the small room that adjoined his room and could be used for the various private physiological functions  so private that the room was referred to as    the personal     with the capital letter always understood  both on earth and  as baley discovered when daneel referred to it   on aurora .  it was just large enough for one person  which made it bewildering to a city dweller accustomed to huge banks of urinals  excretory seats  washbasins  and showers .  in viewing the book films  baley did not attempt to memorize details .  he had no intention of becoming an expert on auroran society  nor even of passing a high school test on the subject .  rather  he wished to get the feel of it .  he noticed  for instance  even through the hagiographic attitude of historians writing for young people  that the auroran pioneers  the founding fathers  the earthpeople who had first come to aurora to settle in the early days of interstellar travel   had been very much earthpeople .  their politics  their quarrels  every facet of their behavior had been earthish  what happened on aurora was  in ways  similar to the events that took place when the relatively empty sections of earth had been settled a couple of thousand years before .  of course  the aurorans had no intelligent life to encounter and to fight  no thinking organisms to puzzle the invaders from earth with questions of treatment  humane or cruel .  there was precious little life of any kind  in fact .  so the planet was quickly settled by human beings  by their domesticated plants and animals  and by the parasites and other organisms that were adventitiously brought along .  and  of course  the settlers brought robots with them .  the first aurorans quickly felt the planet to be theirs  since it fell into their laps with no sense of competition  and they had called the planet new earth to begin with .  that was natural  since it was the first extrasolar planet  the first spacer world  to be settled .  it was the first fruit of interstellar travel  the first dawn of an immense new era .  they quickly cut the umbilical cord  however  and renamed the planet aurora after the roman goddess of the dawn .  it was the world of the dawn .  and so did the settlers from the start self consciously declare themselves the progenitors of a new kind .  all previous history of humanity was a dark night and only for the aurorans on this new world was the day finally approaching .  it was this great fact  this great self praise  that made itself felt over all the details  all the names  dates  winners  losers .  it was the essential .  other worlds were settled  some from earth  some from aurora  but baley paid no attention to that or to any of the details .  he was after the broad brushstrokes and he noted the two massive changes that took place and pushed the aurorans ever farther away from their earthly origins .  these were first  the increasing integration of robots into every facet of life and second  the extension of the life span .  as the robots grew more advanced and versatile  the aurorans grew more dependent on them .  but never helplessly so .  not like the world of solaria  baley remembered  on which a very few human beings were in the collective womb of very many robots .  aurora was not like that .  and yet they grew more dependent .  viewing as he did for intuitive feel  for trend and generality  every step in the course of human robot interaction seemed to depend on dependence .  even the manner in which a consensus of robotic rights was reached  the gradual dropping of what daneel would call    unnecessary distinctions     was a sign of the dependence .  to baley  it seemed not that the aurorans were growing more humane in their attitude out of a liking for the humane  but that they were denying the robotic nature of the objects in order to remove the discomfort of having to recognize the fact that human beings were dependent upon objects of artificial intelligence .  as for the extended life span  that was accompanied by a slowing of the pace of history .  the peaks and troughs smoothed out .  there was a growing continuity and a growing consensus .  there was no question but that the history he was viewing grew less interesting as it went along  it became almost soporific .  for those living through it  this had to be good .  history was interesting to the extent that it was catastrophic and  while that might make absorbing viewing  it made horrible living .  undoubtedly  personal lives continued to be interesting for the vast majority of aurorans and  if the collective interaction of lives grew quiet  who would mind .  if the world of the dawn had a quiet sunlit day  who on that world would clamor for storm .    somewhere in the course of his viewing  baley felt an indescribable sensation .  if he had been forced to attempt a description  he would have said it was that of a momentary inversion .  it was as though he had been turned inside out   and then back as he had been  in the course of a small fraction of a second .  so momentary had it been that he almost missed it  ignoring it as though it had been a tiny hiccup inside himself .  it was only perhaps a minute later  suddenly going over the feeling in retrospect  that he remembered the sensation as something he had experienced twice before  once when traveling to solaria and once when returning to earth from that planet .  it was the    jump     the passage through hyperspace that  in a timeless  spaceless interval  sent the ship across the parsecs and defeated the speed of light limit of the universe .   no mystery in words  since the ship merely left the universe and traversed something which involved no speed limit .  total mystery in concept  however  for there was no way of describing what hyperspace was  unless one made use of mathematical symbols which could  in any case  not be translated into anything comprehensible .   if one accepted the fact that human beings had learned to manipulate hyperspace without understanding the thing they manipulated  then the effect was clear  at one moment  the ship had been within microparsecs of earth and  at the next moment  it was within microparsecs of aurora .  ideally  the jump took zero time  literally zero  and  if it were carried through with perfect smoothness  there would not  could not be any biological sensation at all .  physicists maintained  however  that perfect smoothness required infinite energy so that there was always an    effective time    that was not quite zero  though it could be made as short as desired .  it was that which produced that odd and essentially harmless feeling of inversion .  the sudden realization that he was very far from earth and very close to aurora filled baley with a desire to see the spacer world .  partly  it was the desire to see somewhere people lived .  partly  it was a natural curiosity to see something that had been filling his thoughts as a result of the book films he had been viewing .  giskard entered just then with the middle meal between waking and sleeping  call it    lunch     and said     we are approaching aurora  sir  but it will not be possible for you to observe it from the bridge .  there would  in any case  be nothing to see .  aurora   s sun is merely a bright star and it will be several days before we are near enough to aurora itself to see any detail .     then he added  as though in afterthought     it will not be possible for you to observe it from the bridge at that time  either .     baley felt strangely abashed .  apparently  it was assumed he would want to observe and that want was simply squashed .  his presence as a viewer was not desired .  he said     very well  giskard     and the robot left .  baley looked after him somberly .  how many other constraints would be placed on him .  improbable as successful completion of his task was  he wondered in how many different ways aurorans would conspire to make it impossible .     giskard    .   baley turned and said to daneel     it annoys me  daneel  that i must remain a prisoner here because the aurorans on board this ship fear me as a source of infection .  this is pure superstition .  i have been treated .     daneel said     it is not because of auroran fears that you are being asked to remain in your cabin  partner elijah .        no .  what other reason .        perhaps you remember that  when we first met on this ship  you asked me my reasons for being sent to escort you .  i said it was to give you something familiar as an anchor and to please me .  i was then about to tell you the third reason  when giskard interrupted us with your viewer and viewing material  and thereafter we launched into a discussion of roboticide .        and you never told me the third reason .  what is it .        why  partner elijah  it is merely that i might help protect you .        against what .        unusual passions have been stirred by the incident we have agreed to call roboticide .  you are being called to aurora to help demonstrate dr .  fastolfe   s innocence .  and the hyperwave drama         jehoshaphat  daneel     said baley in outrage .     have they seen that thing on aurora  too .        they have seen it throughout the spacer worlds  partner elijah .  it was a most popular program and has made it quite plain that you are a most extraordinary investigator .        so that whoever might be behind the roboticide may well have exaggerated fears of what i might accomplish and might therefore risk a great deal to prevent my arrival  or to kill me .        dr .  fastolfe     said daneel calmly     is quite convinced that no one is behind the roboticide  since no human being other than himself could have carried it through .  it was a purely fortuitous occurrence  in dr .  fastolfe   s view .  however  there are those who are trying to capitalize on the occurrence and it would be to their interest to keep you from proving that .  for that reason  you must be protected .     baley took a few hasty steps to one wall of the room and then back to the other  as though to speed his thought processes by physical example .  somehow he did not feel any sense of personal danger .  he said     daneel  how many humaniform robots are there all together on aurora .        do you mean now that jander no longer functions .        yes  now that jander is dead .        one  partner elijah .     baley stared at daneel in shock .  soundlessly  he mouthed the word  one .  finally  he said     let me understand this  daneel .  you are the only humaniform robot on aurora .        or on any world  partner elijah .  i thought you were aware of this .  i was the prototype and then jander was constructed .  since then  dr .  fastolfe has refused to construct any more and no one else has the skill to do it .        but in that case  since of two humaniform robots  one has been killed  does it not occur to dr .  fastolfe that the remaining humaniform  you  daneel  might be in danger .        he recognizes the possibility .  but the chance that the fantastically unlikely occurrence of mental freeze out would take place a second time is remote .  he doesn   t take it seriously .  he feels  however  that there might be a chance of other misadventure .  that  i think  played some small part in his sending me to earth to get you .  it kept me away from aurora for a week or so .        and you are now as much a prisoner as i am  aren   t you  daneel .        i am a prisoner     said daneel gravely     only in the sense  partner elijah  that i am expected not to leave this room .        in what other sense is one a prisoner .        in the sense that the person so restricted in his movements resents the restriction .  a true imprisonment has the implication of being involuntary .  i quite understand the reason for being here and i concur in the necessity .        you do     grumbled baley .     i do not .  i am a prisoner in the full sense .  and what keeps us safe here  anyway .        for one thing  partner elijah  giskard is on duty outside .        is he intelligent enough for the job .        he understands his orders entirely .  he is rugged and strong and quite realizes the importance of his task .        you mean he is prepared to be destroyed to protect the two of us .        yes  of course  just as i am prepared to be destroyed to protect you .     baley felt abashed .  he said     you do not resent the situation in which you may be forced to give up your existence for me .        it is my programming  partner elijah     said daneel in a voice that seemed to soften     yet somehow it seems to me that  even were it not for my programming  saving you makes the loss of my own existence seem quite trivial in comparison .     baley could not resist this .  he held out his hand and closed it on daneel   s with a fierce grip .     thank you  partner daneel  but please do not allow it to happen .  i do not wish the loss of your existence .  the preservation of my own would be inadequate compensation  it seems to me .     and baley was amazed to discover that he really meant it .  he was faintly horrified to realize that he would be ready to risk his life for a robot .    no  not for a robot .  for daneel .       giskard entered without signaling .  baley had come to accept that .  the robot  as his guard  had to be able to come and go as he pleased .  and giskard was only a robot  in baley   s eyes  however much he might be a    he    and however much one did not mention the    r .     if baley were scratching himself  picking his nose  engaged in any messy biological function  it seemed to him that giskard would be indifferent  nonjudgmental  incapable of reacting in any way  but coldly recording the observation in some inner memory bank .  it made giskard simply a piece of mobile furniture and baley felt no embarrassment in his presence .    not that giskard had ever intruded on him at an inconvenient moment  baley thought idly .  giskard brought a small cubicle with him .     sir  i suspect that you still wish to observe aurora from space .     baley started .  no doubt  daneel had noted baley   s irritation and had deduced its cause and taken this way of dealing with it .  to have giskard do it and present it as an idea of his simpleminded own was a touch of delicacy on daneel   s part .  it would free baley of the necessity of expressing gratitude .  or so daneel would think .  baley had  as a matter of fact  been more irritated at being  to his way of thinking  needlessly kept from the view of aurora than at being kept imprisoned generally .  he had been fretting over the loss of the view during the two days since the jump .    so he turned and said to daneel     thank you  my friend .        it was giskard   s idea     said daneel .     yes  of course     said baley with a small smile .     i thank him  too .  what is this  giskard .        it is an astrosimulator  sir .  it works essentially like a trimensional receiver and is connected to the viewroom .  if i might add         yes .        you will not find the view particularly exciting  sir .  i would not wish you to be unnecessarily disappointed .        i will try not to expect too much  giskard .  in any case  i will not hold you responsible for any disappointment i might feel .        thank you  sir .  i must return to my post  but daneel will be able to help you with the instrument if any problem arises .     he left and baley turned to daneel with approval .     giskard handled that very well  i thought .  he may be a simple model  but he   s well designed .        he  too  is a fastolfe robot  partner elijah .    this astrosimulator is self contained and self adjusted .  since it is already focused on aurora  it is only necessary to touch the control edge .  that will put it in operation and you need do nothing more .  would you care to set it going yourself .     baley shrugged .     no need .  you may do it .        very well .     daneel had placed the cubicle upon the table on which baley had done his book film viewing .     this     he said  indicating a small rectangle in his hand     is the control  partner elijah .  you need only hold it by the edges in this manner and then exert a small inward pressure to turn the mechanism on  and then another to turn it off .     daneel pressed the control edge and baley shouted in a strangled way .  baley had expected the cubicle to light up and to display within itself a holographic representation of a star field .  that was not what happened .  instead  baley found himself in space   in space  with bright  unblinking stars in all directions .  it lasted for only a moment and then everything was back as it was  the room and  within it  baley  daneel  and the cubicle .     my regrets  partner elijah     said daneel .     i turned it off as soon as i understood your discomfort .  i did not realize you were not prepared for the event .        then prepare me .  what happened .        the astrosimulator works directly on the visual center of the human brain .  there is no way of distinguishing the impression it leaves from three dimensional reality .  it is a comparatively recent device and so far it has been used only for astronomical scenes which are  after all  low in detail .        did you see it  too  daneel .        yes  but very poorly and without the realism a human being experiences .  i see the dim outline of a scene superimposed upon the still clear contents of the room  but it has been explained to me that human beings see the scene only .  undoubtedly  when the brains of those such as myself arc still more finely tuned and adjusted      baley had recovered his equilibrium .     the point is  daneel  that i was aware of nothing else .  i was not aware of myself .  i did not see my hands or sense where they were .  i felt as though i were a disembodied spirit or  er  as i imagine i would feel if i were dead but were consciously existing in some sort of immaterial afterlife .        i see now why you would find that rather disturbing .        actually  i found it very disturbing .        my regrets  partner elijah .  i shall have giskard take this away .        no .  i   m prepared now .  let me have that cube .    will i be able to turn it off  even though i am not conscious of the existence of my hands .        it will cling to your hand  so that you will not drop it  partner elijah .  i have been told by dr .  fastolfe  who has experienced this phenomenon  that the pressure is automatically applied when the human being holding it wills an end .  it is an automatic phenomenon based on nerve manipulation  as the vision itself is .  at least  that is how it works with aurorans and i imagine         that earthmen are sufficiently similar to aurorans  physiologically  for it to work with us as well .    very well  give me the control and i will try .     with a slight internal wince  baley squeezed the control edge and was in space again .  he was expecting it this time and  once he found he could breathe without difficulty and did not feel in any way as though he were immersed in a vacuum  he labored to accept it all as a visual illusion .  breathing rather stertorously  perhaps to convince himself he was actually breathing   he stared about curiously in all directions .  suddenly aware he was hearing his breath rasp in his nose  he said     can you hear me  daneel .     he heard his own voice  a little distant  a little artificial  but he heard it .  and then he heard daneel   s  different enough to be distinguishable .     yes  i can     said daneel .     and you should be able to hear me  partner elijah .  the visual and kinesthetic senses arc interfered with for the sake of a greater illusion of reality  but the auditory sense remains untouched .  largely so  at any rate .        well  i see only stars  ordinary stars  that is .  aurora has a sun .  we are close enough to aurora  i imagine  to make the star that is its sun considerably brighter than the others .        entirely too bright  .  partner elijah .  it is blanked out or you might suffer retina .  damage .        then where is the planet aurora .        do you see the constellation of orion .        yes  i do .    do you mean we still see the constellations as we see them in earth   s sky  as in the city planetarium .        just about .  as stellar distances go  we are not far from earth and the solar system of which it is part  so that they have the starview in common .  aurora   s sun is known as tau ceti on earth and is only   .    parsecs from there .    now if you   ll imagine a line from betelgeuse to the middle star of orion   s belt and continue it for an equal length and a bit more  the middling bright star you see is actually the planet aurora .  it will become increasingly unmistakable over the next few days  as we approach it rapidly .     baley regarded it gravely .  it was just a bright starlike object .  there was no luminous arrow  going on and off  pointing to it .  there was no carefully lettered inscription arced over it .  he said     where   s the sun .  earth   s star  i mean .        it   s in the constellation virgo  as seen from aurora .  it is a second magnitude star .  unfortunately  the astrosimulator we have is not properly computerized and it would not be easy to point it out to you .  it would  in any case  just appear to be a star  quite an ordinary one .        never mind     said baley .     i am going to turn off this thing now .  if i have trouble  help out .     he didn   t have trouble .  it flicked off just as he thought of doing so and he sat blinking in the suddenly harsh light of the room .  it was only then  when he had returned to his normal senses  that it occurred to him that for some minutes he had seemed to himself to have been out in space  without a protecting wall of any kind  and yet his earthly agoraphobia had not been activated .  he had been perfectly comfortable  once he had accepted his own nonexistence .  the thought puzzled him and distracted him from his bookfilm viewing for a while .  periodically  he returned to the astrosimulator and took another look at space as seen from a vantage point just outside the spaceship  with himself nowhere present  apparently  .  sometimes it was just for a moment  to reassure himself that he was still not made uneasy by the infinite void .  sometimes he found himself lost in the pattern of the stars and he began lazily counting them or forming geometrical figures  rather luxuriating in the ability to do something which  on earth  he would never have been able to do because the mounting agoraphobic uneasiness would quickly have overwhelmed everything else .  eventually  it grew quite obvious that aurora was brightening .  it soon became easy to detect among the other dots of light  then unmistakable  and finally unavoidable .  it began as a tiny sliver of light and  thereafter  it enlarged rapidly and began to show phases .  it was almost precisely a half circle of light when baley became aware of the existence of phases .  baley inquired and daneel said     we are approaching from outside the orbital plane  partner elijah .  aurora   s south pole is more or less in the center of its disk  somewhat into the lighted half .  it is spring in the southern hemisphere .     baley said     according to the material i have been reading  aurora   s axis is tipped sixteen degrees .     he had glanced over the physical description of the planet with insufficient attention in his anxiety to get to the aurorans  but he remembered that .     yes  partner elijah .  eventually  we will move into orbit about aurora and the phases will then change rapidly .  aurora revolves more rapidly than earth does         it has a    hour day .  yes .        a day of    .   traditional hours .  the auroran day is divided into    auroran hours  with each hour divided into     auroran minutes  which are  in turn  divided into     auroran seconds .  an auroran second is thus roughly equal to o .   earth seconds .        is that what the books mean when they refer to metric hours  metric minutes  and so on .        yes .  it was difficult to persuade the aurorans  at first  to abandon the time units to which they were accustomed and both systems  the standard and the metric  were in use .  eventually  of course  the metric won out .  at present we speak only of hours  minutes  and seconds  but the decimalized versions are invariably meant .  the same system has been adopted throughout the spacer worlds  even though  on the other worlds  it does not tie in with the natural rotation of the planet .  each planet also uses a local system  of course .        as earth does .        yes  partner elijah  but earth uses only the original standard time units .  that inconveniences the spacer worlds where trade is concerned  but they allow earth to go its way in this .        not out of friendliness  i imagine .  i suspect they wish to emphasize earth   s difference .    how does decimalization fit in with the year .  after all  aurora must have a natural period of revolution about its sun that controls the cycle of its seasons .  how is that measured .     daneel said     aurora revolves about its sun in     .   auroran days or in about   .    earth years .  that is not considered a vital matter in chronology .  aurora accepts    of its days as equaling a month and io months as equaling a metric year .  the metric year is equal to about o .   seasonal years or about three quarters of an earth year .  the relationship is different on each world  of course .  ten days is usually referred to as a decimonth .  all the spacer worlds use this system .        surely  there must be some convenient way of following the cycle of the seasons .        each world has its seasonal year  too  but it is little regarded .  one can  by computer  convert any day  past or present  into its position in the seasonal year if  for any reason  such information is desired .  and this is true on any world  where conversion to and from the local days is also as easily possible .  and  of course  partner elijah  any robot can do the same and can guide human activity where the seasonal year or local time is relevant .  the advantage of metricized units is that it supplies humanity with a unified chronometry that involves little more than decimal point shifts .     it bothered baley that the books he viewed made none of this clear .  but then  from his own knowledge of earth   s history  he knew that  at one time  the lunar month had been the key to the calendar and that there had come a time when  for ease of chronometry  the lunar month came to be ignored and was never missed .  yet if he had given books on earth to some stranger  that stranger would have very likely found n  mention of the lunar month or any historical change in calendars .  dates would have been given without explanation .  what else would be given without explanation .  how far could he rely  then  on the knowledge he was gaining .  he would have to ask questions constantly  take nothing for granted .  there would be so many opportunities to miss the obvious  so many chances to misunderstand  so many ways of taking the wrong path .      .   aurora filled his vision now when he used the astrosimulator and it looked like earth .   baley had never seen earth in the same way  but there had been photographs in astronomy texts and he had seen those .   well  what baley saw on aurora were the same cloud patterns  the same glimpse of desert areas  the same large stretches of day and night  the same pattern of twinkling light in the expanse of the night hemisphere as the photographs showed on earth   s globe .  baley watched raptly and thought  what if  for some reason  he had been taken into space  told he was being brought to aurora  and was in reality being returned to earth for some reason  for some subtle and insane reason .  how could he tell the difference before landing .  was there reason to be suspicious .  daneel had carefully told him that the constellations were the same in the sky of both planets  but wouldn   t that be naturally so for planets circling neighboring stars .  the gross appearance of both planets from space was identical  but wouldn   t that be expected if both were habitable and comfortably suited to human life .  was there any reason to suppose such a farfetched deception would be played upon him .  what purpose would it serve .  and yet why shouldn   t it be made to appear farfetched and useless .  if there were an obvious reason to do such a thing  he would have seen through it at once .  would daneel be party to such a conspiracy .  surely not  if he were a human being .  but he was only a robot  might there not be a way to order him to behave appropriately .  there was no way of coming to a decision .  baley found himself watching for glimpses of continental outlines that he could recognize as earthly or as non earthly .  that would be the telling test  except that it didn   t work .  the glimpses that came and went hazily through the clouds were of no use to him .  he was not sufficiently knowledgeable about earth   s geography .  what he really knew of earth were its underground cities  its caves of steel .  the bits of coastline he saw were unfamiliar to him  whether aurora or earth  he did not know .  why this uncertainty  anyway .  when he had gone to solaria  he had never doubted his  destination  he had never suspected that they might be bringing him back to earth .    ah  but then he had gone on a clear cut mission in which there was reasonable chance for success .  now he felt there was no chance at all .  perhaps it was  then  that he wanted to be returned to earth and was building a false conspiracy in his mind so that he could imagine it possible .  the uncertainty in his mind had come to have a life of its own .  he couldn   t let go .  he found himself watching aurora with an almost mad intensity  unable to come back to the cabin reality .  aurora was moving  turning slowly   he had watched long enough to see that .  while he had been viewing space  everything had seemed motionless  like a painted backdrop  a silent and static pattern of dots of light  with  later on  a small half circle included .  was it the motionlessness that had enabled him to be nonagoraphobic .  but now he could see aurora moving and he realized that the ship was spiraling down in the final stage before landing .  the clouds were bellying upward   no  not the clouds  the ship was spiraling downward .  the ship was moving .  he was moving .  he was suddenly aware of his own existence .  he was hurtling downward through the clouds .  he was falling  unguarded  through thin air toward solid ground .  his throat constricted  it was becoming very hard to breathe .  he told himself desperately  you are enclosed .  the walls of the ship are around you .  but he sensed no walls .  he thought  even without considering the walls  you are still enclosed .  you are wrapped in skin .  but he sensed no skin .  the sensation was worse than simple nakedness  he was an unaccompanied personality  the essence of identity totally uncovered  a living point  a singularity surrounded by an open and infinite world  and he was falling .  he wanted to close off the vision  contract his fist upon the control edge  but nothing happened .  his nerve endings had so abnormalized that the automatic contraction at an effort of will did not work .  he had no will .  eyes would not close  fist would not contract .  he was caught and hypnotized by terror  frightened into immobility .  all he sensed before him were clouds  white  not quite white  off white  a slight golden orange cast   and all turned to gray  and he was drowning .  he could not breathe .  he struggled desperately to open his clogged throat  to cal .  to daneel for help   he could make no sound       .   baley was breathing as though he had just breasted the tape at the end of a long race .  the room was askew and there was a hard surface under his left elbow .  he realized he was on the floor .  giskard was on his knees beside him  his robot   s hand  firm but somewhat cold  closed on baley   s right fist .  the door to the cabin  visible to baley just beyond giskard   s shoulder  stood ajar .  baley knew  without asking  what had happened .  giskard had seized that helpless human hand and clenched it upon the control edge to end the astrosimulation .  otherwise   daneel was there as well  his face close to baley   s  with a look on it that might well have been pain .  he said     you said nothing  partner elijah .  had i been more quickly aware of your discomfort      baley tried to gesture that he understood  that it did not matter .  he was still unable to speak .  the two robots waited until baley made a feeble movement to get up .  arms were under him at once  lifting him .  he was placed in a chair and the control was gently taken away from him by giskard .  giskard said     we will be landing soon .  you will have no further need of the astrosimulator  i believe .     daneel added gravely     it would be best to remove it  in any case .     baley said     wait .     his voice was a hoarse whisper and he was not sure the word could be made out .  he drew a deep breath  cleared his throat feebly  and said again     wait .      and then     giskard .     giskard turned back .     sir .     baley did not speak at once .  now that giskard knew he was wanted  he would wait a lengthy interval  perhaps indefinitely .  baley tried to gather his scattered wits .  agoraphobia or not  there still remained his uncertainty about their destination .  that had existed first and it might well have intensified the agoraphobia .  he had to find out .  giskard would not lie .  a robot could not lie  unless very carefully instructed to do so .  and why instruct giskard .  it was daneel who was his companion  who was to be in his company at all times .  if there was lying to be done  that would be daneel   s job .  giskard was merely a fetcher and carrier  a guard at the door .  surely there was no need to undergo the task of carefully instructing him in the web of lies .     giskard .     said baley  almost normally now .     sir .        we are about to land  are we .        in a little less than two hours  sir .     that was two metric hours  thought baley .  more than two real hours .  less .  it didn   t matter .  it would only confuse .  forget it .  baley said  as sharply as he could manage     tell me right now the name of the planet we are about to land on .     a human being  if he had answered at all  would have done so only after a pause  and then with an air of considerable surprise .  giskard answered at once  with a flat and uninflected assertion     it is aurora  sir .        how do you know .        it is our destination .  then  too  it could not be earth  for in stance  since aurora   s sun  tau ceti  is only ninety percent the mass of earth   s sun .  tau ceti is a little cooler  therefore  and its light has a distinct orange tinge to fresh and unaccustomed earth eyes .  you may have already seen the characteristic color of aurora   s sun in the reflection upon the upper surface of the cloud bank .  you will certainly see it in the appearance of the landscape  until your eyes grow accustomed to it .     baley   s eyes left giskard   s impassive face .  he had noticed the color difference  baley thought  and had attached no importance to it .  a bad error .     you may go  giskard .        yes  sir .     baley turned bitterly to daneel .     i   ve made a fool of myself  daneel .        i gather you wondered if perhaps we were deceiving you and taking you somewhere that was not aurora .  did you have a reason for suspecting this  partner elijah .        none .  it may have been the result of the uneasiness that arose from subliminal agoraphobia .  staring at seemingly motionless space  i felt no perceptible illness  but it may have lain just under the surface  creating a gathering uneasiness .        the fault was ours  partner elijah .  knowing of your dislike for open spaces  it was wrong to subject you to astrosimulation or  having done so  to subject you to no closer supervision .     baley shook his head in annoyance .     don   t say that  daneel .  i have supervision enough .  the question in my mind is how closely i am to be supervised on aurora itself .     daneel said     partner elijah  it seems to me it will be difficult to allow you free access to aurora and aurorans .        that is just what i must be allowed  nevertheless .  if i   m to get to the truth of this case of roboticide  i must be free to seek information directly on the site  and from the people involved .     baley was  by now  feeling quite himself though a bit weary .  embarrassingly enough  the intense experience he had passed through left him with a keen desire for a pipe of tobacco  something he thought he had done away with altogether better than a year before .  he could feel the taste and odor of the tobacco smoke making its way through his throat and nose .  he would  he knew  have to make do with the memory .  on aurora  he would on no account be allowed to smoke .  there was no tobacco on any of the spacer worlds and  if he had had any on him to begin with  it would have been removed and destroyed .  daneel said     partner elijah  this must be discussed with dr .  fastolfe once we land .  i have no power to make any decisions in this matter .        fm aware of that  daneel  but how do i speak to fastolfe .  through the equivalent of an astrosimulator .  with controls in my hand .        not at all  partner elijah .  you will speak face to face .  he plans to meet you at the spaceport .         .   baley listened for the noises of landing .  he did not know what they might be  of course .  he did not know the mechanism of the ship  how many men and women it carried  what they would have to do in the process of landing  what in the way of noise would be involved .  shouts .  rumbles .  a dim vibration .  he heard nothing .  daneel said     you seem to be under tension  partner elijah .  i would prefer that you did not wait to tell me of any discomfort you might feel .  i must help you at the very moment you are  for any reason  unhappy .     there was a faint stress on the word    must .     baley thought absently  the first law drives him .  he surely suffered as much in his way as i suffered in mine when i collapsed and he did not foresee it in time .  a forbidden imbalance of positronic potentials may have no meaning to me  but it may produce in him the same discomfort and the same reaction as acute pain would to me .  he thought further  how can i tell what exists inside the pseudoskin and pseudoconsciousness of a robot  any more than daneel can tell what exists inside me .  and then  feeling remorse at having thought of daneel as a robot  baley looked into the other   s gentle eyes  when did he start thinking of their expression as gentle .   and said     i would tell you of any discomfort at once .  there is none .  i am merely trying to hear any noise that might tell me of the progress of the landing procedure  partner daneel .        thank you  partner elijah     said daneel gravely .  he bowed his head slightly and went on     there should be no discomfort in the landing .  you will feel acceleration  but that will be minimal  for this room will yield  to a certain extent  in the direction of the acceleration .  the temperature may go up  but not more than two degrees celsius .  as for sonic effects  there may be a low hiss as we pass through the thickening atmosphere .  will any of this disturb you .        it shouldn   t .  what does disturb mc is not being free to participate in the landing .  i would like to know about such things .  i do not want to be imprisoned and to be kept from the experience .        you have already discovered  partner elijah  that the nature of the experience does not suit your temperament .        and how am i to get over that  daneel .      he said strenuously .     that is not enough reason to keep mc here .        partner elijah  i have already explained that you are kept here for your own safety .     baley shook his head in clear disgust .     i have thought of that and i say it   s nonsense .  my chances of straightening out this mess are so small  with all the restrictions being placed on me and with the difficulty i will have in understanding anything about aurora  that i don   t think anyone in his right mind would bother to take the trouble to try to stop me .  and if they did  why bother attacking me personally .  why not sabotage the ship .  if we imagine ourselves to be facing no holds barred villains  they should find a ship  and the people aboard it  and you and giskard  and myself  of course  to be a small price to pay .        this has  in point of fact  been considered  partner elijah .  the ship has been carefully studied .  any signs of sabotage would be detected .        are you sure .  one hundred percent certain .        nothing of this sort can be absolutely certain .  giskard and i were comfortable  however  with the thought that the certainty was quite high and that we might proceed with minimal expectation of disaster .        and if you were wrong .     something like a small sign of spasm crossed daneel   s face  as though he were being asked to consider something that interfered with the smooth working of the positronic pathways in his brain .  he said     but we have not been wrong .        you cannot say that .  we arc approaching the landing and that is sure to be the danger moment .  in fact  at this point there is no need to sabotage the ship .  my personal danger is greatest now  right now .  i can   t hide in this room if i   m to disembark at aurora .  i will have to pass through the ship and be within reach of others .  have you taken precautions to keep the landing safe .      he was being petty  striking out at daneel needlessly because he was chafing at his long imprisonment  and at the indignity of his moment of collapse .   but daneel said calmly     we have  partner elijah .  and  incidentally  we have landed .  we arc now resting on the surface of aurora .     for a moment  baley was bewildered .  he looked around wildly  but of course there was nothing to see but an enclosing room .  he had felt and heard nothing of what daneel had described .  none of the acceleration  or heat  or wind whistle .    or had daneel deliberately brought up the matter of his personal danger once again  in order to make sure he would not think of other unsettling  but minor  matters .  baley said     and yet there   s still the matter of getting off the ship .  how do i do that without being vulnerable to possible enemies .     daneel walked to one wall and touched a spot upon it .  the wall promptly split in two  the two halves moving apart .  baley found himself looking into a long cylinder  a tunnel .  giskard had entered the room at that moment from the other side and said     sir  the three of us will move through the exit tube .  others have it under observation from without .  at the other end of the tube  dr .  fastolfe is waiting .        we have taken every precaution     said daneel .  baley muttered     my apologies  daneel  giskard .     he moved into the exit tube somberly .  every effort to assure that precautions had been taken also assured him that those precautions were thought necessary .  baley liked to think he was no coward  but he was on a strange planet  with no way of telling friend from enemy  with no way of taking comfort in anything familiar  except  of course  daneel  .  at crucial moments  he thought with a shiver  he would be without enclosure to warm him and to give him relief .     fastolfe     .   dr .  han fastolfe was indeed waiting  and smiling .  he was tall and thin  with light brown hair that was not very thick  and there were  of course  his ears .  it was the cars that baley remembered  even after three years .  large ears  standing away from his head  giving him a vaguely humorous appearance  a pleasant homeliness .  it was the ears that made baley smile  rather than fastolfe   s welcome .  baley wondered briefly if auroran medical technology did not extend to the minor plastic surgery required to correct the ungainliness of those ears .    but then  it might well be that fastolfe liked their appearance as baley himself  rather to his surprise  did .  there is something to be said about a face that makes one smile .  perhaps fastolfe valued being liked at first glance .  or was it that he found it useful to be underestimated .  or just different .  fastolfe said     plainclothesman elijah baley .  i remember you well  even though i persist in thinking of you as possessing the face of the actor who portrayed you .     baley   s face turned grim .     that hyperwave dramatization haunts me  dr .  fastolfe .  if i knew where i could go to escape it         nowhere     said fastolfe genially .     at least ordinarily .  so if you don   t like it  we   ll expunge it from our conversations right now .  i shall never mention it again .  agreed .        thank you .     with calculated suddenness  he thrust out his hand at fastolfe .  fastolfe hesitated perceptibly .  then he took baley   s hand  holding it gingerly  and not for long  and said     i shall assume you are not a walking sack of infection  mr .  baley .     then he said ruefully  staring at his hands     i must admit  though  that my hands have been treated with an inert film that doesn   t feel entirely comfortable .  i   m a creature of the irrational fears of my society .     baley shrugged .     so are we all .  i do not relish the thought of being outside  in the open air  that is .  for that matter  i do not relish having had to come to aurora under the circumstances in which i find myself .        i understand that well  mr .  baley .  i have a closed car for you here and  when we come to my establishment  we will do our best to continue to keep you enclosed .        thank you  but in the course of my stay on aurora  i feel that it will be necessary for me to stay outside on occasion .  i am prepared for that  as best i can be .        i understand  but we will inflict the outside on you only when it is necessary .  that is not now the case  so please consent to be enclosed .     the car was waiting in the shadow of the tunnel and there would scarcely be a trace of outside in passing from the latter to the former .  behind him  baley was aware of both daneel and giskard  quite dissimilar in appearance but both identical in grave and waiting attitude  and both endlessly patient .  fastolfe opened the back door and said     please to get in .     baley entered .  quickly and smoothly  daneel entered behind him  while giskard  virtually simultaneously  in what seemed a .  most like a well choreographed dance movement  entered on the other side .  baley found himself wedged  but not oppressively so  between them .  in fact  he welcomed the thought that  between himself and the outside  on both sides  was the thickness of a robotic body .  but there was no outside .  fastolfe climbed into the front scat and  as the door closed behind him  the windows blanked out and a soft  artificial light suffused the interior .  fastolfe said     i don   t generally drive this way  mr .  baley  but i don   t mind a great deal and you may find it more comfortable .  the car is completely computerized  knows where it   s going  and can deal with any obstructions or emergencies .  we need interfere in no way .     there was the faintest feeling of acceleration and then a vague  barely noticeable sensation of motion .  fastolfe said     this is a secure passage  mr .  baley .  i have gone to considerable trouble to make certain that as few people as possible know you will be in this car and certainly you will not be detected within it .  the trip by car  which rides on air jets  by the way  so that it is an airfoil  actually  will not take long  but  if you wish  you can seize the opportunity to rest .  you are quite safe now .        you speak     said baley     as though you think i   m in danger .  i was protected to the point of imprisonment on the ship  and again now .     baley looked about the small  enclosed interior of the car  within which he was hemmed by the frame of metal and opacified glass  to say nothing of the metallic frame of two robots .  fastolfe laughed lightly .     i am overreacting  i know  but feeling runs high on aurora .  you arrive here at a time of crisis for us and i would rather be made to look silly by overreacting than to run the terrible risk that underreacting entails .     baley said     i believe you understand  dr .  fastolfe  that my failure here would be a blow to earth .        i understand that well .  i am as determined as you are to prevent your failure .  believe me .        i do .  furthermore  my failure here  for whatever reason  will also be my personal and professional ruin on earth .     fastolfe turned in his seat to look at baley with a shocked expression .     really .  that would not be warranted .     baley shrugged .     i agree  but it will happen .  i will be the obvious target for a desperate earth government .        this was not in my mind when i asked for you  mr .  baley .  you may be sure i will do what i can .  though  in all honesty      his eyes fell away     that will be little enough  if we lose .        i know that     said baley dourly .  he leaned back against the soft upholstery and closed his eyes .  the motion of the car was limited to a gentle lulling sway  but baley did not sleep .  instead  he thought hard  for what that was worth .      .   baley did not experience the outside at the other end of the trip  either .  when he emerged from the airfoil  he was in an underground garage and a small elevator brought him up to ground level  as it turned out  .  he was ushered into a sunny room and  as he passed through the direct rays of the sun  yes  faintly orange   he shrank away a bit .  fastolfe noticed .  he said     the windows are not opacifiable  though they can be darkened .  i will do that  if you like .  in fact  i should have thought of that         no need     said baley gruffly .     i   ll just sit with my back to it .  i must acclimate myself .        if you wish  but let me know if  at any time  you grow too uncomfortable .    mr .  baley  it is late morning here on this part of aurora .  i don   t know your personal time on the ship .  if you have been awake for many hours and would like to sleep  that can be arranged .  if you are wakeful but not hungry  you need not eat .  however  if you feel you can manage it  you are welcome to have lunch with me in a short while .        that would fit in well with my personal time  as it happens .        excellent .  i   ll remind you that our day is about seven percent shorter than earth   s .  it shouldn   t involve you in too much biorhythmic difficulties  but if it does  we will try to adjust ourselves to your needs .        thank you .        finally   i have no clear idea what your food preferences might be .        i   ll manage to cat whatever is put before mc .        nevertheless  i won   t feel offended if anything seems  not palatable .        thank you .        and you won   t mind if daneel and giskard join us .     baley smiled faintly .     will they be eating  too .     there was no answering smile from fastolfe .  he said seriously     no  but i want them to be with you at all times .        still danger .  even here .        i trust nothing entirely .  even here .     a robot entered .     sir  lunch is served .     fastolfe nodded .     very good  faber .  we will be at the table in a few moments .     baley said     how many robots do you have .        quite a few .  we arc not at the solarian level of ten thousand robots to a human being  but i have more than the average number  fifty seven .  the house is a large one and it serves as my office and my workshop as well .  then  too  my wife  when i have one  must have space enough to be insulated from my work in a separate wing and must be served independently .        well  with fifty seven robots  i imagine you can spare two .  i feel the less guilty at your having sent giskard and daneel to escort mc to aurora .        it was no casual choice  i assure you  mr .  baley .  giskard is my majordomo and my right hand .  he has been with me all my adult life .        yet you sent him on the trip to get mc .  i am honored     said baley .     it is a measure of your importance  mr .  baley .  giskard is the most reliable of my robots  strong and sturdy .     baley   s eye flickered toward daneel and fastolfe added     i don   t include my friend daneel in these calculations .  he is not my servant  but an achievement of which i have the weakness to be extremely proud .  he is the first of his class and  while dr .  roj nemennuh sarton was his designer and mode .   the man who      he paused delicately  but baley nodded brusquely and said     i understand .     he did not require the phrase to be completed with a reference to sarton   s murder on earth .     while sarton supervised the actual construction     fastolfe went on     it was i whose theoretical calculations made daneel possible .     fastolfe smiled at daneel  who bowed his head in acknowledgment .  baley said     there was jander  too .        yes .     fastolfe shook his head and looked downcast .     i should perhaps have kept him with me  as i do daneel .  but he was my second humaniform and that makes a difference .  it is daneel who is my first born  so to speak  a special case .        and you construct no more humaniform robots now .        no more .  but come     said fastolfe  rubbing his hands .     we must have our lunch .    i do not think  mr .  baley  that on earth the population is accustomed to what i might term natural food .  we are having shrimp salad  together with bread and cheese  milk  if you wish  or any of an assortment of fruit juices .  it   s all very simple .  ice cream for dessert .        all traditional earth dishes     said baley     which exist now in their original form only in earth   s ancient literature .        none of it is entirely common here on aurora  but i didn   t think it made sense to subject you to our own version of gourmet dining  which involves food items and spices of auroran varieties .  the taste would have to be acquired .     he rose .     please come with me  mr .  baley .  there will just be the two of us and we will not stand on ceremony or indulge in unnecessary dining ritual .        thank you     said baley .     i accept that as a kindness .  i have relieved the tedium of the trip here by a rather intensive viewing of material relating to aurora and i know that proper politeness requires many aspects to a ceremonial meal that i would dread .        you need not dread .     baley said     could we break ceremony even to the extent of talking business over the meal  dr .  fastolfe .  i must not lose time unnecessarily .        i sympathize with that point of view .  we will indeed talk business and i imagine i can rely on you to say nothing to anyone concerning that lapse .  i would not want to be expelled from polite society .     he chuckled  then said     though i should not laugh .  it is nothing to laugh at .  losing time may be more than an inconvenience alone .  it could easily be fatal .         .   the room that baley left was a spare one  several chairs  a chest of drawers  something that looked like a piano but had brass valves in the place of keys  some abstract designs on the walls that seemed to shimmer with light .  the floor was a smooth checkerboard of several shades of brown  perhaps designed to be reminiscent of wood  and although it shone with highlights as though freshly waxed  it did not feel slippery underfoot .  the dining room  though it had the same floor  was like it in no other way .  it was a long rectangular room  overburdened with decoration .  it contained six large square tables that were clearly modules that could be assembled in various fashions .  a bar was to be found along one short wall  with gleaming bottles of various colors standing before a curved mirror that seemed to lend a nearly infinite extension to the room it reflected .  along the other short wall were four recesses  in each of which a robot waited .  both long walls were mosaics  in which the colors slowly changed .  one was a planetary scene  though baley could not tell if it were aurora  or another planet  or something completely imaginary .  at one end there was a wheat field  or something of that sort  filled with elaborate farm machinery  all robot controlled .  as one   s eye traveled along the length of the wall  that gave way to scattered human habitations  becoming  at the other end  what baley felt to be the auroran version of a city .  the other long wall was astronomical .  a planet  blue white  lit by a distant sun  reflected light in such a manner that not the closest examination could free one from the thought that it was slowly rotating .  the stars that surrounded it  some faint  some bright  seemed also to be changing their patterns  though when the eye concentrated on some small grouping and remained fixed there  the stars seemed immobile .  baley found it all confusing and repellent .  fastolfe said     rather a work of art  mr .  baley .  far too expensive to be worth it  though  but fanya would have it .    fanya is my current partner .        will she be joining us  dr .  fastolfe .        no  mr .  baley .  as i said  just the two of us .  for the duration  i have asked her to remain in her own quarters .  i do not want to subject her to this problem we have .  you understand  i hope .        yes  of course .        come .  please take your scat .     one of the tables was set with dishes  cups  and elaborate cutlery  not all of which were familiar to baley .  in the center was a tall  somewhat tapering cylinder that looked as though it might be a gigantic chess pawn made out of a gray rocky material .  baley  as he sat down  could not resist reaching toward it and touching it with a finger .  fastolfe smiled .     it   s a spicer .  it possesses simple controls that allows one to use it to deliver a fixed amount of any of a dozen different condiments on any portion of a dish .  to do it properly  one picks it up and performs rather intricate evolutions that are meaningless in themselves but that are much valued by fashionable aurorans as symbols of the grace and delicacy with which meals should be served .  when i was younger  i could  with my thumb and two fingers  do the triple genuflection and produce salt as the spicer struck my palm .  now if i tried it  i   d run a good risk of braining my guest .  i trust you won   t mind if i do not try .        i urge you not to try  dr .  fastolfe .     a robot placed the salad on the table  another brought a tray of fruit juices  a third brought the bread and cheese  a fourth adjusted the napkins .  all four operated in close coordination  weaving in and out without collision or any sign of difficulty .  baley watched them in astonishment .  they ended  without any apparent sign of prearrangements  one at each side of the table .  they stepped back in unison  bowed in unison  turned in unison  and returned to the recesses along the wall at the far end of the room .  baley was suddenly aware of daneel and giskard in the room as well .  he had not seen them come in .  they waited in two recesses that had somehow appeared along the wall with the wheat field .  daneel was the closer .  fastolfe said     now that they   ve gone      he paused and shook his head slowly in rueful conclusion .     except that they haven   t .  ordinarily  it is customary for the robots to leave before lunch actually begins .  robots do not eat  while human beings do .  it therefore makes sense that those who eat do so and that those who do not leave .  and it has ended by becoming one more ritual .  it would be quite unthinkable to eat until the robots left .  in this case  though         they have not left     said baley .     no .  i felt that security came before etiquette and i felt that  not being an auroran  you would not mind .     baley waited for fastolfe to make the first move .  fastolfe lifted a fork  so did baley .  fastolfe made use of it  moving slowly and allowing baley to see exactly what he was doing .  baley bit cautiously into a shrimp and found it delightful .  he recognized the taste  which was like the shrimp paste produced on earth but enormously more subtle and rich .  he chewed slowly and  for a while  despite his anxiety to get on with the investigation while dining  he found it quite unthinkable to do anything but give his full attention to the lunch .  it was  in fact  fastolfe who made the first move .     shouldn   t we make a beginning on the problem  mr .  baley .     baley felt himself flush slightly .     yes .  by all means .  i ask your pardon .  your auroran food caught mc by surprise  so that it was difficult for me to think of anything else .    the problem  dr .  fastolfe  is of your making  isn   t it .        why do you say that .        someone has committed roboticide in a manner that requires great expertise  as i have been told .        roboticide .  an amusing term .     fastolfe smiled .     of course  i understand what you mean by it .    you have been told correctly  the manner requires enormous expertise .        and only you have the expertise to carry it out  as i have been told .        you have been told correctly there  too .        and even you yourself admit  in fact  you insist  that only you could have put jander into a mental freeze out .        i maintain what is  after all  the truth  mr .  baley .  it would do me no good to lie  even if i could bring myself to do so .  it is notorious that i am the outstanding theoretical roboticist in all the fifty worlds .        nevertheless  dr .  fastolfe  might not the second best theoretical roboticist in all the worlds  or the third best  or even the fifteenth best  nevertheless possess the necessary ability to commit the deed .  does it really require all the ability of the very best .     fastolfe said calmly     in my opinion  it really requires all the ability of the very best .  indeed  again in my opinion  i  myself  could only accomplish the task on one of my good days .  remember that the best brains in robotics  including mine   have specifically labored to design positronic brains that could not be driven into mental freeze out .        are you certain of all that .  really certain .        completely .        and you stated so publicly .        of course .  there was a public inquiry  my dear earthman .  i was asked the questions you arc now asking and i answered truthfully .  it is an auroran custom to do so .     baley said     i do not  at the moment  question that you were convinced you were answering truthfully .  but might you not have been swayed by a natural pride in yourself .  that might also be typically auroran  might it not .        you mean that my anxiety to be considered the best would make me willingly put myself in a position where everyone would be forced to conclude i had mentally frozen jander .        i picture you  somehow  as content to have your political and social status destroyed  provided your scientific reputation remained intact .        i see .  you have an interesting way of thinking  mr .  baley .  this would not have occurred to me .  given a choice between admitting i was second best and admitting i was guilty of  to use your phrase  a roboticide  you are of the opinion i would knowingly accept the latter .        no  dr .  fastolfe  i do not wish to present the matter quite so simplistically .  might it not be that you deceive yourself into thinking you are the greatest of all roboticists and that you are completely unrivaled  clinging to that at all costs  because you unconsciously  unconsciously  dr .  fastolfe  realize that  in fact  you are being overtaken  or have even already been overtaken  by others .     fastolfe laughed  but there was an edge of annoyance in it .     not so  mr .  baley .  quite wrong .        think  dr .  fastolfe .  arc you certain that none of your roboticist colleagues can approach you in brilliance .        there are only a few who are capable of dealing at all with humaniform robots .  daneel   s construction created virtually a new profession for which there is not even a name  humaniformicists  perhaps .  of the theoretical roboticists on aurora  not one  except for myself  understands the workings of daneel   s positronic brain .  dr .  sarton did  but he is dead  and he did not understand it as well as i do .  the basic theory is mine .        it may have been yours to begin with  but surely you can   t expect to maintain exclusive ownership .  has no one learned the theory .     fastolfe shook his head firmly .     not one .  i have taught no one and i defy any other living roboticist to have developed the theory on his own .     baley said  with a touch of irritation     might there not be a bright young man  fresh out of the university  who is cleverer than anyone yet realizes  who         no  mr .  baley  no .  i would have known such a young man .  he would have passed through my laboratories .  he would have worked with me .  at the moment  no such young man exists .  eventually  one will  perhaps many will .  at the moment  none .        if you died  then  the new science dies with you .        i am only a hundred and sixty five years old .  that   s metric years  of course  so it is only a hundred and twenty four of your earth years  more or less .  i am still quite young by auroran standards and there is no medical reason why my life should be considered even half over .  it is not entirely unusual to reach an age of four hundred years  metric years .  there is yet plenty of time to teach .     they had finished eating  but neither man made any move to leave the table .  nor did any robot approach to clear it .  it was as though they were transfixed into immobility by the intensity of the back and forth flow of talk .  baley   s eyes narrowed .  he said     dr .  fastolfe  two years ago i was on solaria .  there i was given the clear impression that the solarians were  on the whole  the most skilled roboticists in all the worlds .        on the whole  that   s probably true .        and not one of them could have done the deed .        not one  mr .  baley .  their skill is with robots who are  at best  no more advanced than my poor  reliable giskard .  the solarians know nothing of the construction of humaniform robots .        how can you be sure of that .        since you were on solaria  mr .  baley  you know very well that solarians can approach each other with only the greatest of difficulty  that they interact by trimensional viewing  except where sexual contact is absolutely required .  do you think that any of them would dream of designing a robot so human in appearance that it would activate their neuroses .  they would so avoid the possibility of approaching him  since he would look so human  that they could make no reasonable use of him .        might not a solarian here or there display a surprising tolerance for the human body .  how can you be sure .        even if a solarian could  which i do not deny  there are no solarian nationals on aurora this year .        none .        none .  they do not like to be thrown into contact even with aurorans and  except on the most urgent business  none will come here  or to  any other world .  even in the case of urgent business  they will come no closer than orbit and then they deal with us only by electronic communication .     baley said     in that case  if you are  literally and actually   the only person in all the worlds who could have done it  did you kill jander .     fastolfe said     i cannot believe that daneel did not tell you i have denied this deed .        he did tell me so  but i want to hear it from you .     fastolfe crossed his arms and frowned .  he said  through clenched teeth     then i   ll tell you so .  i did not do it .     baley shook his head .     i believe you believe that statement .        i do .  and most sincerely .  i am telling the truth .  i did not kill jander .        but if you did not do it  and if no one else can possibly have done it  then   but wait .  i am  perhaps  making an unwarranted assumption .  is jander really dead or have i been brought here under false pretenses .        the robot is really destroyed .  it will be quite possible to show him to you  if the legislature does not bar my access to him before the day is over  which i don   t think they will do .        in that case  if you did not do it  and if no one else could possibly have done it  and if the robot is actually dead  who committed the crime .     fastolfe sighed .     i   m sure daneel told you what i have maintained at the inquiry  but you want to hear it from my own lips .        that is right  dr .  fastolfe .        well  then  no one committed the crime .  it was a spontaneous event in the positronic flow along the brain paths that set up the mental freeze out in jander .        is that likely .        no  it is not .  it is extremely unlikely  but if i did not do it  then that is the only thing that can have happened .        might it not be argued that there is a greater chance that you arc lying than that a spontaneous mental freeze out took place .        many do so argue .  but i happen to know that i did not do it and that leaves only the spontaneous event as a possibility .        and you have had me brought here to demonstrate  to prove  that the spontaneous event did  in fact  take place .        yes .        but how does one go about proving the spontaneous event .  only by proving it  it seems  can i save you  earth  and myself .        in order of increasing importance  mr .  baley .     baley looked annoyed .     well  then  you  me  and earth .        i   m afraid     said fastolfe     that after considerable thought  i have come to the conclusion that there is no way of obtaining such a proof .         .   baley stared at fastolfe in horror .     no way .        no way .  none .     and then  in a sudden fit of apparent abstraction  he seized the spicer and said     you know  i am curious to see if i can still do the triple genuflection .     he tossed the spicer into the air with a calculated flip of the wrist .  it somersaulted and  as it came down  fastolfe caught the narrow end on the side of his right palm  his thumb tucked down  .  it went up slightly and swayed and was caught on the side of the left palm .  it went up again in reverse and was caught on the side of the right palm and then again on the left palm .  after this third genuflection  it was lifted with sufficient force to produce a ftp .  fastolfe caught it in his right fist  with his left hand nearby  palm upward .  once the spicer was caught  fastolfe displayed his left hand and there was a fine sprinkling of salt in it .  fastolfe said     it is a childish display to the scientific mind and the effort is totally disproportionate to the end  which is  of course  a pinch of salt  but the good auroran host is proud of being able to put on a display .  there are some experts who can keep the spicer in the air for a minute and a half  moving their hands almost more rapidly than the eye can follow .     of course     he added thoughtfully     daneel can perform such actions with greater skill and speed than any human .  i have tested him in this manner in order to check on the workings of his brain paths  but it would be totally wrong to have him display such talents in public .  it would needlessly humiliate human spicists  a popular term for them  you understand  though you won   t find it in dictionaries .     baley grunted .  fastolfe sighed .     but we must get back to business .        you brought mc through several parsecs of space for that purpose .        indeed  i did .    let us proceed .     baley said     was there a reason for that display of yours  dr .  fastolfe .     fastolfe said     well  we seem to have come to an impasse .  i   ve brought you here to do something that can   t be done .  your face was rather eloquent and  to tell you the truth  i felt no better .  it seemed  therefore  that we could use a breathing space .  and now  let us proceed .        on the impossible task .        why should it be impossible for you  mr .  baley .  your reputation is that of an achiever of the impossible .         the hyperwave drama .  you believe that foolish distortion of what happened on solaria .     fastolfe spread his arms .     i have no other hope .     baley said     and i have no choice .  i must continue to try  i cannot return to earth a failure .  that has been made clear to me .    tell me  dr .  fastolfe  how could jander have been killed .  what sort of manipulation of his mind would have been required .        mr .  baley  i don   t know how i could possibly explain that  even to another roboticist  which you certainly arc not  and even if i were prepared to publish my theories  which i certainly am not .  however  let me sec if i can   t explain something .    you know  of course  that robots were invented on earth .        very little concerning robotics is dealt with on earth         earth   s strong antirobot bias is well known on the spacer worlds .        but the earthly origin of robots is obvious to any person on earth who thinks about it .  it is well known that hyperspatial travel was developed with the aid of robots and  since the spacer worlds could not have been settled without hypcrspatial travel  it follows that robots existed before settlement had taken place and while earth was still the only inhabited planet .  robots were therefore invented on earth by earthpeople .        yet earth feels no pride in that  does it .        we do not discuss it     said baley shortly .     and earthpeople know nothing about susan calvin .        i have come across her name in a few old books .  she was one of the early pioneers in robotics .        is that all you know of her .     baley made a gesture of dismissal .     i suppose i could find out more if i searched the records  but i have had no occasion to do so .     how strange     said fastolfe .     she   s a demigod to all spacers  so much so that i imagine that few spacers who are not actually roboticists think of her as an earthwoman .  it would seem a profanation .  they would refuse to believe it if they were told that she died after having lived scarcely more than a hundred metric years .  and yet you know her only as an early pioneer .        has she got something to do with all this  dr .  fastolfe .        not directly  but in a way .  you must understand that numerous legends cluster about her name .  most    of them are undoubtedly untrue  but they cling to her  nonetheless .  one of the most famous legends  and one of the least likely to be true   concerns a robot manufactured in those primitive days that  through some accident on the production lines  turned out to have telepathic abilities         what .        a legend .  i told you it was a legend  and undoubtedly untrue .  mind you  there is some theoretical reason for supposing this might be possible  though no one has ever presented a plausible design that could even begin to incorporate such an ability .  that it could have appeared in positronic brains as crude and simple as those in the prehyperspatial era is totally unthinkable .  that is why we are quite certain that this particular talc is an invention .  but let mc go on anyway  for it points out a moral .        by all means  go on .        the robot  according to the tale  could read minds .  and when asked questions  he read the questioner   s mind and told the questioner what he wanted to hear .  now the first law of robotics states quite clearly that a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a person to come to harm  but t  robots generally that means physical harm .  a robot who can read minds  however  would surely decide that disappointment or anger or any violent emotion would make the human being feeling those emotions unhappy and the robot would interpret the inspiring of such emotions under the heading of    harm .     if  then  a telepathic robot knew that the truth might disappoint or enrage a questioner or cause that person to feel envy or unhappiness  he would tell a pleasing lie  instead .  do you see that .        yes  of course .        so the robot lied even to susan calvin herself .  the lies could not long continue  for different people were told different things that were not only inconsistent among themselves but unsupported by the gathering evidence of reality  you see .  susan calvin discovered she had been lied to and realized that those lies had led her into a position of considerable embarrassment .  what would have disappointed her somewhat to begin with had now  thanks to false hopes  disappointed her unbearably .    you never heard the story .        i give you my word .        astonishing .  yet it certainly wasn   t invented on aurora  for it is equally current on all the worlds .    in any case  calvin took her revenge .  she pointed out to the robot that  whether he told the truth or told a lie  he would equally harm the person with whom he dealt .  he could not obey the first law  whatever action he took .  the robot  understanding this  was forced to take refuge in total inaction .  if you want to put it colorfully  his positronic pathways burned out .  his brain was irrecoverably destroyed .  the legend goes on to say that calvin   s last word to the destroyed robot was    liar .     baley said     and something like this  i take it  was what happened to jander panel .  he was faced with a contradiction in terms and his brain burned out .        it   s what appears to have happened  though that is not as easy to bring about as it would have been in susan calvin   s day .  possibly because of the legend  roboticists have always been careful to make it as difficult as possible for contradictions to arise .  as the theory of positronic brains has grown more subtle and as the practice of positronic brain design has grown more intricate  increasingly successful systems have been devised to have all situations that might arise resolve into nonequality  so that some action can always be taken that will be interpreted as obeying the first law .        well  then  you can   t burn out a robot   s brain .  is that what you   re saying .  because if you arc  what happened to jander .        it   s not what i   m saying .  the increasingly successful systems i speak of  are never completely successful .  they cannot be .  no matter how subtle and intricate a brain might be  there is always some way of setting up a contradiction .  that is a fundamental truth of mathematics .  it will remain forever impossible to produce a brain so subtle and intricate as to reduce the chance of contradiction to zero .  never quite to zero .  however  the systems have been made so close to zero that to bring about a mental freeze out by setting up a suitable contradiction would require a deep understanding of the particular positronic brain being dealt with  and that would take a clever theoretician .        such as yourself  dr .  fastolfe .        such as myself .  in the case of humaniform robots  only myself .        or no one at all     said baley  heavily ironic .     or no one at all .  precisely     said fastolfe  ignoring the irony .     the humaniform robots have brains  and  i might add  bodies  constructed in conscious imitation of the human being .  the positronic brains are extraordinarily delicate and they take on some of the fragility of the human brain  naturally .  just as a human being may have a stroke  though some chance event within the brain and without the intervention of any external effect  so a humaniform brain might  through chance alone  the occasional aimless drifting of positrons  go into mental freeze .        can you prove that  dr .  fastolfe .        i can demonstrate it mathematically  but of those who could follow the mathematics  not all would agree that the reasoning was valid .  it involves certain suppositions of my own that do not fit into the accepted modes of thinking in robotics .        and how likely is spontaneous mental freeze out .        given a large number of humaniform robots  say a hundred thousand  there is an even chance that one of them might undergo spontaneous mental freeze out in an average auroran lifetime .  and yet it could happen much sooner  as it did to jander  although then the odds would be very greatly against it .        but look here  dr .  fastolfe  even if you were to prove conclusively that a spontaneous mental freeze out could take place in robots generally  that would not be the same as proving that such a thing happened to jander in particular at this particular time .        no     admitted fastolfe     you arc quite right .        you  the greatest expert in robotics  cannot prove it in the specific case of jander .        again  you are quite right .        then what do you expect mc to be able to do  when i know nothing of robotics .        there is no need to prove anything .  it would surely be sufficient to present an ingenious suggestion that would make spontaneous mental freeze out plausible to the general public .        such as         i don   t know .     baley said harshly .     are you sure you don   t know  dr .  fastolfe .        what do you mean .  i have just said i don   t know        let me point out something .  i assume that aurorans  generally  know that i have come to the planet for the purpose of tackling this problem .  it would be difficult to manage to get me here secretly  considering that i am an earthman and this is aurora .        yes  certainly  and   made no attempt to do that .  i consulted the chairman of the legislature and persuaded him to grant me permission to bring you here  it is how i   ve managed to win a stay in judgment .  you are to be given a chance to solve the mystery before i go on trial  i doubt that they   ll give me a very long stay .        i repeat  then   aurorans  in general  know i   m here and i imagine they know precisely why i am here  that i am supposed to solve the puzzle of the death of jander .        of course .  what other reason could there be .        and from the time i boarded the ship that brought me here  you have kept me under close and constant guard because of the danger that your enemies might try to eliminate me  judging me to be some sort of wonderman who just might solve the puzzle in such a way as to place you on the winning side  even though all the odds are against me .        i fear that as a possibility  yes       and suppose someone who does not want to see the puzzle solved and you  dr .  fastolfe  exonerated should actually succeed in killing rue .  might that not swing sentiment in your favor .  might not people reason that your enemies felt you were  in actual fact  innocent or they would not fear the investigation so much that they would want to kill me .        rather complicated reasoning  mr .  baley .  i suppose that  properly exploited  your death might be used to such a purpose  but ifs not going to happen .  you are being protected and you will not be killed .        but why protect me  dr .  fastolfe .  why not let them kill me and use my death as a way of winning .        because i would rather you remained alive and succeeded in actually demonstrating my innocence .     baley said     but surely you know that i can   t demonstrate your innocence .        perhaps you can .  you have every incentive .  the welfare of earth hangs on your doing so and  as you have told me  your own career .        what good is incentive .  if you ordered me to fly by flapping my arms and told me further that if i failed  i would be promptly killed by slow torture arid that earth would be blown up and all its population destroyed  i would have enormous incentive to flap my wings and fly  and yet still be unable to do so .  fastolfe said uneasily     i know the chances are small .        you know they are nonexistent     said baley violently     and that only my death can save you .        then i will not be saved  for i am seeing to it that my enemies cannot reach you .        but you can reach me .        what .        i have the thought in my head  dr .  fastolfe  that you yourself might kill me in such a way as to make it appear that your enemies have done the deed .  you would then use my death against them  and that that is why you have brought me to aurora .     for a moment  fastolfe looked at baley with a kind of mild surprise and then  in an excess of passion both sudden and extreme  his face reddened and twisted into a snarl .  sweeping up the spicer from the table  he raised it high and brought his arm down to hurl it at baley .  and baley  caught utterly by surprise  barely managed to cringe back against his chair .     daneel and giskard     .   if fastolfe had acted quickly  daneel had reacted far more quickly still .  to baley  who had all but forgotten daneel   s existence  there seemed a vague rush  a confused sound  and then daneel was standing to one side of fastolfe  holding the spicer  and saying     i trust  dr .  fastolfe  that i did not in any way hurt you .     baley noted  in a dazed sort of way  that giskard was not far from fastolfe on the other side and that every one of the four robots at the far wall had advanced almost to the dining room table .  panting slightly  fastolfe  his hair quite disheveled  said     no  daneel .  you did very well  indeed .     he raised his voice .     you all did well  but remember  you must allow nothing to slow you down  even my own involvement .     he laughed softly and took his seat once more  straightening his hair with his hand .     i   m sorry     he said     to have startled you so  mr .  baley  but i felt the demonstration might be more convincing than any words of mine would have been .     baley  whose moment of cringing had been purely a matter of reflex  loosened his collar and said  with a touch of hoarseness     i   m afraid i expected words  but i agree the demonstration was convincing .  i   m glad that daneel was close enough to disarm you .        any one of them was close enough to disarm me  but daneel was the closest and got to me first .  he got to me quickly enough to be gentle about it .  had he been farther away  he might have had to wrench my arm or even knock me out .        would he have gone that far .        mr .  baley     said fastolfe .     i have given instructions for your protection and i know how to give instructions .  they would not have hesitated to save you  even if the alternative was harm to me .  they would  of course  have labored to inflict minimum harm  as daneel did .  all he harmed was my dignity and the neatness of my hair .  and my fingers tingle a bit .     fastolfe flexed them ruefully .  baley drew a deep breath  trying to recover from that short period of confusion .  he said     would not daneel have protected me  even without your specific instruction .        undoubtedly .  he would have had to .  you must not think  however  that robotic response is a simple yes or no  up or down  in or out .  it is a mistake the layman often makes .  there is the matter of speed of response .  my instructions with regard to you were so phrased that the potential built up within the robots of my establishment  including daneel  is abnormally high  as high as i can reasonably make it  in fact .  the response  therefore  to a clear and present danger to you is extraordinarily rapid .  i knew it would be and it was for that reason that i could strike out at you as rapidly as i did  knowing i could give you a most convincing demonstration of my inability to harm you .        yes  but i don   t entirely thank you for it .        oh  i was entirely confident in my robots  especially daneel .  it did occur to me  though  a little too late  that if i had not instantly released the spicer  he might  quite against his will  or the robotic equivalent of will  have broken my wrist .     baley said     it occurs to me that it was a foolish risk for you to have undertaken .        it occurs to me  as well  after the fact .  now if you had prepared yourself to hurl the spicer at me  daneel would have at once countered your move  but not with quite the same speed  for he has received no special instructions as to my safety .  i can hope he would have been fast enough to save me  but i   m not sure  and i would prefer not to test that matter .     fastolfe smiled genially .  baley said     what if some explosive device were dropped on the house from some airborne vehicle .        or if a gamma beam were trained upon us from a neighboring hilltop .    my robots do not represent infinite protection  but such radical terrorist attempts are unlikely in the extreme here on aurora .  i suggest we do not worry about them .        i am waffling not to worry about them .  indeed  i did not seriously suspect that you were a danger to me  dr .  fastolfe  but i needed to eliminate the possibility altogether if i were to continue .  we can now proceed .     fastolfe said     yes  we can .  despite this additional and very dramatic distraction  we still face the problem of proving that jander   s mental freeze out was spontaneous chance .     but baley had been made aware of daneel   s presence and he now turned to him and said uneasily     daneel  does it pain you that we discuss this matter .     daneel  who had deposited the spicer on one of the farther of the empty tables  said     partner elijah  i would prefer that past friend jander were still operational  but since he is not and since he cannot be restored to proper functioning  the best of what is left is that action be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future .  since the discussion now has that end in view  it pleases rather than pains me .        well  then  just to settle another matter  daneel  do you believe that dr .  fastolfe is responsible for the end of your fellow robot jander .    you   ll pardon my inquiring  dr .  fastolfe .     fastolfe gestured his approval and daneel said     dr .  fastolfe has stated that he was not responsible  so he  of course  was not .        you have no doubts on the matter  daneel .        none  partner elijah .     fastolfe seemed a little amused .     you are cross examining a robot  mr .  baley .        i know that  but i cannot quite think of daneel as a robot and so i have asked .        his answers would have no standing before any board of inquiry .  he is compelled to believe me by his positronic potentials .        i am not a board of inquiry  dr .  fastolfe  and i am clearing out the underbrush .  let me go back to where i was .  either you burned out jander   s brain or it happened by random circumstance .  you assure me that i cannot prove random circumstance and that leaves me only with the task of disproving any action by you .  in other words  if i can show that it is impossible for you to have killed jander  we are left with random circumstance as the only alternative .        and how can you do that .        it is a matter of means  opportunity  and motive .  you had the means of killing jander  the theoretical ability to so manipulate him that he would end in a mental freeze out .  but did you have the opportunity .  he was your robot  in that you designed his brain paths and supervised his construction  but was he in your actual possession at the time of the mental freeze out .        no  as a matter of fact .  he was in the possession of another .        for how long .        about eight months  or a little over half of one of your years .        ah .  it   s an interesting point .  were you with him  or near him  at the time of his destruction .  could you have reached him .  in short  can we demonstrate the fact that you were so far from him  or so out of touch with him  that it is not reasonable to suppose that you could have done the deed at the time it is supposed to have been done .     fastolfe said     that  i   m afraid  is impossible .  there is a rather broad interval of time during which the deed might have been done .  there are no robotic changes after destruction equivalent to rigor mortis or decay in a human being .  we can only say that  at a certain time  jander was known to be in operation and  at a certain other time  he was known not to be in operation .  between the two was a stretch of about eight hours .  for that period  i have no alibi .        none .  during that time  dr .  fastolfe  what were you doing .        i was here in my establishment .        your robots were surely aware  perhaps  that you were here and could bear witness .        they were certainly aware  but they cannot bear witness in any legal sense and on that day fanya was off on business of her own .        does fanya share your knowledge of robotics  by the way .     fastolfe indulged in a wry smile .     she knows less than you do .    besides  none of this matters .        why not .     fastolfe   s patience was clearly beginning to stretch to the cracking point .     my dear mr .  baley  this was not a matter of close range physical assault  such as my recent pretended attack on you .  what happened to jander did not require my physical presence .  as it happens  although not actually in my establishment  jander was not far away geographically  but it wouldn   t have mattered if he were on the other side of aurora .  i could always reach him electronically and could  by the orders i gave him and the responses i could educe  send him into mental freeze out .  the crucial step would not even necessarily require much in the way of time      baley said at once     it   s a short process  then  one that someone else might move through by chance  while intending something perfectly routine .        no .     said fastolfe .     for aurora   s sake  earthman  let me talk .  i   ve already told you that   s not the case .  inducing mental freeze out in jander would be a long and complicated and tortuous process  requiring the greatest understanding and wit  and could be done by no one accidentally  without incredible and long continued coincidence .  there would be far less chance of accidental progress over that enormously complex route than of spontaneous mental freeze out  if my mathematical reasoning were only accepted .     however  if i wished to induce mental freeze out  i could carefully produce changes and reactions  little by little  over a period of weeks  months  even years  until i had brought jander to the very point of destruction .  and at no time in that process would he show any signs of being at the edge of catastrophe  just as you could approach closer and closer to a precipice in the dark and yet feel no loss in firmness of footing whatever  even at the very edge .  once i had brought him to the very brink  however  the lip of the precipice  a single remark from me would send him over .  it is that final step that would take but a moment of time .  you see .     baley tightened his lips .  there was no use trying to mask his disappointment .     in short  then  you had the opportunity .        anyone would have had the opportunity .  anyone on aurora  provided he or she had the necessary ability .        and only you have the necessary ability .        i   m afraid so .        which brings us to motive  dr .  fastolfe .             and it   s there that we might be able to make a good case .  these humaniform robots are yours .  they are based on your theory and you were involved in their construction at every step of the way  even if dr .  sarton supervised that construction .  they exist because of you and only because of you .  you have spoken of daneel as your    first born .     they are your creations  your children  your gift to humanity  your hold on immortality .      baley felt himself growing eloquent and  for a moment  imagined himself to be addressing a board of inquiry .      why on earth  or aurora  rather  why on aurora should you undo this work .  why should you destroy a life you have produced by a miracle of mental labor .     fastolfe looked wanly amused .     why  mr .  baley  you know nothing about it .  how can you possibly know that my theory was the result of a miracle of mental labor .  it might have been the very dull extension of an equation that anyone might have accomplished but which none had bothered to do before me .        i think not     said baley  endeavoring to cool down .     if no one but you can understand the humaniform brain well enough to destroy it  then i think it likely that no one but you can understand it well enough to create it .  can you deny that .     fastolfe shook his head .     no  i won   t deny that .  and yet  mr .  baley     his face grew grimmer than it had been since they had met     your careful analysis is succeeding only in making matters far worse for us .  we have already decided that i am the only one with the means and the opportunity .  as it happens  i also have a motive  the best motive in the world  and my enemies know it .  how on earth  then  to quote you  or on aurora  or on anywhere  are we going to prove i didn   t do it .         .   baley   s face crumpled into a furious frown .  he stepped hastily away  making for the corner of the room  as though seeking enclosure .  then he turned suddenly and said sharply     dr .  fastolfe  it seems to me that you are taking some sort of pleasure in frustrating me .     fastolfe shrugged .     no pleasure .  i   m merely presenting you with the problem as it is .  poor jander died the robotic death by the pure uncertainty of positronic drift .  since i know i had nothing to do with it  i know that   s how it must be .  however  no one else can be sure i   m innocent and all the indirect evidence points to me  and this must be faced squarely in deciding what  if anything  we can do .     baley said     well  then  let   s investigate your motive .  what seems like an overwhelming motive to you may be nothing of the sort .        i doubt that .  i am no fool  mr .  baley .        you are also no judge  perhaps  of yourself and your motives .  people sometimes are not .  you may be dramatizing yourself for some reason .        i don   t think so .        then tell me your motive .  what is it .  tell me .        not so quickly  mr .  baley .  it   s not easy to explain it .    could you come outside with me .     baley looked quickly toward the window .  outside .  the sun had sunk lower in the sky and the room was the sunnier for it .  he hesitated  then said  rather more loudly than was necessary     yes  i will .        excellent     said fastolfe .  and then  with an added note of amiability  he added     but perhaps you would care to visit the personal first .     baley thought for a moment .  he felt no immediate urgency  but he did not know what might await him outside  how long he would be expected to stay  what facilities there might or might not be there .  most of all  he did not know auroran customs in this respect and he could not recall anything in the book films he had viewed on the ship that served to enlighten him in this respect .  it was safest  perhaps  to acquiesce in whatever one   s host suggested .     thank you     he said     if it will be convenient for me to do so  fastolfe nodded .     daneel     he said     show mr .  baley to the visitors    personal .     daneel said     partner elijah  would you come with me .     as they stepped together into the next room  baley said     i am sorry  daneel  that you were not part of the conversation between myself and dr .  fastolfe .        it would not have been fitting  partner elijah .  when you asked me a direct question  i answered  but i was not invited to take part fully .        i would have issued the invitation  daneel  if i did not feel constrained by my position as guest .  i thought it might be wrong to take the initiative in this respect .        i understand .    this is the visitors    personal  partner elijah .  the door will open at a touch of your hand anywhere upon it if the room is unoccupied .     baley did not enter .  he paused thoughtfully  then said     if you had been invited to speak  daneel  is there anything you would have said .  any comment you would have cared to make .  i would value your opinion  my friend .     daneel said  with his usual gravity     the one remark i care to make is that dr .  fastolfe   s statement that he had an excellent motive for placing jander out of operation was unexpected to me .  i do not know what the motive might be .  whatever he states to be his motive  however  you might ask why he would not have the same motive to put me in mental freeze out .  if they can believe he had a motive to put jander out of operation  why would the same motive not apply to me .  i would be curious to know .     baley looked at the other sharply  seeking automatically for expression in a face not given to lack of control .  he said     do you feel insecure  daneel .  do you feel fastolfe is a danger to you .     daneel said     by the third law  i must protect my own existence  but i would not resist dr .  fastolfe or any human being if it were their considered opinion that it was necessary to end my existence .  that is the second law .  however  i know that i am of great value  both in terms of investment of material  labor  and time  and in terms of scientific importance .  it would therefore be necessary to explain to me carefully the reasons for the necessity of ending my existence .  dr .  fastolfe has never said anything to me  never  partner elijah  that would sound as though such a thing were in his mind .  i do not believe it is remotely in his mind to end my existence or that it ever was in his mind to end jander   s existence .  random positronic drift must have ended jander and may  someday  end me .  there is always an element of chance in the universe .     baley said     you say so  fastolfe says so  and i believe so  but the difficulty is to persuade people generally to accept this view of the matter .     he turned gloomily to the door of the personal and said     are you coming in with me  daneel .     daneel   s expression contrived to seem amused .     it is flattering  partner elijah  to be taken for human to this extent .  i have no need  of course .        of course .  but you can enter anyway .        it would not be appropriate for me to enter .  it is not the custom for robots to enter the personal .  the interior of such a room is purely human .    besides  this is a one person personal .        one person .     momentarily  baley was shocked .  he raffled  however .  other worlds  other customs .  and this one he did not recall being described in the book films .  he said     that   s what you meant  then  by saying that the door would open only if it were unoccupied .  what if it is occupied  as it will be in a moment .        then it will not open at a touch from outside  of course  and your privacy will be protected .  naturally  it will open at a touch from the inside .        and what if a visitor fell into a faint  had a stroke or a heart seizure while in there and could not touch the door from inside .  wouldn   t that mean no one could enter to help him .        there are emergency ways of opening the door  partner elijah  if that should seem advisable .     then  clearly disturbed     are you of the opinion that something of this sort will occur .        no  of course not .    i am merely curious .        i will be immediately outside the door     said daneel uneasily .     if i hear a call  partner elijah  i will take action .        i doubt that you   ll have to .     baley touched the door  casually and lightly  with the back of his hand and it opened at once .  he waited a moment or two to see if it would close .  it didn   t .  he stepped through and the door then closed promptly .  while the door was open  the personal had seemed like a room that flatly served its purpose .  a sink  a stall  presumably equipped with a shower arrangement   a tub  a translucent half door with a toilet seat beyond in all likelihood .  there were several devices that he did not quite recognize .  he assumed they were intended for the fulfillment of personal services of one sort or another .  he had little chance to study any of these  for in a moment it was all gone and he was left to wonder if what he had seen had really been there at all or if the devices had seemed to exist because they were what he had expected to see .  as the door closed  the room darkened  for there was no window .  when the door was completely closed  the room lit up again  but nothing of what he had seen returned .  it was daylight and he was outside  or so it appeared .  there was open sky above  with clouds drifting across it in a fashion just regular enough to seem clearly unreal .  on every side there seemed an outstretching of greenery moving in equally repetitive fashion .  he felt the familiar knotting of his stomach that arose whenever he found himself outside  but he was not outside .  he had walked into a windowless room .  it had to be a trick of the lighting .  he stared directly ahead of him and slowly slid his feet forward .  he put his hands out before him .  slowly .  staring hard .  his hands touched the smoothness of a wall .  he followed the flatness to either side .  he touched what he had seen to be a sink in that moment of original vision and  guided by his hands  he could see it now  faintly  faintly against the overpowering sensation of light .  he found the faucet  but no water came from it .  he followed its curve backward and found nothing that was the equivalent of the familiar handles that would control the flow of water .  he did find an oblong strip whose slight roughness marked it off from the surrounding wall .  as his fingers slid along it  he pushed slightly and experimentally against it and at once the greenery  which stretched far beyond the plane along which his fingers told him the wall existed  was parted by a rivulet of water  falling quickly from a height toward his feet with a loud noise of splashing .  he jumped backward in automatic panic  but the water ended before it reached his feet .  it didn   t stop coming  but it didn   t reach the floor .  he put his hand out .  it was not water  but a light illusion of water .  it did not wet his hand  he felt nothing .  but his eyes stubbornly resisted the evidence .  they saw water .  he followed the rivulet upward and eventually came to something that was water  a thinner stream issuing from the faucet .  it was cold .  his fingers found the oblong again and experimented  pushing here and there  the temperature shifted quickly and he found the spot that produced water of suitable tepidity .  he did not find any soap .  somewhat reluctantly  he began to rub his unsoaped hands against each other under what seemed a natural spring that should have been soaking him from head to foot but did not .  and as though the mechanism could read his mind or  more likely  was guided by the rubbing together of his hands  he felt the water grow soapy  while the spring he did didn   t see grew bubbles and developed into foam .  still reluctant  he bent over the sink and rubbed his face with the same soapy water .  he felt the bristles of his beard  but knew that there was no way in which he could translate the equipment of this room into a shave without instruction .  he finished and held his hands helplessly under the water .  how did he stop the soap .  he did not have to ask .  presumably  his hands  no longer rubbing either themselves or his face  controlled that .  the water lost its soapy feel and the soap was rinsed from his hands .  he splashed the water against his face   without rubbing  and that was rinsed too .  without the help of vision and with the clumsiness of one unused to the process  he managed to soak his shirt badly .  towels .  paper .  he stepped back  eyes closed  holding his    head forward to avoid dripping more water on his clothes .  stepping back was  apparently  the key action  for he felt the warm flow of an air current .  he placed his face within it and then his hands .  he opened his eyes and found the spring no longer flowing .  he used his hands and found that he could feel no real water .  the knot in his stomach had long since dissolved into irritation .  he recognized that personals varied enormously from world to world  but somehow this nonsense of simulated outside went too far .  on earth  a personal was a huge community chamber restricted to one gender  with private cubicles to which one had a key .  on solaria  one entered a personal through a narrow corridor appended to one side of a house  as though solarians hoped that it would not be considered a part of their home .  in both worlds  however  though so different in every possible way  the personals were clearly defined and the function of everything in them could not be mistaken .  why should there be  on aurora  this elaborate pretense of rusticity that totally masked every part of a personal .  why .  at any rate  his annoyance gave him little emotional room in which to feel uneasy over the pretense of outside .  he moved in the direction in which he recalled having seen the translucent half door .  it was not the correct direction .  he found it only by following the wall slowly and after barking various parts of his body against protuberances .  in the end  he found himself urinating into the illusion of a small pond that did not seem to be receiving the stream properly .  his knees told him that he was aiming correctly between the sides of what he took to be a urinal and he told himself that if he were using the wrong receptacle or misjudging his aim  the fault was not his .  for a moment  when done  he considered finding the sink again for a final hand rinse and decided against it .  he just couldn   t face the search and that false waterfall .  instead  he found  by groping  the door through which he had entered  but he did not know he had found it until his hand touch resulted in its opening .  the light died out at once and the normal nonillusory gleam of day surrounded him .  daneel was waiting for him  along with fastolfe and giskard .  fastolfe said     you took nearly twenty minutes .  we were beginning to fear for you .     baley felt himself grow warm with rage .     i had problems with your foolish illusions     he said in a tightly controlled fashion .  fastolfe   s mouth pursed and his eyebrows rose in a silent  oh h .  he said     there is a contact just inside the door that controls the illusion .  it can make it dimmer and allow you to see reality through it  or it can wipe out the illusion altogether  if you wish .        i was not told .  are all your personals like this .     fastolfe said     no .  personals on aurora commonly possess illusory qualities  but the nature of the illusion varies with the individual .  the illusion of natural greenery pleases me and i vary its details from time to time .  one grows tired of anything  you know  after a while .  there are some people who make use of erotic illusions  but that is not to my taste .     of course  when one is familiar with personals  the illusions offer no trouble .  the rooms are quite standard and one knows where everything is .  it   s no worse than moving about a well known place in the dark .    but tell me  mr .  baley  why didn   t you find your way out and ask for directions .     baley said     because i didn   t wish to .  i admit that i was extremely irritated over the illusions  but i accepted them .  after all  it was daneel who led me to the personal and he gave me no instructions  nor any warning .  he would certainly have instructed me at length  if he had been left to his own devices  for he would surely have foreseen harm to me otherwise .  i had to assume  therefore  that you had carefully instructed him not to warn me and  since i didn   t really expect you to play a practical joke on me  i had to assume that you had a serious purpose in doing so .        oh .        after all  you had asked me to come outside and  when i agreed  you immediately asked me if i wished to visit the personal .  i decided that the purpose of sending me into an illusion of outside was to see whether i could endure it  or if i would come running out in panic .  if i could endure it  i might be trusted with the real thing .  well  i endured it .  i   m a little wet  thank you  but that will dry soon enough .     fastolfe said     you are a clear thinking person  mr .  baley .  i apologize for the nature of the test and for the discomfort i caused you .  i was merely trying to ward off the possibility of far greater discomfort .  do you still wish to come out with me .        i not only wish it  dr .  fastolfe .  i insist on it .         .   they made their way through a corridor  with daneel and giskard following close behind .  fastolfe said chattily     i hope you won   t mind the robots accompanying us .  aurorans never go anywhere without at least one robot in attendance and  in your case in particular  i must insist that daneel and giskard be with you at all times .     he opened a door and baley tried to stand firm against the beat of sunshine and wind  to say nothing of the envelopment of the strange and subtly alien smell of aurora   s land .  fastolfe stayed to one side and giskard went out first .  the robot looked keenly about for a few moments .  one had the impression that all his senses were intently engaged .  he looked back and daneel joined him and did the same .     leave them for a moment  mr .  baley     said fastolfe     and they will tell us when they think it safe for us to emerge .  let me take the opportunity of once again apologizing for the scurvy trick i played on you with respect to the personal .  i assure you we would have known if you were in trouble  your various vital signs were being recorded .  i am very pleased  though not entirely surprised  that you penetrated my purpose .     he smiled and  with almost unnoticeable hesitation  placed his hand upon baley   s left shoulder and gave it a friendly squeeze .  baley held himself stiffly .     you seem to have forgotten your earlier scurvy trick  your apparent attack on me with the spicer .  if you will assure me that we will now deal with each other frankly and honestly  i will consider these matters as having been of reasonable intent .        done .        is it safe to leave now .     baley looked out to where giskard and daneel had moved farther and had separated from each other to right and left  still watching and sensing .     not quite yet .  they will move all around the establishment .    daneel tells me that you invited him into the personal with you .  was that seriously meant .        yes .  i knew he had no need  but i felt it might be impolite to exclude him .  i wasn   t sure of auroran custom in that respect  despite all the reading i did on auroran matters .        i suppose that isn   t one of those things aurorans feel necessary to mention and of course one can   t expect the books to make any attempt to prepare visiting earthmen concerning these subjects         because there are so few visiting earthmen .        exactly .  the point is  of course  that robots never visit personals .  it is the one place where human beings can be free of them .  i suppose there is the feeling that one should feel free of them at some periods and in some places .     baley said     and yet when daneel was on earth on the occasion of sarton   s death three years ago  i tried to keep him out of the community personal by saying he had no need .  still  he insisted on entering .        and rightly so .  he was  on that occasion  strictly instructed to give no indication he was not human  for reasons you well remember .  here on aurora  however   ah  they are done .     the robots were coming toward the door and daneel gestured them outward .  fastolfe held out his arm to bar baley   s way .     if you don   t mind  mr .  baley  i will go out first .  count to one hundred patiently and then join us .         .   baley  on the count of one hundred  stepped out firmly and walked toward fastolfe .  his face was perhaps too stiff  his jaws too tightly clenched  his back too straight .  he looked about .  the scene was not very different from that which had been presented in the personal .  fastolfe had  perhaps  used his own grounds as a model .  everywhere there was green and in one place there was a stream filtering down a slope .  it was  perhaps  artificial  but it was not an illusion .  the water was real .  he could feel the spray when he passed near it .  there was somehow a tameness to it all .  the outside on earth seemed wilder and more grandly beautiful  what little baley had seen of it .  fastolfe said  with a gentle touch on baley   s upper arm and a motion of his hand     come in this direction .  look there .     a space between two trees revealed an expanse of lawn .  for the first time  there was a sense of distance and on the horizon one could see a dwelling place  low roofed  broad  and so green in color that it almost melted into the countryside .     this is a residential area     said fastolfe .     it might not seem so to you  since you are accustomed to earth   s tremendous hives  but we are in the auroran city of eos  which is actually the administrative center of the planet .  there are twenty thousand human beings living here  which makes it the largest city  not only on aurora but on all the spacer worlds .  there are as many people in eos as on all of solaria .     fastolfe said it with pride .     how many robots  dr .  fastolfe .        in this area .  perhaps a hundred thousand .  on the planet as a whole  there are fifty robots to each human being on the average  not ten thousand per human as on solaria .  most of our robots are on our farms  in our mines  in our factories  in space .  if anything  we suffer from a shortage of robots  particularly of household robots .  most aurorans make do with two or three such robots  some with only one .  still  we don   t want to move in the direction of solaria .        how many human beings have no household robots at all .        none at all .  that would not be in the public interest .  if a human being  for any reason  could not afford a robot  he or she would be granted one which would be maintained  if necessary  at public expense .        what happens as the population rises .  do you add more robots .     fastolfe shook his head .     the population does not rise .  aurora   s population is two hundred million and that has remained stable for three centuries .  it is the number desired .  surely you have read that in the books you viewed .        yes  i have     admitted baley     but i found it difficult to believe .        let me assure you it   s true .  it gives each of us ample land  ample space  ample privacy  and an ample share of the world   s resources .  there are neither too many people as on earth  nor too few as on solaria .     he held out his arm for baley to take  so they might continue walking .     what you see     fastolfe said     is a tame world .  it is what i have brought you out to show you  mr .  baley .        there is no danger in it .        always some danger .  we do have storms  rock slides  earthquakes  blizzards  avalanches  a volcano or two   accidental death can never be entirely done away with .  and there are even the passions of angry or envious persons  the follies of the immature  and the madness of the shortsighted .  these things are very minor irritants  however  and do not much affect the civilized quiet that rests upon our world .     fastolfe seemed to ruminate over his words for a moment  then he sighed and said     i can scarcely want it to be any other way  but i have certain intellectual reservations .  we have brought here to aurora only those plants and animals we felt would be useful  ornamental  or both .  we did our best to eliminate anything we would consider weeds  vermin  or even less than standard .  we selected strong  healthy  and attractive human beings  according to our own views  of course .  we have tried   but you smile  mr .  baley .     baley had not .  his mouth had merely twitched .     no no     he said .     there is nothing to smile about .        there is  for i know as well as you do that i myself am not attractive by auroran standards .  the trouble is that we cannot altogether control gene combinations and intrauterine influences .  nowadays  of course  with ectogenesis becoming more common  though i hope it shall never be as common as it is on solaria  i would be eliminated in the late fetal stage .        in which case  dr .  fastolfe  the worlds would have lost a great theoretical roboticist .        perfectly correct     said fastolfe  without visible embarrassment     but the worlds would never have known that  would they .    in any case  we have labored to set up a very simple but completely workable ecological balance  an equable climate  a fertile soil  and resources as evenly distributed as is possible .  the result is a world that produces all of everything that we need and that is  if i may personify  considerate of our wants .    shall i tell you the ideal for which we have striven .        please do     said baley .     we have labored to produce a planet which  taken as a whole  would obey the three laws of robotics .  it does nothing to harm human beings  either by commission or omission .  it does what we want it to do  as long as we do not ask it to harm human beings .  and it protects itself  except at times and in places where it must serve us or save us even at the price of harm to itself .  nowhere else  neither on earth nor in the other spacer worlds  is this so nearly true as here on aurora .     baley said sadly     earthmen  too  have longed for this  but we have long since grown too numerous and we have too greatly damaged our planet in the days of our ignorance to be able to do very much about it now .    but what of aurora   s indigenous life forms .  surely you did not come to a dead planet .     fastolfe said     you know we didn   t  if you have viewed books on our history .  aurora had vegetation and animal life when we arrived  and a nitrogen oxygen atmosphere .  this was true of all the fifty spacer worlds .  peculiarly  in every case  the life forms were sparse and not very varied .  nor were they particularly tenacious in their hold on their own planet .  we took over  so to speak  without a struggle  and what is left of the indigenous life is in our aquaria  our zoos  and in a few carefully maintained primeval areas .     we do not really understand why the life bearing planets that human beings have encountered have been so feebly lifebearing  why only earth itself has been overflowing with madly tenacious varieties of life filling every environmental niche  and why only earth has developed any sign of intelligence whatever .     baley said     maybe it is coincidence  the accident of incomplete exploration .  we know so few planets so far .        i admit     said fastolfe     that that is the most likely explanation .  somewhere there may be an ecological balance as complex as that of earth .  somewhere there may be intelligent life and a technological civilization .  yet earth   s life and intelligence has spread outward for parsecs in every direction .  if there is life and intelligence elsewhere  why have they not spread out as well   and why have we not encountered each other .        that might happen tomorrow  for all we know .        it might .  and if such an encounter is imminent  all the more reason why we should not be passively waiting .  for we are growing passive  mr .  baley .  no new spacer world has been settled in two and a half centuries .  our worlds are so tame  so delightful  we do not wish to leave them .  this world was originally settled  you see  because earth had grown so unpleasant that the risks and dangers of new and empty worlds seemed preferable by comparison .  by the time our fifty spacer worlds were developed  solaria last of all  there was no longer any push  any need to move out elsewhere .  and earth itself had retreated to its underground caves of steel .  the end .  finis .        you don   t really mean that .        if we stay as we are .  if we remain placid and comfortable and unmoving .  yes  i do mean that .  humanity must expand its range somehow if it is to continue to flourish .  one method of expansion is through space  through a constant pioneering reach toward other worlds .  if we fail in this  some other civilization that is undergoing such expansion will reach us and we will not be able to stand against its dynamism .        you expect a space war  like a hyperwave shoot    em up .        no  i doubt that that would be necessary .  a civilization that is expanding through space will not need our few worlds and will probably be too intellectually advanced to feel the need to batter its way into hegemony here .  if  however  we are surrounded by a more lively  a more vibrant civilization  we will wither away by the mere force of the comparison  we will die of the realization of what we have become and of the potential we have wasted .  of course  we might substitute other expansions   an expansion of scientific understanding or of cultural vigor  for instance .  i fear  however  that these expansions are not separable .  to fade in one is to fade in all .  certainly  we are fading in all .  we live too long .  we are too comfortable .     baley said     on earth  we think of spacers as all powerful  as totally self confident .  i cannot believe i   m heating this from one of you .        you won   t from any other spacer .  my views are unfashionable .  others would find them intolerable and i don   t often speak of such things to aurorans .  instead  i simply talk about a new drive for further settlement  without expressing my fears of the catastrophes which will result if we abandon colonization .  in that  at least  i have been winning .  aurora has been seriously   even enthusiastically  considering a new era of exploration and settlement .        you say that     said baley     without any noticeable enthusiasm .  what   s wrong .        it   s just that we are approaching my motive for the destruction of jander panell .     fastolfe paused  shook his head  and continued     i wish  mr .  baley  i could understand human beings better .  i have spent six decades in studying the intricacies of the positronic brain and i expect to spend fifteen to twenty more on the problem .  in this time  i have barely brushed against the problem of the human brain  which is enormously more intricate .  are there laws of humanics as there are laws of robotics .  how many laws of humanics might there be and how can they be expressed mathematically .  i don   t know .     perhaps  though  there may come a day when someone will work out the laws of humanics and then be able to predict the broad strokes of the future  and know what might be in store for humanity  instead of merely guessing as i do  and know what to do to make things better  instead of merely speculating .  i dream sometimes of founding a mathematical science which i think of as    psychohistory     but i know i can   t and i fear no one ever will .     he faded to a halt .  baley waited  then said softly     and your motive for the destruction of jander panell  dr .  fastolfe .     fastolfe did not seem to hear the question .  at any rate  he did not respond .  he said  instead     daneel and giskard are again signaling that all is clear .  tell me  mr .  baley  would you consider walking with me farther afield .        where .     asked baley cautiously .     toward a neighboring establishment .  in that direction  across the lawn .  would the openness disturb you .     baley pressed his lips together and looked in that direction  as though attempting to measure its effect .     i believe i could endure it i anticipate no trouble .     giskard  who was close enough to hear  now approached still closer  his eyes showing no glow in the daylight .  if his voice was without human emotion  his words marked his concern .     sir  may i remind you that on the journey here you suffered serious discomfort on the descent to the planet .     baley turned to face him .  however he might feel toward daneel  whatever warmth of past association might paper over his attitude toward robots  there was none here .  he found the more primitive giskard distinctly repellent .  he labored to fight down the touch of anger he felt and said     i was incautious aboard ship  boy  because i was overly curious .  i faced a vision i had never experienced before and i had no time for adjustment .  this is different .        sir  do you feel discomfort now .  may i be assured of that .        whether i do or not     said baley firmly  reminding himself that the robot was helplessly in the grip of the first law and trying to be polite to a lump of metal who  after all  had baley   s welfare as his only care     doesn   t matter .  i have my duty to perform and that cannot be done if i am to hide in enclosures .        your duty .     giskard said it as though he had not been programmed to understand the word .  baley looked quickly in fastolfe   s direction  but fastolfe stood quietly in his place and made no move to intervene .  he seemed to be listening with abstracted interest  as though weighing the reaction of a robot of a given type to a new situation and comparing it with relationships  variables  constants  and differential equations only he understood .  or so baley thought .  he felt annoyed at being part of an observation of that type and said  perhaps too sharply  he knew      do you know what    duty    means .        that which should be done  sir     said giskard .     your duty is to obey the laws of robotics .  and human beings have their laws  too  as your master  dr .  fastolfe  was only this moment saying  which must be obeyed .  i must do that which i have been assigned to do .  it is important       but to go into the open when you are not         it must be done  nevertheless .  my son may someday go to another planet  one much less comfortable than this one  and expose himself to the outside for the rest of his life .  and if i could  i would go with him .        but why would you do that .        i have told you .  i consider it my duty .        sir  i cannot disobey the laws .  can you disobey yours .  for i must urge you to         i can choose not to do my duty  but i do not choose to  and that is sometimes the stronger compulsion  giskard .     there was silence for a moment and then giskard said     would it do you harm if i were to succeed in persuading you not to walk into the open .        insofar as i would then feel i have failed in my duty  it would .        more harm than any discomfort you might feel in the open .        much more .        thank you for explaining this  sir     said giskard and baley imagined there was a look of satisfaction on the robot   s largely expressionless face .   the human tendency to personify was irrepressible .   giskard stepped back and now dr .  fastolfe spoke .     that was interesting  mr .  baley .  giskard needed instructions before he could quite understand how to arrange the positronic potential response to the three laws or  rather  how those potentials were to arrange themselves in the light of the situation .  now he knows how to behave .     baley said     i notice that daneel asked no questions .     fastolfe said     daneel knows you .  he has been with you on earth and on solaria .    but come  shall we walk .  let us move slowly .  look about carefully and  if at any time you should wish to rest  to wait  even to turn back  i will count on you to let me know .        i will  but what is the purpose of this walk .  since you anticipate possible discomfort on my part  you cannot be suggesting it idly .        i am not     said fastolfe .     i think you will want to see the inert body of jander .        as a matter of form  yes  but i rather think it will tell me nothing .        i   m sure of that  but then you might also have the opportunity to question the one who was jander   s quasi owner at the time of the tragedy .  surely you would like to speak to some human being other than myself concerning the matter .         .   fastolfe moved slowly forward  plucking a leaf from a shrub that he passed  bending it in two  and nibbling at it .  baley looked at him curiously  wondering how spacers could put something untreated  unheated  even unwashed into their mouths  when they feared infection so badly .  he remembered that aurora was free  entirely free .   of pathogenic microorganisms  but found the action repulsive anyway .  repulsion did not have to have a rational basis  he thought defensively  and suddenly found himself on the edge of excusing the spacers their attitude toward earthmen .  he drew back .  that was different .  human beings were involved there .  giskard moved ahead  forward and toward the right .  daneel lagged behind and toward the left .  aurora   s orange sun  baley scarcely noted the orange tinge now  was mildly warm on his back  lacking the febrile heat that earth   s sun had in summer  but  then  what was the climate and season on this portion of aurora right now .   .  the grass or whatever it was  it looked like grass  was a bit stiffer and springier than he recalled it being on earth and the ground was hard  as though it had not rained for a while .  they were moving toward the house up ahead  presumably the house of jander   s quasi owner .  baley could hear the rustle of some animal in the grass to the right  the sudden chirrup of a bird somewhere in a tree behind him  the small unplaceable clatter of insects all about .  these  he told himself  were all animals with ancestors that had once lived on earth .  they had no way of knowing that this patch of ground they inhabited was not all there was  forever and forever back in time .  the very trees and grass had arisen from other trees and grass that had once grown on earth .  only human beings could live on this world and know that they were not autochthonous but had stemmed from earthmen  and yet did the spacers really know it or did they simply put it out of their mind .  would the time come  perhaps  when they would not know it at all .  when they would not remember which world they had come from or whether there was a world of origin at all .     dr .  fastolfe     he said suddenly  in part to break the chain of thought that he found to be growing oppressive     you still have not told me your motive for the destruction of jander .        true .  i have not .    now why do you suppose  mr .  baley  i have labored to work out the theoretical basis for the positronic brains of humaniform robots .        i cannot say .        well  think .  the task is to design a robotic brain as close to the human as possible and that would require  it would seem  a certain reach into the poetic      he paused and his small smile became an outright grin .     you know it always bothers some of my colleagues when i tell them that  if a conclusion is not poetically balanced  it cannot be scientifically true .  they tell me they don   t know what that means .     baley said     i   m afraid i don   t  either .        but i know what it means .  i can   t explain it  but i feel the explanation without being able to put it into words  which may be why i have achieved results my colleagues have not .  however  i grow grandiose  which is a good sign i should become prosaic .  to imitate a human brain  when i know almost nothing about the workings of the human brain  needs an intuitive leap  something that feels to me like poetry .  and the same intuitive leap that would give me the humaniform positronic brain should surely give me a new access of knowledge about the human brain itself .  that was my belief  that through humaniformity i might take at least a small step toward the psychohistory i told you about .        i see .        and if i succeeded in working out a theoretical structure that would imply a humaniform positronic brain  i would need a humaniform body to place it in .  the brain does not exist by itself  you understand .  it interacts with the body  so that a humaniform brain in a nonhumaniform body would become  to an extent  itself nonhuman .        are you sure of that .        quite .  you have only to compare daneel with giskard .        then daneel was constructed as an experimental device for furthering the understanding of the human brain .        you have it .  i labored two decades at the task with sarton .  there were numerous failures that had to be discarded .  daneel was the first true success and  of course  i kept him for further study  and out of     he grinned lopsidedly  as though admitting to something silly     affection .  after all  daneel can grasp the notion of human duty  while giskard  with all his virtues  has trouble doing so .  you saw .        and daneel   s stay on earth with me  three years ago  was his first assigned task .        his first of any importance  yes .  when sarton was murdered  we needed something that was a robot and could withstand the infectious diseases of earth and yet looked enough like a man to get around the antirobotic prejudices of earth   s people .        an astonishing coincidence that daneel should be right at hand at that time .        oh .  do you believe in coincidences .  it is my feeling that any time at which a development as revolutionary as the humaniform robot came into being  some task that would require its use would present itself .  similar tasks had probably been presenting themselves regularly in all the years that daneel did not exist   and because daneel did not exist  other solutions and devices had to be used .        and have your labors been successful  dr .  fastolfe .  do you now understand the human brain better than you did .     fastolfe had been moving more and more slowly and baley had been matching his progress to the other   s .  they were now standing still  about halfway between fastolfe   s establishment and the other   s .  it was the most difficult point for baley  since it was equally distant from protection in either direction  but he fought down the growing uneasiness  determined not to provoke giskard .  he did not wish by some motion or outcry  or even expression  to activate the inconvenience of giskard   s desire to save him .  he did not want to have himself lifted up and carried off to shelter .  fastolfe showed no sign of understanding baley   s difficulty .  he said     there   s no question but that advances in mentology have been carried through .  there remain enormous problems and perhaps these will always remain  but there has been progress .  still         still .        still  aurora is not satisfied with a purely theoretical study of the human brain .  uses for humaniform robots have been advanced that i do not approve of .        such as the use on earth .        no  that was a brief experiment that i rather approved of and was even fascinated by .  could daneel fool earthpeople .  it turned out he could  though  of course  the eyes of earthmen for robots are not very keen .  daneel cannot fool the eyes of aurorans  though i dare say future humaniform robots could be improved to the point where they would .  there are other tasks that have been proposed  however .        such as .     fastolfe gazed thoughtfully into the distance .     i told you this world was tame .  when i began my movement to encourage a renewed period of exploration and settlement  it was not to the supercomfortable aurorans  or spacers generally  that i looked for leadership .  i rather thought we ought to encourage earthmen to take the lead .  with their horrid world  excuse me  and short life span  they have so little to lose  i thought that they would surely welcome the chance  especially if we were to help them technologically .  i spoke to you about such a thing when i saw you on earth three years ago .  do you remember .     he looked sidelong at baley .  baley said stolidly     i remember quite well .  in fact  you started a chain of thought in me that has resulted in a small movement on earth in that very direction .        indeed .  it would not be easy  i imagine .  there is the claustrophilia of you earthmen  your dislike of leaving your walls .        we are fighting it  dr .  fastolfe .  our organization is planning to move out into space .  my son is a leader    in the movement and i hope the day may come when he leaves earth at the head of an expedition to settle a new world .  if we do indeed receive the technological help you speak of      baley let that dangle .     if we supplied the ships  you mean .        and other equipment .  yes  dr .  fastolfe .        there are difficulties .  many aurorans do not want earthmen to move outward and settle new worlds .  they fear the rapid spread of earthish culture  its beehive cities  its chaoticism .     he stirred uneasily and said     why are we standing here  i wonder .  let   s move on .     he walked slowly forward and said     i have argued that that would not be the way it would be .  i have pointed out that the settlers from earth would not be earthmen in the classical mode .  they would not be enclosed in cities .  coming to a new world  they would be like the auroran fathers coming here .  they would develop a manageable ecological balance and would be closer to aurorans than to earthmen in attitude .        would they not then develop all the weaknesses you find in spacer culture  dr .  fastolfe .        perhaps not .  they would learn from our mistakes .    but that is academic  for something has developed which makes the argument moot .        and what is that .        why  the humaniform robot .  you see  there are those who see the humaniform robot as the perfect settler .  it is they who can build the new worlds .     baley said     you   ve always had robots .  do you mean this idea was never advanced before .        oh  it was  but it was always clearly unworkable .  ordinary nonhumaniform robots  without immediate human supervision  building a world that would suit their own nonhumaniform selves  could not be expected to tame and build a world that would be suitable for the more delicate and flexible minds and bodies of human beings .        surely the world they would build would serve as a reasonable first approximation .        surely it would  mr .  baley .  it is a sign of auroran decay  however  that there is an overwhelming feeling among our people that a reasonable first approximation is unreasonably insufficient .    a group of humaniform robots  on the other hand  as closely resembling human beings in body and mind as possible  would succeed in building a world which  in suiting themselves  would also inevitably suit aurorans .  do you follow the reasoning .        completely .        they would build a world so well  you see  that when they are done and aurorans are finally willing to leave  our human beings will step out of aurora and into another aurora .  they will never have left home  they will simply have another newer home  exactly like the older one  in which to continue their decay .  do you follow that reasoning  too .        i see your point  but i take it that aurorans do not .        may not .  i think i can argue the point effectively  if the opposition does not destroy me politically via this matter of the destruction of jander .  do you see the motive attributed to me .  i am supposed to have embarked on a program of the destruction of humaniform robots rather than allow them to be used to settle other planets .  or so my enemies say .     it was baley now who stopped walking .  he looked thoughtfully at fastolfe and said     you understand  dr .  fastolfe  that it is to earth   s interest that your point of view win out completely .        and to your own interests as well  mr .  baley .        and to mine .  but if i put myself to one side for the moment  it still remains vital to my world that our people be allowed  encouraged  and helped to explore the galaxy  that we retain as much of our own ways as we are comfortable with  that we not be condemned to imprisonment on earth forever  since there we can only perish .     fastolfe said     some of you  i think  will insist on remaining imprisoned .        of course .  perhaps almost all of us will .  however  at least some of us  as many of us as possible  will escape if given permission .    it is therefore my duty  not only as a representative of the law of a large fraction of humanity but as an earthman  plain and simple  to help you clear your name  whether you are guilty or innocent .  nevertheless  i can throw myself wholeheartedly into this task only if i know that     in fact  the accusations against you are unjustified .        of course .  i understand .        in the light  then  of what you have told me of the motive attributed to you  assure me once again that you did not do this thing .     fastolfe said     mr .  baley  i understand completely that you have no choice in this matter .  i am quite aware that i can tell you  with impunity  that i am guilty and that you would still be compelled by the nature of your needs and those of your world to work with me to mask that fact .  indeed  if i were actually guilty  i would feel compelled to tell you so  so that you could take that fact into consideration and  knowing the truth  work the more efficiently to rescue me  and yourself .  but i cannot do so  because the fact is i am innocent .  however much appearances may be against me  i did not destroy jander .  such a thing never entered my mind .        never .     fastolfe smiled sadly .     oh  i may have thought once or twice that aurora would have been better off if i had never worked out the ingenious notions that led to the development of the humaniform positronic brain  or that it would be better off if such brains proved unstable and readily subject to mental freeze out .  but those were fugitive thoughts .  not for a split second did i contemplate bringing about jander   s destruction for this reason .        then we must destroy this motive that they attribute to you .        good .  but how .        we could show that it serves no purpose .  what good does it do to destroy jander .  more humaniform robots can be built .  thousands .  millions .        i   m afraid that   s not so  mr .  baley .  none can be built .  i alone know how to design them  and  as long as robot colonization is a possible destiny  i refuse to build any more .  jander is gone and only daneel is left .        the secret will be discovered by others .     fastolfe   s chin went up .     i would like to see the roboticist capable of it .  my enemies have established a robotics institute with no other purpose than to work out the methods behind the construction of a humaniform robot  but they won   t succeed .  they certainly haven   t succeeded so far and i know they won   t succeed .     baley frowned .     if you are the only man who knows the secret of the humaniform robots  and if your enemies are desperate for it  will they not try to get it out of you .        of course .  by threatening my political existence  by perhaps maneuvering some punishment that will forbid my working in the field and thus putting an end to my professional existence as well  they hope to have me agree to share the secret with them .  they may even have the legislature direct me to share the secret on the pain of confiscation of property  imprisonment  who knows what .  however  i have made up my mind to submit to anything  anything  rather than give in .  but i don   t want to have to  you understand .        do they know of your determination to resist .        i hope so .  i have told them plainly enough .  i presume they think i   m bluffing  that i   m not serious .    but i am .        but if they believe you  they might take more serious steps .        what do you mean .        steal your papers .  kidnap you .  torture you .     fastolfe broke into a loud laugh and baley flushed .  he said     i hate to sound like a hyperwave drama  but have you considered that .     fastolfe said     mr .  baley   first  my robots can protect me .  it would take full scale war to capture me or my work .  second  even if somehow they succeeded  not one of the roboticists opposed to me could bear to make it plain that the only way he could obtain the secret of the humaniform positronic brain is to steal it or force it from me .  his or her professional reputation would be completely wiped out .  third  such things on aurora are unheard of .  the merest hint of an unprofessional attempt upon me would swing the legislature  and public opinion  in my favor at once .        is that so .     muttered baley  silently damning the fact of having to work in a culture whose details he simply didn   t understand .     yes .  take my word for it .  i wish they would try something of this melodramatic sort .  i wish they were so incredibly stupid as to do so .  in fact  mr .  baley  i wish i could persuade you to go to them  worm your way into their confidence  and cajole them into mounting an attack on my establishment or waylaying me on an empty road  or anything of the sort that  i imagine  is common on earth .     baley said stiffly     i don   t think that would be my style .        i don   t think so  either  so i have no intention of trying to implement my wish .  and believe me  that is too bad  for if we cannot persuade them to try the suicidal method of force  they will continue to do something much better  from their standpoint .  they will destroy me by falsehoods .        what falsehoods .        it is not just the destruction of one robot they attribute to me .  that is bad enough and just might suffice .  they are whispering  it is only a whisper as yet  that the death is merely an experiment of mine and a dangerous  successful one .  they whisper that i am working out a system for destroying humaniform brains rapidly and efficiently  so that when my enemies do create their own humaniform robots  i  together with members of my party  will be able to destroy them all  thus preventing aurora from settling new worlds and leaving the galaxy to my earthmen confederates .        surely there can be no truth in this .        of course not .  i told you these are lies .  and ridiculous lies  too .  no such method of destruction is even theoretically possible and the robotics institute people are not on the point of creating their own humaniform robots .  i cannot conceivably indulge in an orgy of mass destruction even if i wanted to .  i cannot .        doesn   t the whole thing fall by its own weight  then .        unfortunately  it   s not likely to do so in time .  it may be silly nonsense  but it will probably last long enough to sway public opinion against me to the point of swinging just enough votes in the legislature to defeat me .  eventually  it will all be recognized as nonsense  but by then it will be too late .  and please notice that earth is being used as a whipping boy in this .  the charge that i am laboring on behalf of earth is a powerful one and many will choose to believe the whole farrago  against their own better sense  because of their dislike of earth and earth people .     baley said     what you   re telling me is that active resentment against earth is being built up .     fastolfe said     exactly  mr .  baley .  the situation grows worse for me  and for earth  every day and we have very little time .        but isn   t there an easy way of knocking this thing on its head .      baley  in despair  decided it was time to fall back on daneel   s point .      if you were indeed anxious to test a method for the destruction of a humaniform robot  why seek out one in another establishment  one with which it might be inconvenient to experiment .  you had daneel  himself  in your own establishment .  he was at hand and convenient .  would not the experiment have been conducted upon him if there were any truth at all in the rumor .        no no     said fastolfe .     i couldn   t get anyone to believe that .  daneel was my first success  my triumph .  i wouldn   t destroy him under any circumstances .  naturally  i would turn to jander .  everyone would see that and i would be a fool to try to persuade them that it would have made more sense for me to sacrifice daneel .     they were walking again  nearly at their destination .  baley was in deep silence  his face tight lipped .  fastolfe said     how do you feel  mr .  baley .     baley said in a low voice     if you mean as far as being outside is concerned  i am not even aware of it .  if you mean as far as our dilemma is concerned  i think i am as close to giving up as i can possibly be without putting myself into an ultrasonic brain dissolving chamber .     then passionately     why did you send for me  dr .  fastolfe .  why have you given me this job .  what have i ever done to you to be treated so .        actually     said fastolfe     it was not my idea to begin with and i can only plead my desperation .        well  whose idea was it .        it was the owner of this establishment we have now reached who suggested it originally  and i had no better idea .        the owner of this establishment .  why would he         she .        well  then  why would she suggest anything of the sort .        oh .  i haven   t explained that she knows you  have i  mr .  baley .  there she is  waiting for us now .     baley looked up  bewildered .     jehoshaphat     he whispered .     gladia     .   the young woman who faced them said with a wan smile     i knew that when i met you again  elijah  that would be the first word i would hear .     baley stared at her .  she had changed .  her hair was shorter and her face was even more troubled now than it had been two years ago and seemed more than two years older  somehow .  she was still unmistakably gladia  however .  there was still the triangular face  with its pronounced cheekbones and small chin .  she was still short  still slight of figure  still vaguely childlike .  he had dreamed of her frequently  though not in an overtly erotic fashion  after returning to earth .  his dreams were always stories of not being able to quite reach her .  she was always there  a little too far off to speak to easily .  she never quite heard when he called her .  she never grew nearer when he approached her .  it was not hard to understand why the dreams had been as they were .  she was a solarian born person and  as such  was rarely supposed to be in the physical presence of other human beings .  elijah had been forbidden to her because he was human  and beyond that  of course  because he was from earth .  though the exigencies of the murder case he was investigating forced them to meet  throughout their relationship she was completely covered  when physically together  to prevent actual contact .  and yet  at their last meeting  she had  in defiance of good sense  fleetingly touched his cheek with her bare hand .  she must have known she could be infected as a result .  he cherished the touch the more  for every aspect of her upbringing combined to make it unthinkable .  the dreams had faded in time .  baley said  rather stupidly     it was you who owned the      he paused and gladia finished the sentence for him .     the robot .  and two years ago  it was i who possessed the husband .  whatever i touch is destroyed .     without really knowing what he was doing  baley reached up to place his hand on his cheek .  gladia did not seem to notice .  she said     you came to rescue me that first time .  forgive me  but i had to call on you again .    come in  elijah .  come in  dr .  fastolfe .     fastolfe stepped back to allow baley to walk in first .  he followed .  behind fastolfe came daneel and giskard  and they  with the characteristic self effacement of robots  stepped to unoccupied wall niches on opposite sides and remained silently standing  backs to the wall .  for one moment  it seemed that gladia would treat them with the indifference with which human beings commonly treated robots .  after a glance at daneel  however  she turned away and said to fastolfe in a voice that choked a little     that one .  please .  ask him to leave .     fastolfe said  with a small motion of surprise     daneel .        he   s too  too janderlike .     fastolfe turned to look at daneel and a look of clear pain crossed his face momentarily .     of course  my dear .  you must forgive me .  i did not think .    daneel  move into another room and remain there while we are here .     without a word  daneel left .  gladia glanced a moment at giskard  as though to judge whether he  also  was too janderlike  and turned away with a small shrug .  she said     would either of you like refreshment of any kind .  i have an excellent coconut drink  fresh and cold .        no  gladia     said fastolfe .     i have merely brought mr .  baley here as i promised i would .  i will not stay long .         if i may have a glass of water     said baley     i won   t trouble you for anything more .     gladia raised one hand .  undoubtedly  she was under observation  for  in a moment  a robot moved in noiselessly  with a glass of water on a tray and a small dish of what looked like crackers with a pinkish blob on each .  baley could not forbear taking one  even though he was not certain what it might be .  it had to be something earth descended  for he could not believe that on aurora  he  or anyone  would be eating any portion of the planet   s sparse indigenous biota or anything synthetic either .  nevertheless  the descendants of earthly food species might change with time  either through deliberate cultivation or the action of a strange environment   and fastolfe  at lunchtime  had said that much of the auroran diet was an acquired taste .  he was pleasantly surprised .  the taste was sharp and spicy  but he found it delightful and took a second almost at once .  he said     thank you    to the robot  who would not have objected to standing there indefinitely  and took the entire dish  together with the glass of water .  the robot left .  it was late afternoon now and the sunlight came ruddily through the western windows .  baley had the impression that this house was smaller than fastolfe   s  but it would have been more cheerful had not the sad figure of gladia standing in its midst provoked a dispiriting effect .  that might  of course  be baley   s imagination .  cheer  in any case  seemed to him impossible in any structure purporting to house and protect human beings that yet remained exposed to the outside beyond each wall .  not one wall  he thought  had the warmth of human life on the other side .  in no direction could one look for companionship and community .  through every outer wall  every side  top and bottom  there was inanimate world .  cold .  cold .  and coldness flooded back upon baley himself as he thought again of the dilemma in which he found himself .   for a moment  the shock of meeting gladia again had driven it from his mind .   gladia said     come .  sit down  elijah .  you must excuse me for not quite being myself .  i am  for a second time  the center of a planetary sensation  and the first time was more than enough .        i understand  gladia .  please do not apologize     said baley .     and as for you  dear doctor  please don   t feel you need go .        well      fastolfe looked at the time strip on the wall .     i will stay for a short while  but then  my dear  there is work that must be done though the skies fall .  all the more so  since i must look forward to a near future in which i may be restrained from doing any work at all .     gladia blinked rapidly  as though holding back tears .     i know  dr .  fastolfe .  you are in deep trouble because of  of what happened here and i don   t seem to have time to think of anything but my own  discomfort .     fastolfe said     i   ll do my best to take care of my own problem  gladia  and there is no need for you to feel guilt over the matter .    perhaps mr .  baley will be able to help us both .     baley pressed his lips together at that  then said heavily     i was not aware  gladia  that you were in any way involved in this affair .        who else would be .     she said with a sigh .     you are  were  in possession of jander panell .        not truly in possession .  i had him on loan from dr .  fastolfe .        were you with him when he      baley hesitated over some way of putting it .     died .  mightn   t we say died .    no  i was not .  and before you ask  there was no one else in the house at the time .  i was alone .  i am usually alone .  almost always .  that is my solarian upbringing  you remember .  of course  that is not obligatory .  you two are here and i do not mind  very much .        and you were definitely alone at the time jander died .  no mistake .        i have said so     said gladia  sounding a little irritated .     no  never mind  elijah .  i know you must have everything repeated and repeated .  i was alone .  honestly .        there were robots present  though .        yes  of course .  when i say    alone     i mean there were no other human beings present .        how many robots do you possess  gladia .  not counting jander .     gladia paused as though she were counting internally .  finally  she said     twenty .  five in the house and fifteen on the grounds .  robots move freely between my house and dr .  fastolfe   s  too  so that it isn   t always possible to judge  when a robot is quickly seen at either establishment  whether it is one of mine or one of his .        au     said baley     and since dr .  fastolfe has fifty seven robots in his establishment  that means  if we combine the two  that there are seventy seven robots available  altogether .  are there any other establishments whose robots may mingle with yours indistinguishably .     fastolfe said     there   s no other establishment near enough to make that practical .  nor is the practice of mixing robots really encouraged .  gladia and i are a special case because she is not auroran and because i have taken rather a  responsibility for her .        even so .  seventy seven robots     said baley .     yes     said fastolfe     but why are you making this point .     baley said     because it means you can have any of seventy seven moving objects  each vaguely human in form  that you are used to seeing out of the corner of the eye and to which you would pay no particular attention .  isn   t it possible  gladia  that if an actual human being were to penetrate the house  for whatever purpose  you would scarcely be aware of it .  it would be one more moving object  vaguely human in form  and you would pay no attention .     fastolfe chuckled softly and gladia  unsmiling  shook her head .     elijah     she said     one can tell you are an earthman .  do you imagine that any human being  even dr .  fastolfe here  could possibly approach my house without my being informed of the fact by my robots .  i might ignore a moving form  assuming it to be a robot  but no robot ever would .  i was waiting for you just now when you arrived  but that was because my robots had informed me you were approaching .  no  no  when jander died  there was no other human being in the house .        except yourself .        except myself .  just as there was no one in the house except myself when my husband was killed .     fastolfe interposed gently .     there is a difference  gladia .  your husband was killed with a blunt instrument .  the physical presence of the murderer was necessary and  if you were the only one present  that was serious .  in this case  jander was put out of operation by a subtle spoken program .  physical presence was not necessary .  your presence here alone means nothing  especially since you do not know how to block the mind of a humaniform robot .     they both turned to look at baley  fastolfe with a quizzical look on his face  gladia with a sad one .   it irritated baley that fastolfe  whose future was as bleak as baley   s own  nevertheless seemed to face it with humor .  what on earth is there to the situation to cause one to laugh like an idiot .  baley thought morosely .      ignorance     said baley slowly     may mean nothing .  a person may not know how to get to a certain place and yet may just happen to reach it while walking blindly .  one might talk to jander and  all unknowingly  push the button for mental freeze out .     fastolfe said     and the chances of that .        you   re the expert  dr .  fastolfe  and i suppose you will tell me they are very small .        incredibly small .  a person may not know how to get to a certain place  but if the only route is a series of tight ropes stretched in sharply changing directions  what are the chances of reaching it by walking randomly while blindfolded .     gladia   s hands fluttered in extreme agitation .  she clenched her fists  as though to hold them steady  and brought them down on her knees .     i didn   t do it  accident or not .  i wasn   t with him when it happened .  i wasn   t .  i spoke to him in the morning .  he was well  perfectly normal .  hours later  when i summoned him  he never came .  i went in search of him and he was standing in his accustomed place  seeming quite normal .  the trouble was  he didn   t respond to me .  he didn   t respond at all .  he has never responded since .     baley said     could something you had said to him  quite in passing  have produced mind freeze only after you had left him  an hour after  perhaps .     fastolfe interposed sharply     quite impossible  mr .  baley .  if mind freeze is to take place  it takes place at once .  please do not badger gladia in this fashion  she is incapable of producing mind freeze deliberately and it is unthinkable that she would produce it accidentally .        isn   t it unthinkable that it would be produced by random positronic drift  as you say it must have .        not quite as unthinkable .        both alternatives are extremely unlikely .  what is the difference in unthinkability .        a great one .  i imagine that a mental freeze out through positronic drift might have a probability of   in       that by accidental pattern building   in       .  that is just an estimate  but a reasonable one .  the difference is greater than that between a single electron and the entire universe  and it is in favor of the positronic drift .     there was silence for a while .  baley said     dr .  fastolfe  you said earlier that you couldn   t stay long .        i have stayed too long already .        good .  then would you leave now .     fastolfe began to rise  then said     why .        because i want to speak to gladia alone .        to badger her .        i must question her without your interference .  our situation is entirely too serious to worry about politeness .     gladia said     i am not afraid of mr .  baley  dear doctor .     she added wistfully     my robots will protect me if his impoliteness becomes extreme .     fastolfe smiled and said     very well  gladia .     he rose and held out his hand to her .  she took it briefly .  he said     i would like to have giskard remain here for general protection  and daneel will continue to be in the next room  if you don   t mind .  could you lend me one of your own robots to escort me back to my establishment .        certainly     said gladia  raising her arms .     you know pandion  i believe .        of course .  a sturdy and reliable escort .     he left  with the robot following closely .  baley waited  watching gladia  studying her .  she sat there  her eyes on her hands  which were folded limply together in her lap .  baley was certain there was more for her to tell .  how he could persuade her to talk  he couldn   t say  but of one thing more he was certain .  while fastolfe was there  she would not tell the whole truth .      .   finally  gladia looked up  her face like a little girl   s .  she said in a small voice     how are you  elijah .  how do you feel .        well enough  gladia .     she said     dr .  fastolfe said he would lead you here across the open and see to it that you would have to wait some time in the worst of it .        oh .  why was that .  for the fun of it .        no  elijah .  i had told him how you reacted to the open .  you remember the time you fainted and fell into the pond .     elijah shook his head quickly .  he could not deny the event or his memory thereof  but neither did he approve of the reference .  he said gruffly     i   m not quite like that anymore .  i   ve improved .        but dr .  fastolfe said he would test you .  was it all right .        it was sufficiently all right .  i didn   t faint .     he remembered the episode aboard the spaceship during the approach to aurora and ground his teeth faintly .  that was different and there was no call to discuss the matter .  he said  in a deliberate change of subject     what do i call you here .  how do i address you .        you   ve been calling me gladia .        it   s inappropriate  perhaps .  i could say mrs .  delmarre  but you may have      she gasped and interrupted sharply     i haven   t used that name since arriving here .  please don   t you use it .        what do the aurorans call you  then .        they say gladia solaria  but that   s just an indication that i   m an alien and i don   t want that either .  i am simply gladia .  one name .  it   s not an auroran name and i doubt that there   s another one on this planet  so it   s sufficient .  i   ll continue to call you elijah  if you don   t mind .        i don   t mind .     gladia said     i would like to serve tea .     it was a statement and baley nodded .  he said     i didn   t know that spacers drank tea .        it   s not earth tea .  it   s a plant extract that is pleasant but is not considered harmful in any way .  we call it tea .     she lifted her arm and baley noted that the sleeve held tightly at the wrist and that joining it were thin  flesh colored gloves .  she was still exposing the minimum of body surface in his presence .  she was still minimizing the chance of infection .  her arm remained in the air for a moment and  after a few more moments  a robot appeared with a tray .  he was patently even more primitive than giskard  but he distributed the teacups  the small sandwiches  and the bite sized bits of pastry smoothly .  he poured tea with what amounted to grace .  baley said curiously     how do you do that  gladia .        do what  elijah .        you lift your arm whenever you want something and the robots always know what it is .  how did this one know you wanted tea served .        it   s not difficult .  every time i lift my arm  it distorts a small electromagnetic field that is maintained continuously across the room .  slightly different positions of my hand and fingers produce different distortions and my robots can interpret these distortions as orders .  i only use it for simple orders  come here .  bring tea .  and so on .        i haven   t noticed dr .  fastolfe using the system at his establishment .        it   s not really auroran .  it   s our system in solaria and i   m used to it .    besides  i always have tea at this time .  borgraf expects it .        this is borgraf .     baley eyed the robot with some interest  aware that he had only glanced at him before .  familiarity was quickly breeding indifference .  another day and he would not notice robots at all .  they would flutter about him unseen and chores would appear to do themselves .  nevertheless  he did not want to fail to notice them .  he wanted them to fail to be there .  he said     gladia  i want to be alone with you .  not even robots .    giskard  join daneel .  you can stand guard from there .        yes  sir     said giskard  brought suddenly to awareness and response by the sound of his name .  gladia seemed distantly amused .     you earthpeople are so odd .  i know you have robots on earth  but you don   t seem to know how to handle them .  you bark your orders  as though they   re deaf .     she turned to borgraf and  in a low voice  said     borgraf  none of you are to enter the room until summoned .  do not interrupt us for anything short of a clear and present emergency .     borgraf said     yes  ma   am .     he stepped back  glanced over the table as though checking whether he had omitted anything  turned  and left the room .  baley was amused  in his turn .  gladia   s voice had been soft  but her tone had been as crisp as though she were a sergeant major addressing a recruit .  but then  why should he be surprised .  he had long known that it was easier to see another   s follies than one   s own .  gladia said     we are now alone  elijah .  even the robots are gone .     baley said     you are not afraid to be alone with me .     slowly  she shook her head .     why should i be .  a raised arm  a gesture  a startled outcry  and several robots would be here promptly .  no one on any spacer world has any reason to fear any other human being .  this is not earth .  whyever should you ask  anyway .        because there are other fears than physical ones .  i would not offer you violence of any kind or mistreat you physically in any way .  but are you not afraid of my questioning and what it might uncover about you .  remember that this is not solaria  either .  on solaria  i sympathized with you and was intent on demonstrating your innocence .     she said in a low voice     don   t you sympathize with me now .        it   s not a husband dead this time .  you are not suspected of murder .  it   s only a robot that has been destroyed and  as far as i know  you are suspected of nothing .  instead  it is dr .  fastolfe who is my problem .  it is of the highest importance to me  for reasons i need not go into  that i be able to demonstrate his innocence .  if the process turns out to be damaging to you  i will not be able to help it .  i do not intend to go out of my way to save you pain .  it is only fair that i tell you this .     she raised her head and fixed her eyes on his arrogantly .     why should anything be damaging to me .        perhaps we will now proceed to find out     said baley coolly     without dr .  fastolfe present to interfere .     he plucked one of the small sandwiches out of the dish with a small fork  there was no point in using his fingers and perhaps making the entire dish unusable to gladia   scraped it off onto his own plate  popped it into his mouth  and then sipped at his tea .  she matched him sandwich for sandwich  sip for sip .  if he were going to be cool  so was she  apparently .     gladia     said baley     it is important that i know  exactly  the relationship between you and dr .  fastolfe .  you live near him and the two of you form what is virtually a single robotic household .  he is clearly concerned for you .  he has made no effort to defend his own innocence  aside from the mere statement that he is innocent  but he defends you strongly the moment i harden my questioning .     gladia smiled faintly .     what do you suspect  elijah .     baley said     don   t fence with me .  i don   t want to suspect .  i want to know .        has dr .  fastolfe mentioned fanya .        yes  he has .        have you asked him whether fanya is his wife or merely his companion .  whether he has children .     baley stirred uneasily .  he might have asked such questions  of course .  in the close quarters of crowded earth  however  privacy was cherished  precisely because it had all but perished .  it was virtually impossible on earth not to know all the facts about the family arrangements of others  so one never asked and pretended ignorance .  it was a universally maintained fraud .  here on aurora  of course  the earth ways would not hold  yet baley automatically held with them .  stupid .  he said     i have not yet asked .  tell me .     gladia said     fanya is his wife .  he has been married a number of times  consecutively of course  though simultaneous marriage for either or both sexes is not entirely unheard of on aurora .     the bit of mild distaste with which she said that brought an equally mild defense .     it is unheard of on solaria .     however  dr .  fastolfe   s current marriage will probably soon be dissolved .  both will then be free to make new attachments  though often either or both parties do not wait for dissolution to do that .    i don   t say i understand this casual way of treating the matter  elijah  but it is how aurorans build their relationships .  dr .  fastolfe  to my knowledge  is rather straitlaced .  he always maintains one marriage or another and seeks nothing outside of it .  on aurora  that is considered old fashioned and rather silly .     baley nodded .     i   ve gathered something of this in my reading .  marriage takes place when there   s the intention to have children  i understand .        in theory  that is so  but i   m told hardly anyone takes that seriously these days .  dr .  fastolfe already has two children and can   t have any more  but he still marries and applies for a third .  he gets turned down  of course  and knows he will .  some people don   t even bother to apply .        then why bother marrying .        there are social advantages to it .  it   s rather complicated and  not being an auroran  i   m not sure i understand it .        well  never mind .  tell me about dr .  fastolfe   s children .        he has two daughters by two different mothers .  neither of the mothers was fanya  of course .  he has no sons .  each daughter was incubated in the mother   s womb  as is the fashion on aurora .  both daughters are adults now and have their own establishments .        is he close with his daughters .        i don   t know .  he never talks about them .  one is a roboticist and i suppose he must keep in touch with her work .  i believe the other is running for office on the council of one of the cities or that she is actually in possession of the office .  i don   t really know .        do you know if there are family strains .        none that i am aware of  which may not go for much  elijah .  as far as i know  he is on civil terms with all his past wives .  none of the dissolutions were carried through in anger .  for one thing  dr .  fastolfe is not that kind of person .  i can   t imagine him greeting anything in life with anything more extreme than a good natured sigh of resignation .  he   ll joke on his deathbed .     that  at least  rang true  baley thought .  he said     and dr .  fastolfe   s relationship to you .  the truth  please .  we are not in a position to dodge the truth in order to avoid embarrassment .     she looked up and met his eyes levelly .  she said     there is no embarrassment to avoid .  dr .  han fastolfe is my friend  my very good friend .        how good  gladia .        as i said  very good .        are you waiting for the dissolution of his marriage so that you may be his next wife .        no .     she said it very calmly .     are you lovers  then .        no .        have you been .        no .    are you surprised .        i merely need information     said baley .     then let me answer your questions connectedly  elijah  and don   t bark them at me as though you expected to surprise me into telling you something i would otherwise keep secret .     she said it without noticeable anger .  it was almost as though she were amused .  baley  flushing slightly  was about to say that this was not at all his intention  but  of course  it was and he would gain nothing by denying it .  he said in a soft growl     well  then  go ahead .     the remains of the tea littered the table between them .  baley wondered if  under ordinary conditions  she would not have lifted her arm and bent it just so  and if the robot  borgraf  would not have then entered silently and cleared the table .  did the fact that the litter remained upset gladia  and would it make her less self controlled in her response .  if so  it had better remain  but baley did not really hope for much  for he could see no signs of gladia being disturbed over the mess or even of her being aware of it .  gladia   s eyes had fallen to her lap again and her face seemed to sink lower and to become a touch harsh  as though she were reaching into a past she would much rather obliterate .  she said     you caught a glimpse of my life on solaria .  it was not a happy one  but i knew no other .  it was not until i experienced a touch of happiness that i suddenly knew exactly to what an extent  and how intensively  my earlier life was not happy .  the first hint came through you  elijah .        through me .     baley was caught by surprise .     yes  elijah .  our last meeting on solaria  i hope you remember it  elijah  taught me something .  i touched you .  i removed my glove  one that was similar to the glove i am wearing now  and i touched your cheek .  the contact did not last long .  i don   t know what it meant to you  no  don   t tell me  it   s not important  but it meant a great deal to me .     she looked up  meeting his eyes defiantly .     it meant ever thing to me .  it changed my life .  remember  elijah  that until then  after my few years of childhood  i had never touched a man  or any human being  actually  except for my husband .  and i touched my husband very rarely .  i had viewed men on trimensic  of course  and in the process i had become entirely familiar with every physical aspect of males  every part of them .  i had nothing to learn  in that respect .     but i had no reason to think that one man felt much different from another .  i knew what my husband   s skin felt like  what his hands felt like when he could bring himself to touch me  what   everything .  i had no reason to think that anything would be different with any man .  there was no pleasure in contact with my husband  but why should there be .  is there particular pleasure in the contact of my fingers with this table  except to the extent that i might appreciate its physical smoothness .     contact with my husband was part of an occasional ritual that he went through because it was expected of him and  as a good solarian  he therefore carried it through by the calendar and clock and for the length of time and in the manner prescribed by good breeding .  except that  in another sense  it wasn   t good breeding  for although this periodic contact was for the precise purpose of sexual intercourse  my husband had not applied for a child and was not interested  i believe  in producing one .  and i was too much in awe of him to apply for one on my own initiative  as would have been my right .     as i look back on it  i can see that the sexual experience was perfunctory and mechanical .  i never had an orgasm .  not once .  that such a thing existed i gathered from some of my reading  but the descriptions merely puzzled me and  since they were to be found only in imported books  solarian books never dealt with sex  i could not trust them .  i thought they were merely exotic metaphors .     nor could i experiment  successfully  at least  with autoeroticism .  masturbation is  i think  the common word .  at least  i have heard that word used on aurora .  on solaria  of course  no aspect of sex is ever discussed  nor is any sex related word used in polite society .    nor is there any other kind of society on solaria .     from something i occasionally read  i had an idea of how one might go about masturbating and  on a number of occasions  i made a halfhearted attempt to do what was described .  i could not carry it through .  the taboo against touching human flesh made even my own seem forbidden and unpleasant to me .  i could brush my hand against my side  cross one leg over another  feel the pressure of thigh against thigh  but these were casual touches  unregarded .  to make the process of touch an instrument of deliberate pleasure was different .  every fiber of me knew it shouldn   t be done and  because i knew that  the pleasure wouldn   t come .     and it never occurred to me  never once  that there might be pleasure in touching under other circumstances .  why should it occur to me .  how could it occur to me .     until i touched you that time .  why i did  i don   t know .  i felt a gush of affection for you because you had saved me from being a murderess .  and besides  you were not altogether forbidden .  you were not a solarian .  you were not  forgive me  altogether a man .  you were a creature of earth .  you were human in appearance  but you were short lived and infection prone  something to be dismissed as semihuman at best .     so because you had saved me and were not really a man  i could touch you .  and what   s more  you looked at me not with the hostility and repugnance of my husband  or with the carefully schooled indifference of someone viewing me on trimensic .  you were right there  palpable  and your eyes were warm and concerned .  you actually trembled when my hand approached your cheek .  i saw that .     why it was  i don   t know .  the touch was so fugitive and there was no way in which the physical sensation was different from what it would have been if i had touched my husband or any other man  or  perhaps  even any woman .  but there was more to it than the physical sensation .  you were there  you welcomed it  you showed me every sign of what i accepted as   affection .  and when our skins  my hand  your cheek  made contact  it was as though i had touched gentle fire that made its way up my hand and arm instantaneously and set me all in flame .     i don   t know how long it lasted  it couldn   t be for more than a moment or two  but for me time stood still .  something happened to me that had never happened to me before and  looking back on it long afterward  when i had learned about it  i realized that i had very nearly experienced an orgasm .     i tried not to show it       baley  not daring to look at her  shook his head .      well  then  i didn   t show it .  i said     thank you  elijah .     i said it for what you had done for me in connection with my husband   s death .  but i said it much more for lighting my life and showing me  without even knowing it  what there was in life  for opening a door  for revealing a path  for pointing out a horizon .  the physical act was nothing in itself .  just a touch .  but it was the beginning of everything .     her voice had faded out and  for a moment  she said nothing  remembering .  then one finger lifted .     no .  don   t say anything .  i   m not done yet .     i had had imaginings before  very vague uncertain things .  a man and i  doing what my husband and i did  but somehow different  i didn   t even know different in what sway  and feeling something different  something i could not even imagine when imagining with all my might .  i might conceivably have gone through my whole life trying to imagine the unimaginable and i might have died as i suppose women on solaria  and men  too  often do  never knowing  even after three or four centuries .  never knowing .  having children  but never knowing .     but one touch of your cheek  elijah  and i knew .  isn   t that amazing .  you taught me what i might imagine .  not the mechanics of it  not the dull  reluctant approach of bodies  but something that i could never have conceived as having anything to do with it .  the look on a face  the sparkle in an eye  the feeling of  gentleness  kindness  something i can   t even describe  acceptance  a lowering of the terrible barrier between individuals .  love  i suppose  a convenient word to encompass all of that and more .     i felt love for you  elijah  because i thought you could feel love for me .  i don   t say you loved me  but it seemed to me you could .  i never had that and  although in ancient literature they talked of it  i didn   t know what they meant any more than when men in those same books talked about    honor    and killed each other for its sake .  i accepted the word  but never made out its meaning .  i still haven   t .  and so it was with    love    until i touched you .     after that i could imagine  and i came to aurora remembering you  and thinking of you  and talking to you endlessly in my mind  and thinking that in aurora i would meet a million elijahs .     she stopped  lost in her own thoughts for a moment  then suddenly went on     i didn   t .  aurora  it turned out  was  in its way  as bad as solaria .  in solaria  sex was wrong .  it was hated and we all turned away from it .  we could not love for the hatred that sex aroused .     in aurora  sex was boring .  it was accepted calmly  easily  as easily as breathing .  if one felt the impulse  one reached out toward anyone who seemed suitable and  if that suitable person was not at the moment engaged in something that could not be put aside  sex followed in any fashion that was convenient .  like breathing .    but where is the ecstasy in breathing .  if one were choking  then perhaps the first shuddering breath that followed upon deprivation might be an overwhelming delight and relief .  but if one never choked .     and if one never unwillingly went without sex .  if it were taught to youngsters on an even basis with reading and programming .  if children were expected to experiment as a matter of course  and if older children were expected to help out .     sex  permitted and free as water  has nothing to do with love on aurora  just as sex  forbidden and a thing of shame   has nothing to do with love on solaria .  in either case  children are few and must come about only after formal application .   and then  if permission is granted  there must be an interlude of sex designed for childbearing only  dull and brackish .  if  after a reasonable time  impregnation doesn   t follow  the spirit rebels and artificial insemination is resorted to .     in time  as on solaria  ectogenesis will be the thing  so that fertilization and fetal development will take place in genotaria and sex will be left to itself as a form of social interaction and play that has no more to do with love than space polo does .     i could not move into the auroran attitude  elijah .  i had not been brought up to it .  with terror  i had reached out for sex and no one refused  and no one mattered .  each man   s eyes were blank when i offered myself and remained blank as they accepted .  another one  they said  what matter .  they were willing  but no more than willing .     and touching them meant nothing .  i might have been touching my husband .  i learned to go through with it  to follow their lead  to accept their guidance  and it all still meant nothing .  i gained not even the urge to do it to myself and by myself .  the feeling you had given me never returned and  in time  i gave up .     in all this  dr .  fastolfe was my friend .  he alone  on all aurora  knew everything that happened on solaria .  at least  so i think you know that the full story was not made public and certainly did not appear in that dreadful hyperwave program that i   ve heard of  i refused to watch it .     dr .  fastolfe protected me against the lack of understanding on the part of aurorans and against their general contempt for solarians .  he protected me also against the despair that filled me after a while .     no  we were not lovers .  i would have offered myself  but by the time it occurred to me that i might do so  i no longer felt that the feeling you had inspired  elijah  would ever recur .  i thought it might have been a trick of memory and i gave up .  i did not offer myself .  nor did he offer himself .  i do not know why he did not .  perhaps he could see that my despair arose over my failure to find anything useful in sex and did not want to accentuate the despair by repeating the failure .  it would be typically kind of him to be careful of me in this way  so we were not lovers .  he was merely my friend at a time when i needed that so much more .     there you are  elijah .  you have the whole answer to the questions you asked .  you wanted to know my relationship with dr .  fastolfe and said you needed information .  you have it .  are you satisfied .     baley tried not let his misery show .     i am sorry  gladia  that life has been so hard for you .  you have given me the information i needed .  you have given me more information than  perhaps  you think you have .     gladia frowned .     in what way .     baley did not answer directly .  he said     gladia  i am glad that your memory of me has meant so much to you .  it never occurred to me at any time on solaria  that i was impressing you so and  even if it had  i would not have tried   you know .        i know  elijah     she said  softening .     nor would it have availed you if you had tried .  i couldn   t have .        and i know that .    nor do i take what you have told me as an invitation now .  one touch  one moment of sexual insight  need be no more than that .  very likely  it can never be repeated and that onetime existence ought not to be spoiled by foolish attempts at resurrection .  that is a reason why i do not now  offer myself .  my failure to do so is not to be interpreted as one more blank ending for you .  besides         yes .        you have  as i said earlier  told me perhaps more than you realize you did .  you have told me that the story does not end with your despair .        why do you say that .        in telling me of the feeling that was inspired by the touch upon my cheek  you said something like    looking back on it long afterward  when i had learned  i realized that i had very nearly experienced an orgasm .       but then you went on to explain that sex with aurorans was never successful and  i presume  you did not then experience orgasm either .  yet you must have  gladia  if you recognized the sensation you experienced that time on solaria .  you could not look back and recognize it for what it was  unless you had learned to love successfully .  in other words  you have had a lover and you have experienced love .  if i am to believe that dr .  fastolfe is not your lover and has not been  then it follows that someone else is  or was .        and if so .  why is that your concern  elijah .        i don   t know if it is or is not  gladia .  tell me who it is and  if it proves to be not my concern  that will be the end of it .     gladia was silent .  baley said     if you don   t tell me  gladia  i will have to tell you .  i told you earlier that i am not in a position to spare your feelings .     gladia remained silent  the corners of her lips whitening with pressure .     it must be someone  gladia  and your sorrow over jander   s loss is extreme .  you sent daneel out because you could not bear to look at him for the reminder of jander that his face brought .  if i am wrong in deciding that it was jander panell      he paused a moment  then said harshly     if the robot  jander panell  was not your lover  say so .     and gladia whispered     jander panell  the robot  was not my lover .     then  loudly and firmly  she said     he was my husband .         .   baley   s lips moved soundlessly  but there was no mistaking the tetrasyllabic exclamation .     yes     said gladia .     jehoshaphat .  you are startled .  why .  do you disapprove .     baley said tonelessly     it is not my place either to approve or disapprove .        which means you disapprove .        which means i seek only information .  how does one distinguish between a lover and a husband on aurora .        if two people live together in the same establishment for a period of time  they may refer to each other as    wife    or    husband     rather than as    lover .        how long a period of time .        that varies from region to region  i understand  according to local option .  in the city of eos  the period of time is three months .        is it also required that during this period of time one refrain from sexual relations with others .     gladia   s eyebrows lifted in surprise .     why .        i merely ask .        exclusivity is unthinkable on aurora .  husband or lover  it makes no difference .  one engages in sex at pleasure .        and did you please while you were with jander .        as it happens i did not  but that was my choice .        others offered themselves .        occasionally .        and you refused .        i can always refuse at will .  that is part of the nonexclusivity .        but did you refuse .        i did .        and did those whom you refused know why you refused .        what do you mean .        did they know that you had a robot husband .        i had a husband .  don   t call him a robot husband .  there is no such expression .        did they know .     she paused .     i don   t know if they knew .        did you tell them .        what reason was there to tell them .        don   t answer my questions with questions .  did you tell them .        i did not .        how could you avoid that .  don   t you think an explanation for your refusal would have been natural .        no explanation is ever required .  a refusal is simply a refusal and is always accepted .  i don   t understand you .     baley stopped to gather his thoughts .  gladia and he were not at cross purposes  they were running down parallel tracks .  he started again .     would it have seemed natural on solaria to have a robot for a husband .        on solaria  it would have been unthinkable and i would never have thought of such a possibility .  on solaria  everything was unthinkable .    and on earth  too  elijah .  would your wife ever have taken a robot for a husband .        that   s irrelevant  gladia .        perhaps  but your expression was answer enough .  we may not be aurorans  you and i  but we are on aurora .  i have lived here for two years and i accept its mores .        do you mean that human robot sexual connections are common here on aurora .        i don   t know .  i merely know that they are accepted because everything is accepted where sex is concerned  everything that is voluntary  that gives mutual satisfaction  and that does no physical harm to anyone .  what conceivable difference would it make to anyone else how an individual or any combination of individuals found satisfaction .  would anyone worry about which books i viewed  what food i ate  what hour i went to sleep or awoke  whether i was fond of cats or disliked roses .  sex  too  is a matter of indifference  on aurora .        on aurora     echoed baley .     but you were not born on aurora and were not brought up in its ways .  you told me just a while ago that you couldn   t adjust to this very indifference to sex that you now praise .  earlier  you expressed your distaste for multiple marriages and for easy promiscuity .  if you did not tell those whom you refused why you refused  it might have been because  in some hidden pocket of your being  you were ashamed of having jander as a husband .  you might have known  or suspected  or even merely supposed  that you were unusual in this   unusual even on aurora  and you were ashamed .        no  elijah  you won   t talk me into being ashamed .  if having a robot as a husband is unusual even on aurora  that would be because robots like jander are unusual .  the robots we have on solaria  or on earth  or on aurora  except for jander and daneel  are not designed to give any but the most primitive sexual satisfaction .  they might be used as masturbation devices  perhaps  as a mechanical vibrator might be  but nothing much more .  when the new humaniform robot becomes widespread  so will human robot sex become widespread .     baley said     how did you come to possess jander in the first place  gladia .  only two existed  both in dr .  fastolfe   s establishment .  did he simply give one of them  half of the total  to you .        yes .        why .        out of kindness  i suppose .  i was lonely  disillusioned  wretched  a stranger in a strange land .  he gave me jander for company and i will never be able to thank him enough for it .  it only lasted for half a year  but that half year may be worth all my life beside .        did dr .  fastolfe know that jander was your husband .        he never referred to it  so i don   t know .        did you refer to it .        no .        why not .        i saw no need .    and no  it was not because i felt shame .        how did it happen .        that i saw no need .        no .  that jander became your husband .     gladia stiffened .  she said in a hostile voice     why do i have to explain that .     baley said     gladia  it   s getting late .  don   t fight me every step of the way .  are you distressed that jander is  is gone .        need you ask .        do you want to find out what happened .        again  need you ask .        then help me .  i need all the information i can get if i am to begin  even begin  to make progress in working out an apparently insoluble problem .  how did jander become your husband .     gladia sat back in her chair and her eyes were suddenly brimming with tears .  she pushed at the plate of crumbs that had once been pastry and said in a choked voice     ordinary robots do not wear clothes  but they are so designed as to give the effect of wearing clothes .  i know robots well  having lived on solaria  and i have a certain amount of artistic talent         i remember your light forms     said baley softly .  gladia nodded in acknowledgment .     i constructed a few designs for new models that would possess  in my opinion  more style and more interest than some of those in use in aurora .  some of my paintings  based on those designs  are on the walls here .  others i have in other places in this establishment .     baley   s eyes moved to the paintings .  he had seen them .  they were of robots  unmistakably .  they were not naturalistic  but seemed elongated and unnaturally curved .  he noted now that the distortions were so designed as to stress  quite cleverly  those portions which  now that he looked at them from a new perspective  suggested clothing .  somehow there was an impression of servants    costumes he had once viewed in a book devoted to the victorian england of medieval times .  did gladia know of these things or was it a merely chance  if circumstantial  similarity .  it was a question of no account  probably  but not something  perhaps  to be forgotten .  when he had first noticed them  he had thought it was gladia   s way of surrounding herself with robots in imitation of life on solaria .  she hated that life  she said  but that was only a product of her thinking mind .  solaria had been the only home she had really known and that is not easily sloughed off   perhaps not at all .  and perhaps that remained a factor in her painting  even if her new occupation gave her a more plausible motive .  she was speaking .     i was successful .  some of the robot manufacturing concerns paid well for my designs and there were numerous cases of existing robots being resurfaced according to my directions .  there was a certain satisfaction in all this that  in a small measure  compensated for the emotional emptiness of my life .     when jander was given me by dr .  fastolfe  i had a robot who  of course  wore ordinary clothing .  the dear doctor was  indeed  kind enough to give me a number of changes of clothing for jander .     none of it was in the least imaginative and it amused me to buy what i considered more appropriate garb .  that meant measuring him quite accurately  since i intended to have my designs made to order  and that meant having him remove his clothing in stages .     he did so  and it was only when he was completely unclothed that i quite realized how close to human he was .  nothing was lacking and those portions which might be expected to be erectile were  indeed  erectile .  indeed  they were under what  in a human  would be called conscious control .  jander could tumesce and detumesce on order .  he told me so when i asked him if his penis was functional in that respect .  i was curious and he demonstrated .     you must understand that  although he looked very much like a man  i knew he was a robot .  i have a certain hesitation about touching men  you understand  and i have no doubt that played a part in my inability to have satisfactory sex with aurorans .  but this was not a man and i had been with robots all my life .  i could touch jander freely .     it didn   t take me long to realize that i enjoyed touching him and it didn   t take jander long to realize that i enjoyed it .  he was a finely tuned robot who followed the three laws carefully .  to have failed to give joy when he could would have been to disappoint .  disappointment could be reckoned as harm and he could not harm a human being .  he took infinite care then to give me joy and  because i saw in him the desire to give joy  something i never saw in auroran men  i was indeed joyful and  eventually  i found out  to the full  i think  what an orgasm is .     baley said     you were  then  completely happy .        with jander .  of course .  completely .        you never quarreled .        with jander .  how could i .  his only aim  his only reason for existence  was to please me .        might that not disturb you .  he only pleased you because he had to .        what motive would anyone have to do anything but that  for one reason or another  he had to .        and you never had the urge to try real  to try aurorans after you had learned to experience orgasm .        it would have been an unsatisfactory substitute .  i wanted only jander .    and do you understand  now  what i have lost .     baley   s naturally grave expression lengthened into solemnity .  he said     i understand  gladia .  if i gave you pain earlier  please forgive me  for i did not entirely understand then .     but she was weeping and he waited  unable to say anything more  unable to think of a reasonable way to console her .  finally  she shook her head and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand .  she whispered     is there anything more .     baley said apologetically     a few questions on another subject and then i will be through annoying you .     he added cautiously     for now .        what is it .     she seemed very tired .     do you know that there are people who seem to think that dr .  fastolfe was responsible for the killing of jander .        yes .        do you know that dr .  fastolfe himself admits that only he possesses the expertise to kill jander in the way that he was killed .        yes .  the dear doctor told me so himself .        well  then  gladia  do you think dr .  fastolfe killed jander .     she looked up at him  suddenly and sharply  and then said angrily     of course not .  why should he .  jander was his robot to begin with and he was full of care for him .  you don   t know the dear doctor as i do  elijah .  he is a gentle person who would hurt no one and who would never hurt a robot .  to suppose he would kill one is to suppose that a rock would fall upward .        i have no further questions  gladia  and the only other business i have here  at the moment  is to see jander  what remains of jander  if i have your permission .     she was suspicious again  hostile .     why .  why .        gladia .  please .  i don   t expect it to be of any use  but i must see jander and know that seeing him is of no use .  i will try to do nothing that will offend your sensibilities .     gladia stood up .  her gown  so simple as to be nothing more than a closely fitting sheath  was not black  as it would have been on earth  but of a dull color that showed no sparkle anywhere in it .  baley  no connoisseur of clothing  realized how well it represented mourning .     come with me     she whispered .      .   baley followed gladia through several rooms  the walls of which glowed dully .  on one or two occasions  he caught a hint of movement  which he took to be a robot getting rapidly out of the way  since they had been told not to intrude .  through a hallway  then  and up a short flight of stairs into a small room in which one part of one wall gleamed to give the effect of a spotlight .  the room held a cot and a chair  and no other furnishings .     this was his room     said gladia .  then  as though answering baley   s thought  she went on to say     it was all he needed .  i left him alone as much as i could  all day if i could .  i did not want to ever grow tired of him .     she shook her head .     i wish now i had stayed with him every second .  i didn   t know our time would be so short .    here he is .     jander was lying on the cot and baley looked at him gravely .  the robot was covered with a smooth and shiny material .  the spotlighted wall cast its glow on jander   s head  which was smooth and almost inhuman in its serenity .  the eyes were wide open  but they were opaque and lusterless .  he looked enough like daneel to give ample point to gladia   s discomfort at daneel   s presence .  his neck and bare shoulders showed above the sheet .  baley said     has dr .  fastolfe inspected him .        yes  thoroughly .  i came to him in despair and  if you had seen him rush here  the concern he felt  the pain  the  the panic  you would never think he could have been responsible .  there was nothing he could do .        is he unclothed .        yes .  dr .  fastolfe had to remove the clothing for a thorough examination .  there was no point in replacing them .        would you permit me to remove the covering  gladia .        must you .        i do not wish to be blamed for having missed some obvious point of examination .        what can you possibly find that dr .  fastolfe didn   t .        nothing  gladia  but i must know that there is nothing for me to find .  please cooperate .        well  then  go ahead  but please put the covering back exactly as it is now when you are done .     she turned her back on him and on jander  put her left arm against the wall  and rested her forehead on it .  there was no sound from her  no motion  but baley knew that she was weeping again .  the body was  perhaps  not quite human .  the muscular contours were somehow simplified and a bit schematic  but all the parts were there  nipples  navel  penis  testicles  pubic hair  and so on .  even fine  light hair on the chest .  how many days was it since jander had been killed .  it struck baley that he didn   t know  but it had been sometime before his trip to aurora had begun .  over a week had passed and there was no sign of decay  either visually or olfactorily .  a clear robotic difference .  baley hesitated and then thrust one arm under jander   s shoulders and another under his hips  working them through to the other side .  he did not consider asking for gladia   s help  that would be impossible .  he heaved and  with some di culty  turned jander over without throwing him off the cot .  the cot creaked .  gladia must know what he was doing  but she did not turn around .  though she did not offer to help  she did not protest either .  baley withdrew his arms .  jander felt warm to the touch .  presumably  the power unit continued to do so simple a thing as to maintain temperature  even with the brain inoperative .  the body felt firm and resilient  too .  presumably  it never went through any stage analogous to rigor mortis .  one arm was now dangling off the cot in quite a human fashion .  baley moved it gently and released it .  it swung to and fro slightly and came to a halt .  he bent one leg at the knee and studied the foot  then the other .  the buttocks were perfectly formed and there was even an anus .  baley could not get rid of the feeling of uneasiness .  the notion that he was violating the privacy of a human being would not go away .  if it were a human corpse  its coldness and its stiffness would have deprived it of humanity .  he thought uncomfortably  a robot corpse is much more human than a human corpse .  again he reached under jander  lifted  and turned him over .  he smoothed out the sheet as best he could  then replaced the cover as it had been and smoothed that .  he stepped back and decided it was as it had been at first  or as near to that as he could manage .     i   m finished  gladia     he said .  she turned  looked at jander with wet eyes  and said     may we go  then .        yes  of course  but gladia         well .        will you be keeping him this way .  i imagine he won   t decay .        does it matter if i do .        in some ways  yes .  you must give yourself a chance to recover .  you can   t spend three centuries mourning .  what is over is over .      his statements sounded hollowly sententious in his own ear .  what must they have sounded like in hers .   she said     i know you mean it kindly  elijah .  i have been requested to keep jander till the investigation is done .  he will then be torched at my request .        torched .        put under a plasma torch and reduced to his elements  as human corpses are .  i will have holograms of him  and memories .  will that satisfy you .        of course .  i must return to dr .  fastolfe   s house now .        yes .  have you learned anything from jander   s body .        i did not expect to  gladia .     she faced him full .     and elijah  i want you to find who did this and why .  i must know .        but gladia      she shook her head violently  as though keeping out anything she wasn   t ready to hear .     i know you can do this .        again fastolfe     .   baley emerged from gladia   s house into the sunset .  he turned toward what he assumed must be the western horizon and found aurora   s sun  a deep scarlet in color  topped by thin strips of ruddy clouds set in an apple green sky .     jehoshaphat     he murmured .  clearly  aurora   s sun  cooler and more orange than earth   s sun  accentuated the difference at setting  when its light passed through a greater thickness of aurora .  daneel was behind him  giskard  as before  well in front .  daneel   s voice was in his ear .     are you well  partner elijah .        quite well     said baley  pleased with himself .     i   m handling the outside well  daneel .  i can even admire the sunset .  is it always like this .     daneel gazed dispassionately at the setting sun and said     yes .  but let us move quickly toward dr .  fastolfe   s establishment .  at this time of year  the twilight does not last long  partner elijah  and i would wish you there while you can still see easily .        i   m ready .  let   s go .     baley wondered if it might not be better to wait for the darkness .  it would not be pleasant not to see  but  then  it would give him the illusion of being enclosed  and he was not  in his heart  sure as to how long this euphoria induced by admiring a sunset  a sunset  mind you  outside  would last .  but that was a cowardly uncertainty and he would not own up to it .  giskard noiselessly drifted backward toward him and said     would you prefer to wait  sir .  would the darkness suit you better .  we ourselves will not be discommoded .     baley became aware of other robots  farther off  on every side .  had gladia marked off her field robots for guard duty or had fastolfe sent his .  it accentuated the way they were all caring for him and  perversely  he would not admit to weakness .  he said     no  we   ll go now     and struck off at a brisk walk toward fastolfe   s establishment  which he could just see through the distant trees .  let the robots follow or not  as they wished  he thought boldly .  he knew that  if he let himself think about it  there would be something within him that would still quail at the thought of himself on the outer skin of a planet with no protection but air between himself and the great void  but he would not think of it .  it was the exhilaration at being free of the fear that made his jaws tremble and his teeth click .  or it was the cool wind of evening that did it  and that also set the gooseflesh to appearing on his arms .  it was not the outside .  it was not .  he said  trying to unclench his teeth     how well did you know jander  daneel .     daneel said     we were together for some time .  from the time of friend jander   s construction  till he passed into the establishment of miss gladia  we were together steadily .        did it bother you  daneel  that jander resembled you so closely .        no  sir .  he and i each knew ourselves apart  partner elijah  and dr .  fastolfe did not mistake us either .  we were  therefore  two individuals .        and could you tell them apart  too  giskard .     they were closer to him now  perhaps because the other robots had taken over the long distance duties .  giskard said     there was no occasion  as i recall  on which it was important that i do so .        and if there had been  giskard .        then i could have done so .        what was your opinion of jander  daneel .     daneel said     my opinion  partner elijah .  concerning what aspect of jander do you wish my opinion .        did he do his work well  for instance .        certainly .        was he satisfactory in every way .        in every way  to my knowledge .        how about you  giskard .  what is your opinion .     giskard said     i was never as close to friend jander as friend daneel was and it would not be proper for me to state an opinion .  i can say that  to my knowledge  dr .  fastolfe was uniformly pleased with friend jander .  he seemed equally pleased with friend jander and with friend daneel .  however  i do not think my programming is such as to allow me to offer certainty in such matters .     baley said     what about the period after jander entered the household of miss gladia .  did you know him then  daneel .        no  partner elijah .  miss gladia kept him at her establishment .  on those occasions when she visited dr .  fastolfe  he was never with her  as far as i was aware .  on occasions when i accompanied dr .  fastolfe on a visit to miss gladia   s establishment  i did not see friend jander .     baley felt a little surprised at that .  he turned to giskard in order to ask the same question  paused  and then shrugged .  he was not really getting anywhere and  as dr .  fastolfe had indicated earlier  there is not really much use in cross examining a robot .  they would not knowingly say anything that would harm a human being  nor could they be badgered  bribed  or cajoled into it .  they would not openly lie  but they would remain stubbornly  if politely  insistent on giving useless answers .  and  perhaps  it no longer mattered .  they were at fastolfe   s doorstep now and baley felt his breath quickening .  the trembling of his arms and lower lip  he was confident  was  indeed  only because of the cool wind .  the sun had gone now  a few stars were visible  the sky was darkening to an odd greenish purple that made it seem bruised  and he passed through the door into the warmth  f the glowing walls .  he was safe .  fastolfe greeted him .     you are back in good time  mr .  baley .  was your session with gladia fruitful .     baley said     quite fruitful  dr .  fastolfe .  it is even possible that i hold the key to the answer in my hand .         .   fastolfe merely smiled politely  in a way that signaled neither surprise  elation  nor disbelief .  he led the way into what was obviously a dining room  a smaller and friendlier one than the one in which they had had lunch .     you and i  my dear mr .  baley     said fastolfe pleasantly     will eat an informal dinner alone .  merely the two of us .  we will even have the robots absent if that will please you .  nor shall we talk business unless you desperately want to .     baley said nothing  but paused to look at the walls in astonishment .  they were a wavering  luminous green  with differences in brightness and in tint that were slowly progressive from bottom to top .  there was a hint of fronds of deeper green and shadowy flickers this way and that .  the walls made the room appear to be a well lit grotto at the bottom of a shallow arm of the sea .  the effect was vertiginous  at least  baley found it so .  fastolfe had no trouble interpreting baley   s expression .  he said     it   s an acquired taste  mr .  baley  i admit .    giskard  subdue the wall illumination .    thank you .     baley drew a breath of relief .     and thank you  dr .  fastolfe .  may i visit the personal  sir .        but of course .     baley hesitated .     could you      fastolfe chuckled .     you   ll find it perfectly normal  mr .  baley .  you will have no complaints .     baley bent his head .     thank you very much .     without the intolerable make believe  the personal  he believed it to be the same one he had used earlier in the day  was merely what it was  a much more luxurious and hospitable one than he had ever seen .  it was incredibly different from those on earth  which were rows of identical units stretching indefinitely  each ticked off for use by one  and only one  individual at a time .  it gleamed somehow with hygienic cleanliness .  its outermost molecular layer might have been peeled off after every use and a new layer laid on .  obscurely  baley felt that  if he stayed on aurora long enough  he would find it difficult to readjust himself to earth   s crowds  which forced hygiene and cleanliness into the background  something to pay a distant obeisance to  a not quite attainable ideal .  baley  standing there surrounded by conveniences of ivory and gold  not real ivory  no doubt  nor real gold   gleaming and smooth  suddenly found himself shuddering at earth   s casual exchange of bacteria and wincing at its richness in infectivity .  was that not what the spacers felt .  could he blame them .  he washed his hands thoughtfully  playing with the tiny touches here and there along the control strip in order to change the temperature .  and yet these aurorans were so unnecessarily garish in their interior decorations  so insistent in pretending they were living in a state of nature when they had tamed nature and broken it .    or was that only fastolfe .  after all  gladia   s establishment had been far more austere .    or was that only because she had been brought up on solaria .  the dinner that followed was an unalloyed delight .  again  as at lunch  there was the distinct feeling of being closer to nature .  the dishes were numerous  each different  each in small portions  and  in a number of cases  it was possible to see that they had once been part of plants and animals .  he was beginning to look upon the inconveniences  the occasional small bone  bit of gristle  strand of fiber  which might have repelled him earlier   as a bit of adventure .  the first course was a little fish  a little fish that one ate whole  with whatever internal organs it might have  and that struck him  at first sight  as another foolish way of rubbing one   s nose in nature with a capital    n .     but he swallowed the little fish anyway  as fastolfe did  and the taste converted him at once .  he had never experienced anything like it .  it was as though taste buds had suddenly been invented and inserted iii his tongue .  tastes changed from dish to dish and some were distinctly odd and not entirely pleasant  but he found it didn   t matter .  the thrill of a distinct taste  of different distinct tastes  at fastolfe   s instruction  he took a sip of faintly flavored water between dishes  was what counted  and not the inner detail .  he tried not to gobble  nor to concentrate his attention entirely on the food  nor to lick his plate .  desperately  he continued to observe and imitate fastolfe and to ignore the other   s kindly but definitely amused glance .     i trust     said fastolfe     you find this to your taste .        quite good     baley managed to choke out .     please don   t force yourself into useless politeness .  do not eat anything that seems strange or unpalatable to you .  i will have additional helpings of anything you do like brought in its place .        not necessary  dr .  fastolfe .  it is all rather satisfactory .        good .     despite fastolfe   s offer to eat without robots present  it was a robot who served .   fastolfe  accustomed to this  probably did not even notice the fact  baley thought  and he did not bring the matter up .   as was to be expected  the robot was silent and his motions were flawless .  his handsome livery seemed to be out of historical dramas that baley had seen on hyperwave .  it was only at very close view that one could see how much the costume was an illusion of the lighting and how close the robot exterior was to a smooth metal finish  and no more .  baley said     has the waiter   s surface been designed by gladia .        yes     said fastolfe  obviously pleased .     how complimented she will feel to know that you recognized her touch .  she is good  isn   t she .  her work is coming into increasing popularity and she fills a useful niche in auroran society .     conversation throughout the meal had been pleasant but unimportant .  baley had had no urge to    talk business    and had  in fact  preferred to be largely silent while enjoying the meal and leaving it to his unconscious  or whatever faculty took over in the absence of hard thought  to decide on how to approach the matter that seemed to him now to be the central point of the jander problem .  fastolfe took the matter out of his hands  rather  by saying     and now that you   ve mentioned gladia  mr .  baley  may i ask how it came about that you left for her establishment rather deep in despair and have returned almost buoyant and speaking of perhaps having the key to the whole affair in your hand .  did you learn something new  and unexpected  perhaps  at gladia   s .        that i did     said baley absently  but he was lost in the dessert  which he could not recognize at all  and of which  after some yearning in his eyes had acted to inspire the waiter  a second small helping was placed before him .  he felt replete .  he had never in his life so enjoyed the act of eating and for the first time found himself resenting the physiological limits that made it impossible to eat forever .  he felt rather ashamed of himself that he should feel so .     and what was it learned that was new and unexpected .     asked fastolfe with quiet patience .     presumably something i didn   t know myself .        perhaps .  gladia told me that you had given jander to her about half a year ago .     fastolfe nodded .     i knew that .  so i did .     baley said sharply     why .     the amiable look on fastolfe   s face faded slowly .  then he said     why not .     baley said     i don   t know why not  dr .  fastolfe .  i don   t care .  my question is  why .     fastolfe shook his head slightly and said nothing .  baley said     dr .  fastolfe  i am here in order to straighten out what seems to be a miserable mess .  nothing you have done   nothing  has made things simple .  rather  you have taken what seems to be pleasure in showing me how bad a mess it is and in destroying any speculation i may advance as a possible solution .  now  i don   t expect others to answer my questions .  i have no official standing on this world and have no right to ask questions  let alone force answers .     you  however  are different .  i am here at your request and i am trying to save your career as well as mine and  according to your own account of matters  i am trying to save aurora as well as earth .  therefore  i expect you to answer my questions fully and truthfully .  please don   t indulge in stalemating tactics  such as asking me why not when i ask why .  now  once again  and for the last time  why .     fastolfe thrust out his lips and looked grim .     my apologies  mr .  baley .  if i hesitated to answer  it is because  looking back on it  it seems there is no very dramatic reason .  gladia delmarre  no  she doesn   t want her surname used  gladia is a stranger on this planet  she has undergone traumatic experiences on her home world  as you know  and traumatic experiences on this one  as perhaps you don   t know         i do know .  please be more direct .        well  then  i was sorry for her .  she was alone and jander  i thought  would make her feel less alone .        sorry for her .  just that .  are you lovers .  have you been .        no  not at all .  i did not offer .  nor did she .    why .  did she tell you we were lovers .        no  she did not  but i need independent confirmation  in any case .  i   ll let you know when there is a contradiction  you needn   t concern yourself about that .  how is it that with you sympathizing so with her and  from what i gather from gladia  she feeling so grateful to you  that neither of you offered yourself .  i gather that on aurora offering sex is about on a par with commenting upon the weather .     fastolfe frowned .     you know nothing about it  mr .  baley .  don   t judge us by the standards of your own world .  sex is not a matter of great importance to us  but we are careful as to how we use it .  it may not seem so to you  but none of us offer it lightly .  gladia  unused to our ways and sexually frustrated on solaria  perhaps did offer it lightly  or desperately might be the better word  and it may not be surprising  therefore  that she did not enjoy the results .        didn   t you try to improve matters .        by offering myself .  i am not what she needs and  for that matter  she is not what i need .  i was sorry for her .  i like her .  i admire her artistic talent .  and i want her to be happy .    after all  mr .  baley  surely you   ll agree that the sympathy of one human being for another need not rest on sexual desire or on anything but decent human feeling .  have you never felt sympathy for anyone .  have you never wanted to help someone for no reason other than the good feeling it gave you to relieve another   s misery .  what kind of planet do you come from .     baley said     what you say is justified  dr .  fastolfe .  i do not question the fact that you are a decent human being .  still  bear with me .  when i first asked you why you had given jander to gladia  you did not tell me then what you have told me just now  and with considerable emotion  too  i might add .  your first impulse was to duck  to hesitate  to play for time by asking why not .     granted that what you finally told me is so  what is it about the question that embarrassed you at first .  what reason  that you did not want to admit  came to you before you settled on the reason you did want to admit .  forgive me for insisting  but i must know  and not out of personal curiosity  i assure you .  if what you tell me is of no use in this sorry business  then you may consider it thrown into a black hole .     fastolfe said in a low voice     in all honesty  i am not sure why i parried your question .  you surprised me into something that  perhaps  i don   t want to face .  let me think  mr .  baley .     they sat there together quietly .  the server cleared the table and left the room .  daneel and giskard were elsewhere  presumably  they were guarding the house  .  baley and fastolfe were at last alone in a robot free room .  finally  fastolfe said     i don   t know what i ought to tell you  but let me go back some decades .  i have two daughters .  perhaps you know that .  they are by two different mothers         would you rather have had sons  dr .  fastolfe .     fastolfe looked genuinely surprised .     no .  not at all .  the mother of my second daughter wanted a son  i believe  but i wouldn   t give my consent to artificial insemination with selected sperm  not even with my own sperm  but insisted on the natural throw of the genetic dice .  before you ask why  it is because i prefer a certain operation of chance in life and because i think  on the whole  i wanted a chance to have a daughter .  i would have accepted a son  you understand  but i didn   t want to abandon the chance of a daughter .  i approve of daughters  somehow .  well  my second proved a daughter and that may have been one of the reasons that the mother dissolved the marriage soon after the birth .  on the other hand  a sizable percentage of marriages are dissolved after a birth in any case  so perhaps i needn   t look for special reasons .        she took the child with her  i take it     fastolfe bent a puzzled glance at baley .     why should she do that .    but i forget .  you   re from earth .  no  of course not .  the child would have been brought up in a nursery  where she could be properly cared for  of course .  actually  though     he wrinkled his nose as though in sudden embarrassment over a peculiar memory     she wasn   t put there .  i decided to bring her up myself .  it was legal to do so but very unusual .  i was quite young  of course  not yet having attained the century mark  but already i had made my mark in robotics .        did you manage .        you mean to bring her up successfully .  oh yes .  i grew quite fond of her .  i named her vasilia .  it was my mother   s name  you see .     he chuckled reminiscently .     i get these odd streaks of sentiment  like my affection for my robots .  i never met my mother  of course  but her name was on my charts .  and she   s still alive  as far as i know  so i could see her  but i think there   s something queasy about meeting someone in whose womb you once were .    where was i .        you named your daughter vasilia .        yes  and i did bring her up and actually grew fond of her .  very fond of her .  i could see where the attraction lay in doing something like that  but  of course  i was an embarrassment to my friends and i had to keep her out of their way when there was contact to be made  either social or professional .  i remember once      he paused .     yes .        it   s something i haven   t thought of for decades .  she came running out  weeping for some reason  and threw herself into my arms when dr .  sarton was with me  discussing one of the very earliest design programs for humaniform robots .  she was only seven years old  i think and  of course  i hugged her  and kissed her  and ignored the business at hand  which was quite unforgivable of me .  sarton left  coughing and choking  and most indignant .  it was a full week before i could renew contact with him and resume deliberation .  children shouldn   t have that effect on people  i suppose  but there are so few children and they are so rarely encountered .        and your daughter  vasilia  was fond of you .        oh yes  at least  until   she was very fond of me .  i saw to her schooling and made sure her mind was allowed to expand to the fullest .        you said she was fond of you until  something .  you did not finish the sentence .  there came a time  then  when she was no longer fond of you .  when was that .        she wanted to have her own establishment once she grew old enough .  it was only natural .        and you did not want it .        what do you mean i did not want it .  of course  i wanted it .  you keep assuming i   m a monster  mr .  baley .        am i to assume  instead  that once she reached the age when she was to have her own establishment  she no longer felt the same affection for you that she naturally had when she was actively your daughter  living in your establishment as a dependent .        not quite that simple .  in fact  it was rather complicated .  you see      fastolfe seemed embarrassed .     i refused her when she offered herself to me .        she offered herself to you .     said baley  horrified .     that part was only natural     said fastolfe indifferently .     she knew me best .  i had instructed her in sex  encouraged her experimentation  taken her to the games of eros  done my best for her .  it was something to be expected and i was foolish for not expecting it and letting myself be caught .        but incest .     fastolfe said     incest .  oh yes  an earthly term .  on aurora  there   s no such thing  mr .  baley .  very few aurorans know their immediate family .  naturally  if marriage is in question and children are applied for  there is a genealogical search  but what has that to do with social sex .  no no  the unnatural thing is that i refused my own daughter .     he reddened  his large ears most of all .     i should hope so     muttered baley .     i had no decent reasons for it  either  at least none that i could explain to vasilia .  it was criminal of me not to foresee the matter and prepare a foundation for a rational rejection of one so young and inexperienced  if that were necessary  that would not wound her and subject her to a fearful humiliation .  i am really unbearably ashamed that i took the unusual responsibility of bringing up a child  only to subject her to such an unpalatable experience .  it seemed to me that we could continue our relationship as father and daughter  as friend and friend  but she did not give up .  whenever i rejected her  no matter how affectionately i tried to do so  matters grew worse between us .        until finally         finally  she wanted her own establishment .  i opposed it at first  not because i didn   t want her to have one  but because i wanted to reestablish our loving relationship before she left .  nothing i did helped .  it was  perhaps  the most trying time of my life .  eventually  she simply  and rather violently  insisted on leaving and i could hold out no longer .  she was a professional roboticist by then  i am grateful that she didn   t abandon the profession out of distaste for me  and she was .  able to found an establishment without any help from me .  she did so  in fact  and since then there has been little contact between us .     baley said     it might be  dr .  fastolfe  that  since she did not abandon robotics  she does not feel wholly estranged .        it is what she does best and is most interested in .  it has nothing to do with me .  i know that  for to begin with  i thought as you did and i made friendly overtures  but they were not received .        do you miss her  dr .  fastolfe .        of course i miss her  mr .  baley .    that is an example of the mistake of bringing up a child .  you give into an irrational impulse  an atavistic desire  and it leads to inspiring the child with the strongest possible feeling of love and then subject yourself to the possibility of having to refuse that same child   s first offer of herself and scarring her emotionally for life .  and  to add to that  you subject yourself to this thoroughly irrational feeling of regret of absence .  it   s something i never felt before and have never felt since .  she and i have both suffered needlessly and the fault is entirely mine .     fastolfe fell into a kind of rumination and baley said gently     and what has all this to do with gladia .     fastolfe started .     oh .  i had forgotten .  well  it   s rather simple .  everything i   ve said about gladia is true .  i liked her .  i sympathized with her .  i admired her talent .  but  in addition  she resembles vasilia .  i noticed the similarity when i saw the first hyperwave account of her arrival from solaria .  it was quite startling and it made me take an interest .     he sighed .     when i realized that she  like vasilia  had been sex scarred  it was more than i could endure .  i arranged to have her established near me  as you see .  i have been her friend and done my best to cushion the difficulties of adapting to a strange world .        she is a daughter substitute  then .        after a fashion  yes  i suppose you could call it that  mr .  baley .    and you have no idea how glad i am she never took it  into her head to offer herself to me .  to have rejected her would have been to relive my rejection of vasilia .  to have accepted her out of an inability to repeat the rejection would have embittered my life  for then i would have felt that i was doing for this stranger  this faint reflection of my daughter  what i would not do for my daughter herself .  either way   but  never mind  you can see now why i hesitated to answer you at first .  somehow  thinking about it led my mind back to this tragedy in my life .        and your other daughter .        lumen .     said fastolfe indifferently .     i never had any contact with her  though i hear of her from time to time .        she   s running for political office  i understand .        a local one .  on the globalist ticket .        what is that .        the globalists .  they favor aurora alone  just our own globe  you see .  aurorans are to take the lead in settling the galaxy .  others are to be barred  as far as possible  particularly earthmen .     enlightened self interest    they call it .        this is not your view  of course .        of course not .  i am heading the humanist party  which believes that all human beings have a right to share in the galaxy .  when i refer to    my enemies     i mean the globalists .        lumen  then  is one of your enemies .        vasilia is one  also .  she is  indeed  a member of the robotics institute of aurora  the ria  that was founded a few years ago and which is run by roboticists who view me    as a demon to be defeated at all costs .  as far as i know  however  my various ex wives are apolitical  perhaps even humanist .     he smiled wryly and said     well  mr .  baley  have you asked all the questions you wanted to ask .     baley   s hands aimlessly searched for pockets in his smooth  loose auroran breeches  something he had been doing periodically since he had begun wearing them on the ship  and found none .  he compromised  as he sometimes did  by folding his arms across his chest .  he said     actually  dr .  fastolfe .  i   m not at all sure you have yet answered the first question .  it seems to me that you never tire of evading that .  why did you give jander to gladia .  let   s get all of it into the open  so that we may be able to see light in what now seems darkness .         .   fastolfe reddened again .  it might have been anger this time  but he continued to speak softly .  he said     do not bully me  mr .  baley .  i have given you your answer .  i was sorry for gladia and i thought jander would be company for her .  i have spoken more frankly to you than i would to anyone else  partly because of the position i am in and partly because you are not an auroran .  in return  i demand a reasonable respect .     baley bit his lower lip .  he was not on earth .  he had no official authority behind him and he had more at stake than his professional pride .  he said     i apologize  dr .  fastolfe  if i have hurt your feelings .  i do not mean to imply you are being untruthful or uncooperative .  nevertheless  i cannot operate without the whole truth .  let me suggest the possible answer i am looking for and you can then tell me if i am correct  or nearly correct  or totally wrong .  can it be that you have given jander to gladia  in order that he might serve as a focus for her sexual drive and so that she might not have occasion to offer herself to you .  perhaps that was not your conscious reason  but think about it now .  is it possible that such a feeling contributed to the gift .     fastolfe   s hand picked up a light and transparent ornament that had been resting on the dining room table .  it turned it over and over  over and over .  except for that motion  fastolfe seemed frozen .  finally  he said     that might be so  mr .  baley .  certainly  after i loaned her jander  it was never an outright gift  incidentally  i was less concerned about her offering herself to me .        do you know whether gladia made use of jander for sexual purposes .        did you ask gladia if she made use of him  mr .  baley .        that has nothing to do with my question .  do you know .  did you witness any overt sexual actions between them .  did any of your robots inform you of such .  did she herself tell you .        the answer to all those questions  mr .  baley  is no .  if i stop to think about it  there is nothing particularly unusual about the use of robots for sexual purposes by either men or women .  ordinary robots are not particularly adapted to it  but human beings are ingenious in this respect .  as for jander  he is adapted to it because he is as humaniform as we could make him         so that he might take part in sex .        no  that was never in our minds .  it was the abstract problem of building a totally humaniform robot that exercised the late dr .  sarton and myself .        but such humaniform robots are ideally designed for sex  are they not .        i suppose they are and  now that i allow myself to think of it  and i admit i may have had it hidden in my mind from the start  gladia might well have used jander so .  if she did  i hope the process gave her pleasure .  i would consider my loan to her a good deed  if it had .        could it have been more of a good deed than you counted upon .        in what way .        what would you say if i told you that gladia and jander were wife and husband .     fastolfe   s hand  still holding the ornament  closed convulsively upon it  held it tightly for a moment  then let it drop .     what .  that   s ridiculous .  it is legally impossible .  there is no question of children  so there can   t conceivably be an application for any .  without the intention of such an application  there can be no marriage .        this is not a matter of legality  dr .  fastolfe .  gladia is a solarian  remember  and doesn   t have the auroran outlook .  it is a matter of emotion .  gladia herself told me that she considered jander to have been her husband .  i think she considers herself now his widow and that she has had another sexual trauma   and a very severe one .  if  in any way  you knowingly contributed to this event         by all the stars     said fastolfe with unwonted emotion     i didn   t .  whatever else was in my mind  i never imagined that gladia could fantasize marriage to a robot  however humaniform he might be .  no auroran could have imagined that .     baley nodded and raised his hand .     i believe you .  i don   t think you are actor enough to be drowning me in a faked sincerity .  but i had to know .  it was  after all  just possible that         no  it was not .  possible that i foresaw this situation .  that i deliberately created this abominable widowhood  for some reason .  never .  it was not conceivable  so i did not conceive it .  mr .  baley  whatever i meant in placing jander in her establishment  i meant well .  i did not mean this .  meaning well is a poor defense  i know  but it is all that i have to offer .        dr .  fastolfe  let us refer to that no more     said baley .     what i have now to offer is a possible solution to the mystery .     fastolfe breathed deeply and sat back in his chair .     you hinted as much when you returned from gladia   s .     he looked at baley with a hint of savagery in his eyes .     could you not have told me this    key    you have at the start .  need we have gone through all  this .        i   m sorry  dr .  fastolfe .  the key makes no sense without all   this .        well  then .  get on with it .        i will .  jander was in a position that you  the greatest robotics theoretician in all the world  did not foresee  by your own admission .  he was pleasing gladia so well that she was deeply in love with him and considered him her husband .  what if it turns out that  in pleasing her  he was also displeasing her .        i   m not sure as to your meaning .        well  see here  dr .  fastolfe .  she was rather secretive about the matter .  i gather that on aurora sexual matters are not something one hides at all costs .        we don   t broadcast it over the hyperwave     said fastolfe dryly     but we don   t make a greater secret of it than we do of any other strictly personal matter .  we generally know who   s been whose latest partner and  if one is dealing with friends  we often get an idea of how good  or how enthusiastic  or how much the reverse one or the other partner  or both  might be .  it   s a matter of small talk on occasion .        yes  but you knew nothing of gladia   s connection with jander .        i suspected         not the same thing .  she told you nothing .  you saw nothing .  nor could any robots report anything .  she kept it secret even from you  her best friend on aurora .  clearly  her robots were given careful instructions never to discuss jander and jander himself must have been thoroughly instructed to give nothing away .        i suppose that   s a fair conclusion .        why should she do that  dr .  fastolfe .        a solarian sense of privacy about sex .        isn   t that the same as saying she was ashamed of it .        she had no cause to be  although the matter of considering jander a husband would have made her a laughingstock .        she might have concealed that portion very easily without concealing everything .  suppose  in her solarian way  she was ashamed .        well  then .        no one enjoys being ashamed  and she might have blamed jander for it  in the rather unreasonable way people have of seeking to attribute to others the blame for unpleasantness that is clearly their own fault .        yes .        there might have been times when gladia  who has a short   fused temper  might have burst into tears  let us say  and upbraided jander for being the source of her shame and her misery .  it might not have lasted long and she might have shifted quickly to apologies and caresses  but would not jander have clearly gotten the idea that he was actually the source of her shame and her misery .        perhaps .        and might this not have meant to jander that if he continued the relationship  he would make her miserable  and that if he ended the relationship  he would make her miserable .  whatever he did  he would be breaking the first law and  unable to act in any way without such a violation  he could only find refuge in not acting at all  and so went into mental freeze out .    do you remember the story you told me earlier today of the legendary mind reading robot who was driven into stasis by that robotics pioneer .        by susan calvin  yes .  i see .  you model your scenario on that old legend .  very ingenious  mr .  baley  but it won   t work .        why not .  when you said only you could bring about a mental freeze out in jander  you did not have the faintest idea that he was involved so deeply in so unexpected a situation .  it runs exactly parallel to the susan calvin situation .        let   s suppose that the story about susan calvin and the mind reading robot is not merely a totally fictitious legend .  let   s take it seriously .  there would still be no parallel between that story and the jander situation .  in the case of susan calvin  we would be dealing with an incredibly primitive robot  one that today would not even achieve the status of a toy .  it could deal only qualitatively with such matters  a creates misery  not a creates misery  therefore mental freeze out .     baley said     and jander .        any modern robot  any robot of the last century  would weigh such matters quantitatively .  which of the two situations  a or not a  would create the most misery .  the robot would come to a rapid decision and opt for minimum misery .  the chance that he would judge the two mutually exclusive alternatives to produce precisely equal quantities of misery is small and  even if that should turn out to be the case  the modern robot is supplied with a randomization factor .  if a and not a are precisely equal misery producers according to his judgment  he chooses one or the other in a completely unpredictable way and then follows that unquestioningly .  he does not go into mental freeze out .        are you saying it is impossible for jander to go into mental freeze out .  you have been saying you could have produced it .        in the case of the humaniform positronic brain  there is a way of sidetracking the randomization factor that depends entirely on the way in which that brain is constructed .  even if you know the basic theory  it is a very difficult and long sustained process to so lead the robot down the garden path  so to speak  by a skillful succession of questions and orders as to finally induce the mental freeze out .  it is unthinkable that it be done by accident and the mere existence of all apparent contradiction as that produced by simultaneous love and shame could not do the trick without the most careful quantitative adjustment under the most unusual conditions  which leaves us  as i keep saying  with indeterministic chance as the only possible way in which it happened .        but your enemies will insist that your own guilt is the more likely .    could we not  in our turn  insist that jander was brought to mental freeze out by the conflict brought on by gladia   s love and shame .  would this not sound plausible .  and would it not win public opinion to your side .     fastolfe frowned .     mr .  baley  you are too eager .  think about it seriously .  if we were to try to get out of our dilemma in this rather dishonest fashion  what would be the consequence .  i say nothing of the shame and misery it would bring to gladia  who would suffer not only the loss of jander but the feeling that she herself had brought about that loss if  in fact  she had really felt and had somehow revealed her shame .  i would not want to do that  but let us put that to one side  if we can .  consider  instead  that my enemies would say that i had loaned her jander precisely to bring about what had happened .  i would have done it  they would say  in order to develop a method for mental freeze out in humaniform robots while escaping all apparent responsibility myself .  we would be worse off than we are now  for i would not only be accused of being an underhanded intriguer  as i am now  but  in addition  of having behaved monstrously toward an unsuspecting woman whom i had pretended to befriend  something i have so far been spared .     baley was staggered .  he felt his jaw drop and his voice degenerate to a stutter .     surely they would not         but they would .  you yourself were at least half inclined to think so not very many minutes ago .        merely as a remote         my enemies would not find it remote and they would not publicize it as remote .     baley knew he had reddened .  he felt the wave of heat and found he could not look fastolfe in the face .  he cleared his throat and said     you are right .  i jumped for a way out without thinking and i can only ask your pardon .  i am deeply ashamed .    there   s no way out  i suppose  but the truth  if we can find it .     fastolfe said     don   t despair .  you have already uncovered events in connection with jander that i never dreamed of .  you may uncover more and  eventually  what seems altogether a mystery to us now may unfold and become plain .  what do you plan to do next .     but baley could think of nothing through the shame of his fiasco .  he said     i don   t really know .        well  then  it was unfair of me to ask .  you have had a long day arid not an easy one .  it is not surprising that your brain is a bit sluggish now .  why not rest  view a film  go to sleep .  you will be better off in the morning .     baley nodded and mumbled     perhaps you   re right .     but  at the moment  he didn   t think he   d be any better off in the morning at all .      .   the bedroom was cold  both in temperature and ambience .  baley shivered slightly .  so low a temperature within a room gave it the unpleasant feeling of being outside .  the walls were faintly off white and  unusual for fastolfe   s establishment  were not decorated .  the floor seemed to the sight to be of smooth ivory  but to the bare feet it felt carpeted .  the bed was white and the smooth blanket was cold to the touch .  he sat down at the edge of the mattress and found it yielded very slightly to the pressure of his weight .  he said to daneel  who had entered with him     daneel  does it disturb you when a human being tells a lie .        i am aware that human beings lie on occasion  partner elijah .  sometimes  a lie might be useful or even mandatory .  my feeling about a lie depends upon the liar  the occasion  and the reason .        can you always tell when a human being lies .        no  partner elijah .        does it seem to you that dr .  fastolfe often lies .        it has never seemed to me that dr .  fastolfe has told a lie .        even in connection with jander   s death .        as far as i can tell  he tells the truth in every respect .        perhaps he has instructed you to say that  were ito ask .        he has not  partner elijah .        but perhaps he instructed you to say that  too      he paused .  again  of what use was it to cross examine a robot .  and in this particular case  he was inviting infinite regression .  he was suddenly aware that the mattress had been yielding slowly under him until it now half enfolded his hips .  he rose suddenly and said     is there any way of warming the room  daneel .        it will feel warmer when you are under the cover with the light out  partner elijah .        ah .     he looked about suspiciously .     would you put the light out  daneel  and remain in the room when you have done so .     the light went out almost at once and baley realized that his supposition that this room  at least  was undecorated was totally wrong .  as soon as it was dark  he felt he was outside .  there was the soft sound of wind in trees and the small  sleepy mutters of distant life forms .  there was also the illusion of stars overhead  with an occasional drifting cloud that was just barely visible .     put the light back on  daneel .     the room flooded with light .     daneel     said baley .     i don   t want any of that .  i want no stars  no clouds  no sounds  no trees  no wind  no scents  either .  i want darkness  featureless darkness .  could you arrange that .        certainly  partner elijah .        then do so .  and show me how i may myself put out the light when i am ready to sleep .        i am here to protect you  partner elijah .     baley said grumpily     you can do that  i am sure  from just the other side of the door .  giskard  i imagine  will be just outside the windows  if  indeed  there are windows beyond the draperies .        there are .    if you cross that threshold  partner elijah  you will find a personal reserved for yourself .  that section of the wall is not material and you will move easily through it .  the light will turn on as you enter and it will go out as you leave   and there are no decorations .  you will be able to shower  if you wish  or do anything else that you care to before retiring or after waking .     baley turned in the indicated direction .  he saw no break in the wall  but the floor molding in that spot did show a thickening as though it were a threshold .     how do i see it in the dark  daneel .     he asked .     that section of the wall  which is not a wall  will glow faintly .  as for the room light  there is this depression in the headboard of your bed which  if you place your finger within it  will darken the room if light  or lighten it if dark .        thank you .  you may leave now .     half an hour later  he was through with the personal and found himself huddling beneath the blanket  with the light out  enveloped by a warm spirit hugging darkness .  as fastolfe had said  it had been a long day .  it was almost unbelievable that it had been only that morning that he had arrived on aurora .  he had learned a great deal and yet none of it had done him any good .  he lay in the dark and went over the events of the day in quiet succession  hoping that something might occur to him that had eluded him before  but nothing like that happened .  so much for the quietly thoughtful  keen eyed  subtle brained elijah baley of the hyperwave drama .  the mattress was again half enfolding him and it was like a warm enclosure .  he moved slightly and it straightened beneath him  then slowly molded itself to fit his new position .  there was no point in frying  with his worn  sleep seeking mind  to go over the day again  but he could not help trying a second time  following his own footsteps on this  his first day on aurora  from the spaceport to fastolfe   s establishment  then to gladia   s  then back to fastolfe .  gladia  more beautiful than he remembered but hard  something hard about her  or has she just grown a protective shell   poor woman .  he thought warmly of her reaction to the touch of her hand against his cheek  if he could have remained with her  he could have taught her  stupid aurorans  disgustingly casual attitude toward sex  anything goes  which means nothing really goes  not worthwhile  stupid  to fastolfe  to gladia  back to fastolfe  back to fastolfe .  he moved a little and then abstractedly felt the mattress remold again .  back to fastolfe .  what happened on the way back to fastolfe .  something said .  something not said .  and on the ship before he ever got to aurora  something that fit in   baley was in the never never world of half sleep  when the mind is liberated and follows a law of its own .  it is like the body flying  soaring through the air and liberated of gravity .  of its own accord  it was taking the events  little aspects he had not noted  putting them together  one thing adding to another  clicking into place  forming a web  a fabric   and then  it seemed to him  he heard a sound and he roused himself to a level of wakefulness .  he listened  heard nothing  and sank once more into the half sleep to take up the line of thought  and it eluded him .  it was like a work of art sinking into a morass .  he could still see its outlines  the masses of color .  they got dimmer  but he still knew it was there .  and even as he scrambled desperately for it  it was gone altogether and he remembered nothing of it .  nothing at all .  had he actually thought of anything or was the memory of having done so itself an illusion born of some drifting nonsense in a mind asleep .  and he was  indeed  asleep .  when he woke briefly during the night  he thought to himself  i had an idea .  an important idea .  but he remembered nothing  except that something had been there .  he remained awake a while  staring into the darkness .  if  in fact  something had been there  it would come back in time .  or it might not .   jehoshaphat .     and he slept again .     fastolfe and vasilia     .   baley woke with a start and drew in his breath with sharp suspicion .  there was a faint and unrecognizable odor in the air that vanished by his second breath .  daneel stood gravely at the side of the bed .  he said     i trust  partner elijah  that you have slept well .     baley looked around .  the drapes were still closed  but it was clearly daylight outside .  giskard was laying out clothing  totally different  from shoes to jacket  from anything he had worn the day before .  he said     quite well  daneel .  did something awaken me .        there was an injection of antisomnin in the room   s air circulation  partner elijah .  it activates the arousal system .  we used a smaller than normal amount  since we were uncertain of your reaction .  perhaps we should have used a smaller amount still .     baley said     it did seem to be rather like a paddle over the rear .  what time is it .     daneel said     it is       by auroran measure .  physiologically  breakfast will be ready in half an hour .     he said it without a trace of humor  though a human being might have found a smile appropriate .  giskard said  his voice stiffer and a trifle less intoned than daneel   s     sir  friend daneel and i may not enter the personal .  if you will do so and let us know if there is anything you will need  we will supply it at once .        yes  of course .     baley raised himself  swung around  and got out of bed .  giskard began stripping the bed at once .     may i have your pajamas  sir .     baley hesitated for a moment only .  it was a robot who asked  nothing more .  he disrobed and handed the garment to giskard  who took it with a small  grave nod of acceptance .  baley looked at himself with distaste .  he was suddenly conscious of a middle aged body that was very likely in less good condition than fastolfe   s  which was nearly three times as old .  automatically  he looked for his slippers and found there were none .  presumably  he needed none .  the floor seemed warm and soft to his feet .  he stepped into the personal and called out for instructions .  from the other side of the illusory section of the wall  giskard solemnly explained the working of the shaver  of the toothpaste dispenser  explained how to put the flushing device on automatic  how to control the temperature of the shower .  everything was on a grander and more elaborate scale than anything earth had to offer and there were no partitions on the other side of which he could hear the movements and involuntary sounds of someone else  something he had to ignore rigidly to maintain the illusion of privacy .  it was effete  thought baley somberly as he went through the luxurious ritual  but it was an effeteness that  he already knew  he could become accustomed to .  if he stayed here on aurora any length of time  he would find the culture shock of returning to earth painfully intense  particularly with respect to the personal .  he hoped that the readjustment would not take long  but he also hoped that any earthpeople who settled new worlds would not feel impelled to cling to the concept of community personals .  perhaps  thought baley  that was how one ought to define    effete     that to which one can become easily accustomed .  baley stepped out of the personal  various functions completed  chin new cropped  teeth glistening  body showered and dry .  he said     giskard  where do i find the deodorant .     giskard said     i do not understand  sir .     daneel said quickly     when you activated the lathering control  partner elijah  that introduced a deodorant effect .  i ask pardon for friend giskard   s failure to understand .  he lacks my experience on earth .     baley lifted his eyebrows dubiously and began to dress with giskard   s help .  he said     i see that you and giskard are still with me every step of the way .  has there been any sign of any attempt at putting me out of the way .     daneel said     none thus far  partner elijah .  nevertheless  it would be wise to have friend giskard and myself with you at all times  if that can possibly be managed .        why is that  daneel .        for two reasons  partner elijah .  first  we can help you with any aspect of auroran culture or folkways with which you are unfamiliar .  second  friend giskard  in particular  can record and reproduce every word of every conversation you may have .  this may be of value to you .  you will recall that there were times in your conversations with both dr .  fastolfe and with miss gladia when friend giskard and i were at a distance or in another room         so that conversations were not recorded by giskard .        actually  they were  partner elijah  but with low fidelity  and there may be portions that will not be as clear as we would want them to be .  it would be better if we stayed as close to you as is convenient .     baley said     daneel  are you of the opinion that i will be more at ease if i think of you as guides and as recording devices  rather than as guards .  why not simply come to the conclusion that  as guards  you two are completely unnecessary .  since there have been no attempts at me so far  why isn   t it possible to conclude that there will be no attempts at me in the future .        no  partner elijah  that would be incautious .  dr .  fastolfe feels that you are viewed with great apprehension by his enemies .  they had made attempts to persuade the chairman not to give dr .  fastolfe permission to call you in and they will surely continue to attempt to persuade him to have you ordered back to earth at the earliest possible moment .        that sort of peaceful opposition requires no guards .        no  sir  but if the opposition has reason to fear that you may exculpate dr .  fastolf    it is possible that they may feel driven to extremes .  you are  after all  not an auroran and the inhibitions against violence on our world would therefore be weakened in your case .     baley said dourly     the fact that i   ve been here a whole day and that nothing has happened should relieve their minds greatly and reduce the threat of violence considerably .        it would indeed seem so     said daneel  showing no signs that he recognized the irony in baley   s voice .     on the other hand     said baley     if i seem to make progress  then the danger to me immediately increases .     daneel paused to consider  then said     that would seem to be a logical consequence .        and  therefore  you and giskard will come with me wherever i go  just in case i manage to do my job a little too well .     daneel paused again  then said     your way of putting it  partner elijah  puzzles me  but you seem to be correct .        in that case     said baley     i   m ready for breakfast  though it does take the edge off my appetite to be told that the alternative to failure is attempted assassination .         .   fastolfe smiled at baley across the breakfast table .     did you sleep well  mr .  baley .     baley studied the slice of ham with fascination .  it had to be cut with a knife .  it was grainy .  it had a discrete strip of fat running down one side .  it had  in short  not been processed .  the result was that it tasted hammier  so to speak .  there were also fried eggs  with the yolk a flattened semisphere in the center  rimmed by white  rather like some daisies that ben had pointed out to him in the field back on earth .  intellectually  he knew what an egg looked like before it was processed and he knew that it contained both a yolk and a white  but he had never seen them still separate when ready to eat .  even on the ship coming here and even on solaria  eggs  when served  were scrambled .  he looked up sharply at fastolfe .     pardon me .     fastolfe said patiently     did you sleep well .        yes .  quite well .  i would probably still be sleeping if it hadn   t been for the antisomnin .        ah yes .  not quite the hospitality a guest has the right to expect  but i felt you might want an early start .        you are entirely right .  and i   m not exactly a guest  either .     fastolfe ate in silence for a moment or two .  he sipped at his hot drink  then said     has any enlightenment come overnight .  have you awakened  perhaps  with a new perspective  a new thought .     baley looked at fastolfe suspiciously  but the other   s face reflected no sarcasm .  as baley lifted his drink to his lips  he said     i   m afraid not .  i am as ineffectual now as i was last night .     he sipped and involuntarily made a face .  fastolfe said     i   m sorry .  you find the drink unpalatable .     baley grunted and cautiously tasted it again .  fastolfe said     it is simply coffee  you know .  decaffeinated .     baley frowned .     it doesn   t taste like coffee and   pardon me  dr .  fastolfe  i don   t want to begin to sound paranoid  but daneel and i have just had a half joking exchange on the possibility of violence against me  half joking on my part  of course  not on daneel   s  and it is in my mind that one way they might get at me is      his voice trailed away .  fastolfe   s eyebrows moved upward .  he reached for baley   s coffee with a murmur of apology and smelled it .  he then ladled out a small portion by spoon and tasted it .  he said     perfectly normal  mr .  baley .  this is not an attempt at poisoning .     baley said     i   m sorry to behave so foolishly  since i know this has been prepared by your own robots  but are you certain .     fastolfe smiled .     robots have been tampered with before now .    however  there has been no tampering this time .  it is just that coffee  although universally popular on the various worlds  comes in different strains .  it is notorious that each human being prefers the coffee of his own world .  i   m sorry  mr .  baley  i have no earth strain to give you .  would you prefer milk .  that is relatively constant from world to world .  fruit juice .  aurora   s grape juice is considered superior throughout the worlds  generally .  there are some who hint  darkly  that we allow it to ferment somewhat  but that  of course  is not true .  water .        i   ll try your grape juice .     baley looked at the coffee dubiously .     i suppose i ought to try to get used to this .        not at all     said fastolfe .     why seek out the unpleasant if that is unnecessary .    and so     his smile seemed a bit strained as he returned to his earlier remark     night and sleep have brought no useful reflection to you .        i   m sorry     said baley .  then  frowning at a dim memory     although         yes .        i have the impression that just before falling asleep  in the free association limbo between sleep and waking  it seemed to me that i had something .        indeed .  what .        i don   t know .  the thought drove me into wakefulness but didn   t follow me there .  or else some imagined sound distracted me .  i don   t remember .  i snatched at the thought  but didn   t retrieve it .  it   s gone .  i think that this sort of thing is not uncommon .     fastolfe looked thoughtful .     are you sure of this .        not really .  the thought grew so tenuous so rapidly i couldn   t even be sure that i had actually had it .  and even if i had  it may have seemed to make sense to me only because i was half asleep .  if it were repeated to me now in broad daylight  it might make no sense at all .        but whatever it was and however fugitive  it would have left a trace  surely .        i imagine so  dr .  fastolfe .  in which case  it will come to me again .  i   m confident of that .        ought we to wait .        what else can we do .        there   s such a thing as a psychic probe .     baley sat back in his chair and stared at fastolfe for a moment .  he said     i   ve heard of it  but it isn   t used in police work on earth .        we   re not on earth  mr .  baley     said fastolfe softly .     it can do brain damage .  am i not right .        net likely  in the proper hands .        not impossible  even in the proper hands     said baley .     it   s my understanding that it cannot be used on aurora except under sharply defined conditions .  those it is used on must be guilty of a major crime or must         yes  mr .  baley  but that refers to aurorans .  you are not an auroran .        you mean because i   m an earthman i   m to be treated as inhuman .     fastolfe smiled and spread his hands .     come  mr .  baley .  it was just a thought .  last night you were desperate enough to suggest frying to solve our dilemma by placing gladia in a horrible and tragic position .  i was wondering if you were desperate enough to risk yourself .     baley rubbed his eyes and  for a minute or so  remained silent .  then  in an altered voice  he said     i was wrong last night .  i admitted it .  as for this matter now  there is no assurance that what i thought of  when half asleep  had any relevance to the problem .  it may have been pure fantasy  illogical nonsense .  there may have been no thought at all .  nothing .  would you consider it wise  for so small a likelihood of gain  to risk damage to my brain  when it is upon that for which you say you depend for a solution to the problem .     fastolfe nodded .     you plead your case eloquently  and i was not really serious .        thank you  dr .  fastolfe .        but where are we to go from here .        for one thing  i wish to speak to gladia again .  there are points concerning which i need clarification .        you should have taken them up last night .        so i should  but i had more than i could properly absorb last night and there were points that escaped me .  i am an investigator and not an infallible computer .     fastolfe said     i was not imputing blame .  it   s just that i hate to see gladia unnecessarily disturbed .  in view of what you told me last night  i can only assume she must be in a state of deep distress .        undoubtedly .  but she is also desperately anxious to find out what happened  who  if anyone  killed the one she viewed as her husband .  that   s understandable  too .  i   m sure she   ll be willing to help me .    and i wish to speak to another person as well .        to whom .        to your daughter vasilia .        to vasilia .  why .  what purpose will that serve .        she is a roboticist .  i would like to talk to a roboticist other than yourself .        i do not wish that  mr .  baley .     they had finished eating .  baley stood up .     dr .  fastolfe  once again i must remind you that i am here at your request .  i have no formal authority to do police work .  i have no connection with any auroran authorities .  the only chance i have of getting to the bottom of this miserable mess is to hope that various people will voluntarily cooperate with me and answer my questions .     if you stop me from attempting this  then it is clear that i can get no farther than i am right now  which is nowhere .  it will also look extremely bad for you  and therefore for earth  so i urge you not to stand in my way .  if you make it possible for me to interview anyone i wish  or even simply try to make it possible by interceding on my behalf  then the people of aurora will surely consider that to be a sign of self conscious innocence on your part .  if you hamper my investigation  on the other hand  to what conclusion can they come but that you are guilty and fear exposure .     fastolfe said  with poorly suppressed annoyance     i understand that  mr .  baley .  but why vasilia .  there are other roboticists .        vasilia is your daughter .  she knows you .  she might have strong opinions concerning the likelihood of your destroying a robot .  since she is a member of the robotics institute and on the side of your political enemies  any favorable evidence she may give would be persuasive .        and if she testifies against me .        we   ll face that when it comes .  would you get in touch with her and ask her to receive me .     fastolfe said resignedly     i will oblige you  but you are mistaken if you think i can easily persuade her to see you .  she may be too busy  or think she is .  she may .  be away from aurora .  she may simply not wish to be involved .  i tried to explain last night that she has reason  thinks she has reason  to be hostile to me .  my asking her to see you may indeed impel her to refuse  merely as a sign of her displeasure with me .        would you try  dr .  fastolfe .     fastolfe sighed .     i will try while you are at gladia   s .    i presume you wish to see her directly .  i might point out that a trimensional viewing would do .  the image is high enough in quality so that you will not be able to tell it from personal presence .        i   m aware of that  dr .  fastolfe  but gladia is a solarian and has unpleasant associations with trimensional viewing .  and  in any case  i am of the opinion that there is an intangible additional effectiveness in being within touching distance .  the present situation is too delicate and the difficulties too great for me to want to give up that additional effectiveness .        well  i   ll alert gladia .     he turned away  hesitated  and turned back .     but  mr .  baley         yes  dr .  fastolfe .        last night you told me that the situation was serious enough for you to disregard any convenience it might cause gladia .  there were  you pointed out  greater things at stake .        that   s so  but you can rely on me not to disturb her if i can help it .        i am not talking about gladia now .  i merely warn you that this essentially proper view of yours should be extended to myself .  i don   t expect you to worry about my convenience or pride if you should get a chance to talk to vasilia .  i don   t look forward to the results  but if you do talk to her  i will have to endure any ensuing embarrassment and you must not seek to spare me .  do you understand .        to be perfectly honest  dr .  fastolfe  it was never my attention to spare you .  if i have to weigh your embarrassment or shame against the welfare of your policies and against the welfare of my world  i would not hesitate a moment to shame you .        good .    and mr .  baley  we must extend that attitude also to yourself .  your convenience must not be allowed to stand in the way .        it wasn   t allowed to do so when you decided to have me brought here without consulting me .        fm referring to something else .  if  after a reasonable time   not a long time  but a reasonable time  you make no progress toward a solution  we will have to consider the possibilities of psychic probing  after all .  our last chance might be to find out what it is your mind knows that you do not know it knows .        it may know nothing  dr .  fastolfe .     fastolfe looked at baley sadly .     agreed .  but  as you said concerning the possibility of vasilia testifying against me  we   ll face that when it comes .     he turned away again and walked out of the room .  baley looked after him thoughtfully .  it seemed to him now that if he made progress he would face physical reprisals of an unknown  but possibly dangerous  kind .  and if he did not make progress  he would face the psychic probe  which could scarcely be better .     jehoshaphat .     he muttered softly to himself .      .   the walk to gladia   s seemed shorter than it had on the day before .  the day was sunlit and pleasant again  but the vista looked not at all the same .  the sunlight slanted from the opposite direction  of course  and the coloring seemed slightly different .  it could be that the plant life looked a bit different in the morning than in the evening  or smelled different .  baley had  on occasion  thought that of earth   s plant life as well  he remembered .  daneel and giskard accompanied him again  but they traveled more closely to him and seemed less intensely alert .  baley said idly     does the sun shine here all the time .        it does not  partner elijah     said daneel .     were it to do so  that would be disastrous for the plant world and  therefore  for humanity .  the prediction is  in fact  for the sky to cloud over in the course of the day .        what was that .     asked baley  startled .  a small and gray brown animal was crouched in the grass .  seeing them  it hopped away in leisurely fashion .     a rabbit  sir     said giskard .  baley relaxed .  he had seen them in the fields of earth  too .  gladia was not waiting for them at the door this time  but she was clearly expecting them .  when a robot ushered them in  she did not stand up  but said  with something between crossness and weariness     dr .  fastolfe told me you had to see me again .  what now .     she was wearing a robe that clung tightly to her body and was clearly wearing nothing underneath .  her hair was pulled back shapelessly and her face was pallid .  she looked more drawn than she had the day before and it was clear that she had had little sleep .  daneel  remembering what had happened the day before  did not enter the room .  giskard entered  however  glanced keenly about  then retired to a wall niche .  one of gladia   s robots stood in another niche .  baley said     i   m terribly sorry  gladia  to have to bother you again .     gladia said     i forgot to tell you last night that  after jander is torched  he will  of course  be recycled for use in the robot factories again .  it will be amusing  i suppose  to know that each time i see a newly formed robot  i can take time to realize that many of jander   s atoms form part of him .     baley said     we    ourselves  when we die  are recycled  and who knows what atoms of whom are in you and me right now or in whom ours will someday be .        you are very right  elijah .  and you remind me how easy it is to philosophize over the sorrows of others .        that is right  too  gladia  but i did not come to philosophize .        do what you came to do  then .        i must ask questions .        weren   t yesterday   s enough .  have you spent the time since then in thinking up new ones .        in part  yes  gladia .    yesterday  you said that even after you were with jander  as wife and husband  there were men who offered themselves to you and that you refused .  it is that which i must question you about .        why .     baley ignored the question .     tell me     he said     how many men offered themselves to you during the time you were married to jander .        i don   t keep records  elijah .  three or four .           were any of them persistent .  did anyone offer himself more than once .     gladia  who had been avoiding his eyes  now looked at him full and said     have you talked to others about this .     baley shook his head .     i have talked on this subject to no one but you .  from your question  however  i suspect that there was at least one who was persistent .        one .  santirix gremionis .     she sighed .     aurorans have such peculiar names and he was peculiar  for an auroran .  i had never met one as repetitious in the matter as he .  he was always polite  always accepted my refusal with a small smile and a stately bow  and then  as like as not  he would try again the next week or even the next day .  the mere repetition was a small discourtesy .  a decent auroran would accept a refusal permanently unless the prospective partner made it reasonably plain there was a change of mind .        tell me again   did those who offered themselves to you know of your relationship with jander .        it was not something i mentioned in casual conversation .        well  then  consider this gremionis  specifically .  did he know that jander was your husband .        i never told him so .        don   t dismiss it like that  gladia .  it   s not a matter of his being told .  unlike the others  he offered himself repeatedly .  how often would you say  by the way .  three times .  four .  how many .        i did not count     said gladia wearily .     it might have been a dozen times or more .  if he weren   t a likable person otherwise  i would have had my robots bar the establishment to him .        ah  but you didn   t .  and it takes time to make multiple offerings .  he came to see you .  he encountered you .  he had time to note jander   s presence and how you behaved to him .  might he not have guessed at the relationship .     gladia shook her head .     i don   t think so .  jander never intruded when i was with any human being .        were those your instructions .  i presume they must have been .        they were .  and before you suggest i was ashamed of the relationship  it was merely an attempt to avoid bothersome complications .  i have retained some instinct of privacy about sex that aurorans don   t have .        think again .  might he have guessed .  here he is  a man in love         in love .     the sound she made was almost a snort .     what do aurorans know of love .        a man who considers himself in love .  you are not responsive .  might he not  with the sensitivity and suspicion of a disappointed lover  have guessed .  consider .  did he ever make any roundabout reference to jander .  anything to cause you the slightest suspicion         no .  no .  it would be unheard of for any auroran to comment adversely on the sexual preferences or habits of another .        not necessarily adversely .  a humorous comment  perhaps .  any indication that he suspected the relationship .        no .  if young gremionis had ever breathed a word of that sort  he would never have seen the inside of my establishment again and i would have seen to it that he never approached me again .    but he wouldn   t have done anything of the sort .  he was the soul of eager politeness to me .        you say    young .     how old is this gremionis .        about my age .  thirty five .  perhaps even a year or two younger .        a child     said baley sadly .     even younger than i am .  but at that age   suppose he guessed at your relationship with jander and said nothing  nothing at all .  might he not  nevertheless  have been jealous .        jealous .     it occurred to baley that the word might have little meaning on aurora or solaria .     angered that you should prefer another to himself .     gladia said sharply     i know the meaning of the word    jealous .     i repeated it only out of surprise that you should think any auroran was jealous .  on aurora  people are not jealous over sex .  over other things certainly  but not over sex .     there was a definite sneer upon her face .     even if he were jealous  what would it matter .  what could he do .        wasn   t it possible he might have told jander that the relationship with a robot would endanger your position on aurora         that would not have been true .        jander might have believed it if he were told so  believed he was endangering you  harming you .  might not that have been the reason for the mental freeze out .        jander would never have believed that .  he made me happy every day he was my husband and i told him so .     baley remained calm .  she was missing the point  but he would simply have to make it clearer .     i am sure he believed you  but he might also feel impelled to believe someone else who told him the reverse .  if he were then caught in an unbearable first law dilemma      gladia   s face contorted and she shrieked     that   s mad .  you   re just telling me the old fairy tale of susan calvin and the mind reading robot .  no one over the age of ten can possibly believe that .        isn   t it possible that         no  it isn   t .  i   m from solaria and i know enough about robots to know it isn   t possible .  it would take an incredible expert to tie first law knots in a robot .  dr .  fastolfe might be able to do it  but certainly not santirix gremionis .  gremionis is a stylist .  he works on human beings .  he cuts hair  designs clothing .  i do the same  but at least i work on robots .  gremionis has never touched a robot .  he knows nothing about them  except to order one to close the window or something like that .  are you trying to tell me that it was the relationship between jander and me   me     she tapped herself harshly on the breastbone with one rigid finger  the swells of her small breasts scarcely showing under her robe     that caused jander   s death .        it was nothing you did knowingly     said baley  wanting to stop but unable to quit probing .     what if gremionis had learned from dr .  fastolfe how to         gremionis didn   t know dr .  fastolfe and couldn   t have understood anything dr .  fastolfe might have told him  anyhow .        you can   t know for certain what gremionis might or might not understand and  as for not knowing dr .  fastolfe  gremionis must have been frequently in your establishment if he hounded you so and         and dr .  fastolfe was almost never in my establishment .  last night  when he came with you  it was only the second tune he had crossed my threshold .  he was afraid that to be too close to me would drive me away .  he admitted that once .  he lost his daughter that way  he thought  something foolish like that .    you see  elijah  when you live several centuries  you have plenty of time to lose thousands of things .  be th thankful for short life  elijah .     she was weeping uncontrollably .  baley looked and felt helpless .     i   m sorry  gladia .  i have no more questions .  shall i call a robot .  will you need help .     she shook her head and waved her hand at him .     just go away  go away     she said in a strangled voice .     go away .     baley hesitated and then strode out of the room  taking one last  uncertain look at her as he walked out the door .  giskard followed in his footsteps and daneel joined him as he left the house .  he scarcely noticed .  it occurred to him  abstractedly  that he was coming to accept their presence as he would have that of his shadow or of his clothing  that he was reaching a point where he would feel bare without them .  he walked rapidly back toward the fastolfe establishment  his mind churning .  his desire to see vasilia had at first been a matter of desperation  a lack of any other object of curiosity  but now things had changed .  there was just a chance that he had stumbled on something vital .      .   fastolfe   s homely face was set in grim lines when baley returned .     any progress .     he asked .     i eliminated part of a possibility .    perhaps .        part of a possibility .  how do you eliminate the other part .  better yet  how do you establish a possibility .     baley said     by finding it impossible to eliminate a possibility  a beginning is made at establishing one .        and if you find it impossible to eliminate the other part of the possibility you mysteriously mentioned .     baley shrugged .     before we waste our time considering that  i must see your daughter .     fastolfe looked dejected .     well  mr .  baley  i did as you asked me to do and tried to contact her .  it was necessary to awaken her .        you mean she is in part of the planet where it is night .  i hadn   t thought of that .     baley felt chagrined .     i   m afraid i   m fool enough to imagine i   m on earth still .  in underground cities  day and night lose their meaning and time tends to be uniform .        it   s not that bad .  eos is the robotics center of aurora and you   ll find few roboticists who live out of it .  she was simply sleeping and being awakened did not improve her temper  apparently .  she would not speak to me .        call again     said baley urgently .     i spoke to her secretarial robot and there was an uncomfortable relaying of messages .  she made it quite plain she will not speak to me in any fashion .  she was a little more flexible with you .  the robot announced that she would give you five minutes on her private viewing channel  if you call     fastolfe consulted the time strip on the wall     in half art hour .  she will not see you in person under any conditions .        the conditions are insufficient and so is the time .  i must see her in person for as long as is needed .  did you explain the importance of this  dr .  fastolfe .        i tried .  she is  not concerned .        you are her father .  surely         she is less inclined to bend her decision for my sake than for a randomly chosen stranger .  i knew this  so i made use of giskard .        giskard .        oh yes .  giskard is a great favorite of hers .  when she was studying robotics at the university  she took the liberty of adjusting some minor aspects of his programming  and nothing makes for a closer relationship with a robot than that  except for gladia   s method  of course .  it was almost as though giskard were andrew martin         who is andrew martin .        was  not is     said fastolfe .     you have never heard of him .        never .        how odd .  these ancient legends of ours all have earth as their setting  yet on earth they are not known .    andrew martin was a robot who  gradually  step by step  was supposed to have become humaniform .  to be sure  there have been humaniform robots before daneel  but they were all simple toys  little more than automatons .  nevertheless  amazing stories are told of the abilities of andrew martin  a sure sign of the legendary nature of the tale .  there was a woman who was part of the legends who is usually known as little miss .  the relationship is too complicated to describe now  but i suppose that every little girl on aurora has daydreamed of being little miss and of having andrew martin as a robot .  vasilia did  and giskard was her andrew martin .        well  then .        i asked her robot to tell her that you would be accompanied by giskard .  she hasn   t seen him in years and i thought that might lure her into agreeing to see you .        but it didn   t  i presume .        it didn   t .        then we must think of something else .  there must be some way of inducing her to see me .     fastolfe said     perhaps you will think of one .  in a few minutes  you will view her on trimensic and you will have five minutes to convince her that she ought to see you personally .        five minutes .  what can i do in five minutes .        i don   t know .  it is better  after all  than nothing .         .   fifteen minutes later  baley stood before the trimensional viewing screen  ready to meet vasilia fastolfe .  dr .  fastolfe had left  saying  with a wry smile  that his presence would certainly make his daughter less amenable to persuasion .  nor was daneel present .  only giskard remained behind to keep baley company .  giskard said     dr .  vasilia   s trimensic channel is open for reception .  are you ready  sir .        as ready as i can be     said baley grimly .  he had refused to sit  feeling he might be more imposing if he were standing .   how imposing could an earthman be .   the screen grew bright as the rest of the room dimmed and a woman appeared  in rather uncertain focus  at first .  she was standing facing him  her right hand resting on a laboratory bench laden with sets of diagrams .   no doubt she planned to be imposing  too .   as the focus sharpened  the edges of the screen seemed to melt away and the image of vasilia  if it were she  deepened and became three dimensional .  she was standing in the room with every sign of solid reality  except that the decor of the room she was in did not match the room baley was in and the break was a sharp one .  she was wearing a dark brown skirt that divided into loose trouser legs that were semitransparent  so that her legs  from midthigh down  were shadowily visible .  her blouse was tight and sleeveless  so that her arms were bare to the shoulder .  her neckline was low and her hair  quite blond  was in tight curls .  she had none of her father   s plainness and certainly not his large ears .  baley could only assume she had had a beautiful mother and was fortunate in the allotment of genes .  she was short and baley could see a remarkable resemblance to gladia in her facial features  although her expression was far colder and seemed to bear the mark of a dominating personality .  she said sharply     are you the earthman come to solve my father   s problems .        yes  dr .  fastolfe     said baley in an equally clipped manner .     you may call me dr .  vasilia .  i do not wish the confusion of being mistaken for my father .        dr .  vasilia  i must have a chance to deal with you  face to face  for a reasonably extended period .        no doubt you feel that .  you are  of course  an earthman and a certain source of infection .        i have been medically treated and i am quite safe to be with .  your father has been constantly with me for over a day .        my father pretends to be an idealist and must do foolish things at times to support the pretense .  i will not imitate him .        i take it you do not wish him harm .  you will bring him harm if you refuse to see me .        you are wasting time .  i will not see you  except in this manner  and half the period i have allotted is gone .  if you wish  we can stop this now if you find it unsatisfactory .        giskard is here  dr .  vasilia  and would like to urge you to see me .  giskard stepped into the field of vision .     good morning  little miss     he said in a low voice .  for a moment  vasilia looked embarrassed and  when she spoke  it was in a somewhat softer tone .     i am glad to view you  giskard  and will see you any time you wish  but i will not see this earthman  even at your urging .        in that case     said baley  throwing in all his reserves desperately     i must take the case of santirix gremionis to the public without the benefit of having consulted you .     vasilia   s eyes widened and her hand on the table lifted upward and clenched into a fist     what is this about gremionis .        only that he is a handsome young man and he knows you well .  am i to deal with these matters without hearing what you have to say .        i will tell you right now that         no     said baley loudly .     you will tell me nothing unless i see you face to face .     her mouth twitched .     i will see you  then  but i will not remain with you one moment more than i choose .  i warn you .    and bring giskard .     the trimensional connection broke off with a snap and baley felt himself turn dizzy at the sudden change in background that resulted .  he made his way to a chair and sat down .  giskard   s hand was on his elbow  making certain that he reached the chair safely .     can i help you in any way  sir .     he asked .     i   m all right     said baley .     i just need to catch my breath .     dr .  fastolfe was standing before him .     my apologies  again  for failure in my duties as a host .  i listened on an extension that was equipped to receive and not transmit .  i wanted to see my daughter  even if she didn   t see me .        i understand     said baley  panting slightly .     if manners dictate that what you did requires an apology  then i forgive you .        but what is this about santirix gremionis .  the name is unfamiliar to me .     baley looked up at fastolfe and said     dr .  fastolfe  i heard his name from gladia this morning .  i know very little about him  but i took the chance of saying what i did to your daughter anyway .  the odds were heavily against me  but the results were what i wanted them to be  nevertheless .  as you see  i can make useful deductions  even when i have very little information  so you had better leave me in peace to continue to do so .  please  in the future  cooperate to the full and make no further mention of a psychic probe .     fastolfe was silent and baley felt a grim satisfaction at having imposed his will first on the daughter  then on the father .  how long he could continue to do so he did not know .     vasilia     .   baley paused at the door of the airfoil and said firmly     giskard  i do not wish the windows opacified .  i do not wish to sit in the back .  i want to sit in the front seat and observe the outside .  since i will be sitting between you and daneel  i should be safe enough  unless the car itself is destroyed .  and  in that case  we will all be destroyed and it won   t matter whether i am in front or in back .     giskard responded to the force of the statement by retreating into greater respectfulness .     sir  if you should feel ill         then you will stop the car and i will climb into the back seat and you can opacify the rear windows .  or you needn   t even stop .  i can climb over the front seat while you are moving .  the point is  giskard  that it is important for me to become as acquainted with aurora as is possible and it is important for me  in any case  to become accustomed to the outside .  i am stating this as an order  giskard .     daneel said softly     partner elijah is quite correct in his request  friend giskard .  he will be reasonably safe .     giskard  perhaps reluctantly  baley could not interpret the expression on his not quite human face   gave in and took his place at the controls .  baley followed and looked out of the clear glass of the windshield without quite the assurance he had presented in his voice .  however  the pressure of a robot on either side was comforting .  the car rose on its jets of compressed air and swayed a bit as though it were finding its footing .  baley felt a queasy sensation in the pit of his stomach and tried not to regret his brave performance of moments before .  there was no use trying to tell himself that daneel and giskard showed no signs of fear and should be imitated .  they were robots and could not feel fear .  and then the car moved forward suddenly and baley felt himself pushed hard against the seat .  within a minute he was moving at as fast a speed as he had ever experienced on the expressways of the city .  a wide  grassy road stretched out ahead .  the speed seemed the greater for the fact that there were none of the friendly lights and structures of the city on either side but rather wide gulfs of greenery and irregular formations .  baley fought to keep his breath steady and to talk as naturally as he might of neutral things .  he said     we don   t seem to be passing any farmland  daneel .  this seems to be unused land .     daneel said     this is city territory  partner elijah .  it is privately owned parkland and estates .        city .     baley could not accept the word .  he knew what a city was .     eos is the largest and most important city on aurora .  the first to be established .  the auroran world legislature sits here .  the chairman of the legislature has his estate here and we will be passing it .     not only a city but the largest .  baley looked about to either side .     i was under the impression that the fastolfe and gladia establishments were on the outskirts of eos .  i should think we would have passed the city limits by now .        not at all  partner elijah .  we   re passing through its center .  the limits are seven kilometers away and our destination is nearly forty kilometers beyond that .        the center of the city .  i see no structures .        they are not meant to be seen from the road  but there   s one you can make out between the trees .  that is the establishment of fuad labord  a well known writer .        do you know all the establishments by sight .        they are in my memory banks     said daneel solemnly .     there   s no traffic on the road .  why is that .        long distances are covered by air cars or magnetic subcars .  trimensional connections         they call it viewing on solaria     said baley .     and here  too  in informal conversation  but tvc more formally .  that takes care of much communication .  finally  aurorans are fond of walking and it is not unusual to walk several kilometers for social visiting or even for business meetings where time is not of the essence .        and we have to get somewhere that   s too far to walk  too close for air cars  and trimensional viewing is not wanted  so we use a ground car .        an airfoil  more specifically  partner elijah  but that qualifies as a ground car  i suppose .        how long will it take to reach vasilia   s establishment .        not long  partner elijah .  she is at the robotics institute  as perhaps you know .     there were some moments of silence and then baley said     it looks cloudy near the horizon there .     giskard negotiated a curve at high speed  the airfoil tipping through an angle of some thirty degrees .  baley choked back a moan and clung to daneel  who flung his left arm about baley   s shoulders and held him in a strong viselike grip  one hand on each shoulder .  slowly  baley let out his breath as the airfoil righted itself .  daneel said     yes  those clouds will bring precipitation later in the day  as predicted .     baley frowned .  he had been caught in the rain once  once   during his experimental work in the field outside on earth .  it was like standing under a cold shower with his clothes on .  there had been sheer panic for a moment when he realized that there was no way in which he could reach for any controls that would turn it off .  the water would come down forever .    then everyone was running and he ran with them  making for the dryness and controllability of the city .  but this was aurora and he had no idea what one did when it began to rain and there was no city to escape into .  run into the nearest establishment .  would refugees automatically be welcome .  then there was another brief turn and giskard said     sir  we are in the parking lot of the robotics institute .  we can now enter and visit the establishment that dr .  vasilia maintains on the institute grounds .     baley nodded .  the trip had taken something between fifteen and twenty minutes  as nearly as he could judge  earth time  and he was glad it was over .  he said  rather breathlessly     i want to know something about dr .  fastolfe   s daughter before i meet her .  you did not know her  did you  daneel .     daneel said     at the time i came into existence  dr .  fastolfe and his daughter had been separated for a considerable time .  i have never met her .        but as for you  giskard  you and she knew each other well .  is that not so .        it is so  sir     said giskard impassively .     and were fond of each other .        i believe  sir     said giskard     that it gave dr .  fastolfe   s daughter pleasure to be with me .        did it give you pleasure to be with her .     giskard seemed to pick his words .     it gives me a sensation that i think is what human beings mean by    pleasure    to be with any human being .        but more so with vasilia  i think .  am i right .        her pleasure at being with me  sir     said giskard     did seem to stimulate those positronic potentials that produce actions in me that are equivalent to those that pleasure produces in human beings .  or so i was once told by dr .  fastolfe .     baley said suddenly     why did vasilia leave her father .     giskard said nothing .  baley said  with the sudden peremptoriness of an earthman addressing a robot     i asked you a question  boy .     giskard turned his head and stared at baley  who  for a moment  thought the glow in the robot   s eyes might be brightening into a blaze of resentment at the demeaning word .  however  giskard spoke mildly and there was no readable expression in his eyes when he said     i would like to answer  sir  but in all matters concerning that separation  miss vasilia ordered me at that time to say nothing .        but i   m ordering you to answer me and i can order you very firmly indeed  if i wish to .     giskard said     i am sorry .  miss vasilia  even at that time  was skilled in robotics and the orders she gave me were sufficiently powerful to remain  despite anything you are likely to say  sir .     baley said     she must have been skilled in robotics  since dr .  fastolfe told me she reprogrammed you on occasion .        it was not dangerous to do so  sir .  dr .  fastolfe himself could always correct any errors .        did he have to .        he did not  sir .        what was the nature of the reprogramming .        minor matters  sir .        perhaps  but humor me .  just what was it she did .     giskard hesitated and baley knew what that meant at once .  the robot said     i fear that any questions concerning the reprogramming cannot be answered by me .        you were forbidden .        no  sir  but the reprogramming automatically wipes out what went before .  if i am changed in any particular  it would seem to me that i have always been as changed and i would have no memory of what i was before i was changed .        then how do you know the reprogramming was minor .        since dr .  fastolfe never saw any need of correcting what miss vasilia did  or so he once told me  i can only suppose the changes were minor .  you might ask miss vasilia  sir .        i will     said baley .     i fear  however  that she will not answer  sir .     baley   s heart sank .  so far he had questioned only dr .  fastolfe  gladia  and the two robots  all of whom had overriding reasons to cooperate .  now  for the first time  he would be facing an unfriendly subject .      .   baley stepped out of the airfoil  which was resting on a grassy plot  and felt a certain pleasure in feeling solidity beneath his feet .  he looked around in surprise  for the structures were rather thickly spread  and to his right was a particularly large one  built plainly  rather like a huge right angled block of metal and glass .     is that the robotics institute .     he asked .  daneel said     this entire complex is the institute  partner elijah .  you are seeing only a portion and it is more thickly built up than is common on aurora because it is a self contained political entity .  it contains home establishments  laboratories  libraries  communal gymnasia  and so on .  the large structure is the administrative center .        this is so un auroran  with all these buildings in view  at least judging from what i saw of eos  that i should think there would be considerable disapproval .        i believe there was  partner elijah  but the head of the institute is friendly with the chairman  who has much influence  and there was a special dispensation  i understand  because of research necessities .     daneel looked about thoughtfully .     it is indeed more compact than i had supposed .        than you had supposed .  have you never been here before  daneel .        no  partner elijah .        how about you  giskard .        no  sir     said giskard .  baley said     you found your way here without trouble  and you seem to know the place .        we have been suitably informed  partner elijah     said dan eel     since it was necessary that we come with you .     baley nodded thoughtfully  then said     why didn   t dr .  fastolfe come with us .     and decided  once again  that it made no sense to try to catch a robot off guard .  ask a question rapidly   or unexpectedly  and they simply waited until the question was absorbed and then answered .  they were never caught off guard .  daneel said     as dr .  fastolfe said  he is not a member of the institute and feels it would be improper to visit uninvited .        but why is he not a member .        the reason for that i have never been told  partner elijah .     baley   s eyes turned to giskard  who said at once     nor i  sir .     did not know .  were told not to know .    baley shrugged .  it did not matter which .  human beings could lie and robots be instructed .  of course  human beings could be browbeaten or maneuvered out of a lie  if the questioner were skillful enough or brutal enough  and robots could be maneuvered out of instruction  if the questioner were skillful enough or unscrupulous enough   but the skills were different and baley had none at all with respect to robots .  he said     where would we be likely to find dr .  vasilia fastolfe .     daneel said     this is her establishment immediately before us .     you have been instructed  then  as to its location .        that has been imprinted in our memory banks  partner elijah .        well  then  lead the way .     the orange sun was well up in the sky now and it was clearly nearing midday .  as they approached vasilia   s establishment  they stepped into the shadow of the factory and baley twitched a little as he felt the temperature drop immediately .  his lips tightened at the thought of occupying and settling worlds without cities  where the temperature was uncontrolled and subject to unpredictable  idiotic changes .    and  he noted uneasily  the line of clouds at the horizon had advanced somewhat .  it could also rain whenever it wished  with water cascading down .  earth .  he longed for the cities .  giskard had walked into the establishment first and daneel held out his arm to prevent baley from following .  of course .  giskard was reconnoitering .  so was daneel  for that matter .  his eyes traversed the landscape with an intentness no human being could have duplicated .  baley was certain that those robotic eyes missed nothing .   he wondered why robots were not equipped with four eyes equally distributed about the perimeter of the head  or an optic strip totally circumnavigating it .  daneel could not be expected to  of course  since he had to be human in appearance  but why not giskard .  or did that introduce complications of vision that the positronic pathways could not handle .  for a moment  baley had a faint vision of the complexities that burdened the life of a roboticist .   giskard reappeared in the doorway and nodded .  daneel   s arm exerted a respectful pressure and baley moved forward .  the door stood ajar .  there was no lock on vasilia   s establishment  but there had also been none  baley suddenly remembered  on those of gladia and of dr .  fastolfe .  a sparse population and separation helped insure privacy and  no doubt  the custom of noninterference helped  too .  and  come to think of it  the ubiquitous robot guards were more efficient than any lock could be .  the pressure of daneel   s hand on baley   s upper arm brought the latter to a halt .  giskard  ahead of them  was speaking in a low voice to two robots  who were themselves rather giskardlike .  a sudden coldness struck the pit of baley   s stomach .  what if some rapid maneuver substituted another robot for giskard .  would he be able to recognize the substitution .  tell two such robots apart .  would he be left with a robot without special instructions to guard him  one who might innocently lead him into danger and then react with insufficient quickness when protection was necessary .  controlling his voice  he said calmly to daneel     remarkable the similarity in those robots  daneel .  can you tell them apart .        certainly  partner elijah .  their clothing designs are different and their code numbers are different  as well .        they don   t look different to me .        you are not accustomed to notice that sort of detail .     baley stared again .     what code numbers .        they are easily visible  partner elijah  when you know where to look and when your eyes are sensitive farther into the infrared than human eyes are .        well  then  i would be in trouble if i had to do the identifying  wouldn   t i .        not at all  partner elijah .  you had but to ask a robot for its full name and serial number .  it would tell you .        even if instructed to give me a false one .        why should any robot be so instructed .     baley decided not to explain .  giskard was  in any case  returning .  he said to baley     sir  you will be received .  come this way  please .     the two robots of the establishment led .  behind them came baley and daneel  the latter retaining his grip protectively .  following in the rear was giskard .  the two robots stopped before a double door which opened  apparently automatically  in both directions .  the room within was suffused with a dim  grayish light  daylight diffusing through thick drapery .  baley could make out  not very clearly  a small human figure in the room  half seated on a tall stool  with one elbow resting on a table that ran the length of the wall .  baley and daneel entered  giskard coming up behind them .  the door closed  leaving the room dimmer than ever .  a female voice said sharply     come no closer .  stay where you are .     and the room burst into full daylight .      .   baley blinked and looked upward .  the ceiling was glassed and  through it  the sun could be seen .  the sun seemed oddly dim  however  and could be looked at  even though that did not seem to affect the quality of the light within .  presumably  the glass  or whatever the transparent substance was  diffused the light without absorbing it .  he looked down at the woman  who still maintained her pose at the stool  and said     dr .  vasilia fastolfe .        dr .  vasilia aliena  if you want a full name .  i do not borrow the names of others .  you may call me dr .  vasilia .  it is the name by which i am commonly known at the institute .     her voice  which had been rather harsh  softened     and how are you  my old friend giskard .     giskard said  in tones oddly removed from his usual one     i greet you      he paused and then said     i greet you  little miss .     vasilia smiled .     and this  i suppose  is the humaniform robot of whom i have heard  daneel olivaw .        yes  dr .  vasilia     said daneel briskly .     and finally  we have  the earthman .        elijah baley  doctor     said baley stiffly .     yes  i   m aware that earthmen have names and that elijah baley is yours     she said coolly .     you don   t look one blasted thing like the actor who played you in the hyperwave show .        i am aware of that  doctor .        the one who played daneel was rather a good likeness  however  but i suppose we are not here to discuss the show .        we are not .        i gather we are here  earthman  to talk about whatever it is you want to say about santirix gremionis and get it over with .  bight .        not entirely     said baley .     that is not the primary reason for my coming  though i imagine we will get to it .        indeed .  are you under the impression that we are here to engage in a long and complicated discussion on whatever topic you choose to deal with .        i think  dr .  vasilia  you would be well advised to allow me to manage this interview as i wish .        is that a threat .        no .        well  i have never met an earthman and it might be interesting to see how closely you resemble the actor who played your role  that is  in ways other than appearance .  are you really the masterful person you seemed to be in the show .        the show     said baley with clear distaste     was overdramatic and exaggerated my personality in every direction .  i would rather you accept me as i am and judge me entirely from how i appear to you right now .     vasilia laughed .     at least you don   t seem overawed by me .  that   s a point in your favor .  or do you think this gremionis thing you   ve got in mind puts you in a position to order me about .        i am not here to do anything but uncover the truth in the matter of the dead humaniform robot  jander panell .        dead .  was he ever alive  then .        i use one syllable in preference to phrases such as    rendered inoperative .     does saying    dead    confuse you .     vasilia said     you fence well .    debrett  bring the earthman a chair .  he will grow weary standing if this is to be a long conversation .  then get into your niche .  and you may choose one  too  daneel .    giskard  come stand by me .     baley sat down .     thank you  debrett .    dr .  vasilia  i have no authority to question you  i have no legal means of forcing you to answer my questions .  however  the death of jander panell has put your father in a position of some         it has put whom in a position .        your father .        earthman  i sometimes refer to a certain individual as my father  but no one else does .  please use a proper name .        dr .  han fastolfe .  he is your father  isn   t he .  as a matter of record .     vasilia said     you are using a biological term .  i share genes with him in a manner characteristic of what on earth would be considered a father daughter relationship .  this is a matter of indifference on aurora  except in medical and genetic matters .  i can conceive of my suffering from certain metabolic states in which it would be appropriate to consider the physiology and biochemistry of those with whom i share genes  parents  siblings  children  and so on .  otherwise these relationships are not generally referred to in polite auroran society .    i explain this to you because you are an earthman .        if i have offended against custom     said baley     it is through ignorance and i apologize .  may i refer to the gentleman under discussion by name .        certainly .        in that case  the death of jander panell has put dr .  han fastolfe into a position of some difficulty and i would assume that you would be concerned enough to desire to help him .        you assume that  do you .  why .        he is your   he brought you up .  he cared for you .  you had a profound affection for each other .  he still feels a profound affection for you .        did he tell you that .        it was obvious from the details of our conversations  even from the fact that he has taken an interest in the solarian woman  gladia delmarre  because of her resemblance to you .        did he tell you that .        he did  but even if he hadn   t  the resemblance is obvious .        nevertheless  earthman  i owe dr .  fastolfe nothing .  your assumptions can be dismissed .     baley cleared his throat .     aside from any personal feelings you might or might not have  there is the matter of the future of the galaxy .  dr .  fastolfe wishes new worlds to be explored and settled by human beings .  if the political repercussions of jander   s death lead to the exploration and settlement of the new worlds by robots  dr .  fastolfe believes that this will be catastrophic for aurora and humanity .  surely you would not be a party to such a catastrophe .     vasilia said indifferently  watching him closely     surely not  if i agreed with dr .  fastolfe .  i do not .  i see no harm in having humaniform robots doing the work .  i am here at the institute  in fact  to make that possible .  i am a globalist .  since dr .  fastolfe is a humanist  he is my political enemy .     her answers were clipped and direct  no longer than they had to be .  each time there followed a definite silence  as though she were waiting  with interest  for the next question .  baley had the impression that she was curious about him  amused by him  making wagers with herself as to what the next question might be  determined to give him just the minimum information necessary to force another question .  he said     have you long been a member of this institute .        since its formation .        are there many members .        i should judge about a third of aurora   s roboticists are members  though only about half of these actually live and work on the institute grounds .        do other members of the institute share your views on the robotic exploration of other worlds .  do they oppose dr .  fastolfe   s views one and all .        i suspect that most of them are globalists  but i don   t know that we have taken a vote on the matter or even discussed it formally .  you had better ask them all individually .        is dr .  fastolfe a member of the institute .        no .     baley waited a bit  but she said nothing beyond the negative .  he said     isn   t that surprising .  i should think lie  of all people  would be a member .        as it happens  we don   t want him .  what is perhaps less important  he doesn   t want us .        isn   t that even more surprising .        i don   t think so .       and then  as though goaded into saying something more by an irritation within herself  she said     he lives in the city of eos .  i suppose you know the significance of the name  earthman .     baley nodded and said     eos is the ancient greek goddess of the dawn  as aurora is the ancient roman goddess of the dawn .        exactly .  dr .  han fastolfe lives in the city of the dawn on the world of the dawn  but he is not himself a believer in the dawn .  he does not understand the necessary method of expansion through the galaxy  of converting the spacer dawn into broad galactic day .  the robotic exploration of the galaxy is the only practical way to carry the task through and he won   t accept it  or us .     baley said slowly     why is it the only practical method .  aurora and the other spacer worlds were not explored and settled by robots but by human beings .        correction .  by earthpeople .  it was a wasteful and inefficient procedure and there are now no earthpeople that we will allow to serve as further settlers .  we have become spacers  long lived and healthy  and we have robots who are infinitely more versatile and flexible than those available to the human beings who originally settled our worlds .  times and matters are wholly different  and today only robotic exploration is feasible .        let us suppose you are right and dr .  fastolfe is wrong .  even so  he has a logical view .  why won   t he and the institute accept each other .  simply because they disagree on this point .        no  this disagreement is comparatively minor .  there is a more fundamental conflict .     again baley paused and again she added nothing to her remark .  he did not feel it safe to display irritation  so he said quietly  almost tentatively     what is the more fundamental conflict .     the amusement in vasilia   s voice came nearer the surface .  it softened the lines of her face somewhat and  for a moment  she looked more like gladia .     you couldn   t guess  unless it were explained to you  i think .        precisely why i am asking  dr .  vasilia .        well  then  earthman  i have been told that earthpeople are short lived .  i have not been misled in that  have i .     baley shrugged     some of us live to be a hundred years old  earth time .     he thought a bit .     perhaps a hundred and thirty or so metric years .        and how old are you .        forty five standard  sixty metric .        i am sixty six metric .  i expect to live three metric centuries more at least  if i am careful .     baley spread his hands wide .     i congratulate you .        there are disadvantages .        i was told this morning that  in three or four centuries  many  many losses have a chance to accumulate .        i   m afraid so     said vasilia .     and many  many gains have a chance to accumulate  as well .  on the whole  it balances .        what  then  are the disadvantages .        you are not a scientist  of course .        i am a plainclothesman  a policeman  if you like .        but perhaps you know scientists on your world .        i have met some     said baley cautiously .     you know how they work .  we are told that on earth they cooperate out of necessity .  they have  at most  half a century of active labor in the course of their short lives .  less than seven metric decades .  not much can be done in that time .        some of our scientists had accomplished quite a deal in considerably less time .        because they have taken advantage of the findings others have made before them and profit from the use they can make of contemporary findings by others .  isn   t that so .        of course .  we have a scientific community to which all contribute  across the expanse of space and of time .        exactly .  it won   t work otherwise .  each scientist  aware of the unlikelihood of accomplishing much entirely by himself  is forced into the community  cannot help becoming part of the clearinghouse .  progress thus becomes enormously greater than it would be if this did not exist .        is not this the case on aurora and the other spacer worlds  too .     asked baley .     in theory it is  in practice not so much .  the pressures in a long lived society are less .  scientists here have three or three and a half centuries to devote to a problem  so that the thought arises that significant progress may be made in that time by a solitary worker  it becomes possible to feel a kind of intellectual greed  to want to accomplish something on your own  to assume a property right to a particular facet of progress  to be wiling to see the general advance slowed  rather than give up what you conceive to be yours alone .  and the general advance is slowed on spacer worlds as a result  to the point where it is difficult to outpace the work done on earth  despite our enormous advantages .        i assume you wouldn   t say this if i were not to take it that dr .  han fastolfe behaves in this manner .        he certainly does .  it is his theoretical analysis of the positronic brain that has made the humaniform robot possible .  he has used it to construct  with the help of the late dr .  sarton   your robot friend daneel  but he has not published the important details of his theory  nor does he make it available to anyone else .  in this way  he  and he alone  holds a stranglehold on the production of humaniform robots .     baley furrowed his brow .     and the robotics institute is dedicated to cooperation among scientists .        exactly .  this institute is made up of over a hundred topnotch roboticists of different ages  advancements  and skills and we hope to establish branches on other worlds and make it an interstellar association .  all of us are dedicated to communicating our separate discoveries or speculations to the common fund   doing voluntarily for the general good what you earthpeople do perforce because you live such short lives .     this  however  dr .  han fastolfe will not do .  i   m sure you think of dr .  han fastolfe as a nobly idealistic auroran patriot  but he will not put his intellectual property  as he thinks of it   into the common fund and therefore he does not want us .  and because he assumes a personal property right upon scientific discoveries  we do not want him .    you no longer find the mutual distaste a mystery  i take it .     baley nodded his head  then said     you think this will work   this voluntary giving up of personal glory .        it must     said vasilia grimly .     and has the institute  through community endeavor  duplicated dr .  fastolfe   s individual work and rediscovered the theory of the humaniform positronic brain .        we will  in time .  it is inevitable .        and you are making no attempt to shorten the time it will take by persuading dr .  fastolfe to yield the secret .        i think we are on the way to persuading him .        through the working of the jander scandal .        i don   t think you really have to ask that question .    well  have i told you what you wanted to know  earthman .     baley said     you have told me some things i didn   t know .        then it is time for you to tell me about gremionis .  why have you brought up the name of this barber in connection with me .        barber .        he considers himself a hair stylist  among other things  but he is a barber  plain and simple .  tell me about him  or let us consider this interview at an end .     baley felt weary .  it seemed clear to him that vasilia had enjoyed the fencing .  she had given him enough to whet his appetite and now he would be forced to buy additional material with information of his own .    but he had none .  or at least he had only guesses .  and if any of them were wrong  vitally wrong  he was through .  he therefore fenced on his own .     you understand  dr .  vasilia  that you can   t get away with pretending that it is farcical to suppose there is a connection between gremionis and yourself .        why not  when it is farcical .        oh no .  if it were farcical  you would have laughed in my face and shut off trimensional contact .  the mere fact that you were willing to abandon your earlier stand and receive me  the mere fact that you have been talking to me at length and telling me a great many things  is a clear admission that you feel that i just possibly might have my knife at your jugular .     vasilia   s jaw muscles tightened and she said  in a low and angry voice     see here  little earthman  my position is vulnerable and you probably know it .  i am the daughter of dr .  fastolfe and there are some here at the institute who are foolish enough  or knavish enough  to mistrust me therefor .  i don   t know what kind of story you may have heard  or made up  but that it   s more or less farcical is certain .  nevertheless  no matter how farcical  it might be used effectively against me .  so i am willing to trade for it .  i have told you some things and i might tell you more  but only if you now tell me what you have in your hand and convince me you are telling me the truth .  so tell me now .     if you try to play games with me  i will be in no worse position than at present if i kick you out  and i will at least get pleasure out of that .  and i will use what leverage i have with the chairman to get him to cancel his decision to let you come here and have you sent right back to earth .  there is considerable pressure on him now to do this and you won   t want the addition of mine .     so talk .  now .         .   baley   s impulse was to lead up to the crucial point  feeling his way to see if he were right .  that  he felt  would not work .  she would see what he was doing  she was no fool  and would stop him .  he was on the track of something  he knew  and he didn   t want to spoil it .  what she said about her vulnerable position as the result of her relationship to her father might well be true  but she still would not have been frightened into seeing him if she hadn   t suspected that some notion he had was not completely farcical .  he had to come out with something  then  with something important that would establish  at once  some sort of domination over her .  therefore  the gamble .  he said     santirix gremionis offered himself to you .     and  before vasilia could react  he raised the ante by saying  with an added touch of harshness     and not once but many times .     vasilia clasped her hands over one knee  then pulled herself up and seated herself on the stool  as though to make herself more comfortable .  she looked at giskard  who stood motionless and expressionless at her side .  then she looked at baley and said     well  the idiot offers himself to everyone he sees  regardless of age and sex .  i would be unusual if he paid me no attention .     baley made the gesture of brushing that to one side .   she had not laughed .  she had not brought the interview to an end .  she had not even put on a display of fury .  she was waiting to see what he would build out of the statement  so he did have something by the tail .   he said     that is exaggeration  dr .  vasilia .  no one  however undiscriminating  would fail to make choices and  in the case of this gremionis  you were selected and  despite your refusal to accept him  he continued to offer himself  quite out of keeping with auroran custom .     vasilia said     i am glad you realize i refused him .  there are some who feel that  as a matter of courtesy  any offer  or almost any offer  should be accepted  but that is not my opinion .  i see no reason why i have to subject myself to some uninteresting event that will merely waste my time .  do you find something objectionable in that  earthman .        i have no opinion to offer  either favorable or unfavorable   in connection with auroran custom .      she was still waiting  listening to him .  what was she waiting for .  would it be for what he wanted to say but yet wasn   t sure he dared to .   she said  with an effort at lightness     do you have anything at all to offer  or are we through .        not through     said baley  who was now forced to take another gamble .     you recognized this non auroran perseverance in gremionis and it occurred to you that you could make use of it .        really .  how mad .  what possible use could i make of it .        since he was clearly attracted to you very strongly  it would not be difficult to arrange to have him attracted by another who resembled you very closely .  you urged him to do so  perhaps promising to accept him if the other did not .        who is this poor woman who resembles me closely .        you do not know .  come now  that is na  ve  dr .  vasilia .  i am talking of the solarian woman  gladia  whom i already have said has come under the protection of dr .  fastolfe precisely because she does resemble you .  you expressed no surprise when i referred to this at the beginning of our talk .  it is too late to pretend ignorance now .     vasilia looked at him sharply .     and from his interest in her  you deduced that he must first have been interested in me .  it was this wild guess with which you approached me .        not entirely a wild guess .  there are other substantiating factors .  do you deny all this .     she brushed thoughtfully at the long desk beside her and baley wondered what details were carried by the long sheets of paper on it .  he could make out  from a distance  complexities of patterns that he knew would be totally meaningless to him  no matter how carefully and thoroughly he studied them .  vasilia said     i grow weary .  you have told me that gremionis was interested first in me  and then in my look alike  the solarian .  and now you want me to deny it .  why should i take the trouble to deny it .  of what importance is it .  even if it were true  how could this damage me in any way .  you are saying that i was annoyed by attentions i didn   t want and that i ingeniously deflected them .  well .     baley said     it is not so much what you did  as why .  you knew that gremionis was the type of person who would be persistent .  he had offered himself to you over and over and he would offer himself to gladia over and over .        if she would refuse him .        she was a solarian  having trouble with sex  and was refusing everyone  something i dare say you knew  since i imagine that  for all your estrangement from your fa  from dr .  fastolfe  you have enough feeling to keep an eye on your replacement .        well  then  good for her .  if she refused gremionis  she showed good taste .        you knew there was no    if    about it .  you knew she would .        still  what of it .        repeated offers to her would mean that gremionis would be in gladia   s establishment frequently  that he would cling to her .        one last time .  well .        and in gladia   s establishment was a very unusual object  one of the two humaniform robots in existence  jander panell .     vasilia hesitated .  then     what are you driving at .        i think it struck you that if  somehow  the humaniform robot were killed under circumstances that would implicate dr .  fastolfe  that could be used as a weapon to force the secret of the humaniform positronic brain out of him .  gremionis  annoyed over gladia   s persistent refusal to accept him and given the opportunity by his constant presence at gladia   s establishment  could be induced to seek a fearful revenge by killing the robot .     vasilia blinked rapidly .     that poor barber might have twenty such motives and twenty such opportunities and it wouldn   t matter .  he wouldn   t know how to order a robot to shake hands with any efficiency .  how would he manage to come within a lightyear of imposing mental freeze out on a robot .        which now     said baley softly     finally brings us to the point  a point i think you have been anticipating  for you have somehow restrained yourself from throwing me out because you had to make sure whether i had this point in mind or not .  what i   m saying is that gremionis did the job  with the help of this robotics institute  working through you .         again vasilia     .   it was as though a hyperwave drama had come to a halt in a holographic still .  none of the robots moved  of course  but neither did baley and neither did dr .  vasilia aliena .  long seconds  abnormally long ones  passed  before vasilia let out her breath and  very slowly  rose to her feet .  her face had tightened itself into a humorless smile and her voice was low .     you are saying  earthman  that i am an accessory in the destruction of the humaniform robot .     baley said     something of the sort had occurred to me  doctor .        thank you for the thought .  the interview is over and you will leave .     she pointed to the door .  baley said     i   m afraid i do not wish to .        i don   t consult your wishes  earthman .        you must  for how can you make me leave against my wishes .        i have robots who  at my request  will put you out politely but firmly and without hurting anything but your self esteem  if you have any .        you have but one robot here .  i have two that will not allow that to happen .        i have twenty on instant call .     baley said     dr .  vasilia  please understand .  you were surprised at seeing daneel .  i suspect that  even though you work at the robotics institute  where humaniform robots are the first order of business  you have never actually seen a completed and functioning one .  your robots  therefore  haven   t seen one  either .  now look at daneel .  he looks human .  he looks more human than any robot who has ever existed  except for the dead jander .  to your robots  daneel will surely look human .  he will know how to present an order in such a way that they will obey him in preference  perhaps  to you .     vasilia said     i can  if necessary  summon twenty human beings from within the institute who will put you out  perhaps with a little damage  and your robots  even daneel  will not be able to interfere effectively .        how do you intend to call them  since my robots are not going to allow you to move .  they have extraordinarily quick reflexes .     vasilia showed her teeth in something that could not be called a smile .     i cannot speak for daneel  but i   ve known giskard for most of my life .  i don   t think he will do anything to keep me from summoning help and i imagine he will keep daneel from interfering  too .     baley tried to keep his voice from trembling as he skated on ever thinner ice  and knew it .  he said     before you do anything  perhaps you might ask giskard what he will do if you and i give conflicting orders .        giskard .     said vasilia with supreme confidence .  giskard   s eyes turned full on vasilia and he said  with an odd timbre to his voice     little miss  i am compelled to protect mr .  baley .  he takes precedence .        indeed .  by whose order .  by this earthman   s .  this stranger   s .     giskard said     by dr .  han fastolfe   s order .     vasilia   s eyes flashed and she slowly sat down on the stool again .  her hands  resting in her lap  trembled and she said through lips that scarcely moved     he   s even taken you away .        if that is not enough  dr .  vasilia     said daneel  speaking suddenly  of his own accord     i  too  would place partner elijah   s welfare above yours .     vasilia looked at daneel with bitter curiosity .     partner elijah .  is that what you call him .        yes  dr .  vasilia .  my choice in this matter  the earthman over you  arises not only out of dr .  fastolfe   s instructions  but because the earthman and i are partners in this investigation and because      daneel paused as though puzzled by what he was about to say  and then said it anyway       we are friends .     vasilia said     friends .  an earthman and a humaniform robot .  well  there is a match .  neither quite human .     baley said  sharply     nevertheless bound by friendship .  do not  for your own sake  test the force of our      now it was he who paused and  as though to his own surprise  completed the sentence impossibly       love .     vasilia turned to baley .     what do you want .        information .  i have been called to aurora  this world of the dawn  to straighten out an event that does not seem to have an easy explanation  one in which dr .  fastolfe stands falsely accused  with the possibility  therefore  of terrible consequences for your world and mine .  daneel and giskard understand this situation well and know that nothing but the first law at its fullest and most immediate can take precedence over my efforts to solve the mystery .  since they have heard what i have said and know that you might possibly be an accessory to the deed  they understand that they must not allow this interview to end .  therefore  i say again  don   t risk the actions they may be forced to take if you refuse to answer my questions .  i have accused you of being an accessory in the murder of jander panell .  do you deny that accusation or not .  you must answer .     vasilia said bitterly     i will answer .  never fear .  murder .  a robot is put out of commission and that   s murder .  well  i do deny it  murder or whatever .  i deny it with all possible force .  i have not given gremionis information on robotics for the purpose of allowing him to put an end to jander .  i don   t know enough to do so and i suspect that no one at the institute knows enough .     baley said     i can   t say whether you know enough to have helped commit the crime or whether anyone at the institute knows enough .  we can  however  discuss motive .  first  you might have a feeling of tenderness for this gremionis .  however much you might reject his offers  however contemptible you might find him as a possible lover  would it be so strange that you would feel flattered by his persistence  sufficiently so to be willing to help him if he turned to you prayerfully and without any sexual demands with which to annoy you .        you mean he may have come to me and said     vasilia  dear  i want to put a robot out of commission .  please tell me how to do it and i will be terribly grateful to you .     and i would say     why  certainly  dear  i would just love to help you commit a crime .       preposterous .  no one except an earthman  who knows nothing of auroran ways  could believe anything like this could happen .  it would take a particularly stupid earthman  too .        perhaps  but all possibilities must be considered .  for instance  as a second possibility  might you yourself not be jealous over the fact that gremionis has switched his affections  so that you might help him not out of abstract tenderness but out of a very concrete desire to win him back .        jealous .  that is an earthly emotion .  if i do not wish gremionis for myself  how can i possibly care whether he offers himself to another woman and she accepts or  for that matter  if another woman offers herself to him and he accepts .        i have been told before that sexual jealousy is unknown on aurora and i am willing to admit that is true in theory  but such theories rarely hold up in practice .  there are surely some exceptions .  what   s more  jealousy is all too often an irrational emotion and not to be dismissed by mere logic .  still  let us leave that for the moment .  as a third possibility  you might be jealous of gladia and wish to do her harm  even if you don   t care the least bit for gremionis yourself .        jealous of gladia .  i have never even seen her  except once on the hyperwave when she arrived in aurora .  the fact that people have commented on her resemblance to me  every once in a long while  hasn   t bothered me .        does it perhaps bother you that she is dr .  fastolfe   s ward  his favorite  almost the daughter that you were once .  she has replaced you .        she is welcome to that .  i could not care less .        even if they were lovers .     vasilia stared at baley with growing fury and beads of perspiration appeared at her hairline .  she said     there is no need to discuss this .  you have asked me to deny the allegation that i was accessory to what you call murder and i have denied it .  i have said i lacked the ability and i lacked the motive .  you are welcome to present your case to all aurora .  present your foolish attempts at supplying me with a motive .  maintain  if you wish  that i have the ability to do so .  you will get nowhere .  absolutely nowhere .     and even while she trembled with anger  it seemed to baley that there was conviction in her voice .  she did not fear the accusation .  she had agreed to see him  so he was on the track of something that she feared  perhaps feared desperately .  but she did not fear this .  where  then  had he gone wrong .          .   baley said  troubled  casting about for some way out      suppose i accept your statement  dr .  vasilia .  suppose i agree that my suspicion that you might have been an accessory in this   roboticide  was wrong .  even that would not mean that it is impossible for you to help me .        why should i help you .     baley said     out of human decency .  dr .  han fastolfe assures us he did not do it  that he is not a robot killer  that he did not put this particular robot  jander  out of operation .  you   ve known dr .  fastolfe better than anyone ever has  one would suppose .  you spent years in an intimate relationship with him as a beloved child and growing daughter .  you saw him at times and under conditions that no one else saw him .  whatever your present feelings toward him might be  the past is not changed by them .  knowing him as you do  you must be able to bear witness that his character is such that he could not harm a robot  certainly not a robot that is one of his supreme achievements .  would you be willing to bear such witness openly .  to all the worlds .  it would help a great deal .     vasilia   s face seemed to harden .     understand me     she said  pronouncing the words distinctly .     i will not be involved .        you must be involved .        why .        do you owe nothing to your father .  he is your father .  whether the word means anything to you or not  there is a biological connection .  and besides that  father or not  he took care of you  nurtured and brought you up  for years .  you owe him something for that .     vasilia trembled .  it was a visible shaking and her teeth were chattering .  she tried to speak  failed  took a deep breath  another  then tried again .  she said     giskard  do you hear all that is going on .     giskard bowed his head .     yes  little miss .        and you  the humaniform   daneel .        yes  dr .  vasilia .        you hear all this  too .        yes  dr .  vasilia .        you both understand the earthman insists that i bear evidence on dr .  fastolfe   s character .     both nodded .     then i will speak  against my will and in anger .  it is because i have felt that i did owe this father of mine some minimum consideration as my gene bearer and  after a fashion  my upbringer  that i have not borne witness .  but now i will .  earthman  listen to me .  dr .  han fastolfe  some of whose genes i share  did not take care of me  me  me  as a separate  distinct human being .  i was to him nothing more than an experiment  an observational phenomenon .     baley shook his head .     that is not what i was asking .     she drove furiously over him .     you insisted that i speak and i will speak  and it will answer you .    one thing interests dr .  han fastolfe .  one thing .  one thing only .  that is the functioning of the human brain .  he wishes to reduce it to equations  to a wiring diagram  to a solved maze  and thus found a mathematical science of human behavior which will allow him to prediet the human future .  he calls the science    psychohistory .     i can   t believe that you have talked to him for as little as an hour without his mentioning it .  it is the monomania that drives him .     vasilia searched baley   s face and cried out ip a fierce joy     i can tell .  he has talked to you about it .  then he must have told you that he is interested in robots only insofar as they can bring him to the human brain .  he is interested in humaniform robots only insofar as they can bring him still closer to the human brain .    yes  he   s told you that  too .     the basic theory that made humaniform robots possible arose  i am quite certain  out of his attempt to understand the human brain and he hugs that theory to himself and will allow no one else to see it because he wants to solve the problem of the human brain totally by himself in the two centuries or so he has left .  everything is subordinate to that .  and that most certainly included me .     baley  trying to breast his way against the flood of fury  said in a low voice     in what way did it include you  dr .  vasilia .        when i was born  i should have been placed with others of my kind  with professionals who knew how to care for infants .  i should not have been kept by myself in the charge of an amateur  father or not  scientist or not .  dr .  fastolfe should not have been allowed to subject a child to such an environment and would not  if he had been anyone else but han fastolfe .  he used all his prestige to bring it about  called in every debt he had  persuaded every key person he could  until he had control of me .        he loved you     muttered baley .     loved me .  any other infant would have done as well  but no other infant was available .  what he wanted was a growing child in his presence  a developing brain .  he wanted to make a careful study of the method of its development  the fashion of its growth .  he wanted a human brain in simple form  growing complex  so that he could study it in detail .  for that purpose  he subjected me to an abnormal environment and to subtle experimentation  with no consideration for me as a human being at all .        i can   t believe that .  even if he were interested in you as an experimental object  he could still care for you as a human being .        no .  you speak as an earthman .  perhaps on earth there is some sort of regard for biological connections .  here there is not .  i was an experimental object to him .  period .        even if that were so to start with  dr .  fastolfe couldn   t help but learn to love you  a helpless object entrusted to his care .  even if there were no biological connection at all  even if you were an animal  let us say  he would have learned to love you .        oh  would he now .     she said bitterly .     you don   t know the force of indifference in a man like dr .  fastolfe .  if it would have advanced his knowledge to snuff out my life  he would have done so without hesitation .        that is ridiculous  dr .  vasilia .  his treatment of you was so kind and considerate that it evoked love from you .  i know that .  you  you offered yourself to him .        he told you that  did he .  yes  he would .  not for a moment  even today  would he stop to question whether such a revelation might not embarrass me .    yes  i offered myself to him and why not .  he was the only human being i really knew .  he was superficially gentle to me and i didn   t understand his true purposes .  he was a natural target for me .  then  too  he saw to it that i was introduced to sexual stimulation under controlled conditions  the controls he set up .  it was inevitable that eventually i would turn to him .  i had to  for there was no one else  and he refused .        and you hated him for that .        no .  not at first .  not for years .  even though my sexual development was stunted and distorted  with effects i feel to this day  i did not blame him .  i did not know enough .  i found excuses for him .  he was busy .  he had others .  he needed older women .  you would be astonished at the ingenuity with which i uncovered reasons for his refusal .  it was only years later that i became aware that something was wrong and i managed to bring it out openly  face to face .     why did you refuse me .     i asked .     obliging me might have put me on the right track  solved everything .     she paused  swallowing  and for a moment covered her eyes .  baley waited  frozen with embarrassment .  the robots were expressionless  incapable  for all baley knew  of experiencing any balance or imbalance of the positronic pathways that would produce a sensation in any way analogous to human embarrassment  .  she said  calmer     he avoided the question for as long as he could  but i faced him with it over and over .     why did you refuse me .        why did you refuse me .     he had no hesitation in engaging in sex .  i knew of several occasions   i remember wondering if he simply preferred men .  where children are not involved  personal preference in such things is not of any importance and some men can find women distasteful or  for that matter  vice versa .  it was not so with this man you call my father  however .  he enjoyed women  sometimes young women  as young as i was when i first offered myself .     why did you refuse me .     he finally answered me  and you are welcome to guess what that answer was .     she paused and waited sardonically .  baley stirred uneasily and said in a mumble     he didn   t want to make love to his daughter .        oh  don   t be a fool .  what difference does that make .  considering that hardly any man on aurora knows who his daughter is  any man making love to any woman a few decades younger might be   but never mind  it   s self evident .    what he answered  and oh  how i remember the words  was    you great fool .  if i involved myself with you in that manner  how could i maintain my objectivity  and of what use would my continuing study of you be .        by that time  you see  i knew of his interest in the human brain .  i was even following in his footsteps and becoming a roboticist in my own right .  i worked with giskard in this direction and experimented with his programming .  i did it very well  too  didn   t i  giskard .     giskard said     so you did  little miss .        but i could see that this man whom you call my father did not view me as a human being .  he was willing to see me distorted for life  rather than risk his objectivity .  his observations meant more to him than my normality .  from that time on  i knew what i was and what he was  and i left him .     the silence hung heavy in the air .  baley   s head was throbbing slightly .  he wanted to ask  could you not take into account the self centeredness of a great scientist .  the importance of a great problem .  could you make no allowances for something spoken perhaps in irritation at being forced to discuss what one did not want to discuss .  was not vasilia   s own anger just now much the same thing .  did not vasilia   s concentration on her own    normality     whatever she meant by that  to the exclusion of perhaps the two most important problems facing humanity  the nature of the human brain and the settling of the galaxy  represent an equal self centeredness with much less excuse .  but he could ask none of those things .  he did not know how to put it so that it would make real sense to this woman  nor was he sure he would understand her if she answered .  what was he doing on this world .  he could not understand their ways  no matter how they explained .  nor could they understand his .  he said wearily     i am sorry  dr .  vasilia .  i understand that you are angry  but if you would dismiss your anger for a moment and consider  instead  the matter of dr .  fastolfe and the murdered robot  could you not see that we are dealing with two different things .  dr .  fastolfe might have wanted to observe you in a detached and objective way  even at the cost of your unhappiness  and yet be light years removed from the desire to destroy an advanced humaniform robot .     vasilia reddened .  she shouted     don   t you understand what i   m telling you  earthman .  do you think i have told you what i have just told you because i think you  or anyone  would be interested in the sad story of my life .  for that matter  do you think i enjoy revealing myself in this manner .     i   m telling you this only to show you that dr .  han fastolfe   my biological father  as you never tire of pointing out  did destroy jander .  of course he did .  i have refrained from saying so because no one  until you  was idiot enough to ask me and because of some foolish remnant of consideration i have for that man .  but now that you have asked me  i say so and  by aurora  i will continue to say so  to anyone and everyone .  publicly  if necessary .     dr .  han fastolfe did destroy jander panell .  i am certain of it .  does that satisfy you .         .   baley stared at the distraught woman in horror .  he stuttered and began again .     i don   t understand at all  dr .  vasilia .  please quiet down and consider .  why should dr .  fastolfe destroy the robot .  what has that to do with his treatment of you .  do you imagine it is some kind of retaliation against you .     vasilia was breathing rapidly  baley noted absently and without conscious intention that  although vasilia was as small boned as gladia was  her breasts were larger  and she seemed to wrench at her voice to keep it under control .  she said     i told you  earthman  did i not  that han fastolfe was interested in observing the human brain .  he did not hesitate to put it under stress in order to observe the results .  and he preferred brains that were out of the ordinary  that of an infant  for instance  so that he might watch their development .  any brain but a commonplace one .        but what has that to do         ask yourself  then  why he gained this interest in the foreign woman .        in gladia .  i asked him and he told me .  she reminded him of you and the resemblance is indeed distinct .        and when you told me this earlier  i was amused and asked if you believed him .  i ask again .  do you believe him .        why shouldn   t i believe him .        because it   s not true .  the resemblance may have attracted his attention  but the real key to his interest is that the foreign woman is  foreign .  she had been brought up in solaria  under assumptions and social axioms not like those on aurora .  he could therefore study a brain that was differently molded from ours and could gain an interesting perspective .  don   t you understand that .    for that matter  why is he interested in you  earthman .  is he silly enough to imagine that you can solve an auroran problem when you know nothing about aurora .     daneel suddenly intervened again and baley started at the sound of the other   s voice .  daneel said     dr .  vasilia  partner elijah solved a problem on solaria  though he knew nothing of solaria .        yes     said vasilia sourly     so all the worlds noted on that hyperwave program .  and lightning may strike  too  but i don   t think that han fastolfe is confident it will strike twice in the same place in rapid succession .  no  earthman  he was attracted to you  in the first place  because you are an earthman .  you possess another alien brain he can study and manipulate .        surely you cannot believe  dr .  vasilia  that he would risk matters of vital importance to aurora and call in someone he knew to be useless  merely to study an unusual brain .        of course he would .  isn   t that the whole point of what i am telling you .  there is no crisis that could face aurora that he would believe  for a single moment  to be as important as solving the problem of the brain .  i can tell you exactly what he would say if you were to ask him .  aurora might rise or fall  flourish or decay  and that would all be of little concern compared to the problem of the brain  for if human beings really understood the brain  all that might have been lost in the course of a millennium of neglect or wrong decisions would be regained in a decade of cleverly directed human development guided by his dream of    psychohistory .     he would use the same argument to justify anything  lies  cruelty  anything  by merely saying that it is all intended to serve the purpose of advancing the knowledge of the brain .        i can   t imagine that dr .  fastolfe would be cruel .  he is the gentlest of men .        is he .  how long have you been with him .     baley said     a few hours on earth three years ago .  a day  now  here on aurora .        a whole day .  a whole day .  i was with him for thirty years almost constantly and i have followed his career from a distance with some attention ever since .  and you have been with him a whole day  earthman .  well  on that one day  has he done nothing that frightened or humiliated you .     baley kept silent .  he thought of the sudden attack with the spicer from which daneel had rescued him  of the personal that presented him with such difficulty  thanks to its masked nature  the extended walk outside designed to test his ability to adapt to the open .  vasilia said     i see he did .  your face  earthman  is not quite the mask of disguise you may think it is .  did he threaten you with a psychic probe .     baley said     it was mentioned .        one day  and it was already mentioned .  i assume it made you feel uneasy .        it did .        and that there was no reason to mention it .        oh  but there was     said baley quickly .     i had said that  for a moment  i had a thought which i then lost and it was certainly legitimate to suggest that a psychic probe might help me relocate that thought .     vasilia said     no  it wasn   t .  the psychic probe cannot be used with sufficient delicacy of touch for that  and  if it were attempted  the chances would be considerable that there would be permanent brain damage .        surely not if it were wielded by an expert  by dr .  fastolfe  for instance .        by him .  he doesn   t know one end of the probe from the other .  he is a theoretician  not a technician .        by someone else  then .  he did not  in actual fact  specify himself .        no  earthman .  by no one .  think .  think .  if the psychic probe could be used on human beings safely by anyone  and if han fastolfe were so concerned about the problem of the inactivation of the robot  then why didn   t he suggest the psychic probe be used on himself .        on himself .        don   t tell me this hasn   t occurred to you .  any thinking person would come to the conclusion that fastolfe is guilty .  the only point in favor of his innocence is that he himself insists he is innocent .  well  then  why does he not offer to prove his innocence by being psychically probed and showing that no trace of guilt can be dredged up from the recesses of his brain .  has he suggested such a thing  earthman .        no  he hasn   t .  at least  not to me .        because he knows very well that it is deadly dangerous .  yet he does not hesitate to suggest it in your case  merely to observe how your brain works under pressure  how you react to fright .  or perhaps it occurs to him that  however dangerous the probe is to you  it may come up with some interesting data for him  as far as the details of your earth molded brain are concerned .  tell me  then  isn   t that cruel .     baley brushed it aside with a tight gesture of his right arm .     how does this apply to the actual case  to the roboticide .        the solarian woman  gladia  caught my onetime father   s eye .  she had an interesting brain  for his purposes .  he therefore gave her the robot  jander  to see what would happen if a woman not raised on aurora were faced with a robot that seemed human in every particular .  he knew that an auroran woman would very likely make use of the robot for sex immediately and have no trouble doing so .  i myself would have some trouble  i admit  because i was not brought up normally  but no ordinary auroran would .  the solarian woman  on the other hand  would have a great deal of trouble because she was brought up on an extremely robotic world and had unusually rigid mental attitudes toward robots .  the difference  you see  might be very instructive to my father  who tried  out of these variations  to build his theory of brain functioning .  han fastolfe waited half a year for the solarian woman to get to the point where she could perhaps begin making the first experimental approaches      baley interrupted .     your father knew nothing at all about the relationship between gladia and jander .        who told you that  earthman .  my father .  gladia .  if the former  he was naturally lying  if the latter  she simply didn   t know  very likely .  you may be sure fastolfe knew what was going on  he had to  for it must have been part of his study of how a human brain was bent under solarian conditions .     and then he thought  and i am as sure of this as i would be if i could read his thoughts  what would happen now  at the point where the woman is just beginning to rely on jander  if  suddenly  without reason  she lost him .  he knew what an auroran woman would do .  she would feel some disappointment and then seek out some substitute  but what would a solarian woman do .  so he arranged to put jander out of commission         destroy an immensely valuable robot just to satisfy a trivial curiosity .        monstrous  isn   t it .  but that   s what han fastolfe would do .  so go back to him  earthman  and tell him that his little game is over  if the planet  generally  doesn   t believe him to be guilty now  they most certainly will after i have had my say .         .   for a long moment  baley sat there stunned  while vasilia looked at him with a kind of grim delight  her face looking harsh and totally unlike that of gladia .  there seemed nothing to do   baley got to his feet  feeling old  much older than his forty five standard years  a child   s age to these aurorans  .  so far everything he had done had led to nothing .  to worse than nothing  for at every one of his moves  the ropes seemed to tighten about fastolfe .  he looked upward at the transparent ceiling .  the sun was quite high  but perhaps it had passed its zenith  as it was dimmer than ever .  lines of thin clouds obscured it intermittently .  vasilia seemed to become aware of this from his upward glance .  her arm moved on the section of the long bench near which she was sitting and the transparency of the ceiling vanished .  at the same time  a brilliant light suffused the room  bearing the same faint orange tinge that the sun itself had .  she said     i think the interview is over .  i shall have no reason to see you again  earthman  or you me .  perhaps you had better leave aurora .  you have done     she smiled humorlessly and said the next words almost savagely     my father enough damage  though scarcely as much as he deserves .     baley took a step toward the door and his two robots closed in on him .  giskard said in a low voice     are you well  sir .     baley shrugged .  what was there to answer to that .  vasilia called out     giskard .  when dr .  fastolfe finds he has no further use for you  come join my staff .     giskard looked at her calmly .     if dr .  fastolfe permits  i will do so  little miss     her smile grew warm .     please do so  giskard .  i   ve never stopped missing you .        i often think of you  little miss .     baley turned at the door .     dr .  vasilia  would you have a personal i might use .     vasilia   s eyes widened .     of course not  earthman .  there are community personals here and there at the institute .  your robots should be able to guide you .     he stared at her and shook his head .  it was not surprising that she wanted no earthman infecting her rooms and yet it angered him just the same .  he said out of anger  rather than out of any rational judgment     dr .  vasilia  i would not  were i you  speak of the guilt of dr .  fastolfe .        what is there to stop me .        the danger of the general uncovering of your dealings with gremionis .  the danger to you .        don   t be ridiculous .  you have admitted there was no conspiracy between myself and gremionis .        not really .  i agreed there seemed reason to conclude there was no direct conspiracy between you and gremionis to destroy jander .  there remains the possibility of an indirect conspiracy .        you are mad .  what is an indirect conspiracy .        i am not ready to discuss that in front of dr .  fastolfe   s robots  unless you insist .  and why should you .  you know very well what i mean .     there was no reason why baley should think she would accept this bluff .  it might simply worsen the situation still further .  but it didn   t .  vasilia seemed to shrink within herself  frowning .  baley thought  there is then an indirect conspiracy  whatever it might be  and this might hold her till she sees through my bluff .  baley said  his spirits rising a little     i repeat  say nothing about dr .  fastolfe .     but  of course  he didn   t know how much time he had bought  perhaps very little .      gremionis     .   they were sitting in the airfoil again  all three in the front  with baley once more in the middle and feeling the pressure on either side .  baley was grateful to them for the care they unfailingly gave him  even though they were only machines  helpless to disobey instructions .  and then he thought  why dismiss them with a word      machines    .  they   re good machines in a universe of sometimes evil people .  i have no right to favor the machines vs .  people sub categorization over the good vs .  evil one .  and daneel  at least  i cannot think of as a machine .  giskard said     i must ask again  sir .  do you feel well .     baley nodded .     quite well  giskard .  i am glad to be  out here with you two .     the sky was  for the most part  white  off white  actually .  there was a gentle wind and it had felt distinctly cool until they got into the car .  daneel said     partner elijah  i was listening carefully to the conversation between yourself and dr .  vasilia .  i do not wish to comment unfavorably on what dr .  vasilia has said  but i must tell you that  in my observation  dr .  fastolfe is a kind and courteous human being .  he has never  to my knowledge  been deliberately cruel  nor has he  as nearly as i can judge  sacrificed a human being   s essential welfare to the needs of his curiosity .     baley looked at daneel   s face  which gave the impression  somehow  of intent sincerity .  he said     could you say anything against dr .  fastolfe  even if he were  in fact  cruel and thoughtless .        i could remain silent .        but would you .        if  by telling a lie  i were to harm a truthful dr .  vasilia by casting unjustified doubt on her truthfulness  and if  by remaining silent  i would harm dr .  fastolfe by lending further color to the true accusations against him  and if the two harms were  to my mind  roughly equal in intensity  then it would be necessary for me to remain silent .  harm through an active deed outweighs  in general  harm through passivity  all things being reasonably equal .     baley said     then  even though the first law states     a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm     the two halves of the law are not equal .  a fault of commission  you say  is greater than one of omission .        the words of the law are merely an approximate description of the constant variations in positronomotive force along the robotic brain paths  partner elijah .  i do not know enough to describe the matter mathematically  but i know what my tendencies are .        and they are always to choose not doing over doing  if the harm is roughly equal in both directions .        in general .  and always to choose truth over nontruth  if the harm is roughly equal in both directions .  in general  that is .        and  in this case  since you speak to refute dr .  vasilia and thus do her harm  you can only do so because the first law is mitigated sufficiently by the fact that you are telling the truth .        that is so  partner elijah .        yet the fact is  you would say what you have said  even though it were a lie  provided dr .  fastolfe had instructed you  with sufficient intensity  to tell that lie when necessary and to refuse to admit that you had been so instructed .     there was a pause and then daneel said     that is so  partner elijah .        it is a complicated mess  daneel  but you still believe that dr .  fastolfe did not murder jander panell .        my experience with him is that he is truthful  partner elijah  and that he would not do harm to friend jander .        and yet dr .  fastolfe has himself described a powerful motive for his having committed the deed  while dr .  vasilia has described a completely different motive  one that is just as powerful and is even more disgraceful than the first .     baley brooded a bit .     if the public were made aware of either motive  belief in dr .  fastolfe   s guilt would be universal .     baley turned suddenly to giskard .     how about you  giskard .  you have known dr .  fastolfe longer than daneel has .  do you agree that dr .  fastolfe could not have committed the deed and could not have destroyed jander  on the basis of your understanding of dr .  fastolfe   s character .        i do  sir .     baley regarded the robot uncertainly .  he was less advanced than daneel .  how far could he be trusted as a corroborating witness .  might he not be impelled to follow daneel in whatever direction daneel chose to take .  he said     you knew dr .  vasilia  too  did you not .        i knew her very well     said giskard .     and liked her  i gather .        she was in my charge for many years and the task did not in any way trouble me .        even though she fiddled with your programming .        she was very skillful .        would she lie about her father  about dr .  fastolfe  that is .     giskard hesitated .     no  sir .  she would not .        then you are saying that what she says is the truth .        not quite  sir .  what i am saying is that she herself believes she is telling the truth .        but why should she believe such evil things about her father to be true if  in actual fact  he is as kind a person as daneel has just told me he was .     giskard said slowly     she has been embittered by various events in her youth  events for which she considers dr .  fastolfe to have been responsible and for which he may indeed have been unwittingly responsible  to an extent .  it seems to me it was not his intention that the events in question should have the consequences they did .  however  human beings are not governed by the straightforward laws of robotics .  it is therefore difficult to judge the complexities of their motivations under most conditions .        true enough     muttered baley .  giskard said     do you think the task of demonstrating dr .  fastolfe   s innocence to be hopeless .     baley   s eyebrows moved toward each other in a frown .     it may be .  as it happens  i see no way out  and if dr .  vasilia talks  as she has threatened to do         but you ordered her not to talk .  you explained that it would be dangerous to herself if she did .     baley shook his head .     i was bluffing .  i didn   t know what else to say .        do you intend to give up  then .     and baley said forcefully     no .  if it were merely fastolfe  i might .  after all  what physical harm would come to him .  roboticide is not even a crime  apparently  merely a civil offense .  at worst  he will lose political influence and  perhaps  find himself unable to continue with his scientific labors for a time .  i would be sorry to see that happen  but if there   s nothing more i can do  then there   s nothing more i can do .     and if it were just myself  i might give up  too .  failure would damage my reputation  but who can build a brick house without bricks .  i would go back to earth a bit tarnished  i would lead a miserable and unclassified life  but that is the chance that faces every earthman and woman .  better men than i have had to face that as unjustly .     however  it is a matter of earth .  if i fail  then along with the grievous loss to dr .  fastolfe and to myself  there would be an end for any hope earthpeople might have to move out of earth and into the galaxy generally .  for that reason  i must not fail and i must keep on somehow  as long as i am not physically thrust off this world .     having ended in what was almost a whisper  he suddenly looked up and said in a peevish tone     why are we sitting here parked  giskard .  are you running the motor for your own amusement .        with respect  sir     said giskard     you have not told me where to take you .        true .    i beg your pardon  giskard .  first  take me to the nearest of the community personals that dr .  vasilia made mention of .  you two may be immune to such things  but i have a bladder that needs emptying .  after that  find someplace nearby where i can get something to eat .  i have a stomach that needs filling .  and after that         yes  partner elijah .     asked daneel .     to tell you the truth  daneel  i don   t know .  however  after i tend to these purely physical needs  i will think of something .     and how baley wished he could believe that .      .   the airfoil did not skim the ground for long .  it came to a halt  swaying a bit  and baley felt the usual odd tightening of his stomach .  that small unsteadiness told him he was in a vehicle and it drove away the temporary feeling of being safe within walls and between robots .  through the glass ahead and on either side  and backward  if he craned his neck  was the whiteness of sky and the greenness of foliage  all amounting to outside  that is  to nothing .  he swallowed uneasily .  they had stopped at a small structure .  baley said     is this the community personal .     daneel said     it is the nearest of a number on the institute grounds  partner elijah .        you found it quickly .  are these structures also included in the map that has been pumped into your memory .        that is the case  partner elijah .        is this one in use now .        it may be  partner elijah  but three or four may use it simultaneously .        is there room for me .        very likely  partner elijah .        well  then  let me out .  i   ll go there and see      the robots did not move .  giskard said     sir  we may not enter with you .        yes  i am aware of that  giskard .        we will not be able to guard you properly  sir .     baley frowned .  the lesser robot would naturally have the more rigid mind and baley suddenly recognized the danger that he would simply not be allowed out of their sight and  therefore  not allowed to enter the personal .  he put a note of urgency into his voice and turned his attention to daneel  who might be expected to more nearly understand human needs .     i can   t help that  giskard .    daneel  i have no choice in the matter .  let me out of the car .     giskard looked at baley without moving and  for one horrid moment  baley thought the robot would suggest that he unburden himself in the nearby field  in the open  like an animal .  the moment passed .  daneel said     i think we must allow partner elijah to have his way in this respect .     whereupon giskard said to baley     if you can wait for a short while  sir  i will approach the structure first .     baley grimaced .  giskard walked slowly toward the building and then  deliberately  circumnavigated it .  baley might have predicted the fact that  once giskard disappeared  his own sense of urgency would increase .  he tried to distract his own nerve endings by staring around at the prospect .  after some study  he became aware of thin wires in the air  here and there  fine  dark hairs against the white sky .  he did not see them  to begin with .  what he saw first was an oval object sliding along beneath the clouds .  he became aware of it as a vehicle and realized that it was not floating but was suspended from a long horizontal wire .  he followed that long wire with his eyes  forward and back  noting others of the sort .  he then saw another vehicle farther off  and yet another still farther off .  the farthest of the three was a featureless speck whose nature he understood only because he had seen the nearer ones .  undoubtedly  these were cable cars for internal transportation from one part of the robotics institute to another .  how spread out it all was  thought baley .  how needlessly the institute consumed space .  and yet  in doing so  it did not consume the surface .  the structures were sufficiently widely spaced so that the greenery seemed untouched and the plant and animal life continued  baley imagined  as they might in emptiness .  solaria  baley remembered  had been empty .  no doubt all the spacer worlds were empty  since aurora  the most populous  was so empty  even here in the most built up region of the planet .  for that matter  even earth  outside the cities  was empty .  but there were the cities and baley felt a sharp pang of homesickness  which he had to push to one side .  daneel said     ah  friend giskard has completed his examination .     giskard was back and baley said tartly     well .  will you be so kind as to grant me permission      he stopped .  why expend sarcasm on the impenetrable hide of a robot .  giskard said     it seems quite certain that the personal is unoccupied .        good .  then get out of my way .     baley flung open the door of the airfoil and stepped out onto the gravel of a narrow path .  he strode rapidly  with daneel following .  when he reached the door of the structure  daneel wordlessly indicated the contact that would open it .  daneel did not venture to touch the contact himself .  presumably  thought baley  to have done so without specific instructions would have indicated an intention to enter  and even the intention was not permitted .  baley pushed the contact and entered  leaving the two robots behind .  it was not until he was inside that it occurred to him that giskard could not possibly have entered the personal to see that it was unoccupied  that the robot must have been judging the matter from external appearance  a dubious proceeding at best .  and baley realized  with some discomfort  that  for the first time  he was isolated and separated from all protectors  and that the protectors on the other side of the door couldn   t easily enter if he were suddenly in trouble .  what  then  if he were  at this moment  not alone .  what if some enemy had been alerted by vasilia  who knew he would be in search of a personal  and what if that enemy was in hiding right now in the structure .  baley grew suddenly and uncomfortably aware that  as would not have been the case on earth  he was totally unarmed .      .   to be sure  the structure was not large .  there were small urinals  side by side  half a dozen of them  small washbasins  side by side  again half a dozen .  no showers  no clothes fresheners  no shaving devices .  there were half a dozen stalls  separated by partitions and with small doors to each .  might there not be someone waiting inside one of them   the doors did not come down to the ground .  moving softly  he bent and glanced under each door  looking for any sign of legs .  he then approached each door  testing it  swinging it open tensely  ready to slam it shut at the least sign of anything untoward  and then to dash to the door that led to the outside .  all the stalls were empty .  he looked around to make sure there were no other hiding places .  he could find none .  he went to the door to the outside and found no indication of a way of locking it .  it occurred to him that there would naturally be no way of locking it .  the personal was clearly for the use of several men at the same time .  others would have to be able to enter at need .  yet he could not very well leave and try another  for the danger would exist at any  and besides  he could delay no longer .  for a moment  he found himself unable to decide which of the series of urinals he should use .  he could approach and use any of them .  so could anyone else .  he forced the choice of one upon himself and  aware of openness all around  was afflicted at once with bashful bladder .  he felt the urgency  but had to wait impatiently for the feeling of apprehension at the possible entrance of others to dissipate itself .  he no longer feared the entrance of enemies  just the entrance of anyone .  and then he thought  the robots will at least delay anyone approaching .  with that  he managed to relax   he was quite done  greatly relieved  and about to turn to a washbasin  when he heard a moderately high pitched  rather tense voice .     are you elijah baley .     baley froze .  after all his apprehension and all his precautions  he had been unaware of someone entering .  in the end  he had been entirely wrapped up in the simple act of emptying his bladder  something that should not have taken up even the tiniest fraction of his conscious mind .   was he getting old .   to be sure  there seemed no threat of any kind in the voice he heard .  it seemed empty of menace .  it may have been that baley simply felt certain  and had the sure confidence within him   that daneel  at least  if not giskard  would not have allowed a threat to enter .  what bothered baley was merely the entrance .  in his whole life  he had never been approached  let alone addressed  by a man in a personal .  on earth that was the most strenuous taboo and on solaria  and  until now  on aurora  he had used only one person personals .  the voice came again .  impatient .     come .  you must be elijah baley .     slowly  baley turned .  it was a man of moderate height  delicately dressed in well fitted clothing in various shades of blue .  he was light skinned  light haired  and had a small mustache that was a shade darker than the hair on his head .  baley found himself staring with fascination at the small strip of hair on the upper lip .  it was the first time he had seen a spacer with a mustache .  baley said  and was filled with shame at speaking in a personal      i am elijah baley .     his voice  even in his own ears  seemed a scratchy and unconvincing whisper .  the spacer seemed to find it unconvincing  certainly .  he said  narrowing his eyes and staring     the robots outside said elijah baley was in here  but you don   t look at all the way you looked on hyperwave .  not at all .     that foolish dramatization .  thought baley fiercely .  no one would meet him to the end of time without having been preliminarily poisoned by that impossible representation .  no one would accept him as a human being at the start  as a fallible human being  and when they discovered the fallibility  they would  in disappointment  consider him a fool .  he turned resentfully to the washbasin and splashed water  then shook his hands vaguely in the air  while wondering where the hot air jet might be found .  the spacer touched a contact and seemed to pluck a thin bit of absorbent fluff out of midair .     thank you     said baley  taking it .     that was not me in the hyperwave show .  it was an actor .        i know that  but they might have picked one that looked more like you  mightn   t they .     it seemed to be a source of grievance to him .     i want to speak to you .        how did you get past my robots .     that was another source of grievance  apparently .     i nearly didn   t     said the spacer .     they tried to stop me and i only had one robot with me .  i had to pretend i had to get in here on an emergency basis and they searched me .  they absolutely laid hands on me to see if i was carrying anything dangerous .  i   d have you up on charges  if you weren   t an earthman .  you can   t give robots the kind of orders that embarrass a human being .        i   m sorry     said baley stiffly     but i am not the one who gave them their orders .  what can i do for you .        i want to speak to you .        you are speaking to me .    who are you .     the other seemed to hesitate  then said     gremionis .        santirix gremionis .        that   s right .        why do you want to speak to me .     for a moment  gremionis stared at baley  apparently with embarrassment .  then he mumbled     well  as long as i   m here   if you don   t mind  i might as well      and he stepped toward the line of urinals .  baley realized  with the last refinement of horrified queasiness  what it was gremionis intended to do .  he turned hastily and said     i   ll wait for you outside .        no no  don   t go     said gremionis desperately  in what was almost a squeak .     this won   t take a second .  please .     it was only that baley now wanted  just as desperately  to talk to gremionis and did not want to do anything that might offend the other and make him unwilling to talk  otherwise he would not have been willing to accede to the request .  he kept his back turned and squinted his eyes nearly shut in a sort of horrified reflex .  it was only when gremionis came up around him  his hands kneading a fluffy towel of his own  that baley could relax again  after a fashion .     why do you want to speak to me .     he said again .     gladia  the woman from solaria      gremionis looked dubious and stopped .     i know gladia     said baley coldly .     gladia viewed me  trimensionally  you know  and told me you had asked about me .  and she asked me if i had  in any way  mistreated a robot she owned  a human looking robot like one of those outside         well  did you  mr .  gremionis .        no .  i didn   t even know she owned a robot like that  until   did you tell her i did .        i was only asking questions  mr .  gremionis .     gremionis had made a fist of his right hand and was grinding it nervously into his left .  he said intensely     i don   t want to be falsely accused of anything  and especially where such a false accusation would affect my relationship with gladia .     baley said     how did you find me .     gremionis said     she asked me about that robot and said you had asked about me .  i had heard you had been called to aurora by dr .  fastolfe to solve this  puzzle  about the robot .  it was on the hyperwave news .  and      the words ground out as though they were emerging from him with the utmost difficulty .     go on     said baley .     i had to talk to you and explain that i had had nothing to do with that robot .  nothing .  gladia didn   t know where you were  but i thought dr .  fastolfe would know .        so you called him .        oh no  i  i don   t think i   d have the nerve to   he   s such an important scientist .  but gladia called him for me .  she   s  that kind of person .  he told her you had gone to see his daughter  dr .  vasilia aliena .  that was good because i know her .        yes  i know you do     said baley .  gremionis looked uneasy .     how did you   did you ask her about me  too .     his uneasiness seemed to be degenerating to misery .     i finally called dr .  vasilia and she said you had just left and i   d probably find you at some community personal  and this one is the closest to her establishment .  i was sure there would be no reason for you to delay in order to find a farther one .  i mean why should you .        you reason quite correctly  but how is it you got here so quickly .        i work at the robotics institute and my establishment is on the institute grounds .  my scooter brought me here in minutes .        did you come here alone .        yes .  with only one robot .  the scooter is a two seater  you see .     and your robot is waiting outside .        yes .        tell me again why you want to see me .        i   ve got to make sure you don   t think i   ve had anything to do with that robot .  i never even heard of him till this whole thing exploded in the news .  so can i talk to you now .        yes  but not here     said baley firmly .     let   s get out .     how strange it was  thought baley  that he was so pleased to get out from behind walls and into the outside .  there was something more totally alien to this personal than anything else he had encountered on either aurora or solaria .  even more disconcerting than the fact of planet wide indiscriminate use had been the horror of being openly and casually addressed  of behavior that drew no distinction between this place and its purpose and any other place and purpose .  the book films he had viewed had said nothing of this .  clearly  as fastolfe had pointed out  they were not written for earth people but for aurorans and  to a lesser extent  for possible tourists from the other forty nine spacer worlds .  earthpeople  after all  almost never went to the spacer worlds  least of all to aurora .  they were not welcome there .  why  then  should they be addressed .  and why should the book films expand on what everyone knew .  should they make a fuss over the fact that aurora was spherical in shape  or that water was wet  or that one man might address another freely in a personal .  yet did that not make a mockery of the very name of the structure .  yet baley found himself unable to avoid thinking of the women   s personals on earth where  as jessie had frequently told him  women chattered incessantly and felt no discomfort about it .  why women  but not men .  baley had never thought seriously about it before  but had accepted it merely as custom  as unbreakable custom  but if women  why not men .  it didn   t matter .  the thought only affected his intellect and not whatever it was about his mind that made him feel overwhelming and ineradicable distaste for the whole idea .  he repeated     let   s get out .     gremionis protested     but your robots are out there .        so they are .  what of it .        but this is something i want to talk about privately  man to m man .     he stumbled over the phrase .     i suppose you mean spacer to earthman .        if you like .        my robots are necessary .  they are my partners in my investigation .        but this has nothing to do with the investigation .  that   s what i   m trying to tell you .        i   ll be the judge of that     said baley firmly  walking out of the personal .  gremionis hesitated and then followed .      .   daneel and giskard were waiting  impassive  expressionless  patient .  on daneel   s face  baley thought he could make out a trace of concern  but  on the other hand  he might merely be reading that emotion into those inhumanly human features .  giskard  the less human looking  showed nothing  of course  even to the most willing personifier .  a third robot waited as well  presumably that of gremionis .  he was simpler in appearance even than giskard and had an air of shabbiness about him .  it was clear that gremionis was not very well to do .  daneel said  with what baley automatically assumed to be the warmth of relief     i am pleased that you are well  partner elijah .        entirely well .  i am curious  however  about something .  if you had heard me call out in alarm from within  would you have come in .        at once  sir     said giskard .     even though you are programmed not to enter personals .        the need to protect a human being  you  in particular   would be paramount  sir .        that is so  partner elijah     said daneel .     i   m glad to hear that     said baley .     this person is santirix gremionis .  mr .  gremionis  this is daneel and this is giskard .     each robot bent his head solemnly .  gremionis merely glanced at them and lifted one hand in indifferent acknowledgment .  he made no effort to introduce his own robot .  baley looked around .  the light was distinctly dimmer  the wind was brisker  the air was cooler  the sun was completely hidden by clouds .  there was a gloom to the surroundings that did not seem to affect baley  who continued to be delighted at having escaped from the personal .  it lifted his spirits amazingly that he was actually experiencing the feeling of being pleased at being outside .  it was a special case  he knew  but it was a beginning and he could not help but consider it a triumph .  baley was about to turn to gremionis to resume the conversation  when his eye caught movement .  walking across the lawn came a woman with an accompanying robot .  she was coming toward them but seemed totally oblivious to them .  she was clearly making for the personal .  baley put out his arm in the direction of the woman  as though to stop her  even though she was still thirty meters away  and muttered     doesn   t she know that   s a men   s personal .        what .     said gremionis .  the woman continued to approach  while baley watched in total puzzlement .  finally  the woman   s robot stepped to one side to wait and the woman entered the structure .  baley said helplessly     but she can   t go in there .     gremionis said     why not .  it   s communal .        but it   s for men .        it   s for people     said gremionis .  he seemed utterly confused .     either sex .  surely you can   t mean that .        any human being .  of course i mean it .  how would you want it to be .  i don   t understand .     baley turned away .  it had not been many minutes before that he had thought that open conversation in a personal was the acme in bad taste  of things not done .  if he had tried to think of something worse yet  he would have completely failed to dredge up the possibility of encountering a woman in a personal .  convention on earth required him to ignore the presence of others in the large community personals on that world  but not all the conventions ever invented would have prevented him from knowing whether a person passing him was a man or a woman .  what if  while he had been in the personal  a woman had entered  casually  indifferently  as this one had just done .  or  worse still  what if he had entered a personal and found a woman already there .  he could not estimate his reaction .  he had never weighed the possibility  let alone met with such a situation  but he found the thought totally intolerable .  and the book films had told him nothing about that  either .  he had viewed those films in order that he might not approach the investigation in total ignorance of the auroran way of life  and they had left him in total ignorance of all that was important .  then how could he handle this triply knotted puzzle of jander   s death  when at every step he found himself lost in ignorance .  a moment before he had felt triumph at a small conquest over the terrors of outside  but now he was faced with the feeling of being ignorant of everything  ignorant even of the nature of his ignorance .  it was now  while fighting not to picture the woman passing through the airspace lately occupied by himself  that he came near to utter despair .      .   again giskard said  and in a way that made it possible to read concern into his words  if not into the tone      are you unwell  sir .  do you need help .     baley muttered     no no .  i   m all right .    but let   s move away .  we   re in the path of people wishing to use that structure .     he walked rapidly toward the airfoil that was resting in the open stretch beyond the gravel path .  on the other side was a small two wheeled vehicle  with two seats  one behind the other .  baley assumed it to be gremionis    scooter .  his feeling of depression and misery  baley realized  was accentuated by the fact that he felt hungry .  it was clearly past lunchtime and he had not eaten .  he turned to gremionis .     let   s talk  but if you don   t mind  let   s do it over lunch .  that is  if you haven   t already eaten  and if you don   t mind eating with me .        where are you going to eat .        i don   t know .  where does one eat at the institute .     gremionis said     not at the community diner .  we can   t talk there .        is there an alternative .        come to my establishment     said gremionis at once .     it isn   t one of the fancier ones here .  i   m not one of your high executives .  still  i have a few serviceable robots and we can set a decent table .    i tell you what .  i   ll get on my scooter with brundij  my robot  you know  and you follow me .  you   ll have to go slowly  but i   m only a little over a kilometer away .  it will just take two or three minutes .     he moved away at an eager half run .  baley watched him and thought there seemed to be a kind of gangly youthfulness about him .  there was no easy way of actually judging his age  of course  spacers didn   t show age and gremionis might easily be fifty .  but he acted young  almost what an earthman would consider teenage young .  baley wasn   t sure exactly what there was about him that gave that impression .  baley turned suddenly to daneel .     do you know gremionis  daneel .        i have never met him before  partner elijah .        you  giskard .        i have met him once  sir  but only in passing .        do you know anything about him  giskard .        nothing that is not apparent on the surface  sir .        his age .  his personality .        no  sir .     gremionis shouted     ready .     his scooter was humming rather roughly .  it was clear that it was not air jet assisted .  the wheels would not leave the ground .  brundij sat behind gremionis .  giskard  daneel  and baley moved quickly into their airfoil once again .  gremionis moved outward in a loose circle .  gremionis    hair flew backward in the wind and baley had a sudden sensation of how the wind must feel when one traveled in an open vehicle such as a scooter .  he was thankful he was totally enclosed in an airfoil  which suddenly seemed to him a much more civilized way of traveling .  the scooter straightened out and darted off with a muted roar  gremionis waving one hand in a follow me gesture .  the robot behind him maintained his balance with almost negligent ease and did not hold on to gremionis    waist  as baley was certain a human being would have needed to .  the airfoil followed .  although the scooter   s smooth forward progression seemed high speed  that was apparently the illusion of its small size .  the airfoil had some difficulty maintaining a speed low enough to avoid running it down .     just the same     said baley thoughtfully     one thing puzzles me .     what is that  partner elijah .     asked daneel .     vasilia referred to this gremionis disparagingly as a    barber .     apparently  he deals with hair  clothes  and other matters of personal human adornment .  how is it  then  that he has an establishment on the grounds of the robotics institute .         again gremionis     .   it took only a few minutes before baley found himself in the fourth auroran establishment he had seen since his arrival on the planet a day and a half before  fastolfe   s  gladia   s  vasilia   s  and now gremionis    .  gremionis    establishment appeared smaller and drabber than the others  even though it showed  to baley   s unpracticed eye in auroran matters  signs of recent construction .  the distinctive mark of the auroran establishment  the robotic niches  were  however  present .  on entering  giskard and daneel moved quickly into two that were empty and faced the room  unmoving and silent .  gremionis    robot  brundij  moved into a third niche almost as quickly .  there was no sign of any difficulty in making their choices or of any tendency for any one niche to be the target of two robots  however briefly .  baley wondered how the robots avoided conflict and decided there must be signal communication among them of a kind that was subliminal to human beings .  it was something  provided he remembered to do so  concerning which he might consult daneel .  gremionis was studying the niches also  baley noticed .  gremionis    hand had gone to his upper lip and  for a moment  his forefinger stroked the small mustache .  he said  a bit uncertainly     your robot  the human looking one  doesn   t seem right in the niche .  that   s daneel olivaw  isn   t it .  dr .  fasfolfe   s robot .        yes     said baley .     he was in the hyperwave drama  too .  or at least an actor was one who better fit the part .        yes  i remember .     baley noted that gremionis  like vasilia and even like gladia and fastolfe  kept a certain distance .  there seemed to be a repulsion field  unseen  unfelt  unsensed in any way  around baley that kept these spacers from approaching too closely  that sent them into a gentle curve of avoidance when they passed him .  baley wondered if gremionis was aware of this or if it was entirely automatic .  and what did they do with the chairs he sat in while in their establishments  the dishes he ate from  the towels he used .  would ordinary washing suffice .  were there special sterilizing procedures .  would they discard and replace everything .  would the establishments be fumigated once he left the planet  or every night .  what about the community personal he used .  would they tear it down and rebuild it .  what about the woman who had ignorantly entered it after he had left .  or could she possibly have been the fumigator .  he realized he was getting silly .  to outer space with it .  what the aurorans did and how they dealt with their problems was their affair and he would bother his head no more with them .  jehoshaphat .  he had his own problems and  right now  the particular splinter of it was gremionis  and he would tackle that after lunch .  lunch was rather simple  largely vegetarian  but for the first time he had a little trouble .  each separate item was too sharply defined in taste .  the carrots tasted rather strongly of carrots and the peas of peas  so to speak .  a little too much so  perhaps .  he ate rather reluctantly and tried not to show a slightly rising gorge .  and  as he did so  he became aware that he grew used to it   as though his taste buds saturated and could handle the excess more easily .  it dawned on baley  in a rather sad way  that if his exposure to auroran food was to continue for any length of time  he would return to earth missing that distinctiveness of flavor and resenting the flowing together of earth tastes .  even the crispness of various items  which had startled him at first  as each closing of his teeth seemed to create a noise that surely  he thought  must interfere with conversation  had already grown to seem exciting evidence that he was  in fact  eating .  there would be a silence about an earth meal that would leave him missing something .  he began to eat with attention  to study the tastes .  perhaps  when earthpeople established themselves on other worlds  this spacer fashion food would be the mark of the new diet  especially if there were no robots to prepare and serve the meals .  and then he thought uncomfortably  not when but if earth people established themselves on other worlds  and the ifness of it all depended on him  on plainclothesman elijah baley .  the burden of it weighed him down .  the meal was over .  a pair of robots brought in the heated  moistened napkins with which one could clean one   s hands .  except that they weren   t ordinary napkins  for when baley put his down on the plate  it seemed to move slightly  thin out  and grow cobwebby .  then  quite suddenly  it leaped up insubstantially and was carried into an outlet in the ceiling .  baley jumped slightly and his eyes moved upward  following the disappearing item open mouthed .  gremionis said     that   s something new i just picked up .  disposable  you see  but i don   t know if i like it yet .  some people say it will clog the disposal vent after a while and others worry about pollution because they say some of it will surely get in your lungs .  the manufacturer says not  but      baley realized suddenly that he had said not a word during the meal and that this was the first time either of them had spoken since the short exchange on daneel before the meal had been served .    and there was no use in small talk about napkins .  baley said  rather gruffly     are you a barber  mr .  gremionis .     gremionis flushed  his light skin reddening to the hairline .  he said in a choked voice     who told you that .     baley said     if that is an impolite way of referring to your profession  i apologize .  it is a common way of speaking on earth and is no insult there .     gremionis said     i am a hair designer and a clothing designer .  it is a recognized branch of art .  i am  in fact  a personnel artist .     his finger went to his mustache again .  baley said gravely     i notice your mustache .  is it common to grow them on aurora .        no  it is not .  i hope it will become so .  you take your masculine face   a great many of them can be strengthened and improved by the artful design of facial hair .  everything is in the design  that   s part of my profession .  you can go too far  of course .  on the world of pallas  facial hair is common  but it is the practice there to indulge in parti colored dying .  each individual hair is separately dyed to produce some sort of mixture .    now  that   s foolish .  it doesn   t last  the colors change with time  and it looks terrible .  but even so  it   s better than facial baldness in some ways .  nothing is less attractive than a facial desert .    that   s my own phrase .  i use it in my personal talks with potential clients and it   s very effective .  females can get by with no facial hair because they make up for it in other ways .  on the world of smitheus      there was a hypnotic quality to his quiet  rapid words and his earnest expression  the way in which his eyes widened and remained fixed on baley with an intense sincerity .  baley had to shake loose with an almost physical force .  he said     are you a roboticist  mr .  gremionis .     gremionis looked startled and a little confused at being interrupted in midflow .     a roboticist .        yes .  a roboticist .        no  not at all .  i use robots as everyone does  but i don   t know what   s inside them .    don   t care really .        but you live here on the grounds of the robotics institute .  how is that .        why shouldn   t i .     gremionis    voice was measurably more hostile .     if you   re not a roboticist      gremionis grimaced .     that   s stupid .  the institute  when it was designed some years ago  was intended to be a self contained community .  we have our own transport vehicle repairshops  our own personal robot maintenance shops  our own physicians  our own structuralists .  our personnel live here and  if they have use for a personnel artist  that   s santirix gremionis and i live here  too .    is there something wrong with my profession that i should not .        i haven   t said that .     gremionis turned away with a residual petulance that baley   s hasty disclaimer had not allayed .  he pressed a button  then  after studying a varicolored rectangular strip  did something that was remarkably like drumming his fingers briefly .  a sphere dropped gently from the ceiling and remained suspended a meter or so above their heads .  it opened as though it were an orange that was unsegmenting and a play of colors began within it  together with a soft wash of sound .  the two melted together so skillfully that baley  watching with astonishment  discovered that  after a short while  it was hard to distinguish one from the other .  the windows opacified and the segments grew brighter .     too bright .     asked gremionis .     no     said baley  after some hesitation .     it   s meant for background and i   ve picked a soothing combination that will make it easier for us to talk in a civilized way  you know .     then he said briskly     shall we get to the point .     baley withdrew his attention from the  whatever it was  gremionis had not given it a name   with some difficulty and said     if you please .  i would like to .        have you been accusing me of having anything to do with the immobilization of that robot jander .        i   ve been inquiring into the circumstances of the robot   s ending .     but you   ve mentioned me in connection with that ending .   in fact  just a little while ago  you asked me if i were a roboticist .  i know what you had in mind .  you were trying to get me to admit i knew something about robotics  so that you could build up a case against me as the  as the  ender of the robot .        you might say the killer .        the killer .  you can   t kill a robot .    in any case  i didn   t end it  or kill it  or anything you want to call it .  i told you  i   m not a roboticist .  i know nothing about robotics .  how can you even think that         i must investigate all connections  mr .  gremionis .  jander belonged to gladia  the solarian woman  and you were friendly with her .  that   s a connection .        there could be any number of people friendly with her .  that   s no connection .        are you willing to state that you never saw jander in all the times you may have been in gladia   s establishment .        never .  not once .        you never knew she had a humaniform robot .        no .        she never mentioned him .        she had robots all over the place .  all ordinary robots .  she said nothing about having anything else .     baley shrugged .     very well .  i have no reason  so far  to suppose that that is not the truth .        then say so to gladia .  that is why i wanted to see you .  to ask you to do that .  to insist .        has gladia any reason to think otherwise .        of course .  you poisoned her mind .  you questioned her about me in that connection and she assumed  she was made uncertain   the fact is  she called this morning and asked me if i had anything to do with it .  i told you that .        and you denied it .        of course i denied it and very strenuously  too  because i didn   t have anything to do with it .  but it   s not convincing if i do    the denying .  i want you to do it .  i want you to tell her that  in your opinion  i had nothing to do with the whole business .  you just said i didn   t and you can   t  without any evidence at all  destroy my reputation .  i can report you .        to whom .        to the committee on personal defense .  to the legislature .  the head of this institute is a close personal friend of the chairman himself and i   ve already sent a full report to him on this matter .  i   m not waiting  you understand .  i   m taking action .     gremionis shook his head with an attitude that might have been intended for fierceness but that did not entirely carry conviction  considering the mildness of his face .     look     he said     this isn   t earth .  we are protected here .  your planet  with its overpopulation  makes your people exist in so many beehives  so many anthills .  you push against each other  suffocate each other  and it doesn   t matter .  one life or a million lives  it doesn   t matter .     baley  fighting to keep contempt from showing in his voice  said     you   ve been reading historical novels .        of course i have  and they describe it as it is .  you can   t have billions of people on a single world without its being so .    on aurora  we are each a valuable life .  we are protected physically  each of us  by our robots  so that there is never an assault  let alone murder  on aurora .        except for jander .        that   s not murder  it   s only a robot .  and we are protected from the kinds of harm more subtle than assault by our legislature .  the committee on personal defense takes a dim view  a very dim view  of any action that unfairly damages the reputation or the social status of any individual citizen .  an auroran  acting as you did  would be in trouble enough .  as for an earth man  well      baley said     i am carrying on an investigation at the invitation  i presume  of the legislature .  i don   t suppose dr .  fastolfe could have brought me here without legislative permission .        maybe so  but that wouldn   t give you the right to overstep the limits of fair investigation .        are you going to put this up to the legislature  then .        i   m going to have the institute head         what is his name  by the way .        kelden amadiro .  i   m going to ask him to put it up to the legislature  and he   s in the legislature  you know  he   s one of the leaders of the globalist party .  so i think you had better make it plain to gladia that i am completely innocent .        i would like to  mr .  gremionis  because i suspect that you are innocent  but how can i change suspicion to certainty  unless you will allow me to ask you some questions .     gremionis hesitated .  then  with an air of defiance  he leaned back in his chair and placed his hands behind his neck  the picture of a man utterly failing to appear at ease .  he said     ask away .  i have nothing to hide .  and after you   re done  you   ll have to call gladia  right on that trimensional transmitter behind you and say your piece  or you will be in more trouble than you can imagine .        i understand .  but first   how long have you known dr .  vasilia fastolfe  mr .  gremionis .  or dr .  vasilia aliena  if you know her by that name .     gremionis hesitated  then said in a tense voice     why do you ask that .  what does that have to do with it .     baley sighed and his dour face seemed to sadden further .     i remind you   r .  gremionis  that you have nothing to hide and that you want to convince me of your innocence  so that i can convince gladia of the same .  just tell me how long you have known her .  if you have not known her  just say so  but before you do  it is only fair to tell you that dr .  vasilia has stated that you knew her well  well enough  at least  to offer yourself to her .     gremionis looked chagrined .  he said in a shaky voice     i don   t know why people have to make a big thing out of it .  an offer is a perfectly natural social interaction that concerns no one else .   of course  you   re an earthman  so you   d make a fuss about it .        i understand she didn   t accept your offer .     gremionis brought his hands down upon his lap  fists clenched .     accepting or rejecting is entirely up to her .  there   ve been people who   ve offered themselves to me and whom i   ve rejected .  it   s no large matter .        well  then .  how long have you known her .        for some years .  about fifteen .        did you know her when she was still living with dr .  fastolfe .        i was just a boy then     he said  flushing .     how did you get to know her .        when i finished my training as a personnel artist  i was called in to design a wardrobe for her .  it gave her pleasure and after that she used my services  in that respect  exclusively .        was it on her recommendation  then  that you received your present position as  might we say  official personnel artist for the members of the robotics institute .        she recognized my qualifications .  i was tested  along with others  and won the position on my merits .        but she did recommend you .     briefly and with annoyance  gremionis said     yes .        and you felt the only decent return you could make was to offer yourself to her .     gremionis grimaced and drew his tongue across his lips  as though tasting something unpleasant .     that  is  disgusting .  i suppose an earthman would think in such a way .  my offer meant only that it pleased me to do so .        because she is attractive and has a warm personality .     gremionis hesitated .     well  i wouldn   t say she has a warm personality     he said cautiously     but certainly she   s attractive .        i   ve been told that you offer yourself to everybody  without distinction .        that is a lie .        what is a lie .  that you offer yourself to everybody or that i have been told so .        that i offer myself to everybody .  who said that .        i don   t know that it would serve any purpose to answer that question .  would you expect me to quote you as a source of embarrassing information .  would you speak freely to me if you thought i would .        well  whoever said it is a liar .        perhaps it was merely dramatic exaggeration .  had you offered yourself to others before you offered yourself to dr .  vasilia .     gremionis looked away .     once or twice .  never seriously .        but dr .  vasilia was someone you were serious about .        well         it is my understanding you offered yourself to her repeatedly  which is quite against auroran custom .        oh  auroran custom      gremionis began furiously .  then he pressed his lips together firmly and his forehead furrowed .     see here  mr .  baley  can i speak to you confidentially .        yes .  all my questions are intended to satisfy myself that you had nothing to do with jander   s death .  once i am satisfied of that  you may be sure i   ll keep your remarks in confidence .        very well  then .  it   s nothing wrong  it   s nothing i   m ashamed of  you understand .  it   s just that i have a strong sense of privacy and i have a right to that if i wish  don   t i .        absolutely     said baley consolingly .     you see  i feel that social sex is best when there is a profound love and affection between partners .        i imagine that   s very true .        and then there   s no need for others  wouldn   t you say .        it sounds  plausible .        i   ve always dreamed of finding the perfect partner and never seeking anyone else .  they call it monogamy .  it doesn   t exist on aurora  but on some worlds it does  and they have it on earth don   t they  mr .  baley .        in theory  mr .  gremionis .        it   s what i want .  i   ve looked for it for years .  when i experimented with sex sometimes  i could tell something was missing .  then i met dr .  vasilia and she told me  well  people get confidential with their personnel artists because it   s very personal work  and this is the really confidential part         well  go on .     gremionis licked his ups .     if what i say now gets out  i   m ruined .  she   ll do her best to see to it that i get no further commissions .  are you sure this has something to do with the case .        i assure you with as much force as i can  mr .  gremionis  that this can be totally important .        well  then     gremionis did not look quite convinced     the fact is  that i gathered from what dr .  vasilia told me  in bits and pieces  that she is     his voice dropped to a whisper     a virgin .     i see     said baley quietly  remembering vasilia   s certainty that her father   s refusal had distorted her life and getting a firmer understanding of her hatred of her father  .     that excited me .  it seemed to me i could have her all to myself and i would be the only one that she would ever have .  i can   t explain how much that meant to me .  it made her look gloriously beautiful in my eyes and i just wanted her so much .        so you offered yourself to her .        yes .        repeatedly .  you weren   t discouraged by her refusals .        it just reinforced her virginity  so to speak  and made me more eager .  it was more exciting that it wasn   t easy .  i can   t explain and i don   t expect you to understand .        actually  mr .  gremionis  i do understand .    but there came a time when you stopped offering yourself to dr .  vasilia .        well  yes .        and began offering yourself to gladia .        well  yes .        repeatedly .        well  yes .        why .  why the change .     gremionis said     dr .  vasilia finally made it clear that there was no chance and then gladia came along and she looked like dr .  vasilia and  and  that was it .     baley said     but gladia is no virgin .  she was married on solaria and she experimented rather widely on aurora  i am told .        i knew about that  but she  stopped .  you see  she   s a solarian by birth  not an auroran  and she didn   t quite understand auroran customs .  but she stopped because she doesn   t like what she calls    promiscuity .        did she tell you that .        yes .  monogamy is the custom on solaria .  she wasn   t happily married  but it is still the custom she   s used to  so she never enjoyed the auroran way when she tried it  and monogamy is what i want  too .  do you see .        i see .  but how did you meet her in the first place .        i just met her .  she was on the hyperwave when she arrived in aurora  a romantic refugee from solaria .  and she played a part in that hyperwave drama         yes yes  but there was something else  wasn   t there .        i don   t know what else you want .        well  let me guess .  didn   t there come a point when dr .  vasilia said she was rejecting you forever  and didn   t she suggest an alternative to you .     gremionis  in sudden fury  shouted     did dr .  vasilia tell you that .        not in so many words  but i think i know what happened  even so .  did she not tell you that it might be advantageous if you looked up a new arrival on the planet  a young lady from solaria who was a ward or prot  g  e of dr .  fastolfe  who you know is dr .  vasilia   s father .  did dr .  vasilia perhaps not tell you that people thought this young lady  gladia  rather resembled herself  but that she was younger and had a warmer personality .  did dr .  vasilia not  in short  encourage your to transfer your attentions from herself to gladia .     gremionis was visibly suffering .  his eyes flicked to those of baley and away again .  it was the first time that baley saw in the eyes of any spacer a look of fright  or was it awe .   baley shook his head slightly .  he must not take too much satisfaction at having overawed a spacer .  it could damage his objectivity .   he said     well .  am i right or wrong .     and gremionis said in a low voice .     that hyperwave show was no exaggeration  then .    do you read minds .         .   baley said calmly     i just ask questions .    and you haven   t answered directly .  am i right or wrong .     gremionis said     it didn   t quite happen like that .  not just like that .  she did talk about gladia  but      he bit at his lower lip and then said     well  it amounted to what you said .  it was just about the way you described it .        and you were not disappointed .  you found that gladia did resemble dr .  vasilia .        in a way  she did .     gremionis    eyes brightened .     but not really .  stand them side by side and you   ll see the difference .  gladia has much greater delicacy and grace .  a greater spirit of  of fun .        have you offered yourself to vasilia since you met gladia .        are you mad .  of course not .        but you have offered yourself to gladia .        yes .        and she rejected you .        well  yes  but you have to understand that she has to be sure  as i would have to be .  think what a mistake i would have made if i had moved dr .  vasilia to accept me .  gladia doesn   t want to make that mistake and i don   t blame her .        but you don   t think it would be a mistake for her to accept you  so you have offered yourself again  and again  and again .     gremionis stared vacantly at baley for a moment and then seemed to shudder .  he thrust out his lower lip  as though he were a rebellious child .     you say it in an insulting way         i   m sorry .  i don   t mean it to be insulting .  please answer the question .        well  i have .        how many times have you offered yourself .        i haven   t counted .  four times .  well  five .  or maybe more .        and she has always rejected you .        yes .  or i wouldn   t have to offer again  would i .        did she reject you angrily .        oh no .  that   s not gladia .  very kindly .        has it made you offer yourself to anyone else .        what .        well  gladia has rejected you .  one way of responding would be to offer yourself to someone else .  why not .  if gladia doesn   t want you         no .  i don   t want anyone else .        why is that  do you suppose .     and  strenuously  gremionis said     how should i know why that is .  i want gladia .  it   s a  it   s a kind of madness  except that i think it   s the best kind of insanity .  i   d be mad not to have that kind of madness .    i don   t expect you to understand .        have you tried to explain this to gladia .  she might understand .        never .  i   d distress her .  i   d embarrass her .  you don   t talk about such things .  i should see a mentologist .        have you .        no .        why not .     gremionis frowned .     you have a way of asking the rudest questions  earthman .        perhaps because i   m an earthman .  i know no better .  but i   m also an investigator and i must know these things .  why have you not seen a mentologist .     surprisingly  gremionis laughed .     i told you .  the cure would be greater madness than the disease .  i would rather be with gladia and be rejected than be with anyone else and be accepted .    imagine having your mind out of whack and wanting it to stay out of whack .  any mentologist would put me in for major treatment .     baley thought awhile  then said     do you know whether dr .  vasilia is a mentologist in any way .        she   s a roboticist .  they say that   s the closest thing to it .  if you know how a robot works  you   ve got a hint as to how a human brain works .  or so they say .        does it occur to you that vasilia knows these strange feelings you have in connection with gladia .     gremionis stiffened .     i   ve never told her .    i mean in so many words .        isn   t it possible that she understands your feelings without having to ask .  is she aware that you have repeatedly offered yourself to gladia .        well   she would ask how i was getting along .  in the way of long standing acquaintanceship  you know .  i would say certain things .  nothing intimate .        are you sure that it was never anything intimate .  surely she encouraged you to continue to offer .        you know  now that you mention it  i seem to see it all in a new way .  i don   t see quite how you managed to put it into my head .  it   s the questions you ask  i suppose  but it seems to me now that she did continue to encourage my friendship with gladia .  she actively supported it .     he looked very uneasy .     this never occurred to me before .  i never really thought about it .        why do you think she encouraged you to make repeated offers to gladia .     gremionis twitched his eyebrows ruefully and his finger went to his mustache .     i suppose some might guess she was trying to get rid of me .  trying to make sure i wouldn   t want to bother her .     he made a small laughing sound .     that   s not very complimentary to me  is it .        did dr .  vasilia cease being friendly with you .        not at all .  she was more friendly  if anything .        did she try to tell you how to be more successful with gladia .  to show a greater interest in gladia   s work  for example .        she didn   t have to do that .  gladia   s work and mine are very similar .  i work with human beings and she with robots  but we   re both designers  artists   that does make for closeness  you know .  we even help each other at times .  when i   m not offering and being rejected  we   re good friends .    that   s a lot  when you come to think of it .        did dr .  vasilia suggest you show a greater interest in dr .  fastolfe   s work .        why should she suggest that .  i don   t know anything about dr .  fastolfe   s work .        gladia might be interested in her benefactor   s work and it might be a way for you to ingratiate yourself with her .     gremionis    eyes narrowed .  he rose with almost explosive force  walked to the other end of the room  came back  stood in front of baley  and said     now  you  look  here .  i   m not the biggest brain on the planet  not even the second biggest  but i   m not a blithering idiot .  i see what you   re getting at  you know .        oh .        all your questions have served to sort of wriggle me into saying that dr .  vasilia got me to fall in love   that   s it     he stopped in sudden surprise     i   m in love  like in the historical novels .     he thought about that with the light of wonder in his eyes .  then the anger returned .     that she got me to fall in love and to stay in love  so that i could find out things from dr .  fastolfe and learn how to immobilize that robot  jander .        you don   t think that   s so .        no  it   s not .     shouted gremionis .     i don   t know anything about robotics .  anything .  no matter how carefully anything about robotics were explained to me  i wouldn   t understand it .  and i don   t think gladia would either .  besides  i never asked anyone about robotics .  i was never told  by dr .  fastolfe or anyone  anything about robotics .  no one ever suggested i get involved with robotics .  dr .  vasilia never suggested it .  your whole rotten theory doesn   t work .     he shot his arms out to either side .     it doesn   t work .  forget it .     he sat back  folded his arms rigidly across his chest  and forced his lips together in a thin line  making his small mustache bristle .  baley looked up at the unsegmented orange  which was still humming its low  pleasantly varying tune and displaying a gentle change of color as it swayed hypnotically through a small  slow arc .  if gremionis    outburst had upset his line of attack  he showed no sign of it .  he said     i understand what you   re saying  but it   s still true that you see much of gladia  isn   t it .        yes  i do .        your repeated offers do not offend her  and her repeated rejections do not offend you .     gremionis shrugged .     my offers are polite .  her refusals are gentle .  why should we be offended .        but how do you spend time together .  sex is out  obviously  and you don   t talk robotics .  what do you do .        is that all there is to companionship  sex and robotics .  we do a great deal together .  we talk  for one thing .  she is very curious about aurora and i spend hours describing the planet .  she   s seen very little of it  you know .  and she spends hours telling me about solaria and what a hellhole it is .  i   d rather live on earth   no offense intended .  and there   s her dead husband .  what a miserable character he was .  gladia   s had a hard life  poor woman .     we go to concerts  i took her to the art institute a few times  and we work together .  i told you that .  we go over my designs   or her designs  together .  to be perfectly honest  i don   t see that working on robots is very rewarding  but we all have our own notions  you know .  for that matter  she seemed to be amused when i explained why it was so important to cut hair correctly   her own hair isn   t quite right  you know .  but mostly  we go for walks .        walks .  where .        nowhere particularly .  just walks .  that is her habit  because of the way she was brought up on solaria .  have you ever been on solaria .    yes  you have been  of course .  i   m sorry .    on solaria  there are these huge estates with only one or two human beings on them  just robots otherwise .  you can walk for miles and be completely alone and gladia says that it makes you feel as though you owned the entire planet .  the robots are always there  of course  keeping an eye on you and taking care of you  but  of course  they keep out of sight .  gladia misses that feeling of world ownership here on aurora .        do you mean that she wants world ownership .        you mean a kind of lust for power .  gladia .  that   s crazy .  all she means is that she misses the feeling of being alone with nature .  i don   t see it myself  you understand  but i like humoring her .  of course  you can   t quite get the solarian feeling in aurora .  there are bound to be people about  especially in the eos metropolitan area  and robots haven   t been programmed to keep out of sight .  in fact  aurorans generally walk with robots .    still  i know some routes that are pleasant and not very crowded and gladia enjoys them .        do you enjoy them  too .        well  only because i would be with gladia .  aurorans are walkers  too  by and large  but i must admit i   m not .  i had protesting muscles at first and vasilia laughed at me .        she knew you went on walks  did she .        well  i came in limping one day and creaking at the thighs  so i had to explain .  she laughed and said it was a good idea and the best way to get a walker to accept an offer was to walk with them .     keep it up     she said     and she   ll cancel her rejection before you get a chance to offer again .  she   ll make the offer herself .     as it happened  gladia didn   t  but eventually i grew to like the walks very much  just the same .     he seemed to have gotten over his flash of anger and was now very much at his ease .  he might have been thinking of the walks  baley thought  for there was a half smile on his face .  he looked rather likable  and vulnerable  with his mind back on who knew what conversational passage on a walk that had taken them who knew where .  baley almost smiled in response .     vasilia knew  then  that you continued the walks .        i suppose so .  i began to take wednesdays and saturdays off because that fit in with gladia   s schedule choice  and vasilia would sometimes joke about my    ws walks    when i brought in some sketches .        did dr .  vasilia ever join the walks .        certainly not .     baley shifted in his seat and stared intently at his fingertips as he said     i presume you had robots accompanying you on your walks .        absolutely .  one of mine  one of hers .  they kept rather out of the way  though .  they didn   t tag along in what gladia called aurora fashion .  she wanted solarian solitude  she said .  so i obliged  though at first i got a crick in my neck looking around to see if brundij was with me .        and which robot accompanied gladia .        it wasn   t always the same one .  whichever he was  he held off  too .  i didn   t get to talk to him .        what about jander .     some of the sunniness left gremionis    expression at once .     what about him .     he asked .     did he ever come along .  if he did  you would know  wouldn   t you .        a humaniform robot .  i certainly would .  and he did not accompany us  not ever .        are you certain .        completely certain .     gremionis scowled .     i imagine she thought him far too valuable to waste on duties any ordinary robot could perform .        you seem annoyed .  did you think so  too .        he was her robot .  i didn   t worry about it .        and you never saw him when you were at gladia   s establishment .        never .        did she ever say anything about him .  discuss him .        not that i recall .        didn   t you consider that strange .     gremionis shook his head .     no .  why talk about robots .     baley   s somber eyes fixed on the other   s face .     did you have any idea of the relationship between gladia and jander .     gremionis said     are you going to tell me that there was sex between them .     baley said     would you be surprised if i did .     gremionis said stolidly     it happens .  it   s not unusual .  you can use a robot sometimes  if you feel like it .  and a humaniform robot  completely humaniform  i believe         completely     said baley with an appropriate gesture .  gremionis    lips curved downward .     well  then  it would be hard for a woman to resist .        she resisted you .  doesn   t it bother you that gladia would prefer a robot to you .        well  if it comes to that  i   m not sure that i believe this is true  but if it is  it   s nothing to worry about .  a robot is just a robot .  a woman and a robot  or a man and a robot  it   s just masturbation .        you honestly never knew of the relationship  mr .  gremionis .  you never suspected .        i never gave it any thought     insisted gremionis .     didn   t know .  or did know  but paid it no mind .     gremionis scowled .     you   re pushing again .  what do you want me to say .  now that you put it into my head and push  it seems to me  if i look back  that maybe i was wondering about something like that .  just the same  i never felt anything was happening before you started asking questions .        are you sure .        yes  i   m sure .  don   t badger me .        i   m not badgering you .  i   m just wondering if it were possible that you did know that gladia was regularly engaging in sex with jander  that you knew that you would never be accepted as her lover as long as that was so  that you wanted her so much that you would stop at nothing to eliminate jander  that  in short  you were so jealous that you      and at that moment  gremionis  as though some tightly coiled spring  held back with difficulty for some minutes  had suddenly twitched loose  hurled himself at baley with a loud and incoherent cry .  baley  taken completely by surprise  pushed backward instinctively and his chair went over .      .   there were strong arms upon him at once .  baley felt himself lifted  the chair righted  and was aware that he was in the grip of a robot .  how easy it was to forget they were in the room when they stood silent and motionless in their niches .  it was neither daneel nor giskard who had come to his rescue  however .  it was gremionis    robot  brundij .     sir     said brundij  his voice just a bit unnatural     i hope you are not hurt .     where were daneel and giskard .  the question answered itself at once .  the robots had divided the labor neatly and quickly .  daneel and giskard  estimating instantly that an overturned chair offered less chance of harm to daley than a maddened gremionis  had launched themselves at the host .  brundij  seeing at once that he was not needed in that direction  saw to the welfare of the guest .  gremionis  still standing  his breath heaving  was completely immobilized in the careful double grasp of baley   s robots .  gremionis said  in very little above a whisper     release me .  i am in control of myself .        yes  sir     said giskard .     of course  mr .  gremionis     said daneel with what was almost suavity .  but although their arms released their hold  neither moved back for a period of time .  gremionis looked right and left  adjusted the smoothness of his clothing  and then  deliberately  sat down .  his breathing was still rapid and his hair was  to a small extent  in disarray .  baley now stood  one hand on the back of the chair on which he had been sitting .  gremionis said     i am sorry  mr .  baley  for losing control .  it is something i have not done in my adult life .  you accused me of being j jealous .  it is a word no respectable auroran would use of another  but i should have remembered you are an earthman .  it is a word we encounter only in historical romances and even then the word is usually spelled with a    j     followed by a dash .  of course  that is not so on your world .  i understand that .        i am sorry  too  mr .  gremionis     said baley gravely     that my forgetfulness of auroran custom led me astray in this instance .  i assure you that such a lapse will not happen again .     he seated himself and said     i don   t know that there is much more to discuss      gremionis did not seem to be listening .     when i was a child     he said     i would sometimes push against another  and be pushed  and it would be awhile before the robots would take the trouble to separate us  of course      daneel said     if i may explain  partner elijah .  it has been well established that total suppression of aggression in the very young has undesirable consequences .  a certain amount of youthful play involving physical competition is permitted  even encouraged  provided no real hurt is involved .  robots in charge of the young are carefully programmed to be able to distinguish the chances and level of harm that may take place .  i  for instance  am not properly programmed in this respect and would not qualify as a guardian of the young except under emergency conditions for brief periods .    nor would giskard .     baley said     such aggressive behavior is stopped during adolescence  i suppose .        gradually     said daneel     as the level of harm that may be inflicted increases and as the desirability of self control becomes more pronounced .     gremionis said     by the time i was ready for higher schooling  i  like all aurorans  knew quite well that all competition rested on the comparison of mental capacity and talent         no physical competition .     said baley .     certainly  but only in fashions that do not involve deliberate physical contact with intent to injure .        but since you   ve been an adolescent         i   ve attacked no one .  of course i haven   t .  i   ve had the urge to do so on a number of occasions  to be sure .  i suppose i wouldn   t be entirely normal if i hadn   t  but until this moment  i   ve been able to control it .  but then  no one ever called me  that before .     baley said     it would do no good to attack  in any case  if you are going to be stopped by robots  would it .  i presume there is always a robot within reach on both sides of both the attacker and the attacked .        certainly .    all the more reason for me to be ashamed of having lost my self control .  i trust that this won   t have to go into your report .        i assure you i will tell no one of this .  it has nothing to do with the case .        thank you .  did you say that the interview is over .        i think it is .        in that case  will you do as i have asked you to do .        what is that .        to tell gladia i had nothing to do with jander   s immobilization .     baley hesitated .     i will tell her that that is my opinion .     gremionis said     please make it stronger than that .  i want her to be absolutely certain that i had nothing to do with it  all the more so if she was fond of the robot from a sexual standpoint .  i couldn   t bear to have her think i was j j   being a solarian  she might think that .        yes  she might     said baley thoughtfully .     but look     said gremionis  speaking quickly and earnestly .     i don   t know anything about robots and no one  dr .  vasilia or anyone else  has told me anything about them  how they work  i mean .  there is just no way in which i could have destroyed jander .     baley seemed  for a moment  to be deep in thought .  then he said  with clear reluctance     i can   t help but believe you .  to be sure  i don   t know everything .  and it is possible  i say this without meaning offense  that either you or dr .  vasilia  or both  are lying .  i know surprisingly little about the intimate nature of auroran society and i can perhaps be easily fooled .  and yet  i can   t help but believe you .  nevertheless  i can   t do more than tell gladia that  in my opinion  you are completely innocent .  i must say    in my opinion     however .  i am sure she will find that strong enough .     gremionis said gloomily     then i will have to be satisfied with that .    if it will help  though  i assure you  on the word of an auroran citizen  that i am innocent .     baley smiled slightly .     i wouldn   t dream of doubting your word  but my training forces me to rely on objective evidence alone .     he stood up  stared solemnly at gremionis for a moment  then said     what i am about to say should not be taken amiss  mr .  gremionis .  i take it that you are interested in having me give gladia this reassurance because you want to retain her friendship .        i want that very much  mr .  baley .        and you intend  on some suitable occasion  to offer yourself again .     gremionis flushed  swallowed visibly  then said     yes  i do .        may i then give you a word of advice  sir .  don   t do it .        you may keep your advice  if that   s what you   re going to tell me .  i don   t intend ever to give up .        i mean do not go through the usual formal procedure .  you might consider simply     baley looked away  feeling unaccountably embarrassed     putting your arms around her and kissing her .        no     said gremionis earnestly .     please .  an auroran woman would not endure that .  nor an auroran man .        mr .  gremionis  won   t you remember that gladia is not auroran .  she is solarian and has other customs  other traditions .  i would try it if i were you .     baley   s level gaze masked a sudden internal fury .  what was gremionis to him that he should give such advice .  why tell another to do that which he himself longed to do .      amadiro     .   baley got back to business  with a somewhat deeper baritone to his voice than was usual .  he said     mr .  gremionis  you mentioned the name of the head of the robotics institute earlier .  could you give me that name again .        kelden amadiro .        and would there be some way of reaching him from here .     gremionis said     well  yes and no .  you can reach his receptionist or his assistant .  i doubt that you   ll reach him .  he   s a rather standoffish person  i   m told .  i don   t know him personally  of course .  i   ve seen him now and then  but i   ve never talked to him .        i take it  then  he doesn   t use you as a clothes designer or for personal grooming .        i don   t know that he uses anyone and  from the few occasions when i   ve seen him  i can tell you he looks it  though i   d rather you didn   t repeat that remark .        i   m sure you   re right  but i   ll keep the confidence     said baley gravely .     i would like to try to reach him  despite his standoffish reputation .  if you have a trimensic outlet  would you mind my making use of it for that purpose .        brundij can make the call for you .        no  i think my partner  daneel  should  that is  if you don   t mind .        i don   t mind at all     said gremionis .     the outlet is in there  so just follow me  daneel .  the pattern you must use is       up    .     daneel bowed his head .     thank you  sir .     the room with the trimensic outlet was quite empty  except for a thin pillar toward one side of the room .  it ended waist high in a flat surface on which there was a rather complicated console .  the pillar stood in the center of a circle marked off on the light green floor in a neutral gray .  near it was an identical circle in size and color  but on the second one there stood no pillar .  daneel stepped to the pillar and  as he did so  the circle on which it stood glowed with a faint white radiance .  his hand moved over the console  his fingers flicking too quickly for baley to make out clearly what it was they did .  it only took a second and then the other circle glowed in precisely the same way .  a robot appeared on it  three dimensional in appearance but with a very faint flicker that gave away the fact that it was a holographic image .  next to him was a console like that next to which daneel stood  but the robot   s console also flickered and was also an image .  daneel said     i am r .  daneel olivaw     he faintly emphasized the    r .     so the robot would not mistake him for a human being     and i represent my partner  elijah baley  a plainclothesman from earth .  my partner would like to speak with master roboticist kelden amadiro .     the robot said     master roboticist amadiro is in conference .  would it be sufficient to speak to roboticist cicis .     daneel looked quickly in baley   s direction .  baley nodded and daneel said     that will be quite satisfactory .     the robot said     if you will ask plainclothesman baley to take your place  i will try to locate roboticist cicis .     daneel said smoothly     it would perhaps be better if you were first to      but baley called out     it   s all right  daneel .  i don   t mind waiting .  daneel said     partner elijah  as the personal representative of master roboticist han fastolfe  you have assimilated his social status  at least temporarily .  it is not your place to have to wait for         it   s all right  daneel     said baley  with enough emphasis to preclude further discussion .     i don   t wish to create delay by a dispute over social etiquette .     daneel stepped off the circle and baley stepped on .  he felt a slight tingle as he did so  perhaps a purely imaginary one   but it quickly passed .  the robot   s image  standing on the other circle  faded and disappeared .  baley waited patiently and eventually another image darkened and took on apparent three dimensionality .     roboticist maloon cicis here     said the figure in a rather sharp  clear voice .  he had the close cut bronze hair that alone sufficed to give him what baley thought of as a typical spacer look  though there was a certain un spacerlike asymmetry to the line of his nose .  baley said quietly     i am plainclothesman elijah baley from earth .  i would like to speak with master roboticist kelden amadiro .        do you have an appointment  plainclothesman .        no  sir .        you will have to make one if you wish to see him  and there   s no time slot available for this week or next .        i am plainclothesman elijah baley of earth         so i have been given to understand .  it doesn   t alter the facts .     baley said     at the request of dr .  han fastolfe and with the permission of the world legislature of aurora  i am investigating the murder of robot jander panell         the murder of robot jander panell .     asked cicis so politely as to indicate contempt .     roboticide  if you prefer  then .  on earth  the destruction of a robot would not be so great a matter  but on aurora  where robots are treated more or less as human beings  it seemed to me that the word    murder    might be used .     cicis said     nevertheless  whether murder  roboticide  or nothing at all  it is still impossible to see master roboticist amadiro .        may i leave a message for him .        you may .        will it be delivered to him instantly .  now .        i can try  but obviously i can make no guarantee .        good enough .  i will make several points and i will number them .  perhaps you would like to make notes .     cicis smiled faintly .     i think i will be able to remember .        first  where there is a murder  there is a murderer  and i would like to give dr .  amadiro a chance to speak in his own defense         what .     said cicis .   and gremionis  watching from the other side of the room  let his jaw drop .   baley managed to imitate the faint smile that had suddenly disappeared from the other   s lips .     am i too fast for you  sir .  would you like to make notes after all .        are you accusing the master roboticist of having had anything to do with this jander panell business .        on the contrary  roboticist .  it is because i don   t want to accuse him that i must see him .  i would hate to imply any connection between the master roboticist and the immobilized robot on the basis of incomplete information  when a word from him might make everything clear .        you are mad .        very well .  then tell the master roboticist that a madman wants a word with him in order to avoid accusing him of murder .  that   s my first point .  i have a second .  could you tell him that the same madman has just completed a detailed interrogation of personnel artist santirix gremionis and is calling from gremionis    establishment .  and the third point  am i going too fast for you .        no .  finish .        the third point is this .  it may be that the master roboticist  who surely has a great deal on his mind that is of much moment  does not remember who personnel artist santirix gremionis is .  in that case  please identify him as someone living on the institute grounds who has  in the last year  taken many long walks with gladia  a woman from solaria who now lives on aurora .        i cannot deliver a message so ridiculous and offensive  earthman .        in that case  would you tell him i will go straight to the legislature and i will announce that i cannot continue with my investigation because one maloon cicis takes it upon himself to assure me that master roboticist kelden amadiro will not assist me in the investigation of the destruction of robot jander panell and will not defend himself against accusations of being responsible for that destruction .     cicis reddened .     you wouldn   t dare say anything of the sort .        wouldn   t i .  what would i have to lose .  on the other hand  how will it sound to the general public .  after all  aurorans are perfectly aware that dr .  amadiro is second only to dr .  fastolfe himself in expertise in robotics and that  if fastolfe himself is not responsible for the roboticide   is it necessary to continue .        you will find  earthman  that the laws of aurora against slander are strict .        undoubtedly  but if dr .  amadiro is effectively slandered  his punishment is likely to be greater than mine .  but why don   t you simply deliver my message now .  then  if he explains just a few minor points  we can avoid all question of slander or accusation or anything of the sort .     cicis scowled and said stiffly     i will tell dr .  amadiro this and i will strongly advise him to refuse to see you .     he disappeared .  again  baley waited patiently  while gremionis gestured fiercely and said in a loud whisper     you can   t do that  baley .  you can   t do it .     baley waved him quiet .  after some five minutes  it seemed much longer to baley   cicis reappeared  looking enormously angry .  he said     dr .  amadiro will take my place here in a few minutes and will talk to you .  wait .     and baley said at once     there is no point in waiting .  i will come directly to dr .  amadiro   s office and i will see him there .     he stepped off the gray circle and made a cutting gesture to daneel  who promptly broke the connection .  gremionis said  with a kind of strangled gasp     you can   t talk to dr .  amadiro   s people that way  earthman .        i just have     said baley .     he   ll have you thrown off the planet within twelve hours .        if i don   t make progress in straightening out this mess  i may in any case be thrown off the planet within twelve hours .     daneel said     partner elijah  i fear that mr .  gremionis is justified in his alarm .  the auroran world legislature cannot do more than evict you  since you are not an auroran citizen .  nevertheless  they can insist that the earth authorities punish you severely and earth will do so .  they could not resist an auroran demand  in this case .  i would not wish you to be punished in this way  partner elijah .     baley said heavily     nor do i wish the punishment  daneel  but i must take the chance .    mr .  gremionis  i am sorry that i had to tell him i was calling from your establishment .  i had to do something to persuade him to see me and i felt he might attach importance to that fact .  what i said was  after all  the truth .     gremionis shook his head .     if i had known what you were going to do  mr .  baley  i would not have permitted you to call from my establishment .  i feel sure that i   m going to lose my position here and     with bitterness     what are you going to do for me that will make up for that .        i will do my best  mr .  gremionis  to see that you do not lose your position .  i feel confident that you will be in no trouble .  if i fail  however  you are free to describe me as a madman who made wild accusations against you and frightened you with threats of slander  so that you had to let me use your viewer .  i   m sure dr .  amadiro will believe you .  after all  you have already sent him a memo complaining that i have been slandering you  have you not .     baley lifted his hand in farewell .     good bye  mr .  gremionis .  thank you again .  don   t worry and  remember what i said about gladia .     with daneel and giskard sandwiching him fore and aft  baley stepped out of gremionis    establishment  scarcely conscious of the fact that he was moving out into the open once more .      .   once out in the open  it was a different matter .  baley stopped and looked up .     odd     he said .     i didn   t think that that much time had passed  even allowing for the fact that the auroran day is a little shorter than standard .        what is it  partner elijah .     asked daneel solicitously .     the sun has set .  i wouldn   t have thought it .        the sun has not yet set  sir     put in giskard .     it is about two hours before sunset .     daneel said     it is the gathering storm  partner elijah .  the clouds are thickening  but the storm will not actually break for some time yet .     baley shivered .  dark  in itself  did not disturb him .  in fact  when outside  night  with its suggestion of enclosing walls  was far more soothing than the day  which broadened the horizons and opened space in every direction .  the trouble was that this was neither day nor night .  again  he tried to remember what it had been like that time it had rained when he had been outside .  it suddenly occurred to him that he had never been out when it snowed and that he wasn   t even sure what the rain of crystalline solid water was like .  descriptions in words were surely insufficient .  the younger ones sometimes went out to go sliding or sledding  or whatever  and returned shrieking with excitement  but always glad to get within the city walls .  ben had once tried to make a pair of skis  according to directions in some ancient book or other  and had gotten himself half buried in a drift of the white stuff .  and even ben   s descriptions of what it was like to see and feel snow were distressingly vague and unsatisfying .  then  too  no one went out when it was actually snowing  as opposed to having the material merely lying about on the ground .  baley told himself  at this point  that the one thing everyone agreed on was that it only snowed when it was very cold .  it was not very cold now  it was merely cool .  those clouds did not mean it was going to snow .    somehow  he felt only minimally consoled .  this was not like the cloudy days on earth  which he had seen .  on earth  the clouds were lighter  he was sure of that .  they were grayish white  even when they covered the sky solidly .  here  the light  what there was of it  was rather bilious  a ghastly yellowish slate .  was that because aurora   s sun was more orange than earth   s was .  he said     is the color of the sky  unusual .     daneel looked up at the sky .     no  partner elijah .  it is a storm .        do you often have storms like this .        at this time of year  yes .  occasional thunderstorms .  this is no surprise .  it was predicted in the weather forecast yesterday and again this morning .  it will be over well before daybreak and the fields can use the water .  we   ve been a bit subnormal in rainfall lately .        and it gets this cold  too .  is that normal  too .        oh yes .    but let us get into the airfoil  partner elijah .  it can be heated .     baley nodded and walked toward the airfoil  which lay on the grassy plot where it had been brought to rest before lunch .  he paused .     wait .  i did not ask gremionis for directions to amadiro   s establishment  or office .        no need  partner elijah     said daneel immediately  his hand in the crook of baley   s elbow  propelling him gently but unmistakably onward .     friend giskard has the map of the institute clearly in his memory banks and he will take us to the administration building .  it is very likely that dr .  amadiro has his office there .     giskard said     my information is to the effect that dr .  amadiro   s office is in the administration building .  if  by some chance  he is not at his office but is in his establishment  that is nearby .     again  baley found himself crammed into the front seat between the two robots .  he welcomed daneel particularly  with his humanlike body warmth .  although giskard   s textilelike outermost layer was insulating and not as cold to the touch as bare metal would have been  he was the less attractive of the two in baley   s current chilly state .  baley caught himself on the verge of putting an arm around daneel   s shoulder  with the intention of finding comfort by drawing him even closer .  he brought his arm down to his lap in confusion .  he said     i don   t like the way it looks out there .     daneel  perhaps in an effort to take baley   s    mind off the appearance outside  said     partner elijah  how is it you knew that dr .  vasilia had encouraged mr .  gremionis    interest in miss gladia .  i did not see that you had received any evidence to that effect .        i didn   t     said baley .     i   ve been desperate enough to play long shots  that is  to gamble on events of low probability .  gladia told me that gremionis was the one person sufficiently interested in her to offer himself repeatedly .  i thought he might have killed jander out of jealousy .  i didn   t think he could possibly know enough about robotics to do it  but then i heard that fastolfe   s daughter vasilia was a roboticist and resembled gladia physically .  i wondered if gremionis  having been fascinated by gladia  might not have been fascinated by vasilia earlier   and if the killing might possibly have been the result of a conspiracy between the two .  it was by hinting obscurely at the existence of such a conspiracy that i was able to persuade vasilia to see me .     daneel said     but there was no conspiracy  partner elijah  at least as far as the destruction of jander was concerned .  vasilia and gremionis could not have engineered that destruction  even if they had worked together .        granted  and yet vasilia had been made nervous by the suggestion of having had a connection with gremionis .  why .  when gremionis told us of having been attracted to vasilia first  and then to gladia  i wondered if the connection between the two had been more indirect  if vasilia might have encouraged the transfer for some reason more distantly connected  but connected nevertheless  to jander   s death .  after all  there had to be some connection between the two  vasilia   s reaction to the original suggestion showed that .     my suspicion was correct .  vasilia had engineered gremionis    switch from one woman to the other .  gremionis was astonished at my knowing this and that  too  was useful  for if the matter were something completely innocent  there would have been no reason to make a secret of it  and a secret it obviously was .  you remember that vasilia mentioned nothing of urging gremionis to turn to gladia .  when i told her that gremionis had offered himself to gladia  she acted as though that was the first time she had heard of it .        but  partner elijah  of what importance is this .        we may find out .  it seemed to me that there was no importance in it to either gremionis or vasilia .  therefore  if it had any importance at all  it might be that a third person was involved .  if it had anything to do with the jander affair  then it ought to be a roboticist still more skillful than vasilia  and that might be amadiro .  so i hinted to him of the existence of a conspiracy by deliberately pointing out i had been questioning gremionis and was calling from his establishment  and that worked  too .        yet i still don   t know what it all means  partner elijah .        nor i  except for some speculations .  but perhaps we   ll find out at amadiro   s .  our situation is so bad  you see  we have nothing to lose by guessing and gambling .     during this exchange  the airfoil has risen on its air jets  and had moved to a moderate height .  it cleared a line of bushes and was now once again speeding along over grassy areas and graveled roads .  baley noticed that  where the grass was taller  it was swept to one side by the wind as though an invisible  and much larger  airfoil were passing over it .  baley said     giskard  you have been recording the conversations which have taken place in your presence  haven   t you .        yes  sir .        and can reproduce them at need .        yes  sir .        and can easily locate  and reproduce  some particular statement made by some given person .        yes  sir .  you would not have to listen to the entire recording .        and could you  at need  serve as a witness in a courtroom .        i  sir .  no  sir .     giskard   s eyes were fixed firmly on the road .     since a robot can be directed to lie by a skillful enough command and not all the exhortations or threats of a judge might help  the law wisely considers a robot an incompetent witness .        but  in that case  of what use are your recordings .        that  sir  is a different thing .  a recording  once made  cannot be altered on simple command  though it might be erased .  such a recording can  therefore  be admitted as evidence .  there are no firm precedents  however  and whether it is  or is not  admitted depends on the individual case and on the individual judge .     baley could not tell whether that statement was depressing in itself or whether he was influenced by the unpleasant livid light that bathed the landscape .  he said     can you see well enough to drive  giskard .        certainly  sir  but i do not need to .  the airfoil is equipped with a computerized radar that would enable it to avoid obstacles on its own  even if i were  unaccountably  to fail in my task .  it was this that was in operation yesterday morning when we traveled comfortably though all the windows were opacified .        partner elijah     said daneel  again veering the conversation away from baley   s uncomfortable awareness of the coming storm     do you have hope that dr .  amadiro might indeed be helpful .     giskard brought the airfoil to rest on a wide lawn before a broad but not very high building  with an intricately carved fa  ade that was clearly new and yet gave the impression of imitating something quite old .  baley knew it was the administration building without being told .  he said     no  daneel  i suspect that amadiro may be far too intelligent to give us the least handle to grasp him by .        and if that is so  what do you plan to do next .        i don   t know     said baley  with a grim feeling of d  j   vu     but i   ll try to think of something .         .   when baley entered the administration building  his first feeling was one of relief at removing himself from the unnatural lighting outside .  the second was one of wry amusement .  here on aurora  the establishments  the private dwelling places  were all strictly auroran .  he couldn   t  for a moment  while sitting in gladia   s living room  or breakfasting in fastolfe   s dining room  or talking in vasilia   s work room  or making use of gremionis    trimensional viewing device  have thought himself on earth .  all four were distinct from each other  but all fell within a certain genus  widely different from that of the underground apartments on earth .  the administration building  however  breathed officialdom and that  apparently  transcended ordinary human variety .  it did not belong to the same genus as the dwelling places on aurora  any more than an official building in baley   s home city resembled an apartment in the dwelling sectors  but the two official buildings on the two worlds of such widely different natures strangely resembled each other .  this was the first place on aurora where  for an instant  baley might have imagined himself on earth .  here were the same long cold bare corridors  the same lowest common denominator of design and decoration  with every light source designed so as to irritate as few people as possible and to please just as few .  there were some touches here that would have been absent on earth  the occasional suspended pots of plants  for instance  flourishing in the light and outfitted with devices  baley guessed  for controlled and automatic watering .  that natural touch was absent on earth and its presence did not delight him .  might such pots not sometimes fall .  might they not attract insects .  might not the water drip .  there were some things missing here  too .  on earth  when one was within a city  there was always the vast  warm hum of people and machinery  even in the most coldly official of administrative structures .  it was the    busy buzz of brotherhood     to use the phrase popular among earth   s politicians and journalists .  here  on the other hand  it was quiet .  baley had not particularly noticed the quiet in the establishments he had visited that day and the day before  since everything had seemed so unnatural there that one more oddity escaped his notice .  indeed  he had been more aware of the soft susurration of insect life outside or of the wind through the vegetation than of the absence of the steady    hum of humanity     another popular phrase  .  here  however  where there seemed a touch of earth  the absence of the    hum    was as disconcerting as was the distinct orange touch to the artificial light  which was far more noticeable against the blank off white of the walls here than among the busy decoration that marked the auroran establishments .  baley   s reverie did not last long .  they were standing just inside the main entrance and daneel had held out his arm to stop the other two .  some thirty seconds passed before baley  speaking in an automatic whisper in view of the silence everywhere  said     why are we waiting .        because it is advisable to do so  partner elijah     said daneel .     there is a tingle field ahead .        a what .        a tingle field  partner elijah .  actually  the name is a euphemism .  it stimulates the nerve endings and produces a rather sharp pain .  robots can pass  but human beings cannot .  any breach  of course  whether by human or robot  will set off an alarm .     baley said     how can you tell there   s a tingle field .        it can be seen  partner elijah  if you know what to look for .  the air seems to twinkle a bit and the wall beyond that region has a faint greenish tinge as compared to the wall in front of it .        i   m not at all sure i see it     said baley indignantly .     what   s to prevent me  or any innocent outsider  from walking into it and experiencing agony .     daneel said     those who are members of the institute carry a neutralizing device  those who are visitors are almost always attended by one or more robots who will surely detect the tingle field .     a robot was approaching down the corridor on the other side of the field .   the twinkling of the field was more easily noted against the muted smoothness of his metallic surface .   he seemed to ignore giskard  but  for a moment  he hesitated as he looked from baley to daneel and back .  and then  having made a decision  he addressed baley .   perhaps  thought baley  daneel looks too human to be human .   the robot said     your name  sir .     baley said     i am plainclothesman elijah baley from earth .  i am accompanied by two robots of the establishment of dr .  han fastolfe  daneel olivaw and giskard reventlov .        identification  sir .     giskard   s serial number flared out in soft phosphorescence on the left side of his chest .     i vouch for the other two  friend     he said .  the robot studied the number a moment  as though comparing it with a file in his memory banks .  then he nodded and said     serial number accepted .  you may pass .     daneel and giskard moved forward at once  but baley found himself edging ahead slowly .  he put out one arm as a way of testing the coming of pain .  daneel said     the field is gone  partner elijah .  it will be restored after we have passed through .     better safe than sorry  thought baley  and continued his shuffle till he was well past the point where the barrier of the field might have existed .  the robots  showing no sign of impatience or condemnation  waited for baley   s reluctant steps to catch up with them .  they then stepped onto a helical ramp that was only two people wide .  the robot was first  by himself  baley and daneel stood side by side behind him  daneel   s hand rested lightly  but almost possessively  on baley   s elbow   and giskard brought up the rear .  baley was conscious of his shoes pointing upward just a bit uncomfortably and felt vaguely that it would be a little tiresome mounting this too steep ramp and having to lean forward in order to avoid a clumsy slip .  either the soles of his shoes or the surface of the ramp  or both  ought to be ridged .  in fact  neither was .  the robot in the lead said     mr .  baley     as though warning of something  and the robot   s hand then visibly tightened on the railing that it held .  at once  the ramp divided into sections that slid against each other to form steps .  immediately thereafter  the whole ramp began to move upward .  it made a complete turn  passing up through the ceiling  a section of which had retracted  and  when it came to a halt  they were on what was  presumably  the second floor .  the steps disappeared and the four stepped off .  baley looked back curiously .     i suppose it will service those who want to go down as well  but what if there is a period where more people want to go up than down .  it would end up sticking half a kilometer into the sky  or into the ground  in reverse .        that is an up helix     said daneel in a low voice .     there are separate down helices .        but it has to get down again  doesn   t it .        it collapses at the top  or the bottom  depending on which we   re speaking of  partner elijah  and  in periods of nonuse  it unwinds  so to speak .  this up helix is descending now .     baley looked back .  the smooth surface might be sliding downward  but it showed no irregularity or mark whose motion he could notice .     and if someone should want to use it when it has moved up as far as it can .        then one must wait for the unwinding  which would take less than a minute .    there are ordinary flights of stairs as well  partner elijah  and most aurorans are not reluctant to use them .  robots almost always use the stairs .  since you are a visitor  you are being offered the courtesy of the helix .     they were walking down a corridor again  toward a door more ornate than the others .     they are offering me courtesy  then     said baley .     a hopeful sign .     it was perhaps another hopeful sign that an auroran now appeared in the ornate doorway .  he was tall  at least eight centimeters taller than daneel  who was some five centimeters taller than baley .  the man in the doorway was broad as well  somewhat heavyset  with a round face  a somewhat bulbous nose  curly dark hair  a swarthy complexion  and a smile .  it was the smile that was most noticeable .  wide and apparently unforced  it revealed prominent teeth that were white and well shaped .  he said     ah  it is mr .  baley  the famous investigator from earth  who has come to our little planet to show that i am a dreadful villain .  come in  come in .  you are welcome .  i am sorry if my able aide  roboticist maloon cicis  gave you the impression that i would be unavailable  but he is a cautious fellow and is a great deal more concerned about my time than i myself am .  he stepped to one side as baley walked in and tapped him lightly with the fiat of his hand on the shoulder blade as he passed .  it seemed to be a gesture of friendship of a kind that baley had not yet experienced on aurora .  baley said  cautiously  was he assuming too much .       i take it you are master roboticist kelden amadiro .        exactly .  exactly .  the man who intends to destroy dr .  han fastolfe as a political force upon this planet  but that  as i hope to persuade you  does not really make me a villain .  after all  i am not trying to prove that it is fastolfe who is a villain simply because of the foolish vandalism he committed on the structure of his own creation  poor jander .  let us say only that i will demonstrate that fastolfe is  mistaken .     he gestured lightly and the robot who had guided them in stepped forward and into a niche .  as the door closed  amadiro gestured baley jovially to a well upholstered armchair and  with admirable economy  indicated  with his other arm  wall niches for daneel and giskard as well .  baley noticed that amadiro stared with a moment   s hunger at daneel and that  for that moment  his smile disappeared and a look that was almost predatory appeared on his face .  it was gone quickly and he was smiling again .  baley was left to wonder if  perhaps  that momentary change of expression was an invention of his own imagination .  amadiro said     since it looks as though we   re in for some mildly nasty weather  let   s do without the ineffective daylight we are now dubiously blessed with .     somehow  baley did not follow exactly what it was that amadiro did on the control panel of his desk  the windows opacified and the walls glowed with gentle daylight .  amadiro   s smile seemed to broaden .     we do not really have much to talk about  you and i  mr .  baley .  i took the precaution of speaking to mr .  gremionis while you were coming here .  from what he said  i decided to call dr .  vasilia as well .  apparently  mr .  baley  you have more or less accused both of complicity in the destruction of jander and  if i can understand the language  you have also accused me .        i merely asked questions  dr .  amadiro  as i intend to do now .        no doubt  but you are an earthman  so you are not aware of the enormity of your actions and i am really sorry that you must nonetheless suffer the consequences of them .    you know perhaps that gremionis sent me a memo concerning your slander of him .        he told me he had  but he misinterpreted my action .  it was not slander .     amadiro pursed his lips as though considering the statement .     i dare say you are right from your standpoint  mr .  baley  but you don   t understand the auroran definition of the word .  i was forced to send gremionis    memo on to the chairman and  as a result  it is very likely that you   ll be ordered off the planet by tomorrow morning .  i regret this  of course  but i fear that your investigation is about to come to an end .         again amadiro     .   baley was taken aback .  he did not know what to make of amadiro and he had not expected this confusion within himself .  gremionis had described him as    standoffish .     from what cicis had said  he expected amadiro to be autocratic .  in person  however  amadiro seemed jovial  outgoing  even friendly .  yet if his words were to be trusted  amadiro was calmly moving to end the investigation .  he was doing it pitilessly  and yet with what seemed to be a commiserating smile .  what was he .  automatically  baley glanced toward the niches where giskard and daneel were standing  the primitive giskard of course without expression  the advanced daneel calm and quiet .  that daneel had ever met amadiro in his short existence was  on the face of it  unlikely .  giskard  on the other hand  in his  how many .   decades of life might very well have met him .  baley   s lips tightened as he thought he might have asked giskard in advance what amadiro might be like .  he might  in that case  be now better able to judge how much of this roboticist   s present persona was real and how much was cleverly calculated .  why on earth  or off it  baley wondered  didn   t he use these robotic resources of his more intelligently .  or why didn   t giskard volunteer information  but no  that was unfair .  giskard clearly lacked the capacity for independent activity of that sort .  he would yield information on request  baley thought  but would produce none on his own initiative .  amadiro followed the brief flicking of baley   s eyes and said     i   m one against three  i think .  as you see  i have none of my robots here in my office  although any number are on instant call  i admit  while you have two of fastolfe   s robots  the old reliable giskard and that marvel of design  daneel .        you know them both  i see     said baley .     by reputation only .  i actually see them  i  a roboticist  was about to say    in the flesh     i actually see them physically for the first time now  although i saw daneel portrayed by an actor in that hyperwave show .        everyone in all the worlds has apparently seen that hyperwave show     said baley glumly .     it makes my life  as a real and limited individual  difficult .        not with me     said amadiro  his smile broadening .     i assure you i did not take your fictional representation with any seriousness whatever .  i assumed you were limited in real life .  and so you are  or you would not have indulged so freely in unwarranted accusations on aurora .        dr .  amadiro     said baley     i assure you i was making no formal accusations .  i was merely pursuing an investigation and considering possibilities .        don   t misunderstand me     said amadiro with sudden earnestness .     i don   t blame you .  i am sure that you were behaving perfectly by earth standards .  it is just that you are up against auroran standards now .  we treasure reputation with unbelievable intensity .        if that were so  dr .  amadiro  then haven   t you and other globalists been slandering dr .  fastolfe with suspicion  to a far greater extent than any small thing i have done .        quite true     agreed amadiro     but i am an eminent auroran and have a certain influence  while you are an earthman and have no influence whatever .  that is most unfair  i admit  and i deplore it  but that is the way the worlds are .  what can we do .  besides  the accusation against fastolfe can be maintained  and will be maintained  and slander isn   t slander when it is the truth .  your mistake was to make accusations that simply can   t be maintained .  i   m sure you must admit that neither mr .  gremionis nor dr .  vasilia aliena  nor both together  could possibly have disabled poor jander .        i did not formally accuse either .        perhaps not  but you can   t hide behind the word    formally    on aurora .  it   s too bad fastolfe didn   t warn you of this when he brought you in to take up this investigation  this  as it now is  i   m afraid  ill fated investigation .     baley felt the corner of his mouth twitch as he thought that fastolfe might indeed have warned him .  he said     am i to get a hearing in the matter or is it all settled .        of course you will get a hearing before being condemned .  we are not barbarians here on aurora .  the chairman will consider the memo i have sent him  together with my own suggestions in the matter .  he will probably consult fastolfe as the other party intimately concerned and then arrange to meet with all three of us  perhaps tomorrow .  some decision might be reached then  or later  and it would be ratified by the full legislature .  all due process of law will be followed  i assure you .        the letter of the law will be followed  no doubt  but what if the chairman has already made up his mind  what if nothing i say will be accepted  and what if the legislature simply rubberstamps a foregone decision .  is that possible .     amadiro did not exactly smile at that  but he seemed subtly amused .     you are a realist  mr .  baley .  i am pleased with that .  people who dream of justice are so apt to be disappointed  and they are usually such wonderful people that one hates to see that happen .     amadiro   s glance fixed itself on daneel again .     a remarkable job  this humaniform robot     he said .     it is astonishing how close to his vest fastolfe has kept things .  and it is a shame that jander was lost .  there fastolfe did the unforgivable .        dr .  fastolfe  sir  denies that he was in any way implicated .        yes  mr .  baley  of course he would .  does he say that i am implicated .  or is my implication entirely your own idea .     baley said deliberately     i have no such idea .  i merely wish to question you on the matter .  as for dr .  fastolfe  he is not a candidate for one of your accusations of slander .  he is certain you have had nothing to do with what happened to jander because he is quite certain you lack the knowledge and capacity to immobilize a humaniform robot .     if baley hoped to stir things up in that manner  he failed .  amadiro accepted the slur with no loss of good humor and said     in that he is right  mr .  baley .  sufficient ability is not to be found in any roboticist  alive or dead  except for fastolfe himself .  isn   t that what he says  our modest master of masters .        yes  he does .        then whatever does he say happened to jander  i wonder .        a random event .  purely chance .     amadiro laughed .     has he calculated the probability of such a random event .        yes  master roboticist .  yet even an extremely unlikely chance might happen  especially if there were incidents that bettered the odds .        such as what .        that is what i am hoping to find out  since you have already arranged to have me thrown off the planet  do you now intend to forestall any questioning of yourself  or may i continue my investigation until such time as my activity in that respect is legally ended .    before you answer  dr .  amadiro  please consider that the investigation has not as yet been legally ended and  in any hearing that may come up  whether tomorrow or later  i will be able to accuse you of refusing to answer my questions if you should insist on now ending this interview .  that might influence the chairman in his decision .        it would not  my dear mr .  baley .  don   t imagine you can in any way interfere with me .    however  you may interview me for as long as you wish .  i will cooperate fully with you  if only to enjoy the spectacle of the good fastolfe trying uselessly to disentangle himself from his unfortunate deed .  i am not extraordinarily vindictive  mr .  baley  but the fact that jander was fastolfe   s own creation does not give him the right to destroy it .     baley said     it is not legally established that this is what he has done  so that what you have just said is  at least potentially  slander .  let us put that to one side  therefore  and get on with this interview .  i need information .  i will ask my questions briefly and directly and  if you answer in the same way  this interview may be completed quickly .        no  mr .  baley .  it is not you who will set the conditions for this interview     said amadiro .     i take it that one or both of your robots is equipped to record our conversation in full .        i believe so .        i know so .  i have a recording device of my own as well .  don   t think  my good mr .  baley  that you will lead me through a jungle of short answers to something that will serve fastolfe   s purpose .  i will answer as i choose and make certain i am not misinterpreted .  and my own recording will help me make it certain that i am not misinterpreted .     now  for the first time  there was the suggestion of the wolf behind amadiro   s attitude of friendliness .     very well  then  but if your answers are deliberately long winded and evasive  that  too  will show up in the recording .        obviously .        with that understood  may i have a glass of water  to begin with .        absolutely .    giskard  will you oblige mr .  baley .     giskard was out of his niche at once .  there was the inevitable tinkle of ice at the bar at one end of the room and a tall glass of water was on the desk immediately before baley .  baley said     thank you  giskard     and waited for him to move back into his niche .  he said     dr .  amadiro  am i correct in considering you the head of the robotics institute .        yes  you are .        and its founder .        correct .    you see  i answer briefly .        how long has it been in existence .        as a concept  decades .  i have been gathering like minded people for at least fifteen years .  permission was obtained from the legislature twelve years ago .  building began nine years ago and active work began six years ago .  in its present completed form  the institute is two years old and there are long range plans for further expansion  eventually .    there you have a long answer  sir  but presented reasonably concisely .        why did you find it necessary to set up the institute .        ah  mr .  baley .  here you surely expect nothing but a long winded answer .        as you please  sir .     at this point  a robot brought in a tray of small sandwiches and still smaller pastries  none of which were familiar to baley .  he tried a sandwich and found it crunchy and not exactly unpleasant but odd enough for him to finish it only with an effort .  he washed it down with what was left of his water .  amadiro watched with a kind of gentle amusement and said     you must understand  mr .  baley  that we aurorans are unusual people .  so are spacers generally  but i speak of aurorans in particular now .  we are descended from earthpeople  something most of us do not willingly think about  but we are self selected .        what does that mean  sir .        earthpeople have long lived on an increasingly crowded planet and have drawn together into still more crowded cities that finally became the beehives and anthills you call cities with a capital    c .     what kind of earthpeople  then  would leave earth and go to other worlds that are empty and hostile so that they might build new societies from nothing  societies that they could not enjoy in completed form in their own lifetime  trees that would still be saplings when they died  so to speak .        rather unusual people  i suppose .        quite unusual .  specifically  people who are not so dependent on crowds of their fellows as to lack the ability to face emptiness .  people who even prefer emptiness  who would like to work on their own and face problems by themselves  rather than hide in the herd and share the burden so that their own load is virtually nothing .  individualists  mr .  baley .  individualists .        i see that .        and our society is founded on that .  every direction in which the spacer worlds have developed further emphasizes our individuality .  we are proudly human on aurora  rather than being huddled sheep on earth .    mind you  mr .  baley  i use the metaphor not as a way of deriding earth .  it is simply a different society which i find unadmirable but which you  i suppose  find comforting and ideal .        what has this to do with the founding of the institute  dr .  amadiro .        even proud and healthy individualism has its drawbacks .  the greatest minds  working singly  even for centuries  cannot progress rapidly if they refuse to communicate their findings .  a knotty puzzle may hold up a scientist for a century  when it may be that a colleague has the solution already and is not even aware of the puzzle that it might solve .    the institute is an attempt  in the narrow field of robotics at least  to introduce a certain community of thought .        is it possible that the particular knotty puzzle you are attacking is that of the construction of a humaniform robot .     amadiro   s eyes twinkled .     yes  that is obvious  isn   t it .  it was twenty six years ago that fastolfe   s new mathematical system  which he calls    intersectional analysis     made it possible to design humaniform robots  but he kept the system to himself .  years afterward  when all the difficult technical details were worked out  he and dr .  sarton applied the theory to the design of daneel .  then fastolfe alone completed jander .  but all of those details were kept secret  also .     most roboticists shrugged and felt that this was natural .  they could only try  individually  to work out the details for themselves .  i  on the other hand  was struck by the possibility of an institute in which efforts would be pooled .  it wasn   t easy to persuade other roboticists of the usefulness of the plan  or to persuade the legislature to fund it against fastolfe   s formidable opposition  or to persevere through the years of effort  but here we are .  baley said     why was dr .  fastolfe opposed .        ordinary self love  to begin with  and i have no fault to find with that  you understand .  all of us have a very natural self love .  it comes with the territory of individualism .  the point is that fastolfe considers himself the greatest roboticist in history and also considers the humaniform robot his own particular achievement .  he doesn   t want that achievement duplicated by a group of roboticists  individually faceless compared to himself .  i imagine he viewed it as a conspiracy of inferiors to dilute and deface his own great victory .        you say that was his motive for opposition    to begin with .     that means there were other motives .  what were they .        he also objects to the uses to which we plan to put the humaniform robots .        what uses are these  dr .  amadiro .        now now .  let   s not be ingenuous .  surely dr .  fastolfe has told you of the globalist plans for setting the galaxy .        that he has and  for that matter  dr .  vasilia has spoken to me of the difficulties of scientific advance among individualists .  however  that does not stop me from wanting to hear your views on these matters .  nor should it stop you from wanting to tell me .  for instance  do you want me to accept dr .  fastolfe   s interpretation of globalist plans as unbiased and impartial  and would you state that for the record .  or would you prefer to describe your plans in your own words .        put that way  mr .  baley  you intend to give me no choice .        none  dr .  amadiro .        very well .  i  we  i should say  for the people at the institute are like minded in this  look into the future and wish to see humanity opening ever more and ever newer planets to settlement .  we do not  however  want the process of self selection to destroy the older planets or to reduce them to moribundity  as in the case  pardon me  of earth .  we don   t want the new planets to take the best of us and to leave behind the dregs .  you see that  don   t you .        please go on .        in any robot oriented society  as in the case of our own  the easy solution is to send out robots as settlers .  the robots will build the society and the world and we can then all follow later without selection  for the new world will be as comfortable and as adjusted to ourselves as the old worlds were  so that we can go on to new worlds without leaving home  so to speak .        won   t the robots create robot worlds rather than human worlds .        exactly  if we send out robots that are nothing but robots .  we have  however  the opportunity of sending out humaniform robots like daneel here  who  in creating worlds for themselves  would automatically create worlds for us .  dr .  fastolfe  however  objects to this .  he finds some virtue in the thought of human beings calving a new world out of a strange and forbidding planet and does not see that the effort to do so would not only cost enormously in human life  but would also create a world molded by catastrophic events into something not at all like the worlds we know .        as the spacer worlds today are different from earth and from each other .     amadiro  for a moment  lost his joviality and looked thoughtful .     actually  mr .  baley  you touch an important point .  i am discussing aurora only .  the spacer worlds do indeed differ among themselves and i am not overly fond of most of them .  it is clear to me  though i may be prejudiced  that aurora  the oldest among them  is also the best and most successful .  i don   t want a variety of new worlds of which only a few might be really valuable .  i want many auroras  uncounted millions of auroras  and for that reason i want new worlds carved into auroras before human beings go there .  that   s why we call ourselves    globalists    by the way .  we are concerned with this globe of oars  aurora  and no other .        do you see no value in variety  dr .  amadiro .        if the varieties were equally good  perhaps there would be value  but if some  or most  are inferior  how would that benefit humanity .        when do you start this work .        when we have the humaniform robots with which to do it .  so far there were fastolfe   s two  of which he destroyed one  leaving daneel the only specimen .     his eyes strayed briefly to daneel as he spoke .     when will you have humaniform robots .        that is difficult to say .  we have not yet caught up with dr .  fastolfe .        even though he is one and you are many  dr .  amadiro .     amadiro twitched his shoulders slightly .     you waste your sarcasm  mr .  baley .  fastolfe was well ahead of us to begin with and  though the institute has been in embryo for a long time  we have been fully at work for only two years .  besides  it wffi be necessary for us not only to catch up with fastolfe but to move ahead of him .  daneel is a good product  but he is only a prototype and is not good enough .        in what way must the humaniform robots be improved beyond daneel   s mark .        they must be even more human  obviously .  they must exist in both sexes and there must be the equivalent of children .  we must have a generational spread if a sufficiently human society is to be built up on the planets .        i think i see difficulties  dr .  amadiro .        no doubt .  there are many .  which difficulties do you foresee  mr .  baley .        if you produce humaniform robots who are so humaniform they can produce a human society  and if they are produced with a generational spread in both sexes  how will you be able to distinguish them from human beings .        will that matter .        it might .  if such robots are too human  they might melt into auroran society and become part of human family groups  and might not be suitable for service as pioneers .     amadiro laughed .     that thought clearly entered your head because of gladia delmarre   s attachment to jander .  you see  i know something of your interview with that woman from my conversations with gremionis and with dr .  vasilia .  i remind you that gladia is from solaria and her notion of what constitutes a husband is not necessarily auroran in nature .        i was not thinking of her in particular .  i was thinking that sex on aurora is broadly interpreted and that robots as sex partners are tolerated even now  with robots who are only approximately humaniform .  if you really cannot tell a robot from a human being         there   s the question of children .  robots can neither father nor mother children .        but that brings up another point .  the robots will be long lived  since the proper building of the society may take centuries .        they would  in any case  have to be long lived if they are to resemble aurorans .        and the children  also long lived .     amadiro did not speak .  baley said     these will be artificial robot children and will never grow older  they will not age and mature .  surely this will create an element sufficiently nonhuman to cast the nature of the society into doubt .     amadiro sighed .     you are penetrating  mr .  baley .  it is indeed our thought to devise some scheme whereby robots can produce babies who can in some fashion grow and mature  at least long enough to establish the society we want .        and then  when human beings arrive  the robots can be restored to more robotic schemes of behavior .        perhaps  if that seems advisable .        and this production of babies .  clearly  it would be best if the system used were as close to the human as possible  wouldn   t it .        possibly .        sex  fertilization  birth .        possibly .        and if these robots form a society so human that they cannot be differentiated from human  then  when true human beings arrive  might it not be that the robots would resent the immigrants and try to keep them off .  might the robots not react to aurorans as you react to earthpeople .        mr .  baley  the robots would still be bound by the three laws .        the three laws speak of refraining from injuring human beings and of obeying human beings .        exactly .        and what if the robots are so close to human beings that they regard themselves as the human beings they should protect and obey .  they might  very rightly  place themselves above the immigrants .        my good mr .  baley  why are you so concerned with all these things .  they are for the far future .  there will be solutions  as we progress in time and as we understand  by observation  what the problems really are .        it may be  dr .  amadiro  that aurorans may not very much approve what you are planning  once they understand what it is .  they may prefer dr .  fastolfe   s views .        indeed .  fastolfe thinks that  if aurorans cannot settle new planets directly and without the help of robots  then earthpeople should be encouraged to do so .     baley said     it seems to me that that makes good sense .        because you are an earthman  my good baley .  i assure you that aurorans would not find it pleasant to have earthpeople swarming over the new worlds  building new beehives and forming some sort of galactic empire in their trillions and quadrillions and reducing the spacer worlds to what .  to insignificance at best and to extinction at worst .        but the alternative to that is worlds of humaniform robots  building quasi human societies and allowing no true human beings among themselves .  there would gradually develop a robotic galactic empire  reducing the spacer worlds to insignificance at best and to extinction at worst .  surely aurorans would prefer a human galactic empire to a robotic one .        what makes you so sure of that  mr .  baley .        the form your society takes now makes me sure .  i was told  on my way to aurora  that no distinctions are made between robots and human beings on aurora  but that is clearly wrong .  it may be a wished for ideal that aurorans flatter themselves truly exists  but it does not .        you   ve been here  what .   less than two days and you can already tell .        yes  dr .  amadiro .  it may be precisely because i   m a stranger that i can see clearly .  i am not blinded by custom and ideals .  robots are not permitted to enter personals and that   s one distinction that is clearly made .  it permits human beings to find one place where they can be alone .  you and i sit at our ease  while robots remain standing in their niches  as you see     baley waved his arm toward daneel     which is another distinction .  i think that human beings  even aurorans  will always be eager to make distinctions and to preserve their own humanity .        astonishing  mr .  baley .        not astonishing at all  dr .  amadiro .  you have lost .  even if you manage to foist your belief that dr .  fastolfe destroyed jander upon aurorans generally  even if you reduce dr .  fastolfe to political impotence  even if you get the legislature and the auroran people to approve your plan of robot settlement  you will only have gained time .  as soon as the aurorans see the implications of your plan  they will turn against you .  it might be better  then  if you put an end to your campaign against dr .  fastolfe and meet with him to work out some compromise whereby the settlement of new worlds by earthmen can be so arranged as to represent no threat to aurora or to the spacer worlds in general .        astonishing  mr .  baley     said amadiro a second time .     you have no choice     said baley flatly .  but amadiro answered  in a leisurely and amused tone     when i say your remarks are astonishing  i do not refer to the content of your statements but only to the fact that you make them at all  and that you think they are worth something .         .   baley watched amadiro forage for one last piece of pastry and put half of it into his mouth  clearly enjoying it .     very good     said amadiro     but i am a little too fond of eating .  what was i saying .    oh yes .  mr .  baley  do you think you have discovered a secret .  that i have told you something that our world does not already know .  that my plans are dangerous  but that i blab them to every newcomer .  i imagine you may think that  if i talk to you long enough  i will surely produce some verbal folly that you will be able to make use of .  be assured that i am not likely to .  my plans for ever more humaniform robots  for robot families  and for as human a culture as possible are all on record .  they are available to the legislature and to anyone who is interested .     baley said     does the general public know .        probably not .  the general public has its own priorities and is more interested in the next meal  the next hyperwave show  the next space soccer contest than in the next century and the next millennium .  still  the general public will be as glad to accept my plans  as are the intellectually minded who already know .  those who object will not be numerous enough to matter .        can you be certain of that .        oddly enough  i can be .  you don   t understand  i   m afraid  the intensity of the feelings that aurorans  and spacers generally  have toward earthpeople .  i don   t shares those feelings  mind you  and i am  for instance  quite at ease with you .  i don   t have that primitive fear of infection  i don   t imagine that you smell bad  i don   t attribute to you all sorts of personality traits that i find offensive  i don   t think that you and yours are plotting to take our lives or steal our property  but the large majority of aurorans have all these attitudes .  it may not be very close to the surface and aurorans may bring themselves to be very polite to individual earthpeople who seem harmless  but put them to the test and all their hatred and suspicion will emerge .  tell them that earthpeople are swarming over new worlds and will preempt the galaxy and they will howl for earth   s destruction before such a thing can happen .        even if the alternative was a robot society .        certainly .  you don   t understand how we feel about robots  either .  we are familiar with them .  we are at home with them .        no .  they are your servants .  you feel superior to them and are at home with them only while that superiority is maintained .  if you are threatened by an overturn  by having them become your superiors  you will react with horror .        you say that only because that is how earthpeople would react .        no .  you keep them out of the personals .  it is a symptom .        they have no use for those rooms .  they have their own facilities for washing and they do not excrete .    of course  they are not truly humaniform .  if they were  we might not make that distinction .        you would fear them the more .        truly .     said amadiro .     that   s foolish .  do you fear daneel .  if i can trust that hyperwave show  and i admit i do not think i can  you developed a considerable affection for daneel .  you feel it now  don   t you .     baley   s silence was eloquent and amadiro pursued his advantage .     right now     he said     you are unmoved by the fact that giskard is standing  silent and unresponsive  in an alcove  but i can tell by small examples of body language that you are uneasy over the fact that daneel is doing so  too .  you feel he is too human in appearance to be treated as a robot .  you don   t fear him the more because he looks human .        i am an earthman .  we have robots     said baley     but not a robot culture .  you cannot judge from my case .        and gladia  who preferred jander to human beings         she is a solarian .  you cannot judge from her case  either .        what case can you judge from  then .  you are only guessing .  to me  it seems obvious that  if a robot is human enough  he would be accepted as human .  do you demand proof that i am not a robot .  the fact that i seem human is enough .  in the end  we will not worry whether a new world is settled by aurorans who are human in fact or in appearance  if no one can tell the difference .  but  human or robot  the settlers will be aurorans either way  not earthpeople .     baley   s assurance faltered .  he said unconvincingly     what if you never learn how to construct a humaniform robot .        why would you expect we would not .  notice that i say    we .     there are many of us involved here .        it may be that any number of mediocrities do not add up to one genius .     amadiro said shortly     we are not mediocrities .  fastolfe may yet find it profitable to come in with us .        i don   t think so .        i do .  he will not enjoy being without power in the legislature and  when our plans for settling the galaxy move ahead and he sees that his opposition does not stop us  he will join us .  it will be only human of him to do so .        i don   t think you will win out     said baley .     because you think that somehow this investigation of yours will exonerate fastolfe and implicate me  perhaps  or someone else .        perhaps     said baley desperately .  amadiro shook his head .     my friend  if i thought that anything you could do would spoil my plans  would i be sitting still and waiting for destruction .        you are not .  you are doing everything you can to have this investigation aborted .  why would you do that if you were confident that nothing i could do would get in your way .        well     said amadiro     you can get in my way by demoralizing some of the members of the institute .  you can   t be dangerous  but you can be annoying  and i don   t want that either .  so  if i can  i   ll put an end to the annoyance  but i   ll do that in reasonable fashion  in gentle fashion  even .  if you were actually dangerous         what could you do  dr .  amadiro  in that case .        i could have you seized and imprisoned until you were evicted .  i don   t think aurorans generally would worry overmuch about what i might do to an earthman .     baley said     you are trying to browbeat me and that won   t work .  you know very well you could not lay a hand on me with my robots present .     amadiro said     does it occur to you that i have a hundred robots within call .  what would yours do against them .        all hundred could not harm me .  they cannot distinguish between earthmen and aurorans .  i am human within the meaning of the three laws .        they could hold you quite immobilized  without harming you  while your robots were destroyed .        not so     said baley .     giskard can hear you arid  if you make a move to summon your robots  giskard will have you immobilized .  he moves very quickly and  once that happens  your robots will be helpless  even if you manage to call them .  they will understand that any move against me will result in harm to you .        you mean that giskard will hurt me .        to protect me from harm .  certainly .  he will kill you  if absolutely necessary .        surely you don   t mean that .        i do     said baley .     daneel and giskard have orders to protect me .  the first law  in this respect  has been strengthened with all the skill dr .  fastolfe can bring to the job  and with respect to me  specifically .  i haven   t been told this in so many words  but i   m quite sure it   s true .  if my robots must choose between harm to you and harm to me  earthman though i am  it will be easy for them to choose harm to you .  i imagine you are well aware that dr .  fastolfe is not very eager to ensure your well being .  amadiro chuckled and a grin wreathed his face .     i   m sure you   re right in every respect  mr .  baley  but it is good to have you say so .  you know  my good sir  that i am recording this conversation also  i told you so at the start  and i   m glad of it .  it is possible that dr .  fastolfe will erase the last part of this conversation  but i assure you i won   t .  it is clear from what you have said that he is quite prepared to devise a robotic way of doing harm to me  even kill me  if he can manage that  whereas it cannot be said from anything in this conversation  or any other  that i plan any physical harm to him whatever or even to you .  which of us is the villain  mr .  baley .    i think you have established that and i think  then  that this is a good place at which to end the interview .     he rose  still smiling  and baley  swallowing hard  stood up as well  almost automatically .  amadiro said     i still have one thing to say  however .  it has nothing to do with our little contretemps here on aurora  fastolfe   s and mine .  rather  with your own problem  mr .  baley .        my problem .        perhaps i should say earth   s problem .  i imagine that you feel very anxious to save poor fastolfe from his own folly because you think that will give your planet a chance for expansion .   don   t think so  mr .  baley .  you are quite wrong  rather arsyvarsy  to use a vulgar expression i   ve come across in some of your planet   s historical novels .        i   m not familiar with that phrase     said baley stiffly .     i mean you have the situation reversed .  you see  when my view wins out in the legislature  and note that i say    when    and not    if  earth will be forced to remain in her own planetary system  i admit  but that will actually be to her benefit .  aurora will have the prospect of expansion and of establishing an endless empire .  if we then know that earth will merely be earth and never anything more  of what concern will she be to us .  with the galaxy at our disposal  we will not begrudge earthpeople their one world .  we would even be disposed to make earth as comfortable a world for her people as would be practical .     on the other hand  mr .  baley  if aurorans do what fastolfe asks and allow earth to send out settling parties  then it won   t be long before it will occur to an increasing number of us that earth will take over the galaxy and that we will be encircled and hemmed in  that we will be doomed to decay and death .  after that  there will be nothing i can do .  my own quite kindly feeling toward earthmen will not be able to withstand the general kindling of auroran suspicion and prejudice and it will then be very bad for earth .     so if  mr .  baley  you are truly concerned for your own people  you should be very anxious indeed for fastolfe not to succeed in foisting upon this planet his very misguided plan .  you should be a strong ally of mine .  think about it .  i tell you this  i assure you  out of a sincere friendship and liking for you and for your planet .     amadiro was smiling as broadly as ever  but it was all wolf now .      .   baley and his robots followed amadiro out the room and along the corridor .  amadiro stopped at one inconspicuous door and said     would you care to use the facilities before leaving .     for a moment  baley frowned in confusion  for he did not understand .  then he remembered the antiquated phrase amadiro had used  thanks to his own reading of historical novels .  he said     there was an ancient general  whose name i have forgotten  who  mindful of the exigencies of sudden absorption in military affairs  once said     never turn down a chance to piss .  amadiro smiled broadly and said     excellent advice .  quite as good as my advice to think seriously about what i have said .   but i notice that you hesitate  even so .  surely you don   t think i am laying a trap for you .  believe me  i am not a barbarian .  you are my guest in this building and  for that reason alone  you are perfectly safe .     baley said cautiously     if i hesitate  it is because i am considering the propriety of using your  uh  facilities  considering that i am not an auroran .        nonsense  my dear baley .  what is your alternative .  needs must .  please make use of it .  let that be a symbol that i myself am not subject to the general auroran prejudices and wish you and earth well .        could you go a step further .        in what way  mr .  baley .        could you show me that you are also superior to this planet   s prejudice against robots         there is no prejudice against robots     said amadiro quickly .  baley nodded his head solemnly in apparent acceptance of the remark and completed his sentence .       by allowing them to enter the personal with me .  i have grown to feel uncomfortable without them .     for one moment  amadiro seemed shaken .  he recovered almost at once and said  with what was almost a scowl     by all means  mr .  baley .        yet whoever is now inside might object strenuously .  i would not want to create scandal .        no one is in there .  it is a one person personal and  if someone were making use of it  the in use signal would indicate that .        thank you  dr .  amadiro     said baley .  he opened the door and said     giskard  please enter .     giskard clearly hesitated  but said nothing in objection and entered .  at a gesture from baley  daneel followed  but as he passed through the door  he took baley   s elbow and pulled him in as well .  baley said  as the door closed behind him     i   ll be out again soon .  thank you for allowing this .     he entered the room with as much unconcern as he could manage and yet he felt a tightness in the pit of his abdomen .  might it contain some unpleasant surprise .      .   baley found the personal empty  however .  there was not even much to search .  it was smaller than the one in fastolfe   s establishment .  eventually  he noticed daneel and giskard standing silently side by side  backs against the door  as though endeavoring to have entered the room by the least amount possible .  baley tried to speak normally  but what camp out was a dim croak .  he cleared his throat with unnecessary noise and said     you can come farther into the room  and you needn   t remain silent  daneel .      daneel had been on earth .  he knew the earthly taboo against speech in the personal .   daneel displayed that knowledge at once .  he put his forefinger to his lips .  baley said     i know  i know  but forget it .  if amadiro can forget the auroran taboo about robots in personals  i can forget the earthly taboo about speech there .        will it not make you uncomfortable  partner elijah .     asked daneel in a low voice .     not a bit     said baley in an ordinary one .   actually  speech felt different with daneel  a robot .  the sound of speech in a room such as this when  actually  no human being was present was not as horrifying as it might be .  in fact  it was not horrifying at all when only robots were present  however humaniform one of them might be .  baley could not say so  of course .  though daneel had no feelings a human being could hurt  baley had feelings on his behalf .   and then baley thought of something else and felt  quite intensely  the sensation of being a thoroughgoing fool .     or     he said to daneel  in a voice that was suddenly very low indeed     are you suggesting silence because this room is bugged .     the last word came out merely as a shaping of the mouth .     if you mean  partner elijah  that people outside this room can detect what is spoken inside this room through some sort of eavesdropping device  that is quite impossible .        why impossible .     the toilet device flushed itself with quick and silent efficiency and baley advanced toward the washbasin .  daneel said     on earth  the dense packing of the cities makes privacy impossible .  overhearing is taken for granted and to use a device to make overhearing more efficient might seem natural .  if an earthman wishes not to be overheard  he simply doesn   t speak  which may be why silence is so mandatory in places where there is a pretense of privacy  as in the very rooms you call personals .     on aurora  on the other hand  as on all the spacer worlds  privacy is a true fact of life and is greatly valued .  you remember solaria and the diseased extremes to which it was carried there .  but even on aurora  which is no solaria  every human being is insulated from every other human being by the kind of space extension unthinkable on earth and by a wall of robots  in addition .  to break down that privacy would be an unthinkable act .     baley said     do you mean it would be a crime to bug this room .        much worse  partner elijah .  it would not be the act of a civilized auroran gentleman .     baley looked about .  daneel  mistaking the gesture  plucked a towel out of the dispenser  which might not have been instantly apparent to the other   s unaccustomed eyes  and offered it to baley .  baley accepted the towel  but that was not the object of his questing glance .  it was a bug for which his eyes searched  for he found it difficult to believe that someone would forego an easy advantage on the ground that it would not be civilized behavior .  it was  however  useless and baley  rather despondently  knew it would be .  he would not be able to detect an auroran bug  even if one were there .  he wouldn   t know what to look for in a strange culture .  whereupon he followed the course of another strand of suspicion in his mind .     tell me  daneel  since you know aurorans better than i do  why do you suppose amadiro is taking all this trouble with me .  he talks to me at his leisure .  he sees me out .  he offers me the use of this room  something vasilia would not have done .  he seems to have all the time in the world to spend on me .  politeness .        many aurorans pride themselves on their politeness .  it may be that amadiro does .  he has several times stressed that he is not a barbarian .        another question .  why do you think he was willing to have me bring you and giskard into this room .        it seemed to me that that was to remove your suspicions that the offer of this room might conceal a trap .        why should he bother .  because he was concerned over the possibility of my experiencing unnecessary anxiety .        another gesture of a civilized auroran gentleman  i should imagine .     baley shook his head .     well  if this room is bugged and amadiro can hear me  let him hear me .  i don   t consider him a civilized auroran gentleman .  he made it quite clear that  if i did not abandon my investigation  he would see to it that earth as a whole would suffer .  is that the act of a civilized gentleman .  or of an incredibly brutal blackmailer .     daneel said     an auroran gentleman may find it necessary to utter threats  but if so  he would do it in a gentlemanly manner .        as amadiro did .  it is  then  the manner and not the content of speech that marks the gentleman .  but then  daneel  you are a robot and therefore can not really criticize a human being  can you .     daneel said     it would be difficult for me to do so .  but may i ask a question  partner elijah .  why did you ask permission to bring friend giskard and me into this room .  it had seemed to me that you were reluctant  earlier  to believe you were in danger .  have you now decided that you are not safe except in our presence .        no  not at all  daneel .  i am now quite convinced that i am not in danger and have not been .        yet there was a distinctly suspicious cast about your actions when you entered this room  partner elijah .  you searched it .     baley said     of course .  i said i am not in danger  but i do not say there is no danger .        i do not think i see the distinction  partner elijah     said daneel .     we will discuss it later  daneel .  i am still not certain as to whether this room is bugged or not .     baley was by now quite done .  he said     well  daneel  i   ve been leisurely about this  i haven   t rushed at all .  now i   m ready to go out again and i wonder if amadiro is still waiting for us after all this time or whether he has delegated an underling to do the rest of the job of showing us out .  after all  amadiro is a busy man and cannot spend all day with me .  what do you think  daneel .        it would be more logical if dr .  amadiro had delegated the task .        and you  giskard .  what do you think .        i agree with friend daneel  though it is my experience that human beings do not always make what would seem the logical response .     baley said     for my part  i suspect amadiro is waiting for us quite patiently .  if something has driven him to waste this much time on us  i rather think that the driving force  whatever it might be  has not yet weakened .        i do not know what might be the driving force you speak of  partner elijah     said daneel .     nor i  daneel     said baley     which bothers me a great deal .  but let us open the door now and see .         .   amadiro was waiting outside the door for them  precisely where baley had left him .  he smiled at them  showing no sign of impatience .  baley could not resist shooting a quiet i told you so glance at daneel  who responded with bland impassivity .  amadiro said     i rather regretted  mr .  baley  that you had not left giskard outside when you entered the personal .  i might have known him in times past  when fastolfe and i were on better terms but somehow never did .  fastolfe was my teacher once  you know .        was he .     said baley .     i didn   t know that  as a matter of fact .        no reason you should  unless you had been told  and  in the short time you   ve been on the planet  you can scarcely have had time to learn much in the way of this sort of trivia  i suppose .    come now  it has occurred to me that you can scarcely think me hospitable if i do not take advantage of your being at the institute to show you around .        really     said baley  stiffening a bit .     i must         i insist     said amadiro  with something of a note of the imperious entering his voice .     you arrived on aurora yesterday morning and i doubt that you will be staying on the planet much longer .  this may be the only chance you will ever have of getting a glimpse of a modern laboratory doing research work on robotics .     he linked arms with baley and continued to speak in familiar terms .      prattled    was the term that occurred to the astonished baley .      you   ve washed     said amadiro .     you   ve taken care of your needs .  there may be other roboticists here whom you will wish to question and i would welcome that  since i am determined to show i have put no barriers in your way during the short time in which you will yet be permitted to conduct your investigation .  in fact  there is no reason you can   t have dinner with us .     giskard said     if i may interrupt  sir         you may not .     said amadiro with unmistakable firmness and the robot fell silent .  amadiro said     my dear mr .  baley  i understand these robots .  who should know them better .    except for the unfortunate fastolfe  of course .  giskard  i am sure  was going to remind you of some appointment  some promise  some business  and there is no point in any of that .  since the investigation is about over  i promise you  none of what he was going to remind you of will have any significance .  let us forget all such nonsense and  for a brief time  be friends .     you must understand  my good mr .  baley     he went on     that i am quite an aficionado of earth and its culture .  it is not the most popular of subjects on aurora  but i find it fascinating .    am particularly interested in earth   s past history  the days when it had a hundred languages and interstellar standard had not yet been developed .    may i compliment you  by the way  on your own handling of interstellar .     this way  this way     he said  turning a corner .     we   ll be coming to the pathway simulation room  which has its own weird beauty  and we may have a mock up in operation .  quite symphonic  actually .    but i was talking about your handling of interstellar .  it is one of the many auroran superstitions concerning earth  that earthpeople speak an all but incomiprehensible version of interstellar .  when the show about you was produced  there were many who said that the actors could not be earthpeople because they could be understood  yet i can understand you .     he smiled as he said that .     i   ve tried reading shakespeare     he continued with a confidential air     but i can   t read him in the original  of course  and the translation is curiously flat .  i can   t help but believe that the fault lies with the translation and not with shakespeare .  i do better with dickens and tolstoy  perhaps because that is prose  although the names of the characters are  in both cases  virtually unpronounceable to me .     what i   m trying to say  mr .  baley  is that i   m a friend of earth .  i really am .  i want what is best for it .  do you understand .     he looked at baley and again the wolf showed in his twinkling eyes .  baley raised his voice  forcing it between the softly running sentences of the other .     i   m afraid i cannot oblige you  dr .  amadiro .  i must be about my business and i have    no further questions to ask of either you or anyone else here .  if you      baley paused .  there was a faint and curious rumble of sound in the air .  he looked up  startled .     what is that .        what is what .     asked amadiro .     i sense nothing .     he looked at the robots  who had been following the two human beings in grave silence .     nothing .     he said forcefully .     nothing .     baley recognized that as the equivalent of an order .  neither robot could now claim to have heard the rumble in direct contradiction to a human being  unless baley himself applied a counter pressure  and he was sure he could not manage to do it skillfully enough in the face of amadiro   s professionalism .  nevertheless  it didn   t matter .  he had heard something and he was not a robot  he would not be talked out of it .  he said     by your own statement  dr .  amadiro  i have little time left me  that is all the more reason that i must      the rumble again .  louder .  baley said  with a sharp  cutting edge to his voice     that  i suppose  is precisely what you didn   t hear before and what you don   t hear now .  let me go  sir  or i will ask my robots for help .     amadiro loosened his grip on baley   s upper arm at once .     my friend  you had but to express the wish .  come .  i will take you to the nearest exit and  if ever you are on aurora again  which seems unlikely in the extreme  please return and you may have the tour i promised you .     they were walking faster .  they moved down the spiral ramp  out along a corridor to the commodious and now empty anteroom and the door by which they had entered .  the windows in the anteroom showed utterly dark .  could it be night already .  it wasn   t .  amadiro muttered to himself     rotten weather .  they   ve opacified the windows .     he turned to baley     i imagine it   s raining .  they predicted it and the forecasts can usually be relied on  always  when they   re unpleasant .     the door opened and baley jumped backward with a gasp .  a cold wind gusted inward and against the sky  not black but a dull  dark gray  the tops of trees were whipping back and forth .  there was water pouring from the sky  descending in streams .  and as baley watched  appalled  a streak of light flashed across the sky with blinding brilliance and then the rumble came again  this time with a cracking report  as though the light streak had split the sky and the rumble was the noise it had made .  baley turned and fled back the way he had come  whimpering .      again daneel and giskard     .   baley felt daneel   s strong grip on his arms  just beneath his shoulders .  he halted and forced himself to stop making that infantile sound .  he could feel himself trembling .  daneel said with infinite respect     partner elijah  it is a thunderstorm  expected  predicted  normal .        i know that     whispered baley .  he did know it .  thunderstorms had been described innumerable times in the books he had read  whether fiction or nonfiction .  he had seen them in holographs and on hyperwave shows  sound  sight  and all .  the real thing  however  the actual sound and sight  had never penetrated into the bowels of the city and he had never in his life actually experienced such a thing .  with all he knew  intellectually  about thunderstorms  he could not face  viscerally  the actuality .  despite the descriptions  the collections of words  the sight in small pictures and on small screens  the sounds captured in recordings  despite all that  he had no idea the flashes were so bright and streaked so across the sky  that the sound was so vibratorily bass in sound when it rattled across a hollow world  that both were so sudden  and that rain could be so like an inverted bowl of water  endlessly pouring .  he muttered in despair     i can   t go out in that .        you won   t have to     said daneel urgently .   giskard will get the airfoil .  it will be brought right to the door for you .  not a drop of rain will fall on you .        why not wait until it   s over .        surely that would not be advisable  partner elijah .  some rain  at least  will continue past midnight and if the chairman arrives tomorrow morning  as dr .  amadiro implied he might  it might be wise to spend the evening in consultation with dr .  fastolfe .     baley forced himself to turn around  face in the direction from which he wanted to flee  and look into daneers eyes .  they seemed deeply concerned  but baley thought dismally that that was merely the result of his own interpretation of the appearance of those eyes .  the robot had no feelings  only positronic surges that mimicked those feelings .   and perhaps human beings had no feelings  only neuronic surges that were interpreted as feelings .   he was somehow aware that amadiro was gone .  he said     amadiro delayed me deliberately  by ushering me into the personal  by his senseless talk  by his preventing you or giskard from interrupting and warning me about the storm .  he would even have tried to persuade me to tour the building or dine with him .  he desisted only at the sound of the storm .  that was what he was waiting for .        it would seem so .  if the storm now keeps you here  that may be what he was waiting for .     baley drew a deep breath .     you are right .  i must leave   somehow .     reluctantly  he took a step toward the door  which was still open  still filled with a dark gray vista of whipping rain .  another step .  and still another  leaning heavily on daneel .  giskard was waiting quietly at the door .  baley paused and closed his eyes for a moment .  then he said in a low voice  to himself rather than to daneel     i must do it     and moved forward again .      .      are you well  sir .     asked giskard .  it was a foolish question  dictated by the programming of the robot  thought baley  though  at that  it was no worse than the questions asked by human beings  sometimes with wild inappropriateness  out of the programming of etiquette .     yes     said baley in a voice he tried  and failed  to raise above a husky whisper .  it was a useless answer to the foolish question  for giskard  robot though he was  could surely see that baley was unwell and that baley   s answer was a palpable lie .  the answer was  however  given and accepted and that freed giskard for the next step .  he said     i will now leave to get the airfoil and bring it to the door .        will it work  in all this  this water  giskard .        yes  sir .  this is not an uncommon rain .     he left  moving steadily into the downpour .  the lightning was flickering almost continuously and the thunder was a muted growl that rose to a louder crescendo every few minutes .  for the first time in his life  baley found himself envying a robot .  imagine being able to walk through that  to be indifferent to water  to sight  to sound  to be able to ignore surroundings and to have a pseudo life that was absolutely courageous  to know no fear of pain or of death  because there was no pain or death .  and yet to be incapable of originality of thought  to be incapable of unpredictable leaps of intuition   were such gifts worth what humanity paid for them .  at the moment  baley could not say .  he knew that  once he no longer felt terror  he would know that no price was too high to pay for being human .  but now that he experienced nothing but the pounding of his heart and the collapse of his will  he could not help but wonder of what use it might be to be a human being if one could not overcome these deep seated terrors  this intense agoraphobia .  yet he had been in the open for much of two days and had managed to be almost comfortable .  but the fear had not been conquered .  he knew that now .  he had suppressed it by thinking intensely of other things  but the storm overrode all intensity of thought .  he could not allow this .  if all else failed  thought  pride  will  then he would have to fall back on shame .  he could not collapse under the impersonal  superior gaze of the robots .  shame would have to be stronger than fear .  he felt daneel   s steady arm about his waist and shame prevented him from doing what  at the moment  he most wanted to do  to turn and hide his face against the robotic chest .  he might have been unable to resist if daneel had been human   he had lost contact with reality  for he was becoming aware of daneel   s voice as though it were reaching him from a long distance .  it sounded as though daneel was feeling something akin to panic .     partner elijah  do you hear me .     giskard   s voice  from an equal distance  said     we must carry him .        no     mumbled baley .     let me walk .     perhaps they did not hear him .  perhaps he did not really speak  but merely thought he did .  he felt himself lifted from the ground .  his left arm dangled helplessly and he strove to lift it  to push it against someone   s shoulder  to lift himself upright again from the waist  to grope for the floor with his feet and stand upright .  but his left arm continued to dangle helplessly and his striving went for nothing .  he was somehow aware that he was moving through the air and he felt a wash of spray against his face .  not actually water but the sifting of damp air .  then there was the pressure of a hard surface against his left side  a more resilient one against his right side .  he was in the airfoil  wedged in once more between giskard and daneel .  what he was most conscious of was that giskard was very wet .  he felt a jet of warm air cascading over him .  between the near darkness outside and the film of trickling water upon the glass  they might as well have been opacified  or so baley thought till opacification actually took place and total darkness descended .  the soft noise of the jet  as the airfoil rose above the grass and swayed  muted the thunder and seemed to draw its teeth .  giskard said     i regret the discomfort of my wet surface  sir .  i will dry quickly .  we will wait here a short while till you recover .     baley was breathing more easily .  he felt wonderfully and comfortably enclosed .  he thought  give me back my city .  wipe out all the universe and let the spacers colonize it .  earth is all we need .  and even as he thought it  he knew it was his madness that believed it  not he .  he felt the need to keep his mind busy .  he said weakly     daneel .        yes  partner elijah .        about the chairman .  is it your opinion that amadiro was judging the situation correctly in supposing that the chairman would put an end to the investigation or was he perhaps allowing his wishes to do his thinking for him .        it may be  partner elijah  that the chairman will indeed interview dr .  fastolfe and amadiro on the matter .  it would be a standard procedure for settling a dispute of this nature .  there are ample precedents .        but why .     asked baley weakly .     if amadiro was so persuasive  why should not the chairman simply order the investigation stopped .        the chairman     said daneel     is in a difficult political situation .  he agreed originally to allow you to be brought to aurora at dr .  fastolfe   s urging and he cannot so sharply reverse himself so soon without making himself look weak and irresolute   and without angering dr .  fastolfe  who is still a very influential figure in the legislature .        then why did he not simply turn down amadiro   s request .        dr .  amadiro is also influential  partner elijah  and likely to grow even more so .  the chairman must temporize by hearing both sides and by giving at least the appearance of deliberation before coming to a decision .        based on what .        on the merits of the case  we must presume .        then by tomorrow morning  i must come up with something that will persuade the chairman to side with fastolfe  rather than against him .  if i do that  will that mean victory .     daneel said     the chairman is not all powerful  but his influence is great .  if he comes out strongly on dr .  fastolfe   s side  then  under the present political conditions  dr .  fastolfe will probably win the backing of the legislature .     baley found himself beginning to think clearly again .     that would seem explanation enough for amadiro   s attempt to delay us .  he might have reasoned that i had nothing yet to offer the chairman and he needed only to delay to keep me from getting anything in the time that remained to me .        so it would seem  partner elijah .        and he let me go only when he thought he could rely on the storm continuing to keep me .        perhaps so  partner elijah .        in that case  we cannot allow the storm to stop us .     giskard said calmly     where do you wish to be taken  sir .        back to the establishment of dr .  fastolfe .     daneel said     may we have one moment   s more pause  partner elijah .  do you plan to tell dr .  fastolfe that you cannot continue the investigation .     baley said sharply     why do you say that .     it was a measure of his recovery that his voice was loud and angry .  daneel said     it is merely that i fear you might have forgotten for a moment that dr .  amadiro urged you to do so for the sake of earth   s welfare .        i have not forgotten     said baley grimly     and i am surprised  daneel  that you should think that that would influence me .  fastolfe must be exonerated and earth must send its settlers outward into the galaxy .  if there is danger in that from the globalists  that danger must be chanced .        but  in that case  partner elijah  why go back to dr .  fastolfe .  it doesn   t seem to me that we have anything of moment to report to him .  is there no direction in which we can further continue our investigation before reporting to dr .  fastolfe .     baley sat up in his seat and placed his hand on giskard  who was now entirely dry .  he said  in quite a normal voice     i am satisfied with the progress i have already made  daneel .  let   s get moving  giskard .  proceed to fastolfe   s establishment .     and then  tightening his fists and stiffening his body  baley added     what   s more  giskard  clear the windows .  i want to look out into the face of the storm .         .   baley held his breath in preparation for transparency .  the small box of the airfoil would no longer be entirely enclosed  it would no longer have unbroken walls .  as the windows clarified  there was a flash of light that came and went too quickly to do anything but darken the world by contrast baley could not prevent his cringe as he tried to steel himself for the thunder which  after a moment or two  rolled and grumbled .  daneel said pacifyingly     the storm will get no worse and soon enough it will recede .        i don   t care whether it recedes or not     said baley through trembling lips .     come on .  let   s go .     he was trying  for his own sake  to maintain the illusion of a human being in charge of robots .  the airfoil rose slightly in the air and at once underwent a sideways movement that tilted it so that baley felt himself pushing hard against giskard .  baley cried out  gasped out  rather      straighten the vehicle  giskard .     daneel placed his arm around baley   s shoulder and pulled him gently back his other arm was braced about a hand grip attached to the frame of the airfoil .  that cannot be done  partner elijah     daneel said .     there is a fairly strong wind .     baley felt his hair bristle .     you mean  we   re going to be blown away .        no  of course not     said daneel .     if the car were antigrav  a form of technology that does not  of course  exist  and if its mass and inertia were eliminated  then it would be blown like a feather high into the air .  however  we retain our full mass even when our jets lift us and poise us in the air  so our inertia resists the wind .  nevertheless  the wind makes us sway  even though the car remains completely under giskard   s control .        it doesn   t feel like it .     baley was conscious of a thin whine  which he imagined to be the wind curling around the body of the airfoil as it cut its way through the protesting atmosphere .  then the airfoil lurched and baley  who could not for his life have helped it  seized daneel in a desperate grip around the neck .  daneel waited a moment .  when baley had caught his breath and his grip grew less rigid  daneel released himself easily from the other   s embrace  while somewhat tightening the pressure of his own arm around baley .  he said     in order to maintain course  partner elijah  giskard must counter the wind by an asymmetric ordering of the airfoil   s jets .  they are sent to one side so as to cause the airfoil to lean into the wind and these jets have to be adjusted in force and direction as the wind itself changes force and direction .  there are none better at this than giskard  but  even so  there are occasional jiggles and lurches .  you must excuse giskard  then  if he does not participate in our conversation .  his attention is fully on the airfoil .        is it  it safe .     baley felt his stomach contract at the thought of playing with the wind in this fashion .  he was devoutly glad he had not eaten for some hours .  he could not  dared not  be sick in the close confines of the airfoil .  the very thought unsettled him further and he tried to concentrate on something else .  he thought of running the strips back on earth  of racing from one moving strip to its neighboring faster strip  and then to its neighboring still faster strip  and then back down into the slower regions  leaning expertly into the wind either way  in one direction as one fastered  an odd word used by no one but stripracers  and in the other direction  as one slowered .  in his younger days  daneel could do it without pause and without error .  daneel had adjusted to the need without trouble and  the one time they had run the strips together  daneel had done it perfectly .  well  this was just the same .  the airfoil was running strips .  absolutely .  it was the same .  not quite the same  to be sure .  in the city  the speed of the strips was a fixed quantity .  what wind there was blew in absolutely predictable fashion  since it was only the result of the movement of the strips .  here in the storm  however  the wind had a mind of its own or  rather  it depended on so many variables  baley was deliberately striving for rationality  that it seemed to have a mind of its own  and giskard had to allow for that .  that was all .  otherwise  it was just running the strips with an added complication .  the strips were moving at variable  and sharply changing  speeds .  baley muttered     what if we blow into a tree .        very unlikely  partner elijah .  giskard is far too skillful for that .  and we are only very slightly above the ground  so that the jets are particularly powerful .        then we   ll hit a rock .  it will cave us in underneath .        we will not hit a rock  partner elijah .        why not .  how on earth can giskard see where he   s going  anyway .     baley stared at the darkness ahead .     it is just about sunset     said daneel     and some light is making its way through the clouds .  it is enough for us to see by with the help of our headlights .  and as it grows darker  giskard will brighten the headlights .        what headlights .     asked baley rebelliously .     you do not see them very well because they have a strong infrared component  to which giskard   s eyes are sensitive but yours are not .  what   s more  the infrared is more penetrating than shorter wave light is and  for that reason  is more effective in rain  mist  and fog .     baley managed to feel some curiosity  even amid his uneasiness .     and your eyes  daneel .        my eyes  partner elijah  are designed to be as similar to those of human beings as possible .  that is regrettable  perhaps  at this moment .     the airfoil trembled and baley found himself holding his breath again .  he said in a whisper     spacer eyes are still adapted to earth   s sun  even if robot eyes aren   t .  a good thing  too  if it helps remind them they   re descended from earthpeople .     his voice faded out .  it was getting darker .  he could see nothing at all now and the intermittent flashes lighted nothing  either .  they were merely blinding .  he closed his eyes and that didn   t help .  he was the more conscious of the angry  threatening thunder .  should they not stop .  should they not wait for the worst of the storm to pass .  giskard suddenly said     the vehicle is not reacting properly .     baley felt the ride become ragged as though the machine was on wheels and was rolling over ridges .  daneel said     can it be storm damage  friend giskard .        it does not have the feel of that  friend daneel .  nor does it seem likely that this machine would suffer from this kind of damage in this or any other storm .     baley absorbed the exchange with difficulty .     damage .     he muttered .     what kind of damage .     giskard said     i should judge the compressor to be leaking  sir  but slowly .  it   s not the result of an ordinary puncture .        how did it happen  then .     baley asked .     deliberate damage  perhaps  while it was outside the administration building .  i have known  now  for some little time that we are being followed and carefully not being overtaken .        why  giskard .        a possibility  sir  is that they are waiting for us to break down completely .     the airfoil   s motion was becoming more ragged .     can you make it to dr .  fastolfe   s .        it would not seem so  sir .     baley tried to fling his reeling mind into action .     in that case  i   ve completely misjudged amadiro   s reason for delaying us .  he was keeping us there to have one or more of his robots damage the airfoil in such a way as to bring us down in the midst of desolation and lightning .        but why should he do that .     said daneel  sounding shocked .     to get you .    in a way  he already had you .        he doesn   t want me .  no one wants me     said baley with a somewhat feeble anger .     the danger is to you  daneel .        to me  partner elijah .        yes  you .  daneel .    giskard  choose a safe place to come down and  as soon as you do  daneel must get out of the car and be off to a place of safety .     daneel said     that is impossible  partner elijah .  i could not leave you when you are feeling ill  and most especially if there are those who pursue us and might do you harm .     baley said     daneel  they   re pursuing you .  you must leave .  as for me  i will stay in the airfoil .  i am in no danger .        how can i believe that .        please .  please .  how can i explain the whole thing with everything spinning   daneel     baley   s voice grew desperately calm     you are the most important individual here  far more important than giskard and i put together .  it   s not just that i care for you and want no harm to come to you .  all of humanity depends on you .  don   t worry about me  i   m one man  worry about billions .  daneel  please          .       baley could feel himself rocking back and forth .  or was it the airfoil .  was it breaking up altogether .  or was giskard losing control .  or was he taking evasive action .  baley didn   t care .  he didn   t care .  let the airfoil crash .  let it smash to bits .  he would welcome oblivion .  anything to get rid of this terrible fright  this total inability to come to terms with the universe .  except that he had to make sure that daneel got away   safely away .  but how .  everything was unreal and he was not going to be able to explain anything to these robots .  the situation was so clear to him  but how was he to transfer this understanding to these robots  to these nonmen  who understood nothing but their three laws and who would let all of earth and  in the long run  all of humanity go to hell because they could only be concerned with the one man under their noses .  why had robots ever been invented .  and then  oddly enough  giskard  the lesser of the two  came to his aid .  he said in his contentless voice     friend daneel  i cannot keep this airfoil in motion much longer .  perhaps it will be more suitable to do as mr .  baley suggests .  he has given you a very strong order .        can i leave him when he is unwell  friend giskard .     said daneel  perplexed .     you cannot take him out into the storm with you  friend daneel .  moreover  he seems so anxious for you to leave that it may do him harm for you to stay .     baley felt himself reviving .     yes  yes      he managed to croak out .     as giskard says .  giskard  you go with him  hide him  make sure he doesn   t return  then come back for me .     daneel said forcefully     that cannot be  partner elijah .  we cannot leave you alone  untended  unguarded .        no danger  i am in no danger .  do as i say      giskard said     those following are probably robots .  human beings would hesitate to come out in the storm .  and robots would not harm mr .  baley .     daneel said     they might take him away .        not into the storm  friend daneel  since that would work obvious harm to him .  i will bring the airfoil to a halt now  friend daneel .  you must be ready to do as mr .  baley orders .  i  too .        good .     whispered baley .     good .     he was grateful for the simpler brain that could more easily be impressed and that lacked the ability to get lost and uncertain in ever expanding refinements .  vaguely  he thought of daneel trapped between his perception of baley   s ill being and the urgency of the order  and of his brain snapping under the conflict .  baley thought  no no  daneel .  just do as i say and don   t question it .  he lacked the strength  almost the will  to articulate it and he let the order remain a thought .  the airfoil came down with a bump and a short  harsh  scraping noise .  the doors flew open  one on either side  and then closed with a soft  sighing noise .  at once  the robots were gone .  having come to their decision  there was no hesitation and they moved with a speed that human beings could not duplicate .  baley took a deep breath and shuddered .  the airfoil was rock steady now .  it was part of the ground .  he was suddenly aware of how much of his misery had been the result of the swaying and bucking of the vehicle  the feeling of insubstantiality  of not being connected to the universe but of being at the mercy of inanimate  uncaring forces .  now  however  it was still and he opened his eyes .  he had not been aware that they had been closed .  there was still lightning on the horizon and the thunder was a subdued mutter  while the wind  meeting a more resistant and less yielding object now than it had hitherto  keened a higher note than before .  it was dark .  baley   s eyes were no more than human and he saw no light of any kind  other than the occasional blip of lightning .  the sun must surely have set and the clouds were thick .  and for the first time since baley had left earth  he was alone .      .   alone .  he had been too ill  too beside himself  to make proper sense .  even now  he found himself struggling to understand what it was he should have done and would have done  if he had had room in his tottering mind for more than the one thought that daneel must leave .  for instance  he had not asked where he now was  what he was near  where daneel and giskard were planning to go .  he did not know how any portion of the grounded airfoil worked .  he could not  of course  make it move  but he might have had it supply heat if he felt cold or turn off the heat if there were too much  except that he did not know how to direct the machine to do either .  he did not know how to opacify the windows if he wanted to be enclosed or how to open a door if he wanted to leave .  the only thing he could do now was to wait for giskard to come back for him .  surely that was what giskard would expect him to do .  the orders to him had simply been  come back for me .  there had been no indication that baley would change position in any way and giskard   s clear and uncluttered mind would surely interpret the    come back    with the assumption that he was to come back to the airfoil .  baley tried to adjust himself to that .  in a way  it was a relief merely to wait  to have to make no decisions for a while  because there were no decisions he could possibly make .  it was a relief to be steady and to feel at rest and to be rid of the terrible light flashes and the disturbing crashes of sound .  perhaps he might even allow himself to go to sleep .  and then he stiffened .    dare he do that .  they were being pursued .  they were under observation .  the airfoil  while parked and waiting for them outside the administration building of the robotics institute  had been tampered with and no doubt the tamperers would soon be upon him .  he was waiting for them  too  and not for giskard only .  had he thought it out clearly in the midst of his misery .  the machine had been tampered with outside the administration building .  that might have been done by anyone  but most likely by someone who knew it was there  and who would know that better than amadiro .  amadiro had intended delay until the storm .  that was obvious .  he was to travel in the storm and he was to break down in the storm .  amadiro had studied earth and its population  he boasted of that .  he would know quite clearly just what difficulty earthpeople would have with the outside generally and with a thunderstorm in particular .  he would be quite certain that baley would be reduced to complete helplessness .  but why should he want that .  to bring baley back to the institute .  he had already had him  but he had had a baley in the full possession of his faculties and along with him he had had two robots perfectly capable of defending baley physically .  it would be different now .  if the airfoil were disabled in a storm  baley would be disabled emotionally .  he would even be unconscious  perhaps  and would certainly not be able to resist being brought back .  nor would the two robots object .  with baley clearly in  their only appropriate reaction would be to assist amadiro   s robots in rescuing him .  in fact  the two robots would have to come along with baley and would do so helplessly .  and if anyone ever questioned amadiro   s action  he could say that he had feared for baley in the storm  that he had tried to keep him at the institute and failed  that he had sent his robots to trail him and assure his safety  and that  when the airfoil came to grief in the storm  those robots brought baley back to haven .  unless people understood that it had been amadiro who had ordered the airfoil tampered with  and who would believe that  and how could one prove it .    the only possible public reaction would be to praise amadiro for his humanitarian feelings  all the more astonishing for having been expressed toward a subhuman earthman .  and what would amadiro do with baley then .  nothing  except to keep him quiet and helpless for a time .  baley was not himself the quarry .  that was the point .  amadiro would also have two robots and they would now be helpless .  their instructions forced them  in the strongest manner  to guard baley and  if baley were ill and being cared for  they could only follow amadiro   s orders if those orders were clearly and apparently for baley   s benefit .  nor would baley be  perhaps  sufficiently himself to protect them with further orders   certainly not if he were kept under sedation .  it was clear .  it was clear .  amadiro had had baley  daneel  and giskard  but in unusable fashion .  he had sent them out into the storm in order to bring them back and have them again  in usable fashion .  especially daneel .  it was daneel who was the key .  to be sure  fastolfe would be searching for them eventually and would find them  too  and retrieve them  but by then it would be too late  wouldn   t it .  and what did amadiro want with daneel .  baley  his head aching  was sure he knew  but how could he possibly prove it .  he could think no more .    if he could opacify the windows  he could make a little interior world again  enclosed and motionless  and then maybe he could continue his thoughts .  but he did not know how to opacify the windows .  he could only sit there and look at the flagging storm beyond those windows  hear the whip of rain against the windows  watch the fading lightning  and listen to the muttering thunder .  he closed his eyes tightly .  the eyelids made a wall  too  but he dared not sleep .  the car door on his right opened .  he heard the sighing noise it made .  he felt the cool  damp breeze enter  the temperature drop  the sharp smell of things green and wet enter and drown out the faint and friendly smell of oil and upholstery that reminded him somehow of the city that he wondered if he would ever see again .  he opened his eyes and there was the odd sensation of a robotic face staring at him  and drifting sideways  yet not really moving .  baley felt dizzy .  the robot  seen as a darker shadow against the darkness  seemed a large one .  he had  somehow  an air of capability about him .  he said     your pardon  sir .  did you not have the company of two robots .        gone     muttered baley  acting as ill as he could and aware that it did not require acting .  a brighter flash of the heavens made its way through the eyelids that were now half open .     gone .  gone where  sir .     and then  as he waited for an answer  he said     are you ill  sir .     baley felt a distant twinge of satisfaction within the inner scrap of himself that was still capable of thinking .  if the robot had been without special instruction  he would have responded to baley   s clear signs of illness before doing anything else .  to have asked first about the robots implied hard and close pressed directions as to their importance .  it fit .  he tried to assume a strength and normality he did not possess and said     i am well .  don   t concern yourself with me .     it could not possibly have convinced an ordinary robot  but this one had been so intensified in connection with daneel  obviously  that he accepted it .  he said     where have the robots gone  sir .        back to the robotics institute .        to the institute .  why  sir .        they were called by master roboticist amadiro and he ordered them to return .  i am waiting for them .        but why did you not go with them  sir .        master roboticist amadiro did not wish me to be exposed to the storm .  he ordered me to wait here .  i am following master roboticist amadiro   s orders .     he hoped the repetition of the prestige filled name with the inclusion of the honorific  together with the repetition of the word    order     would have its effect on the robot and persuade him to leave baley where he was .  on the other hand  if they had been instructed  with particular care  to bring back daneel  and if they were convinced that daneel was already on his way back to the institute  there would be a decline in the intensity of their need in connection with that robot .  they would have time to think of baley again .  they would say   the robot said     but it appears you are not well  sir .     baley felt another twinge of satisfaction .  he said     i am well .     behind the robot  he could vaguely see a crowding of several other robots  he could not count them  with their faces gleaming in the occasional lightning flash .  as baley   s eyes adapted to the return of darkness  he could see the dim shine of their eyes .  he turned his head .  there were robots at the left door  too  though that remained closed .  how many had amadiro sent .  were they to have been returned by force  if necessary .  he said     master roboticist amadiro   s orders were that my robots were to return to the institute and i was to wait .  you see that they are returning and that i am waiting .  if you were sent to help  if you have a vehicle  find the robots  who are on their way back  and transport them .  this airfoil is no longer operative .     he tried to say it all without hesitation and firmly  as a well man would .  he did not entirely succeed .     they have returned on foot  sir .     baley said     find them .  your orders are clear .     there was hesitation .  clear hesitation .  baley finally remembered to move his right foot  he hoped properly .  he should have done it before  but his physical body was not responding properly to his thoughts .  still the robots hesitated and baley grieved over that .  he was not a spacer .  he did not know the proper words  the proper tone  the proper air with which to handle robots with the proper efficiency .  a skilled roboticist could  with a gesture  a lift of an eyebrow  direct a robot as though it were a marionette of which he held the strings .    especially if the robot were of his own design .  but baley was only an earthman .  he frowned  that was easy to do in his misery  and whispered a weary    go .     and motioned with his hands .  perhaps that added the last small and necessary quantity of weight to his order  or perhaps an end had simply been reached to the time it took for the robots    positronic pathways to determine  by voltage and counter voltage  how to sort out their instructions according to the three laws .  either way  they had made up their minds and  after that  there was no further hesitation .  they moved back to their vehicle  whatever and wherever it was  with such determined speed that they seemed simply to disappear .  the door the robot had held open now closed of its own accord .  baley had moved his foot in order to place it in the pathway of the closing door .  he wondered distantly if his foot would be cut off cleanly or if its bones would be crushed  but he didn   t move it .  surely no vehicle would be designed to make such a misadventure possible .  he was alone again .  he had forced robots to leave a patently unwell human being by playing on the force of the orders given them by a competent robot master who had been intent on strengthening the second law for his own purposes  and had done it to the point where baley   s own quite apparent lies had subordinated the first law to it .  how well he had done it  baley thought with distant self satisfaction  and became aware that the door which had swung shut was still ajar  held so by his foot  and that that foot had not been the least bit damaged as a result .      .   baley felt cool air curling about his foot and a sprinkle of cool water .  it was a frighteningly abnormal thing to sense  yet he could not allow the door to close  for he would then not know how to open it .   how did the robots open those doors .  undoubtedly  it was no puzzle to members of the culture  but in his reading on auroran life  there was no careful instruction of just how one opens the door of a standard airfoil .  everything of importance is taken for granted .  you   re supposed to know  even though you are  in theory  being informed .   he was groping in his pockets as he thought this and even the pockets were not easy to find .  they were not in the right places and they were sealed  so that they had to be opened by fumbles till he found the precise motion that caused the seal to part .  he pulled out a handkerchief  balled it  and placed it between the door and jamb so that the door would not entirely close .  he then removed his foot .  now to think  if he could .  there was no point to keeping the door open unless he meant to get out .  was there  however  any purpose in getting out .  if he waited where he was  giskard would eventually come back for him and  presumably  lead him to safety .  dare he wait .  he did not know how long it would take giskard to see daneel to safety and then return .  but neither did he know how long it would take the pursuing robots to decide they would not find daneel and giskard on any road leading back to the institute .   surely it was impossible that daneel and giskard had actually moved backward toward the institute in search of sanctuary .  baley had not actually ordered them not to  but what if that were the only feasible route .    no .  impossible .   baley shook his head in silent denial of the possibility and felt it ache in response .  he put his hands to it and gritted his teeth .  how long would the pursuing robots continue to search before they would decide that baley had misled them  or had been himself misled .  would they then return and take him in custody  very politely and with great care not to harm him .  could he hold them off by telling them he would die if exposed to the storm .  would they believe that .  would they call the institute to report .  surely they would do that .  and would human beings then arrive .  they would not be overly concerned about his welfare .  if baley got out of the car and found some hiding place in the surrounding trees  it would be that much harder for the pursuing robots to locate him  and that would gain him time .  it would also be harder for giskard to locate him  but giskard would be under a much more intense instruction to guard baley than the pursuing robots were to find him .  the primary task of the former would be to locate baley  and of the latter  to locate daneel .  besides  giskard was programmed by fastolfe himself and amadiro  however skillful  was no match for fastolfe .  surely  then  all things being equal  giskard would be back before the other robots could possibly be .  but would all things be equal .  with a faint attempt at cynicism  baley thought  i   m worn out and can   t really think .  i   m merely seizing desperately at whatever will console me .  still  what could he do but play the odds  as he conceived the odds to be .  he leaned against the door and was out into the open .  the handkerchief fell out into the wet  rank grass and he automatically bent down to pick it up  holding it in his hands as he staggered away from the car .  he was overwhelmed by the gusts of rain that soaked his face and hands .  after a short while  his wet clothes were clinging to his body and he was shivering with cold .  there was a piercing splitting of the sky  too quick for him to close his eyes against  and then a sharp hammering that stiffened him in terror and made him clap his hands over his ears .  had the storm returned .  or did it sound louder only because he was out in the open .  he had to move .  he had to move away from the car  so that the pursuers would not find him too easily .  he must not waver and remain in its vicinity or he might as well have stayed inside  and dry .  he tried to wipe his face with the handkerchief  but it was as wet as his face was and he let it go .  it was useless .  he moved on  hands outstretched .  was there a moon that circled aurora .  he seemed to recall there had been mention of such a thing and he would have welcomed its light .    but what did it matter .  even if it existed and were in the sky now  the clouds would obscure it .  he felt something .  he could not see what it was  but he knew it to be the rough bark of a tree .  undoubtedly a tree .  even a city man would know that much .  and then he remembered that lightning might hit trees and might kill people .  he could not remember that he had ever read a description of how it felt to be hit by lightning or if there were any measures to prevent it .  he knew of no one on earth who had been hit by lightning .  he felt his way about the tree and was in an agony of apprehension and fear .  how much was halfway around  so that he would end up moving in the same direction .  onward .  the underbrush was thick now and hard to get through .  it was like bony  clutching fingers holding him .  he pulled petulantly and he heard the tearing of cloth .  onward .  his teeth were chattering and he was trembling .  another flash .  not a bad one .  for a moment  he caught a glimpse of his surroundings .  trees .  a number of them .  he was in a grove of trees .  were many trees more dangerous than one tree where lightning was concerned .  he didn   t know .  would it help if he didn   t actually touch a tree .  he didn   t know that  either .  death by lightning simply wasn   t a factor in the cities and the historical novels  and sometimes histories  that mentioned it never went into detail .  he looked up at the dark sky and felt the wetness coming down .  he wiped at his wet eyes with his wet hands .  he stumbled onward  trying to step high .  at one point  he splashed through a narrow stream of water  sliding over the pebbles underlaying it .  how strange .  it made him no wetter than he was .  he went on again .  the robots would not find him .  would giskard .  he didn   t know where he was .  or where he was going .  or how far he was from anything .  if he wanted to return to the car  he couldn   t .  if he was trying to find himself  he couldn   t .  and the storm would continue forever and he would finally dissolve and pour down in a little stream of baley and no one would ever find him again .  and his dissolved molecules would float down to the ocean .  was there an ocean on aurora .  of course there was .  it was larger than earth   s  but there was more ice at the auroran poles .  ah  he would float to the ice and freeze there  glistening in the cold orange sun .  his hands were touching a tree again  wet hands  wet tree   rumble of thunder  funny he didn   t see the flash of lightning   lightning came first  was he hit .  he didn   t feel anything  except the ground .  the ground was under him because his fingers were scrabbling into cold mud .  he turned his head so he could breathe .  it was rather comfortable .  he didn   t have to walk anymore .  he could wait .  giskard would find him .  he was suddenly very sure of it .  giskard would have to find him because   no  he had forgotten the because .  it was the second time he had forgotten something .  before he went to sleep   was it the same thing he had forgotten each time .    the same thing .    it didn   t matter .  it would be all right  all   and he lay there  alone and unconscious  in the rain at the base of a tree  while the storm beat on .      again gladia     .   afterward  looking back and estimating times  it would appear that baley had remained unconscious not less than ten minutes and not more than twenty .  at the time  though  it might have been anything from zero to infinity .  he was conscious of a voice .  he could not hear the words it spoke  just a voice .  he puzzled over the fact that it sounded odd and solved the matter to his satisfaction by recognizing it as a woman   s voice .  there were arms around him  lifting him  heaving him .  one arm  his arm  dangled .  his head lolled .  he tried feebly to straighten out  but nothing happened .  the woman   s voice again .  he opened his eyes wearily .  he was aware of being cold and wet and suddenly realized that water was not striking him .  and it was not dark  not entirely .  there was a dim suffusing of light and  by it  he saw a robot   s face .  he recognized it .     giskard     he whispered and with that he remembered the storm and the flight .  and giskard had reached him first  he had found him before the other robots had .  baley thought contentedly  i knew he would .  he let his eyes close again and felt himself moving rapidly but with the slight  yet definite  unevenness that meant he was being carried by someone who was walking .  then a stop and a slow adjustment until he was resting on something quite warm and comfortable .  he knew it was the seat of a car covered  perhaps  with toweling  but did not question how he knew .  then there was the sensation of smooth motion through the air and the feeling of soft absorbent fabric over his face and hands  the tearing open of his blouse  cold air upon his chest  and then the drying and blotting again .  after that  the sensations crowded in upon him .  he was in an establishment .  there were flashes of walls  of illumination  of objects  miscellaneous shapes of furnishings  which he saw now and then when he opened his eyes .  he felt his clothes being stripped off methodically and made a few feeble and useless attempts to cooperate  then he felt warm water and vigorous scrubbing .  it went on and on and he didn   t want it to stop .  at one point  a thought occurred to him and he seized the arm that was holding him .     giskard .  giskard .     he heard giskard   s voice     i am here  sir .        giskard  is daneel safe .        he is quite safe  sir .        good .     baley closed his eyes again and made no effort whatever in connection with the drying .  he felt himself turned over and over in the stream of dry air and then he was being dressed again in something like a warm robe .  luxury .  nothing like this had happened to him since he was an infant and he was suddenly sorry for the babies for whom everything was done and who were not sufficiently conscious of it to enjoy it .  or did they .  was the hidden memory of that infant luxury a determinant of adult behavior .  was his own feeling now just an expression of the delight of being an infant again .  and he had heard a woman   s voice .  mother .  no  that couldn   t possibly be .    mamma .  he was sitting in a chair now .  he could sense as much and he could also feel  somehow  that the short  happy period of renewed infancy was coming to an end .  he had to return to the sad world of self consciousness and self help .  but there had been a woman   s voice .    what woman .  baley opened his eyes .     gladia .         .   it was a question  a surprised question  but deep within himself he was not really surprised .  thinking back  he had  of course  recognized her voice .  he looked around .  giskard was standing in his alcove  but he ignored him .  first things first .  he said     where   s daneel .     gladia said     he has cleaned and dried himself in the robot   s quarters and he has dry clothing .  he is surrounded by my household staff and they have their instructions .  i can tell you that no outsider will approach within fifty meters of my establishment in any direction without our all knowing it at once .   giskard is cleaned and dried as well .        yes  i can see that     said baley .  he was not concerned with giskard  only with daneel .  he was relieved that gladia seemed to accept the necessity of guarding daneel and that he would not have to face the complications of explaining the matter .  yet there was one breach in the wall of security and a note of querulousness entered in his voice as he said     why did you leave him  gladia .  with you gone  there was no human being in the house to stop the approach of a band of outside robots .  daneel could have been taken by force .        nonsense     said gladia with spirit .     we were not gone long and dr .  fastolfe had been informed .  many of his robots had joined mine and he could be on the spot in minutes if needed   and i   d like to see any band of outside robots withstand him .        have you seen daneel since you returned  gladia .        of course .  he   s safe  i tell you .        thank you .     baley relaxed and closed his eyes .  oddly enough  he thought  it wasn   t so bad .  of course it wasn   t .  he had survived  hadn   t he .  when he thought that  something inside himself grinned and was happy .  he had survived  hadn   t he .  he opened his eyes and said     how did you find me  gladia .        it was giskard .  they had come here  both of them  and giskard explained the situation to me quickly .   i set right about securing daneel  but he wouldn   t budge until i had promised to order giskard out after you .  he was very eloquent .  his responses with respect to you are very intense  elijah .     daneel remained behind  of course .  it made him very unhappy  but giskard insisted that i order him to stay at the very top of my voice .  you must have given giskard some mighty strict orders .  then we got in touch with dr .  fastolfe and  after that  we took my personal airfoil .     baley shook his head wearily .     you should not have come along  gladia .  your place was here  making sure daneel was safe .     gladia   s face twisted into scorn .     and leave you dying in the storm  for all we knew .  or being taken up by dr .  fastolfe   s enemies .  i have a little holograph of myself letting that happen .  no  elijah  i might have been needed to keep the other robots away from you if they had gotten to you first .  i may not be much good in most ways  but any solarian can handle a mob of robots  let me tell you .  we   re used to it .        but how did you find me .        it wasn   t so terribly hard .  actually  your airfoil wasn   t far away  so that we could have walked it  except for the storm .  we      baley said     you mean we had almost made it to fastolfe   s .        yes     said gladia .     either your airfoil  in being damaged  wasn   t damaged sufficiently to force you to a standstill sooner or giskard   s skill kept it going for longer than the vandals had anticipated .  which is a good thing .  if you had come down closer to the institute  they might have gotten you all .  anyway  we took my airfoil to where yours had come down .  giskard knew where it was  of course  and we got out         and you got all wet  didn   t you  gladia .        not a bit     she replied .     i had a large rain shade and a light sphere  too .  my shoes got muddy and my feet got a little damp because i didn   t have time to spray on latex  but there   s no harm in that .    anyway  we were back at your airfoil less than half an hour after giskard and daneel had left you and  of course  you weren   t there .        i had tried      began baley .     yes  we know .  i thought they  the others  had taken you away because giskard said you were being followed .  but giskard found your handkerchief about fifty meters from the airfoil and he said that you must have wandered off in that direction .  giskard said it was an illogical thing to do  but that human beings were often illogical  so that we should search for you .    so we looked  both of us  using the lightsphere  but it was he found you .  he said he saw the infrared glimmer of your body heat at the base of the tree and we brought you back .     baley said  with a spark of annoyance     why was my leaving an illogical thing to do .        he didn   t say  elijah .  do you wish to ask him .     she gestured toward giskard .  baley said     giskard  what   s this .     giskard   s impassivity was disrupted at once and his eyes focused on baley .  he said     i felt that you had exposed yourself to the storm unnecessarily .  if you had waited  we would have brought you here sooner .        the other robots might have gotten to me first .        they did  but you had sent them away  sir .        how do you know that .        there were many robotic footprints around the doors on either side  sir  but there was no sign of dampness within the airfoil  as there would have been if wet arms had reached in to lift you out .  i judged you would not have gotten out of the airfoil of your own accord in order to join them  sir .  and  having sent them away  you need not have feared they would return very quickly  since it was daneel they were after  by your own estimate of the situation  and not you .  in addition  you might have been certain that i would have been back quickly .     baley muttered     i reasoned precisely in that manner but i felt that confusing the issue might help further .  i did what seemed best to me and you did find me  even so .        yes  sir .     baley said     but why bring me here .  if we were close to gladia   s establishment  we were just as close  perhaps closer  to dr .  fastolfe   s .        not quite  sir .  this residence was somewhat closer and i judged  from the urgency of your orders  that every moment counted in securing daneel   s safety .  daneel concurred in this  though he was most reluctant to leave you .  once he was here  i felt you would want to be here  too  so that you could  if you desired  assure yourself of his safety firsthand .     baley nodded and said grumpily  he was still annoyed at that remark concerning his illogicality      you did well  giskard .     gladia said     is it important that you see dr .  fastolfe  elijah .  i can have him summoned here .  or you can view him trimensionally .     baley leaned back in his chair again .  he had leisure to realize that his thought processes were blunted and that he was very tired .  it would do him no good to face fastolfe now .  he said     no .  i   ll see him tomorrow after breakfast .  time enough .  and then i think i   ll be seeing this man  kelden amadiro  the head of the robotics institute .  and a high official  what d   you call him .    the chairman .  he will be there  too  i suppose .        you look terribly tired  elijah     said gladia .     of course  we don   t have those microorganisms  those germs and viruses  that you have on earth and you   ve been cleaned out  so you won   t get any of the diseases they have all over your planet  but you   re clearly tired .     baley thought  after all that  no cold .  no flu .  no pneumonia .   there was something to being on a spacer world at that .  he said     i admit i   m tired  but that can be cured by a bit of rest .        are you hungry .  it   s dinnertime .     baley made a face .     i don   t feel like eating .        i   m not sure that   s wise .  you don   t want a heavy meal  perhaps  but how about some hot soup .  it will do you good .     baley felt the urge to smile .  she might be solarian  but given the proper circumstances she sounded exactly like an earthwoman .  he suspected that this would be true of aurorans as well .  there are some things that differences in culture don   t touch .  he said     do you have soup available .  i don   t want to be a problem .        how can you be a problem .  i have a staff  not a large one  as on solaria  but enough to prepare any reasonable item of food on short order .    now you just sit there and tell me what kind of soup you would like .  it will all be taken care of .     baley couldn   t resist .     chicken soup .        of course .     then innocently     just what i would have suggested  and with lumps of chicken  so that it will be substantial .     the bowl was put before him with surprising speed .  he said     aren   t you going to eat  gladia .        i   ve eaten already  while you were being bathed and treated .        treated .        only routine biochemical adjustment  elijah .  you had been rather psychic damaged and we wanted no repercussions .    do eat .     baley lifted an experimental spoonful to his lips .  it was not bad chicken soup  though it had the queer tendency of auroran food to be rather spicier than baley would prefer .  or perhaps it was prepared with different spices than those he was used to .  he remembered his mother suddenly  a sharp thrust of memory that made her appear younger than he himself was right now .  he remembered her standing over him when he rebelled at eating his    nice soup .     she would say to him     come  lije .  this is real chicken and very expensive .  even the spacers don   t have anything better .     they didn   t .  he called to her in his mind across the years  they don   t  mom .  really .  if he could trust memory and allow for the power of youthful taste buds  his mother   s chicken soup  when it wasn   t dulled by repetition  was far superior .  he sipped again and again  and when he finished  he muttered in a shamefaced way     would there be a little more .        as much as you want  elijah .        just a little more .     gladia said to him  as he was finishing     elijah  this meeting tomorrow morning         yes  gladia .        does it mean that your investigation is over .  do you know what happened to jander .     baley said judiciously     i have an idea as to what might have happened to jander .  i don   t think i can necessarily persuade anyone that i am right .        then why are you having the conference .        it   s not my idea  gladia .  it   s master roboticist amadiro   s idea .  he objects to the investigation and he   s going to try to have me sent back to earth .        is he the one who tampered with your airfoil and tried to have his robots take daneel .        i think he is .        well  can   t he be tried and convicted and punished for that .        he certainly could     said baley feelingly     except for the very small problem that i can   t prove it .        and can he do all that and get away with it  and stop the investigation  too .        i   m afraid he has a good chance of being able to do so .  as he himself says  people who don   t expect justice don   t have to suffer disappointment .        but he mustn   t .  you mustn   t let him .  you   ve got to complete your investigation and find out the truth .     baley sighed .     what if i can   t find out the truth .  or what if i can  but can   t make people listen to me .        you can find out the truth .  and you can make people listen to you .        you have a touching faith in me  gladia .  still  if the auroran world legislature wants to send me back and orders the investigation ended  there   s nothing i   m going to be able to do about it .        surely you won   t be willing to go back with nothing accomplished .        of course i won   t .  it   s worse than just accomplishing nothing  gladia .  i   ll go back with my career ruined and with earth   s future destroyed .        then don   t let them do that  elijah .     and he said     jehoshaphat  gladia  i   m going to try not to  but i can   t lift a planet with my bare hands .  you can   t ask me for miracles .     gladia nodded and  eyes downcast  put her fist to her mouth  sitting there motionlessly  as though in thought .  it took a while for baley to realize that she was weeping soundlessly .      .   baley stood up quickly and walked around the table to her .  he noted absently  and with some annoyance  that his legs were trembling and that there was a tic in the muscle of his right thigh .     gladia     he said urgently     don   t cry .        don   t bother  elijah     she whispered .     it will pass .     he stood helplessly at her side  reaching out to her yet hesitating .     i   m not touching you     he said .     i don   t think i had better do so  but         oh  touch me .  touch me .  i   m not all that fond of my body and i won   t catch anything from you .  i   m not  what i used to be .     so baley reached out and touched her elbow and stroked it very slightly and clumsily with his fingertips .     i   ll do what i can tomorrow  gladia     he said .     i   ll give it my very best try .     she rose at that  turned toward him  and said     oh  elijah .     automatically  scarcely knowing what he was doing  baley held out his arms .  and  just as automatically  she walked into them and he was holding her while her head cradled against his chest .  he held her as lightly as he could  waiting for her to realize that she was embracing an earthman .   she had undoubtedly embraced a humaniform robot  but he had been no earthman .   she sniffed loudly and spoke while her mouth was half obscured in baley   s shirt .  she said     it isn   t fair .  it   s because i   m a solarian .  no one really cares what happened to jander and they would if i were an auroran .  it just boils down to prejudice and politics .     baley thought  spacers are people .  this is exactly what jessie would say in a similar situation .  and if it were gremionis who was holding gladia  he   d say exactly what i   ll say  if i knew what i would say .  and then he said     that   s not entirely so .  i   m sure dr .  fastolfe cares what happened to jander .        no  he doesn   t .  not really .  he just wants to have his way in the legislature  and that amadiro wants to have his way  and either one would trade jander for his way .        i promise you  gladia  i won   t trade jander for anything .        no .  if they tell you that you can go back to earth with your career saved and no penalty for your world  provided you forget all about jander  what would you do .        there   s no use setting up hypothetical situations that can   t possibly come to pass .  they   re not going to give me anything in return for abandoning jander .  they   re just going to try to send me back with nothing at all except ruin for me and my world .  but  if they were to let me  i would get the man who destroyed jander and see to it that he was adequately punished .        what do you mean if they were to let you .  make them let you .     baley smiled bitterly .     if you think aurorans pay no attention to you because you   re a solarian  imagine how little you would get if you were from earth  as i am .     he held her closer  forgetting he was from earth  even as he said the word .     but i   ll try  gladia .  it   s no use raising hopes  but i don   t have a completely empty hand .  i   ll try      his voice trailed off .     you keep saying you   ll try .    but how .     she pushed away from him a bit to look up into his face .  baley said  bewildered     why  i may         find the murderer .        whatever .    gladia  please  i must sit down .     he reached out for the table  leaning on it .  she said     what is it  elijah .        i   ve had a difficult day  obviously  and i haven   t quite recovered  i think .        you   d better go to bed  then .        to tell the truth  gladia  i would like to .     she released him  her face full of concern and with no further room in it for tears .  she lifted her arm and made a rapid motion and he was  it seemed to him  surrounded by robots at once .  and when he was in bed eventually and the last robot had left him  he found himself staring up at darkness .  he could not tell whether it was still raining outside or whether some feeble lightning flashes were still making their last sleepy sparks  but he knew he heard no thunder .  he drew a deep breath and thought  now what is it i have promised gladia .  what will happen tomorrow .  last act  failure .  and as baley drifted into the borderland of sleep  he thought of that unbelievable flash of illumination that had come before sleep .      .   twice before  it had happened .  once the night before when  as now  he was falling asleep and once earlier this evening when he had slipped into unconsciousness beneath the tree in the storm .  each time  something had occurred to him  some enlightenment that had unmystified the problem as the lightning had undarkened the night .  and it had stayed with him as briefly as the lightning had .  what was it .  would it come to him again .  this time  he tried consciously to seize it  to catch the elusive truth .    or was it the elusive illusion .  was it the slipping away of conscious reason and the coming of attractive nonsense that one couldn   t analyze properly in the absence of a properly thinking brain .  the search for whatever it was  however  slid slowly away .  it would no more come on call than a unicorn would in a world in which unicorns did not exist .  it was easier to think of gladia and of how she had felt .  there had been the direct touch of the silkiness of her blouse  but beneath it were the small and delicate arms  the smooth back .  would he have dared to kiss her if his legs had not begun to buckle beneath him .  or would that have been going too far .  he heard his breath exhale in a soft snore and  as always  that embarrassed him .  he flogged himself awake and thought of gladia again .  before he left  surely  but not if he could gain nothing for her in ret   would that be payment for services ren   he heard the soft snore again and cared less this time .  gladia   he had never thought he would see her again  let alone touch her  let alone hold her  hold her   and he had no way of telling at what point he passed from thought to dream .  he was holding her again  as before   but there was no blouse  and her skin was warm and soft  and his hand moved slowly down the slope of shoulder blade and down the hidden ridges of her ribs   there was a total aura of reality about it .  all of his senses were engaged .  he smelled her hair and his lips tasted the faint  faint salt of her skin  and now somehow they were no longer standing .  had they lain down or were they lying down from the start .  and what had happened to the light .  he felt the mattress beneath him and the cover over him   darkness  and she was still in his arms and her body was bare .  he was shocked awake .     gladia .     rising inflection  disbelieving      shh .  elijah .     she placed the fingers of one hand gently on his lips .     don   t say anything .     she might as well have asked him to stop the current of his blood .  he said     what are you doing .     she said     don   t you know what i   m doing .  i   m in bed with you .        but why .        because i want to .     her body moved against his .  she pinched the top of his night garment and the seam that held it together fell apart .     don   t move  elijah .  you   re tired and i don   t want you to wear yourself out further .     elijah felt a warmth stirring within him .  he decided not to protect gladia against herself .  he said     i   m not that tired  gladia .        no     she said sharply .     rest .  i want you to rest .  don   t move .     her mouth was on his as though intent on forcing him to keep quiet .  he relaxed and the small thought flitted past him that he was following orders  that he was tired and was willing to be done to rather than to do .  and  tinged with shame  it occurred to him that it rather diluted his guilt .   i couldn   t help it  he heard himself say .  she made me .   jehoshaphat  how cowardly .  how unbearably demeaning .  but those thoughts washed away  too .  somehow there was soft music in the air and the temperature had risen a bit .  the cover had vanished and so had his nightclothes .  he felt his head moved into the cradle of her arms and pressed against softness .  with a detached surprise  he knew  from her position  that the softness was her left breast and that it was centered  contrastingly  with its nipple hard against his lips .  softly  she was singing to the music  a sleepily joyful tune he did not recognize .  she rocked gently back and forth and her fingertips grazed his chin and neck  he relaxed  content to do nothing  to let her initiate and carry through every activity .  when she moved his arms  he did not resist and let them rest wherever she placed them .  he did not help and  when he did respond with heightened excitement and climax  it was only out of helplessness to do otherwise .  she seemed tireless and he did not want her to stop .  aside from the sensuality of sexual response  he felt again what he had felt earlier  the total luxury of the infant   s passivity .  and  finally  he could respond no more and  it seemed  she could do no more and she lay with her head in the hollow where his left shoulder met his chest and her left arm lay across his ribs  her fingers stroking the short  curling hairs tenderly .  he seemed to hear her murmuring     thank you   thank you      for what .  he wondered .  he was scarcely conscious of her now  for this utterly soft end of a hard day was as soporific as the fabled nepenthe and he could feel himself slipping away  as though his fingertips were relaxing from the edge of the cliff of harsh reality in order that he might drop  drop  through the soft clouds of gathering sleep into the slowly swaying ocean of dreams .  and as he did so  what had not come on call came of itself .  for the third time  the curtain was lifted and all the events since he had left earth shuffled once more into hard focus .  again  it was all clear .  he struggled to speak  to hear the words he needed to hear  to fix them and make them part of his thought processes  but though he clutched at them with every tendril of his mind  they slipped past and through and were gone .  so that  in this respect  baley   s second day on aurora ended very much as his first had .      the chairman     .   when baley opened his eyes  it was to find sunlight streaming through the window and he welcomed it .  to his still sleepy surprise  he welcomed it .  it meant the storm was over and it was as though the storm had never happened .  sunlight  when viewed only as an alternative to the smooth  soft  warm  controlled light of the cities   could only be considered harsh and uncertain .  but compare it with the storm and it was the promise of peace itself .  everything  baley thought  is relative and he knew he would never think of sunshine as entirely evil again .     partner elijah .     daneel was standing at the side of the bed .  a little behind him stood giskard .  baley   s long face dissolved in a rare smile of pure pleasure .  he held out his hands  one to each .     jehoshaphat  men     and he was totally unaware  at the moment  of any inappropriateness in the word     when i last saw you two together  i wasn   t in the least sure i would ever see either of you again .        surely     said daneel softly     none of us would have been harmed under any circumstances .        with the sunlight coming in  i see that     said baley .     but last night  i felt as though the storm would kill me and i was certain you were in deadly danger  daneel .  it even seemed possible that giskard might be damaged in some way  trying to defend me against overwhelming odds .  melodramatic  i admit  but i wasn   t quite myself  you know .        we were aware of that  sir     said giskard .     that was what made it difficult for us to leave you  despite your urgent order .  we trust that this is not a source of displeasure for you at present .        not at all  giskard .        and     said daneel     we also know that you have been well cared for since we left you .     it was only then that baley remembered the events of the night before .  gladia .  he looked about in sudden astonishment .  she was not anywhere in the room .  had he imagined   no  of course not .  that would be impossible .  and then he looked at daneel with a frown  as though suspecting his remark to bear a libidinous character .  but no  that would be impossible  too .  a robot  however humaniform  would not be designed to take lubricious delight in innuendo .  he said     quite well cared for .  but what i need at the moment is to be shown to the personal .        we are here  sir     said giskard     to direct you and help you through the morning .  miss gladia felt you would be more comfortable with us than with any of her own staff and she stressed that we were to leave nothing wanting for your comfort .     baley looked doubtful .     how far did she instruct you to go .  i feel pretty well now  so i don   t have to have anyone wash and dry me .  i can take care of myself .  she does understand that  i hope .        you need fear no embarrassment  partner elijah     said dan eel  with the small smile that  it seemed to baley  came at those moments when  in a human being  it might be judged that a feeling of affection would have arisen .     we are merely to see to your comfort .  if  at any time  you are most comfortable in privacy  we will wait at some distance .        in that case  daneel  we   re all set .     baley scrambled out of bed .  it pleased him to see that he felt quite steady on his legs .  the night   s rest and the treatment when he was brought back  whatever it might have been  had done marvels .    and gladia  too .      .   still nude and just damp enough from his shower to feel thoroughly fresh  baley  having brushed his hair  studied the result critically .  it seemed natural that he would have breakfast with gladia and he wasn   t certain how he might be received .  it might be best  perhaps  to take the attitude that nothing had happened and to be guided by her attitude .  and somehow  he thought  it might help if he looked reasonably good  provided that was within the realm of the possible .  he made a dissatisfied face at his reflection in the mirror .     daneel .     he called .     yes  partner elijah .     speaking through and around toothpaste  baley said     those are new clothes you are wearing  it seems .        not mine originally  partner elijah .  they had been friend jander   s .     baley   s eyebrows climbed .     she let you have jander   s .        miss gladia did not wish me to be unclothed while waiting for my storm drenched items to be washed and to dry .  those are ready now  but miss gladia says i may keep these .        when did she say that .        this morning  partner elijah .        she   s awake  then .        indeed .  and you will be joining her at breakfast when you are ready .     baley   s lips tightened .  it was odd that  at the moment  he was more concerned with having to face gladia than  a little later on  the chairman .  the matter of the chairman was  after all  in the lap of the fates .  he had decided on his strategy and it would either work or it would not work .  as for gladia  he simply had no strategy .  well  he would have to face her .  he said  with as careful an air of indifference as he might manage     and how is miss gladia this morning .     daneel said     she seems well .        cheerful .  depressed .     daneel hesitated .     it is difficult to judge the inner attitude of a human being .  there is nothing in her behavior to indicate internal turmoil .     baley cast a quick eye on daneel and again he wondered if he were referring to the events of last night .    and again he dismissed the possibility .  nor did it do any good to study daneel   s face .  one could not stare at a robot to guess thoughts from expression  for there were no thoughts in the human sense .  he stepped out into the bedroom and looked at the clothes that had been laid out for him  considering them thoughtfully and wondering if he could put them on without error and without requiring robotic help .  the storm and the night were over and he wanted to assume the mantle of adulthood and independence once again .  he said     what is this .     he held up a long sash covered with an intricately colored arabesque .     it is a pajama sash     said daneel .     it is purely ornamental .  it passes over the left shoulder and is tied at the right side of the waist .  it is traditionally worn at breakfast on some spacer worlds but is not very popular on aurora .        then why should i wear it .        miss gladia thought it would become you  partner elijah .  the method of tieing is rather intricate and i will be glad to help you .     jehoshaphat  thought baley ruefully  she wants me to be pretty .  what does she have in mind .  don   t think about it .  baley said     never mind .  i   ll manage with a simple bowknot .    but listen  daneel  after breakfast i will be going over to fastolfe   s  where i will meet with him  with amadiro  and with the chairman of the legislature .  i don   t know if there will be any others present .        yes  partner elijah .  i am aware of that .  i don   t think there will be others present .        well  then     said baley  beginning to put on his undergarments and doing it slowly so as to make no mistake and thus find it unnecessary to appeal for help to daneel     tell me about the chairman .  i know from my reading that he is the nearest thing to an executive officer that there is on aurora  but i gathered from that same reading that the position is purely honorary .  he has no power  i take it .     daneel said     i am afraid  partner elijah      giskard interrupted .     sir  i am more aware of the political situation on aurora than friend daneel is .  i have been in operation for much longer .  would you be willing to have me answer the question .        why  certainly  giskard .  go ahead .        when the government of aurora was first set up  sir     began giskard in a didactic way  as though an information reel within him were methodically spinning     it was intended that the executive officer fulfill only ceremonial duties .  he was to greet dignitaries from other worlds  open all meetings of the legislature  preside over its deliberations  and vote only to break a tie .  after the river controversy  however         yes  i read about that     said baley .  it had been a particularly dull episode in auroran history  in which impenetrable arguments over the proper division of hydroelectric power had led to the nearest approach to civil war the planet had ever seen .     you needn   t go into details .        no  sir     said giskard .     after the river controversy  however  there was a general determination never to allow controversy to endanger auroran society again .  it has become customary  therefore  to settle all disputes in a private and peaceable manner outside the legislature .  when the legislators finally vote  it is in an agreed upon fashion  so that there is always a large majority on one side or the other .     the key figure in the settlement of disputes is the chairman of the legislature .  he is held to be above the struggle and his power  which  although nil in theory  is considerable in practice  only holds as long as he is seen to be so .  the chairman therefore jealously guards his objectivity and  as long as he succeeds in this  it is he who usually makes the decision that settles any controversy in one direction or another .     baley said     you mean that the chairman will listen to me  to fastolfe  and to amadiro  and then come to a decision .        possibly .  on the other hand  sir  he may remain uncertain and require further testimony  further thought  or both .        and if the chairman does come to a decision  will amadiro bow to it if it is against him  or will fastolfe bow if it is against him .        that is not an absolute necessity .  there are almost always some who will not accept the chairman   s decision and both dr .  amadiro and dr .  fastolfe are headstrong and obstinate individuals  if one may judge from their actions .  most of the legislators  however  will go along with the chairman   s decision  whatever that might be .  dr .  fastolfe or dr .  amadiro   whichever it may be who will be decided against by the chairman  will then be sure to find himself in a small minority when the vote is taken .        how sure  giskard .        almost sure .  the chairman   s term of office is ordinarily thirty years  with the opportunity for reelection by the legislature for another thirty years .  if  however  a vote were to go against the chairman   s recommendation  the chairman would be forced to resign forthwith and there would be a governmental crisis while the legislature tried to find another chairman under conditions of bitter dispute .  few legislators are willing to risk that and the chance of getting a majority to vote against the chairman  when that is the consequence  is almost nil .        then     said baley ruefully     everything depends on this morning   s conference .        that is very likely .        thank you  giskard .     gloomily  baley arranged and rearranged his line of thought .  it seemed hopeful to him  but he did not have any idea what amadiro might say or what the chairman might be like .  it was amadiro who had initiated the meeting and he must feel confident  sure of himself .  it was then that baley remembered that once again  when he was falling asleep  with gladia in his arms  he had seen  or thought he had seen  or imagined he had seen  the meaning of all the events on aurora .  everything had seemed clear obvious  certain .  and once more  for the third time  it was gone as though it had never been .  and with that thought  his hopes seemed to go  too .      .   daneel led baley into the room where breakfast was being served  it seemed more intimate than an ordinary dining room .  it was small and plain  with no more in the way of furnishings than a table and two chairs and when daneel retired  he did not move into a niche .  in fact  there were no niches and  for a moment  baley found himself alone  entirely alone  in the room .  that he was not really alone  he was certain .  there would be robots on instant call .  still  it was a room for two  a no robots room  a room  baley hesitated at the thought  for lovers .  on the table there were two stacks of pancakelike objects that did not smell like pancakes but smelled good .  two containers of what looked like melted butter  but might not be  flanked them .  there was a pot of the hot drink  which baley had tried and had not liked very much  that substituted for coffee .  gladia walked in  dressed in rather prim fashion and with her hair glistening  as though freshly conditioned .  she paused a moment  her face wearing a half smile .     elijah .     baley  caught a little by surprise at the sudden appearance  jumped to his feet .     how are you  gladia .     he stuttered a bit .  she ignored that .  she seemed cheerful  carefree .  she said     if you   re worried about daneel not being in sight  don   t be .  he   s completely safe and he   ll stay so .  as for us      she came to him  standing close  and put a hand slowly to his cheek  as once  long ago  she had done in solaria .  she laughed lightly .     that was all i did then  elijah .  do you remember .     elijah nodded silently .     did you sleep well  elijah .    sit down  dear .     he sat down .     very well .    thank you  gladia .     he hesitated before deciding not to return the endearment in kind .  she said     don   t thank me .  i   ve had my best night   s sleep in weeks and i wouldn   t have if i hadn   t gotten out of bed after i was sure you were sleeping soundly .  if i had stayed  as i wanted to  i would have been annoying you before the night was over and you would not have gotten your rest .     he recognized the need for gallantry .     there are some things more important than r rest  gladia     he said  but with such formality that she laughed again .     poor elijah     she said .     you   re embarrassed .     the fact that she recognized that embarrassed him even more .  baley had been prepared for contrition  disgust  shame  affected indifference  tears  everything but the frankly erotic attitude she had assumed .  she said     well  don   t suffer so .  you   re hungry .  you hardly ate last night .  get some calories inside you and you   ll feel more carnal .     baley looked doubtfully at the pancakes that weren   t .  gladia said     oh .  you   ve probably never seen these .  they   re solarian delicacies .  pachinkas .  i had to reprogram my chef before he could make them properly .  in the first place  you have to use imported solarian grain .  it won   t work with the auroran varieties .  and they   re stuffed .  actually  there are a thousand stuffings you can use  but this is my favorite and i know you   ll like it  too .  i won   t tell you what   s in it  except for chestnut puree and a touch of honey  but try it and tell me what you think .  you can eat it with your fingers  but be careful how you bite into it .     she picked one up  holding it daintily between the thumb and middle finger of each hand  then took a small bite  slowly  and licked at the golden  semiliquid filling that flowed out .  baley imitated her action .  the pachinka was hard to the touch and not too hot to hold .  he put one end cautiously in his mouth and found it resisted biting .  he put more muscle into it and the pachinka cracked and he found the contents flowing over his hands .     the bite was too large and too forceful     said gladia  rushing to him with a napkin .     now lick at it .  no one eats a pachinka neatly .  there   s no such thing .  you   re supposed to wallow in it .  ideally  you   re supposed to eat it in the nude  then take a shower .     baley tried a hesitant lick and his expression was clear enough .     you like it  don   t you .     said gladia .     it   s delicious     said baley and he bit away at it slowly and gently .  it wasn   t too sweet and it seemed to soften and melt in the mouth .  it scarcely required swallowing .  he ate three pachinkas and it was only shame that kept him from asking for more .  he licked at his fingers without urging and eschewed the use of napkins  for he wanted none of it to be wasted on an inanimate object .     dip your fingers and hands in the cleanser  elijah     and she showed him .  the    melted butter    was a finger bowl  obviously .  baley did as he was shown and then dried his hands .  he sniffed at them and there was no odor whatever .  she said     are you embarrassed about last night  elijah .  is that all you feel .     what did one say .  baley wondered .  finally  he nodded .     i   m afraid i am  gladia .  it   s not all i feel  by twenty kilometers or more  but i am embarrassed .  stop and think .  i   m an earthman and you know that  but for the time being you   re repressing it and    earthman    is only a meaningless disyllabic sound to you .  last night you were sorry for me  concerned over my problem with the storm  feeling toward me as you would toward a child  and  sympathizing with me  perhaps  out of the vulnerability produced in you by your own loss  you came to me .  but that feeling will pass  i   m surprised it hasn   t passed already  and then you will remember that i am an earthman and you will feel ashamed  demeaned  and dirtied .  you will hate me for what i have done for you and i don   t want to be hated .    i don   t want to be hated  gladia .      if he looked as unhappy as he felt  he looked unhappy indeed .   she must have thought so  for she reached out to him and stroked his hand .     i won   t hate you  elijah .  why should i .  you did nothing to me that i can object to .  i did it to you and i   ll be glad for the rest of my life that i did .  you freed me by a touch two years ago  elijah  and last night you freed me again .  i needed to know  two years ago  that i could feel desire  and last night i needed to know that i could feel desire again after jander .  elijah  stay with me .  it would be      he cut her off earnestly .     how can that be  gladia .  i must go back to my own world .  i have duties and goals there and you cannot come with me .  you could not live the kind of life that is lived on earth .  you would die of earthly diseases  if the crowds and enclosure did not kill you first .  surely you understand .        i understand about earth     said gladia with a sigh     but surely you needn   t leave immediately .        before the morning is over  i may be ordered off the planet by the chairman .        you won   t be     said gladia energetically .     you won   t let yourself be .    and if you are  we can go to another spacer world .  there are dozens we can choose from .  does earth mean so much to you that you wouldn   t live on a spacer world .     baley said     i could be evasive  gladia  and point out that no other spacer world would let me make my home there permanently  and you know that   s so .  the greater truth is  though  that even if some spacer world would accept me  earth means so much to me that i would have to return .    even if it meant leaving you .        and never visiting aurora again .  never seeing me again .        if i could see you again  i would     baley said  wishing .     over and over again  believe me .  but what   s the use of saying so .  you know i   m not likely to be invited back .  and you know i can   t return without an invitation .     gladia said in a low voice     i don   t want to believe that  elijah .     baley said     gladia  don   t make yourself unhappy .  something wonderful happened between us  but there are other wonderful things that will happen to you  too  many of them  of all kinds  but not the same wonderful thing .  look forward to the others .     she was silent .     gladia     he said urgently     need anyone know what has happened between us .     she looked up at him  a pained expression on her face .     are you that ashamed .        of what happened  certainly not .  but even though i am not ashamed  there could be consequences that would be discomforting .  the matter would be talked about .  thanks to that hateful hyperwave drama  which included a distorted view of our relationship  we are news .  the earthman and the solarian woman .  if there is the slightest reason to suspect that there is   love between us  it will get back to earth at the speed of hyperspatial drive .     gladia lifted her eyebrows with a touch of hauteur .     and earth will consider you demeaned .  you will have indulged in sex with someone beneath your station .        no  of course not     said baley uneasily  for he knew that that would certainly be the view of billions of earthpeople .     has it occurred to you that my wife would hear of it .  i   m married .        and if she does .  what of it .     baley took a deep breath .     you don   t understand .  earth ways are not spacer ways .  we have had times in our history when sexual mores were fairly loose  at least in some places and for some classes .  this is not one of those times .  earthmen live crowded together and it takes a puritan ethic to keep the family system stable under such conditions .        everyone has one partner  you mean  and no other .        no     said baley .     to be honest  that   s not so .  but care is taken to keep irregularities sufficiently quiet  so that everyone can  can         pretend they don   t know .        well  yes  but in this case         it will all be so public that no one could pretend not to know  and your wife will be angry with you and will strike you .        no  she won   t strike me  but she will be shamed  which is worse .  i will be shamed as well and so will my son .  my social position will suffer and   gladia  if you don   t understand  you don   t understand  but tell me that you will not speak freely of this thing as aurorans do .     he was conscious of making a rather miserable show of himself .  gladia said thoughtfully     i do not mean to tease you  elijah .  you have been kind to me and i would not be unkind to you  but     she threw her arms up hopelessly     your earth ways are so nonsensical .        undoubtedly .  yet i must live with them  as you have lived with solarian ways .        yes .     her expression darkened with memory .  then     forgive me  elijah .  really and honestly  i apologize .  i want what i can   t have and i take it out on you .        it   s all right .        no  it   s not all right .  please  elijah  i must explain something to you .  i don   t think you understand what happened last night .  will you be all the more embarrassed if i do .     baley wondered how jessie would feel and what she would do if she could hear this conversation .  baley was quite aware that his mind should be on the confrontation with the chairman that was looming immediately up ahead and not on his own personal marital dilemma .  he should be thinking of earth   s danger and not of his wife   s  but  in actual fact  he was thinking of jessie .  he said     i   ll probably be embarrassed  but explain it anyway .     gladia moved her chair  refraining from calling one of her robotic staff to do it for her .  he waited for her nervously  not offering to move it himself .  she put her chair immediately next to his  facing it in the other direction  so that she was looking at him directly when she sat down .  and as she did so  she put out her small hand and placed it in his and he felt his own hand press it .     you see     she said     i no longer fear contact .  i   m no longer at the stage where all i can do is brush your cheek for an instant .        that may be  but this does not affect you  gladia  does it  as that bare touch did then .     she nodded .     no  it doesn   t affect me that way  but i like it anyway .  i think that   s an advance  actually .  to be turned inside out just by a single moment of touch shows how abnormally i had lived and for how long .  now it is better .  may i tell you how .  what i have just said is actually prologue .        tell me .        i wish we were in bed and it was dark .  i could talk more freely .        we are sitting up and it is light  gladia  but i am listening .        yes .    on solaria  elijah  there was no sex to speak of .  you know that .        yes  i do .        i experienced none  in any real sense .  on a few occasions   only a few  my husband approached me out of duty .  i won   t even describe how that was  but you will believe me when i tell you that  looking back on it  it was worse than none .        i believe you .        but i knew about sex .  i read about it .  i discussed it with other women sometimes  all of whom pretended it was a hateful duty that solarians must undergo .  if they had children to the limit of their quota  they always said they were delighted they would never have to deal with sex again .        did you believe them .        of course i did .  i had never heard anything else and the few non solarian accounts i read were denounced as false distortions .  i believed that  too .  my husband found some books i had  called them pornography  and had them destroyed .  then  too  you know  people can make themselves believe anything .  i think solarian women believed what they said and really did despise sex .  they certainly sounded sincere enough and it made me feel there was something terribly wrong with me because i had a kind of curiosity about it  and odd feelings i could not understand .        you did not  at that time  use robots for relief in any way .        no  it didn   t occur to me .  or any inanimate object .  there were occasional whispers of such things  but with such horror   or pretended horror  that i would never dream of doing anything like that .  of course  i had dreams and sometimes something that  as i look back on it  must have been incipient orgasms  would wake me .  i never understood them  of course  or dared talk of it .  i was bitterly ashamed of it  in fact .  worse  i was frightened of the pleasure they brought me .  and then  of course  i came to aurora .        you told me of that .  sex with aurorans was unsatisfactory .        yes .  it made me think that solarians were right after all .  sex was not like my dreams at all .  it was not until jander that i understood .  it is not sex that they have on aurora  it is  it is   choreography .  every step of it is dictated by fashion  from the method of approach to the moment of departure .  there is nothing unexpected  nothing spontaneous .  on solaria  since there was so little sex  nothing was given or taken .  and on aurora  sex was so stylized that  in the end  nothing was given or taken either .  do you understand .        i   m not sure  gladia  never having experienced sex with an auroran woman or  for that matter  never    having been an auroran man .  but it   s not necessary to explain .  i have a dim notion of what you mean .        you   re terribly embarrassed  aren   t you .        not to the point of being unable to listen .        but then i met jander and learned to use him .  he was not an auroran man .  his only aim  his only possible aim  was to please me .  he gave and i took and  for the first time  i experienced sex as it should be experienced .  do you understand that .  can you imagine what it must be like suddenly to know that you are not mad  or distorted  or perverted  or even simply wrong  but to know that you are a woman and have a satisfying sex partner .        i think i can imagine that .        and then  after so short a time  to have it all taken away from me .  i thought  i thought  that that was the end .  i was doomed .  i was never again  through centuries of life  to have a good sexual relationship again .  not to have had it to start with   and then never to have had it at all  was bad enough .  but to get it against all expectation and to have it  then suddenly to lose it and go back to nothing  that was unbearable .    you see how important  therefore  last night was .        but why me  gladia .  why not someone else .        no  elijah  it had to be you .  we came and found you  giskard and i  and you were helpless .  truly helpless .  you were not unconscious  but you did not rule your body .  you had to be lifted and carried and placed in the car .  i was there when you were warmed and treated  bathed and dried  helpless throughout .  the robots did it all with marvelous efficiency  intent on caring for you and preventing harm from coming to you but totally without actual feeling .  i  on the other hand  watched and i felt .     baley bent his head  gritting his teeth at the thought of his public helplessness .  he had luxuriated in it when it had happened  but now he could only feel the disgrace of being observed under such conditions .  she went on .     i wanted to do it all for you .  i resented the robots for reserving for themselves the right to be kind to you   and to give .  and as i thought of myself doing it  i felt a growing sexual excitement  something i hadn   t felt since jander   s death .    and it occurred to me then that  in my only successful sex  what i had done was to take .  jander gave whatever i wished  but he never took .  he was incapable of taking  since his only pleasure lay in pleasing me .  and it never occurred to me to give because i was brought up with robots and knew they couldn   t take .     and as i watched  it came to me that i knew only half of sex and i desperately wanted to experience the other half .  but then  at the dinner table with me afterward  when you were eating your hot soup  you seemed recovered  you seemed strong .  you were strong enough to console me and because i had had that feeling for you  when you were being cared for  i no longer feared your being from earth and i was willing to move into your embrace .  i wanted it .  but even as you held me  i felt a sense of loss  for i was taking again and not giving .     and you said to me     gladia  please  i must sit down .     oh  elijah  it was the most wonderful thing you could have said to me .  baley felt himself flush .     it embarrassed me hideously at the time .  such a confession of weakness .        it was just what i wanted .  it drove me wild with desire .  i forced you to bed and came to you and  for the first time in my life  i gave .  i took nothing .  and the spell of jander passed  for i knew that he had not been enough  either .  it must be possible to take and give  both .    elijah  stay with me .     baley shook his head .     gladia  if i tore my heart in two  it wouldn   t change the facts .  i cannot remain on aurora .  i must return to earth .  you cannot come to earth .        elijah  what if i can come to earth .        why do you say such a foolish thing .  even if you could  i would age quickly and soon be useless to you .  in twenty years  thirty at the most  i will be an old man  probably dead  while you will stay as you are for centuries .        but that is what i mean  elijah .  on earth  i will catch your infections and i will grow old quickly  too .        you wouldn   t want that .  besides  old age isn   t an infection .  you will merely grow sick  very quickly  and die .  gladia  you can find another man .        an auroran .     she said it with contempt .     you can teach .  now that you know how to take and to give  teach them how to do both as well .        if i teach  will they learn .        some will .  surely some will .  you have so much time to find the one who will .  there is       no  he thought  it is not wise to mention gremionis now  but perhaps if he comes to her  less politely and with a little more determination    she seemed thoughtful .     is it possible .     then  looking at baley  with her gray blue eyes moist     oh  elijah  do you remember anything at all of what happened last night .        i must admit     said baley a little sadly     that some of it is distressingly hazy .        if you remembered  you would not want to leave me .        i don   t want to leave you as it is  gladia .  it is just that i must .        and afterward     she said     you seemed so quietly happy  so rested .  i lay nestled on your shoulder and felt your heart beat rapidly at first  then more and more slowly  except when you sat up so suddenly .  do you remember that .     baley started and leaned a little away from her  gazing into her eyes wildly .     no  i don   t remember that .  what do you mean .  what did i do .        i told you .  you sat up suddenly .        yes  but what else .     his heart was beating rapidly now  as rapidly as it must have in the wake of last night   s sex .  three times  something that had seemed the truth had come to him  but the first two times he had been entirely alone .  the third time  last night  however  gladia had been with him .  he had had a witness .  gladia said     nothing else  really .  i said     what is it  elijah .     but you paid no attention to me .  you said     i have it .  i have it .     you didn   t speak clearly and your eyes were unfocused .  it was a little frightening .        is that all i said .  jehoshaphat  gladia .  didn   t i say anything more .     gladia frowned .     i don   t remember .  but then you lay back and i said     don   t be frightened  elijah .  don   t be frightened .  you   re safe now .     and i stroked you and you settled back and fell asleep  and snored .    i never heard anyone snore before  but that   s what it must have been  from the descriptions .     the thought clearly amused her .  baley said     listen to me  gladia .  what did i say .     i have it .  i have it .     did i say what it was i had .     she frowned again .     no .  i don   t remember   wait  you did say one thing in a very low voice .  you said     he was there first .           he was there first .     that   s what i said .        yes .  i took it for granted that you meant giskard was there before the other robots  that you were trying to overcome your fears of being taken away  that you were reliving that time in the storm .  yes .  that   s why i stroked you and said     don   t be frightened  elijah .  you   re safe now     till you relaxed .        he was there first .        he was there first .       i won   t forget it now .  gladia  thanks for last night .  thanks for talking to me now .     gladia said     is there something important about you saying that giskard found you first .  he did .  you know that .        it can   t be that  gladia .  it must be something i don   t know but manage to discover only when my mind is totally relaxed .        but what does it mean  then .        i   m not sure  but if that   s what i said  it must mean something .  and i have an hour or so to figure it out .     he stood up .     i must leave now .     he had taken a few steps toward the door  but gladia flew to him and put her arms around him .     wait  elijah .     baley hesitated  then lowered his head to kiss her .  for a long moment  they clung together .     will i see you again  elijah .     baley said sadly     i can   t say .  i hope so .     and he went off to find daneel and giskard  so that he could make the necessary preparations for the confrontation about to come .      .   baley   s sadness persisted as he walked across the long lawn  to fastolfe   s establishment .  the robots walked on either side .  daneel seemed at his ease  but giskard  faithful to his programming and apparently unable to relax it  maintained his close watch on the surroundings .  baley said     what is the name of the chairman of the legislature  daneel .        i cannot say  partner elijah .  on the occasions when he has been referred to in my hearing  he has been referred to only as    the chairman .     he is addressed as    mr .  chairman .     giskard said     his name is rutilari horder  sir  but it is never mentioned officially .  the title alone is used .  that serves to impress continuity on the government .  human holders of the position have  individually  fixed terms  but    the chairman    always exists .        and this particular individual chairman  how old is he .        quite old  sir .  three hundred and thirty one     said giskard  who typically had statistics on tap .     in good health .        i know nothing to the contrary  sir .        any outstanding personal characteristics it might be well for me to be prepared for .     that seemed to stop giskard .  he said  after a pause     that is difficult for me to say  sir .  he is in his second term .  he is considered an efficient chairman who works hard and gets results .        is he short tempered .  patient .  domineering .  understanding .     giskard said     you must judge such things for yourself  sir .     daneel said     partner elijah  the chairman is above partisanship .  he is just and evenhanded  by definition .        i   m sure of that     muttered baley     but definitions are abstract  as is    the chairman     while individual chairmen  with names  are concrete and may have minds to match .     he shook his head .  his own mind  he would swear  had a strong measure of concrete itself .  having three times thought of something and three times lost it  he was now presented with his own comment at the time of having the thought and it still didn   t help .     he was there first .     who was there first .  when .  baley had no answer .      .   baley found fastolfe waiting for him at the door of his establishment  with a robot behind him who seemed most unrobotically restless  as though unable to perform his proper function of greeting a visitor and upset by the fact .   but then  one was always reading human motivations and responses into robots .  what was more likely true was no upsettedness  no feeling of any kind  merely a slight oscillation of positronic potentials resulting from the fact that his orders were to greet and inspect all visitors and he could not quite perform the task without pushing past fastolfe  which he also could not do  in the absence of overriding necessity .  so he made false starts  one after the other  and that made him seem restless .   baley found himself staring at the robot absently and only with difficulty managing to bring his eyes back to fastolfe .   he was thinking of robots  but he didn   t know why .      i   m glad to see you again  dr .  fastolfe     he said and thrust his hand forward .  after his encounter with gladia  it was rather difficult to remember that spacers were reluctant to make physical contact with an earthman .  fastolfe hesitated a moment and then  as manners triumphed over prudence  he took the hand offered him  held it lightly and briefly  and let it go .  he said     i am even more delighted to see you  mr .  baley .  i was quite alarmed over your experience last evening .  it was not a particularly bad storm  but to an earthman it must have seemed overwhelming .        you know about what happened  then .        daneel and giskard have brought me fully up to date in that respect .  i would have felt better if they had come here directly and  eventually  brought you here with them  but their decision was based on the fact that gladia   s establishment was closer to the breakdown point of the airfoil and that your orders had been extremely intense and had placed daneel   s safety ahead of your own .  they did not misinterpret you .        they did not .  i forced them to leave me .        was that wise .     fastolfe led the way indoors  and pointed to a chair .  baley sat down .     it seemed the proper thing to do .  we were being pursued .        so giskard reported .  he also reported that      baley intervened .     dr .  fastolfe  please .  i have very little time and i have questions that i must ask you .        go ahead  please     said fastolfe at once  with his usual air of unfailing politeness .     it has been suggested that you place your work on brain function above everything else  that you         let me finish  mr .  baley .  that i will let nothing stand in my way  that i am totally ruthless  oblivious to any consideration of immorality or evil  would stop at nothing  would excuse everything  all in the name of the importance of my work .        yes .        who told you this  mr .  baley .     asked fastolfe .     does it matter .        perhaps not .  besides  it   s not difficult to guess .  it was my daughter vasilia .  i   m sure of that .     baley said     perhaps .  what i want to know is whether this estimate of your character is correct .     fastolfe smiled sadly .     do you expect an honest answer from me about my own character .  in some ways  the accusations against me are true .  i do consider my work the most important matter there is and i do have the impulse to sacrifice anything and everything to it .  i would ignore conventional notions of evil and immorality if these got in my way .    the thing is  however  that i don   t .  i can   t bring myself to .  and  in particular  if i have been accused of killing jander because that would in some way advance my study of the human brain  i deny it .  it is not so .  i did not kill jander .     baley said     you suggested i submit to a psychic probe to get some information that i can   t reach otherwise out of my brain .  has it occurred to you that  if you submitted to a psychic probe  your innocence could be demonstrated .     fastolfe nodded his head thoughtfully     i imagine vasilia suggested that my failure to offer to submit to one was proof of my guilt .  not so .  a psychic probe is dangerous and i am as nervous about submitting myself to one as you are .  still  i would have done so  despite my fears  were it not for the fact that is what my opponents would most like to have me do .  they would argue against any evidence to my innocence and the psychic probe is not delicate enough an instrument to demonstrate innocence beyond argument .  but what they would get by use of the probe is information about the theory and design of humaniform robots .  that is what they are after and that is what i am not going to give them .     baley said     very well .  thank you  dr .  fastolfe .     fastolfe said     you are welcome .  and now  if i may get back to what i was saying  giskard reported that  after you were left alone in the airfoil  you were accosted by strange robots .  at least  you spoke of strange robots  rather disjointedly  after you were found unconscious and exposed to the storm .        the strange robots did accost me  dr .  fastolfe .  i managed to deflect them and send them away  but i thought it wise to leave the airfoil rather than await their return .  i may not have been thinking clearly when i reached that decision .  giskard said i was not .     fastolfe smiled .     giskard has a simplistic view of the universe .  have you any idea whose robots they were .     baley moved about restlessly and seemed to find no way of adjusting himself to the seat in a comfortable manner .  he said     has the chairman arrived yet .        no  but he will be here momentarily .  so will amadiro  the head of the institute  whom  the robots told me  you met yesterday .  i am not sure that was wise .  you irritated him .        i had to see him  dr .  fastolfe  and he did not seem irritated .        that is no guide with amadiro .  as a result of what he calls your slanders and your unbearable sullying of professional reputation  he has forced the chairman   s hand .        in what way .        it is the chairman   s job to encourage the meeting of contending parties and to work for a compromise .  if amadiro wishes to meet with me  the chairman could not  by definition  discourage it  much less forbid it .  he must hold the meeting and  if amadiro can find enough evidence against you  and it is easy to find evidence against an earthman  that will end the investigation .        perhaps  dr .  fastolfe  you should not have called on an earthman to help  considering how vulnerable we are .        perhaps not  mr .  baley  but i could think of nothing else to do .  i still can   t  so i must leave it up to you to persuade the chairman to our point of view  if you can .        the responsibility is mine .     said baley glumly .     entirely yours     said fastolfe smoothly .  baley said     are we four to be the only ones present .     fastolfe said     actually  we three  the chairman  amadiro  and myself .  we are the two principals and the compromising agent  so to speak .  you will be there as a fourth party  mr .  baley  only on sufferance .  the chairman can order you to leave at will  so i hope you will not do anything to upset him .        i   ll try not to  dr .  fastolfe .        for instance  mr .  baley  do not offer him your hand  if you will forgive my rudeness .     baley felt himself grow warm with retroactive embarrassment at his earlier gesture .     i will not .        and be unfailingly polite .  make no angry accusations .  do not insist on statements for which there is no support         you mean don   t try to stampede anyone into betraying himself .  amadiro  for instance .        yes  do not do so .  you will be committing slander and it will be counterproductive .  therefore  be polite .  if the politeness masks an attack  we won   t quarrel with that .  and try not to speak unless you are spoken to .     baley said     how is it  dr .  fastolfe  that you are so full of careful advice now and yet you never warned me about the dangers of slander earlier .        the fault is indeed mine     said dr .  fastolfe .     it was a matter of such basic knowledge to me that it never occurred to me that it had to be explained .     baley grunted .     yes  i thought so .     fastolfe raised his head suddenly .  .     i hear an airfoil outside .  more than that  i can hear the steps of one of my staff  heading for the entrance .  i presume the chairman and amadiro are at hand .        together .     asked baley .     undoubtedly .  you see  amadiro suggested my establishment as the meeting place  thus granting me the advantage of home ground .  he will therefore have the chance of offering  out of apparent politeness  to call for the chairman and bring him here .  after all  they must both come here .  this will give him a few minutes to talk privately with the chairman and push his point of view .        that is scarcely fair     said baley .     could you have stopped that .        i didn   t want to .  amadiro takes a calculated risk .  he may say something that will irritate the chairman .        is the chairman particularly irritable by nature .        no .  no more so than any chairman in the fifth decade of his term of office .  still  the necessity of strict adherence to protocol  the further necessity of never taking sides  and the actuality of arbitrary power all combine toward making a certain irritability inevitable .  and amadiro is not always wise .  his jovial smile  his white teeth  his exuding bonhomie can be extremely irritating when those upon whom he lavishes it are not in a good mood  for some reason .    but i must go meet them  mr .  baley  and supply what i hope will be a more substantial version of charm .  please stay here and don   t move from that chair .     baley could do nothing but wait now .  he thought  irrelevantly  that he had been on aurora for just a bit short of fifty standard hours .      again the chairman     .   the chairman was short  surprisingly short .  amadiro towered over him by nearly thirty centimeters .  however  since most of his shortness was in his thighs  the chairman  when all were seated  was not noticeably inferior in height to the others .  indeed  he was thickset  with a massive chest and shoulders  and looked almost overpowering under those conditions .  his head was large  too  but his face was lined and marked by age .  nor were its wrinkles the kindly type carved by laughter .  they were impressed into his cheeks and forehead  one felt  by the exercise of power .  his hair was white and sparse and he was bald in the spot where the hairs would have met in a whorl .  his voice suited him  deep and decisive .  age had robbed it of some of its timbre  perhaps  and lent it a bit of harshness  but in a chairman  baley thought  that might help rather than hinder .  fastolfe went through the full ritual of greeting  exchanged stroking remarks without meaning  and offered food and drink .  through all of this  no mention was made of the outsider and no notice was taken of him .  it was only when the preliminaries were finished and when all were seated that baley  a little farther from the center than the others  was introduced .  he said     mr .  chairman     without holding out his hand .  then  with an offhand nod  he said     and  of course  i have met dr .  amadiro .     amadiro   s smile did not waver at the touch of insolence in baley   s voice .  the chairman  who had not acknowledged baley   s greeting  placed his hands on each knee  fingers spread apart  and said     let us get started and let us see if we can   t make this as brief and as productive as possible .     let me stress first that i wish to get past this matter of the misbehavior  or possible misbehavior  of an earthman and strike instantly to the heart of the matter .  nor  in dealing with the heart of the matter  are we speaking of this overblown matter of the robot .  disrupting the activity of a robot is a matter for the civil courts  it can result in a judgment of the infringement of property rights and the inflicting of a penalty of costs but nothing more than that .  what   s more  if it should be proved that dr .  fastolfe had rendered the robot  jander panell  inoperable  it is a robot who  after all  he helped design  whose construction he supervised  and the ownership of whom he held at the time of the inoperability .  no penalty is likely to apply  since a person may do what he likes with his own .     what is really at issue is the matter of the exploration and settlement of the galaxy  whether we of aurora carry it through alone  whether we do it in collaboration with the other spacer worlds  or whether we leave it to earth .  dr .  amadiro and the globalists favor having aurora shoulder the burden alone  dr .  fastolfe wishes to leave it to earth .     if we can settle this matter  then the affair of the robot can be left to the civil courts  and the question of the earthman   s behavior will probably become moot  and we can simply get rid of him .     therefore  let me begin by asking whether dr .  amadiro is prepared to accept dr .  fastolfe   s position in order to achieve unity of decision or whether dr .  fastolfe is prepared to accept dr .  amadiro   s position with the same end in view .     he paused and waited .  amadiro said     i am sorry  mr .  chairman  but i must insist that earthmen be confined to their planet and that the galaxy be settled by aurorans only .  i would be willing to compromise  however  to the extent of allowing other spacer worlds to share in the settlement if that would prevent needless strife among us .     i see     said the chairman .     will you  dr .  fastolfe  in view of this statement  abandon your position .     fastolfe said     dr .  amadiro   s compromise has scarcely anything of substance in it  mr .  chairman .  i am willing to offer a compromise of greater significance .  why should not the worlds of the galaxy be thrown open to spacers and earthpeople alike .  the galaxy is large and there would be room for both .  i would be willing to accept such an arrangement .        no doubt     said amadiro quickly     for it is no compromise .  the over eight billion population of earth is more than half again the population of all the spacer worlds combined .  earth   s people are short lived and are used to replacing their losses quickly .  they lack our regard for individual human life .  they will swarm over the new worlds at any cost  multiplying like insects  and will preempt the galaxy even while we are making a bare beginning .  to offer earth a supposedly equal chance at the galaxy is to give them the galaxy  and that is not equality .  earthpeople must be confined to earth .        and what have you to say to that  dr .  fastolfe .     asked the chairman .  fastolfe sighed .     my views are on record .  i   m sure i don   t need to repeat them .  dr .  amadiro plans to use humaniform robots to build the settled worlds that human aurorans will then enter  ready made  yet he doesn   t even have humaniform robots .  he cannot construct them and the project would not work  even if he did have them .  no compromise is possible unless dr .  amadiro consents to the principle that earthpeople may at least share in the task of the settlement of new worlds .        then no compromise is possible     said amadiro .  the chairman looked displeased .     i   m afraid that one of you two must give in .  i do not intend aurora to be torn apart in an emotional orgy on a question this important .     he looked at amadiro blankly  his expression carefully signifying neither favor nor disfavor .     you intend to use the inoperability of the robot  jander  as an argument against fastolfe   s view  do you not .        i do     said amadiro .     a purely emotional argument .  you are going to claim that fastolfe is trying to destroy your view by falsely making humaniform robots appear less useful than they  in effect  are .        that is exactly what he is trying to do         slander .     put in fastolfe in a low voice .     not if i can prove it  which i can     said amadiro .     the argument may be an emotional one  but it will be effective .  you see that  mr .  chairman  don   t you .  my view will surely win  but left to itself it will be messy .  i would suggest that you persuade dr .  fastolfe to accept inevitable defeat and spare aurora the enormous sadness of a spectacle that will weaken our position among the spacer worlds and shake our own belief in ourselves .        how can you prove that dr .  fastolfe rendered the robot inoperative .          he himself admits he is the only human being who could have done so .  you know this .        i know     said the chairman     but i wanted to hear you say this  not to your constituency  not to the media  but to me  in private .  and you have done so .     he turned to fastolfe .     and what do you say  dr .  fastolfe .  are you the only man who could have destroyed the robot .        without leaving physical marks .  i am  as far as i know .  i don   t believe that dr .  amadiro has the skill in robotics to do so and i am constantly amazed that  after having founded his robotics institute  he is so eager to proclaim his own incapacity  even with all his associates at his back  and to do so publicly .     he smiled at amadiro  not entirely without malice .  the chairman sighed .     no  dr .  fastolfe .  no rhetorical tricks now .  let us dispense with sarcasm and clever thrusts .  what is your defense .        why  only that i did no harm to jander .  i do not say anyone did .  it was chance  the uncertainty principle at work on the positronic pathways .  it can happen every so often .  let dr .  amadiro merely admit that it was chance  that no one be accused without evidence  and we can then argue the competing proposals about settlement on their own merits .        no     said amadiro .     the chance of accidental destruction is too small to be considered  far smaller than the    chance that dr .  fastolfe is responsible  so much smaller that to ignore dr .  fastolfe   s guilt is irresponsible .  i will not back down and i will win .  mr .  chairman  you know i will win and it seems to me that the only rational step to be taken is to force dr .  fastolfe to accept his defeat in the interest of global unity .     fastolfe said quickly     and that brings me to the matter of the investigation i have asked mr .  baley of earth to undertake .     and amadiro said  just as quickly     a move i opposed when it was first suggested .  the earthman may be a clever investigator  but he is unfamiliar with aurora and can accomplish nothing here .  nothing  that is  except to strew slander and to hold aurora up to the spacer worlds in an undignified and ridiculous light .  there have been satirical pieces on the matter in half a dozen important spacer hyperwave news programs on as many different worlds .  recordings of these have been sent to your office .        and have been brought to my attention     said the chairman .     and there has been murmuring here on aurora     amadiro drove on .     it would be to my selfish interest to allow the investigation to continue .  it is costing fastolfe support among the populace and votes among the legislators .  the longer it continues  the more certain i am of victory  but it is damaging aurora and i do not wish to add to my certainty at the cost of harm to my world .   i suggest  with respect  that you end the investigation  mr .  chairman  and persuade dr .  fastolfe to submit gracefully now to what he will eventually have to accept  at much greater cost .     the chairman said     i agree that to have permitted dr .  fastolfe to set up this investigation may have been unwise .  i say    may .     i admit i am tempted to end it .  and yet the earthman      he gave no indication of knowing that baley was in the room      has already been here for some time      he paused  as though to give fastolfe a chance for corroboration  and fastolfe took it  saying     this is the third day of his investigation  mr .  chairman .        in that case     said the chairman     before i end that investigation  it would be fair  i believe  to ask if there have been any significant findings so far .     he paused again .  fastolfe glanced quickly at baley and made a small motion of his head .  baley said in a low voice     i do not wish  mr .  chairman  to obtrude  unasked  any observations .  am i being asked a question .     the chairman frowned .  without looking at baley  he said     i am asking mr .  baley of earth to tell us whether he has any findings of significance .     baley took a deep breath .  this was it .      .      mr .  chairman     he began .     yesterday afternoon  i was interrogating dr .  amadiro  who was most cooperative and useful to me .  when my staff and i left         your staff .     asked the chairman .     i was accompanied by two robots on all phases of my investigation  mr .  chairman     said baley .     robots who belong to dr .  fastolfe .     asked amadiro .     i ask this for the record .        for the record  they do     said baley .     one is daneel olivaw  a humaniform robot  and the other is giskard reventlov  an older nonhumaniform robot .        thank you     said the chairman .     continue .        when we left the institute grounds  we found that the airfoil we used had been tampered with .        tampered with .     asked the chairman  startled .     by whom .        we don   t know  but it happened on institute grounds .  we were there by invitation  so it was known by the institute personnel that we would be there .  moreover  no one else would be likely to be there without the invitation and knowledge of the institute staff .  if it were at all thinkable  it would be necessary to conclude that the tampering could only have been done by someone on the institute staff and that would  in any case  be impossible  except at the direction of dr .  amadiro himself  which would also be unthinkable .     amadiro said     you seem to think a great deal about the unthinkable .  has the airfoil been examined by a qualified technician to see if it has indeed been tampered with .  might there not have been a natural failing .     asked amadiro .     no  sir     said baley     but giskard  who is qualified to drive an airfoil and who has frequently driven that particular one  maintains that it was tampered with .        and he is one of dr .  fastolfe   s staff and is programmed by him and receives his daily orders from him     said amadiro .     are you suggesting      began fastolfe .     i am suggesting nothing .     amadiro held up his hand in a benign gesture .     i am merely making a statement  for the record .     the chairman stirred .     will mr .  baley of earth please continue .     baley said     when the airfoil broke down  there were others in pursuit .        others .     asked the chairman .     other robots .  they arrived and  by that time  my robots were gone .        one moment     said amadiro .     what was your condition at the time  mr .  baley .        i was not entirely well .        not entirely well .  you are an earthman and unaccustomed to life except in the artificial setting of your cities .  you are uneasy in the open .  is that not so  mr .  baley .     asked amadiro .     yes  sir .        and there was a severe thunderstorm in progress last evening  as i am sure the chairman recalls .  would it not be accurate to say that you were quite ill .  semiconscious  if not worse .        i was quite ill     said baley reluctantly .     then how is it your robots were gone .     asked the chairman sharply .     should they not have been with you in your illness .        i ordered them away  mr .  chairman .        why .        i thought it best     said baley     and i will explain  if i may be allowed to continue .        continue .        we were indeed being pursued  for the pursuing robots arrived shortly after my robots had left .  the pursuers asked me where my robots were and i told them i had sent them away .  it was only after that that they asked if i were ill .  i said i wasn   t ill and they left me in order to continue a search for my robots .        in search of daneel and giskard .     asked the chairman .     yes  mr .  chairman .  it was clear to me that they were under intense orders to find the robots .        in what way was that clear .        although i was obviously ill  they asked about the robots before they asked about me .  then  later  they abandoned me in my illness to search for my robots .  they must have received enormously intense orders to find those robots or it would not have been possible for them to disregard a patently ifi human being .  as a matter of fact  i had anticipated this search for my robots and that was why i had sent them away .  i felt it all important to keep them out of unauthorized hands .     amadiro said     mr .  chairman  may i continue to question mr .  baley on this point  in order to show the worthlessness of this statement .        you may .     amadiro said     mr .  baley .  you were alone after your robots had left  were you not .        yes  sir .        therefore you have no recording of events .  you are not yourself equipped to record them .  you have no recording device .        no to all three  sir .        and you were ill .        yes  sir .        distraught .  possibly too ill to remember clearly .        no  sir .  i remember quite clearly .        you would think so  i suppose  but you may well have been delirious and hallucinating .  under those conditions  it seems clear that what the robots said or  indeed  whether robots appeared at all would seem highly dubious .     the chairman said thoughtfully     i agree .  mr .  baley of earth  assuming that what you remember  or claim to remember  is accurate  what is your interpretation of the events you are describing .        i hesitate to give you my thoughts on the matter  mr .  chairman     said baley     lest i slander the worthy dr .  amadiro .        since you speak at my request and since your remarks are confined to this room     the chairman looked around  the wall niches were empty of robots     there is no question of slander  unless it seems to me you speak with malice .        in that case  mr .  chairman     said baley     i had thought it possible that dr .  amadiro detained me in his office by discussing matters with me at greater length than was perhaps necessary  so that there would be time for the damaging of my machine  then detained me further in order that i might leave after the thunderstorm had begun  thus making sure that i would be ill in transit .  he had studied earth   s social conditions  as he told me several times  so he would know what my reaction to the storm might be .  it seemed to me that it was his plan to send his robots after us and  when they came upon our stalled airfoil  to have them take us all back to the institute grounds  presumably so that i might be treated for my illness but actually so that he might have dr .  fastolfe   s robots .     amadiro laughed gently .     what motive am i supposed to have for all this .  you see  mr .  chairman  that this is supposition joined to supposition and would be judged slander in any court on aurora .     the chairman said severely     has mr .  baley of earth anything to support these hypotheses .        a line of reasoning  mr .  chairman .     the chairman stood up  at once losing some of his presence  since he scarcely unfolded to a greater than sitting height .     let me take a short walk  so that i might consider what i have heard so far .  i will be right back .     he left for the personal .  fastolfe leaned in the direction of baley and baley met him halfway .   amadiro looked on in casual unconcern  as though it scarcely mattered to him what they might have to say to each other .   fastolfe whispered     have you anything better to say .     baley said     i think so  if i get the proper chance to say it  but the chairman does not seem to be sympathetic .        he is not .  so far you have merely made things worse and i would not be surprised if  when he comes back  he calls these proceedings to a halt .     baley shook his head and stared at his shoes .      .   baley was still staring at his shoes when the chairman returned  reseated himself  and turned a hard and rather baleful glance at the earthman .  he said     mr .  baley of earth .        yes  mr .  chairman .        i think you are wasting my time  but i do not want it said that i did not give either side a full hearing  even when it seemed to be wasting my time .  can you offer me a motive that would account for dr .  amadiro acting in the mad way in which you accuse him of acting .        mr .  chairman     said baley in a tone approaching desperation     there is indeed a motive  a very good one .  it rests on the fact that dr .  amadiro   s plan for settling the galaxy will come to nothing if he and his institute cannot produce humaniform robots .  so far he has produced none and can produce none .  ask him if he is willing to have a legislative committee examine his institute for any indication that successful humaniform robots are being produced or designed .  if he is willing to maintain that successful humaniforms are on the assembly lines or even on the drawing boards  or even in adequate theoretical formulation   and if he is prepared to demonstrate that fact to a qualified committee  i will say nothing more and admit that my investigation has achieved nothing .     he held his breath .  the chairman looked at amadiro  whose smile had faded .  amadiro said     i will admit that we have no humaniform robots in prospect at the moment .        then i will continue     said baley  resuming his interrupted breathing with something very much like a gasp .     dr .  amadiro can  of course  find all the information he needs for his project if he turns to dr .  fastolfe  who has the information in his head  but dr .  fastolfe will not cooperate in this matter .        no  i will not     murmured fastolfe     under any conditions .        but  mr .  chairman     baley continued     dr .  fastolfe is not the only individual who has the secret of the design and construction of humaniform robots .        no .     said the chairman .     who else would know .  dr .  fastolfe himself looks astonished at your comment  mr .  baley .      for the first time  he did not add    of earth .         i am indeed astonished     said fastolfe .     to my knowledge  i am certainly the only one .  i don   t know what mr .  baley means .     amadiro said  with a small curling of the lip     i suspect mr .  baley doesn   t know  either .     baley felt hemmed in .  he looked from one to the other and felt that not one of them  not one  was on his side .  he said     isn   t it true that any humaniform robot would know .  not consciously perhaps  not in such a way as to be able to give instructions in the matter  but the information would surely be there within him  wouldn   t it .  if a humaniform robot was properly questioned  his answers and responses would betray his design and construction .  eventually  given enough time and given questions properly framed  a humaniform robot would yield information that would make it possible to plan the design of other humaniform robots .    to put it briefly  no machine can be of secret design if the machine itself is available for sufficiently intense study .     fastolfe seemed struck .     i see what you mean  mr .  baley  and you are right .  i had never thought of that .        with respect  dr .  fastolfe     said baley     i must tell you that  like all aurorans  you have a peculiarly individualistic pride .  you are entirely too satisfied with being the best roboticist  the only roboticist who can construct humaniforms  so you blind yourself to the obvious .     the chairman relaxed into a smile .     he has you there  dr .  fastolfe .  i have wondered why you were so eager to maintain that you were the only one with the know how to destroy jander when that so weakened your political case .  i see clearly now that you would rather have your political case go down than your uniqueness .     fastolfe chafed visibly .  as for amadiro  he frowned and said     has this anything to do with the problem under discussion .        yes  it does     said baley  his confidence rising .     you cannot force any information from dr .  fastolfe directly .  your robots cannot be ordered to do him harm  to torture him into revealing his secrets  for instance .  you can   t harm him directly yourself against the protection of dr .  fastolfe by his staff .  however  you can isolate a robot and have it taken by other robots when the human being present is too ill to take the necessary action to prevent you .  all the events of yesterday afternoon were part of a quickly improvised plan to get your hands on daneel .  you saw your opportunity as soon as i insisted on seeing you at the institute .  if i had not sent my robots away  if i had not been just well enough to insist i was well and to send your robots in the wrong direction  you would have had him .  and eventually you might have worked out the secret of humaniform robots by some long sustained analysis of daneel   s behavior and responses .     amadiro said     mr .  chairman  i protest .  i have never heard slander so viciously expressed .  this is all based on the fancies of an ill man .  we don   t know  and perhaps can   t ever know   whether the airfoil was really damaged  and if it was  by whom  whether robots really pursued the airfoil and really spoke to mr .  baley or not .  he is merely piling inference on inference  all based on dubious testimony concerning events of which he is the only witness  and that at a time when he was half mad with fear and may have been hallucinating .  none of this can stand up for one moment in a courtroom .        this is not a courtroom  dr .  amadiro     said the chairman     and it is my duty to listen to everything that may be germane to a question under dispute .        this is not germane  mr .  chairman .  it is a cobweb .        yet it hangs together  somehow .  i do not seem to catch mr .  baley in a clear cut illogicality .  if one admits what he claims to have experienced  then his conclusions make a kind of sense .  do you deny all this  dr .  amadiro .  the airfoil damage  the pursuit  the intention to appropriate the humaniform robot .        i do .  absolutely .  none of it is true .     said amadiro .  it had been a noticeable while since he had smiled .     the earthman can produce a recording of our entire conversation and no doubt he will point out that i was delaying him by speaking at length  by inviting him to tour the institute  by inviting him to have dinner  but all that can equally well be interpreted as my stretching a point to be courteous and hospitable .  i was misled by a certain sympathy i have for earthmen  perhaps  and that   s all there is to that .  i deny his inferences and nothing of what he says can stand up against my denial .  my reputation is not such that a mere speculation can persuade anyone that i am the kind of devious plotter this earthman says i am .     the chairman scratched at his chin thoughtfully and said     certainly  i am not of a mind to accuse you on the basis of what the earthman has said so far .    mr .  baley  if this is all you have  it is interesting but insufficient .  is there anything more you have to say of substance .  i warn you that  if not  i have now spent all the time on this that i can afford to .         .   baley said     there is but one more subject i wish to bring up  mr .  chairman .  you have perhaps heard of gladia delmarre  or gladia solaria .  she calls herself simply gladia .        yes  mr .  baley     said the chairman with a testy edge to his voice .     i have heard of her .  i have seen the hyperwave show in which you and she play such remarkable parts .        she was associated with the robot  jander  for many months .  in fact  toward the end  he was her husband .     the chairman   s unfavorable stare at baley became a hard glare .     her what .        husband  mr .  chairman .     fastolfe  who half rose  sat down again  looking perturbed .  the chairman said harshly     that is illegal .  worse  it is ridiculous .  a robot could not impregnate her .  there could be no children .  the status of a husband  or of a wife  is never granted without some statement as to willingness to have a child if permitted .  even an earthman  i should think  would know that .     baley said     i am aware of this  mr .  chairman .  so  i am certain  was gladia .  she did not use the word    husband    in its legal sense but in an emotional one .  she considered jander the equivalent of a husband .  she felt toward him as though he were a husband .     the chairman turned to fastolfe .     did you know of this  dr .  fastolfe .  he was a robot on your staff .     fastolfe  clearly embarrassed  said     i knew she was fond of him .  i suspected she made use of him sexually .  i knew nothing of this illegal charade  however  until mr .  baley told me of it .     baley said     she was a solarian .  her concept of    husband    was not auroran .        obviously not     said the chairman .     but she did have enough of a sense of reality to keep it to herself  mr .  chairman .  she never told of this charade  as dr .  fastolfe calls it  to any auroran .  she told me the day before yesterday because she wanted to urge me on in the investigation of something that meant so much to her .  yet even so  i imagine she would not have used the word if she had not known i was an earthman and would understand it in her sense  and not in an auroran   s .        very well     said the chairman .     i   ll grant her a bare minimum of good sense  for a solarian .  is that the one more subject you wanted to bring up .        yes  mr .  chairman .        in that case  it is totally irrelevant and can play no part in our deliberations .        mr .  chairman  there is one question i must still ask .  one question .  a dozen words  sir  and then i will be through .     he said it as earnestly as he could  for everything depended on this .  the chairman hesitated .     agreed .  one last question .        yes  mr .  chairman .     baley would have liked to bark out the words  but he refrained .  nor did he raise his voice .  nor did he even point his finger .  everything depended on this .  everything had led up to this and yet he remembered fastolfe   s warning and said it almost casually .     how is it that dr .  amadiro knew that jander was gladia   s husband .        what .     the chairman   s white and bushy eyebrows raised themselves in surprise .     who said he knew anything of this .     asked a direct question  baley could continue .     ask him  mr .  chairman .     and he merely nodded in the direction of amadiro  who had risen from his seat and was staring at baley in obvious horror .      .   baley said again  very softly  reluctant to draw attention away from amadiro     ask him  mr .  chairman .  he seems upset .     the chairman said     what is this  dr .  amadiro .  did you know anything about the robot as supposed husband of this solarian woman .     amadiro stuttered  then pressed his lips together for a moment and tried again .  the paleness which had struck him had vanished and was replaced by a dull flush .  he said     i am caught by surprise at this meaningless accusation  mr .  chairman .  i do not know what it is all about .        may i explain  mr .  chairman .  very briefly .     said baley .   would he be cut off .      you had better     said the chairman grimly .     if you have any explanation  i would certainly like to hear it .        mr .  chairman     said baley .     i had a conversation with dr .  amadiro yesterday afternoon .  because it was his intention to keep me until the storm broke  he spoke more lengthily than he intended and  apparently  more carelessly .  in referring to gladia  he casually referred to the robot  jander  as her husband .  i   m curious as to how he knew that fact .        is this true  dr .  amadiro .     asked the chairman .  amadiro was still standing  bearing almost the appearance of a prisoner before a judge .  he said     whether it is true or not has no bearing on the question under discussion .        perhaps not     said the chairman     but i was astonished at your reaction to the question when it was put .  it occurs to me that there is a meaning to this that mr .  baley and you both understand and that i do not .  i therefore want to understand also .  did you or did you not know of this impossible relationship between jander and the solarian woman .     amadiro said in a choking voice     i could not possibly have .        that is no answer     said the chairman .     that is an equivocation .  you are making a judgment when i am asking you to hand me a memory .  did you or did you not make the statement imputed to you .        before he answers     said baley  feeling more certain of his ground now that the chairman was governed by moral outrage     it is only fair to dr .  amadiro for me to remind him that giskard  a robot who was also present at the meeting  can  if asked to do so  repeat the entire conversation  word for word  using the voice and intonation of both parties .  in short  the conversation is recorded .     amadiro burst into a kind of rage .     mr .  chairman  the robot  giskard  was designed  constructed  and programmed by dr .  fastolfe  who announces himself to be the best roboticist who exists and who is bitterly opposed to me .  can we trust a recording produced by such a robot .     baley said     perhaps you ought to hear the recording and come to your own decision  mr .  chairman .        perhaps i ought     said the chairman .     i am not here  dr .  amadiro  to have my decisions made for me .  but let us put that aside for a moment .  regardless of what the recording says  dr .  amadiro  do you wish to state for the record that you did not know that the solarian woman considered her robot to be her husband and that you never referred to him as her husband .  please remember  as you both  being legislators  should  that  although no robot is present  this entire conversation is being recorded in my own device .     he tapped a small bulge at his breast pocket .     flatly  then  dr .  amadiro .  yes or no .     amadiro said  with an edge of desperation in his voice     mr .  chairman  i honestly cannot remember what i said in casual conversation .  if i did mention the word  and i don   t admit i did  it may have been the result of some other casual conversation in which someone mentioned the fact that gladia acted as love struck toward her robot as though he were her husband .     the chairman said     and with whom did you have this other casual conversation .  who made this statement to you .        at the moment  i cannot say .     baley said     mr .  chairman  if dr .  amadiro will be so kind as to list anyone and everyone who might have used the word to him  we can question every one of them to discover which one can remember making such a remark .     amadiro said     i hope  mr .  chairman  you will consider the effect on the morale of the institute if anything of this sort is done .     the chairman said     i hope you will consider it  too  dr .  amadiro  and come up with a better answer to our question  so that we are not forced to extremes .        one moment  mr .  chairman     said baley  as obsequiously as he could manage     there remains a question .        again .  another one .     the chairman looked at baley without favor .     what is it .        why is dr .  amadiro struggling so to avoid admitting he knew of jander   s relation to gladia .  he says it is irrelevant .  in that case  why not say he knew of the relationship and be done with it .  i say it is relevant and that dr .  amadiro knows that his admission could be used to demonstrate criminal activity on his part .     amadiro thundered     i resent the expression and i demand an apology .     fastolfe smiled thinly and baley   s lips pressed together grimly .  he had forced amadiro over the edge .  the chairman turned an almost alarming red and said with passion     you demand .  you demand .  to whom do you demand .  i am the chairman .  i hear all views before deciding what to suggest as best to be done .  let me hear what the earthman has to say about his interpretation of your action .  if he is slandering you  he shall be punished  you may be sure  and i will take the broadest view of the slander statutes  too  you may be sure .  but you  amadiro  may make no demands upon me .  go on  earth man .  say what you have to say  but be extraordinarily careful .     baley said     thank you  mr .  chairman .  actually  there is one auroran to whom gladia did tell the secret of her relationship with jander .     the chairman interrupted .     well  who is that .  do not play your hyperwave tricks on me .     baley said     i have no intention of anything but a straightforward statement  mr .  chairman .  the one auroran is  of course  jander himself .  he may have been a robot  but he is an inhabitant of aurora and might be viewed as an auroran .  gladia must surely  in her passion  have addressed him as    my husband .     since dr .  amadiro has admitted he might possibly have heard from someone else some statement to the effect of jander   s husbandly relationship to gladia  isn   t it logical to suppose that he heard of the matter from jander .  would dr .  amadiro be willing  right now  to state for the record that he never spoke to jander during the period when jander formed part of gladia   s staff .     twice amadiro   s mouth opened as though he would speak .  twice he did not utter a sound .     well     said the chairman     did you speak to jander during that period  dr .  amadiro .     there was still no answer .  baley said softly     if he did  it is entirely relevant to the matter at hand .        i   m beginning to see that it must be  mr .  baley .  well  dr .  amadiro  once again  yes or no .     and amadiro burst forth     what evidence does this earthman have against me in this matter .  does he have a recording of any conversation i have had with jander .  does he have witnesses who are willing to say they have seen me with jander .  what does he have anything at all besides mere self serving statements .     the chairman turned to look at baley and baley said     mr .  chairman  if i have nothing at all  then dr .  amadiro should not hesitate to deny  for the record  any contact with jander  but he does not do so .  as it happens  in the course of my investigation  i spoke to dr .  vasilia aliena  the daughter of dr .  fastolfe .  i spoke also to a young auroran named santirix gremionis .  in the recordings of both interviews  it will be plain that dr .  vasilia encouraged gremionis to pay court to gladia .  you may question dr .  vasilia as to her purpose in so doing and as to whether this course of action had been suggested to her by dr .  amadiro .  it also appears that it was gremionis    custom to take long walks with gladia  which both enjoyed  and on which they were not accompanied by the robot  jander .  you might check on this  if you wish  sir .     the chairman said dryly     i may do so  but if all is as you say  what does this show .     baley said     i have stated that  failing dr .  fastolfe himself  the secret of the humaniform robot could be obtained only from daneel .  before jander   s death  it could  with equal facility  have been obtained from jander .  whereas daneel was part of dr .  fastolfe   s establishment and could not easily be reached  jander was part of gladia   s establishment and she was not as sophisticated as dr .  fastolfe in seeing to a robot   s protection .     isn   t it likely that dr .  amadiro took the occasion of gladia   s periodic absences from her establishment  when she was walking with gremionis  to converse with jander  perhaps by trimensional viewing  to study his responses  to subject him to various tests  and then to erase any sign of his visit with jander  so that he could never inform gladia of it .  it may be that he came close to finding what he wanted to know  before the attempt ended when jander went out of action .  his concentration then shifted to daneel .  he felt perhaps that he had only a few tests and observations left to make and so he set up the trap of yesterday evening  as i said earlier in my  my testimony .     the chairman said  in what was almost a whisper     now it all hangs together .  i am almost forced to believe .        plus one final point and then i will truly have nothing more to say     said baley .     in his examination and testing of jander  it is entirely possible that dr .  amadiro accidentally  and without any deliberate intention whatever  immobilized jander and thus committed roboticide .     and amadiro  maddened  shouted     no .  never .  nothing i did to that robot could possibly have immobilized him .     fastolfe interposed .     i agree .  mr .  chairman  i  too  think that dr .  amadiro did not immobilize jander .  however  mr .  chairman  dr .  amadiro   s statement just now would seem an implicit admission that he was working with jander  and that mr .  baley   s analysis of the situation is essentially accurate .     the chairman nodded .     i am forced to agree with you  dr .  fastolfe .    dr .  amadiro  you may insist on a formal denial of all this and that may force me into a full fledged investigation  which could do you a great deal of damage  however it turned out  and i rather suspect  at this stage  it is likely to turn out to your great disadvantage .  my suggestion is that you do not force this  that you do not cripple your own position in the legislature and  perhaps  cripple aurora   s ability to continue along a smooth political course .     as i see it  before the matter of jander   s immobilization came up  dr .  fastolfe had a majority of the legislators  not a large majority  admittedly  on his side in the matter of galactic settlement .  you would have swung enough legislators to your side by pushing the matter of dr .  fastolfe   s supposed responsibility for jander   s immobilization and thus have gained the majority .  but now dr .  fastolfe  if he wishes  can turn the tables by accusing you of the immobilization and  moreover  of having tried to hang a false accusation upon your opponent as well  and you would lose .     if i do not interfere  then it may be that you  dr .  amadiro  and you  dr .  fastolfe  actuated by stubbornness or even vindictiveness  will both marshal your forces and accuse each other of all sorts of things .  our political forces and public opinion  too  will be hopelessly divided  even fragmented  to our infinite harm .     i believe that  in that case  fastolfe   s victory  while inevitable  would be a very costly one  so that it would be my task as the chairman to swing the votes in his direction to begin with  and to place pressure upon you and your faction  dr .  amadiro  to accept fastolfe   s victory with as much grace as you can manage  and to do it right now  for the good of aurora .     fastolfe said     i am not interested in a crushing victory  mr .  chairman .  i propose again a compromise whereby aurora  the other spacer worlds  and earth  too  all have the freedom of settlement in the galaxy .  in return  i will be glad to join the robotics institute  put my knowledge of humaniform robots at its disposal  and thus facilitate dr .  amadiro   s plan  in return for his solemn agreement to abandon all thought of retaliation against earth at any time in the future and to put this into treaty form  with ourselves and earth as signatories .     the chairman nodded .     a wise and statesmanlike suggestion .  may i have your acceptance of this  dr .  amadiro .     amadiro now sat down .  his face was a study in defeat .  he said     i have not wanted personal power or the satisfaction of victory .  i wanted what i know to be best for aurora and i am convinced that this plan of dr .  fastolfe   s means an end to aurora someday .  however  i recognize that i am now helpless against the work of this earthman     he shot a quick venomous glance toward baley     and i am forced to accept dr .  fastolfe   s suggestion  though i will ask for permission to address the legislature on the subject and to state  for the record  my fears of the consequences .        we will  of course  allow that     said the chairman .     and if you   ll be guided by me  dr .  fastolfe  you   ll get this earthman off our world as fast as possible .  he has won your viewpoint for you  but it will not be a very popular one if aurorans have too long a time to brood over it as an earthly victory over aurorans .        you are quite right  mr .  chairman  and mr .  baley will be gone quickly  with my thanks and  i trust  with yours as well .        well     said the chairman  not with the best of grace     since his ingenuity has saved us from a bruising political battle  he has my thanks .    thank you  mr .  baley .         again baley     .   baley watched them leave from a distance .  though amadiro and the chairman had come together  they now left separately .  fastolfe came back from seeing them off  making no attempt to hide his intense relief .     come  mr .  baley     he said     you will have lunch with me and then  as soon after that as possible  you will leave for earth again .     his robotic staff was clearly in action with that in mind .  baley nodded and said sardonically     the chairman managed to thank me  but it seemed to stick in his throat .     fastolfe said     you have no idea how you have been honored .  the chairman rarely thanks anyone  but then no one ever thanks the chairman .  it is always left to history to praise chairmen and this one has served for over forty years .  he has grown cranky and ill tempered  as chairmen always do in their final decades .     however  mr .  baley  once again i thank you and  through me  aurora will thank you .  you will live to see earthmen move outward into space  even in your short lifetime  and we will help you with our technology .     how you have managed to untie this knot of ours  mr .  baley  in two and a half days  less  i can   t imagine .  you are a wonder .   but  come  you will want to wash and freshen up .  i know i do .     for the first time since the chairman arrived  baley had time to think of something besides his next sentence .  he still didn   t know what it was that had come to him three times  first on the point of sleep  then on the point of unconsciousness  and finally in postcoital relaxation .     he was there first .     it was still meaningless  yet he had made his point to the chairman and carried all before him without it .  could it have any meaning at all  then  if it was a part of a mechanism that didn   t fit and didn   t seem needed .  was it nonsense .  it chafed at the corner of his mind and he came to lunch a victor without the proper sensation of victory .  somehow  he felt as though he had missed the point .  for one thing  would the chairman stick to his resolve .  amadiro had lost the battle  but he didn   t seem the kind of person who would give up altogether under any circumstances .  give him credit and assume he meant what he said  that he was driven not by personal vainglory but by his concept of auroran patriotism .  if that were so  he could not give up .  baley felt it necessary to warn fastolfe .     dr .  fastolfe     he said     i don   t think it   s over .  dr .  amadiro will continue the fight to exclude earth .     fastolfe nodded as the dishes were served .     i know he will .  i expect him to .  however  i have no fear as long as the matter of jander   s immobilization is set to rest .  with that aside  i   m sure i can always outmaneuver him in the legislature .  fear not  mr .  baley  earth will move along .  nor need you fear personal danger from a vengeful amadiro .  you will be off this planet and on your way back to earth before sunset  and daneel will escort you  of course .  what   s more  the report we   ll send with you will ensure  once more  a healthy promotion for you .        i am eager to go     said baley     but i hope i will have time to say my good byes .  i would like to  to see gladia once more and i would like to say good bye to giskard  who may have saved my life last night .        no question of that  mr .  baley .  but please eat  won   t you .     baley went through the motions of eating  but didn   t enjoy it .  like the confrontation with the chairman and the victory that ensued  the food was oddly flavorless .  he should not have won .  the chairman should have cut him off .  amadiro  if necessary  should have made a flat denial .  it would have been accepted over the word  or the reasoning  of an earthman .  but fastolfe was jubilant .  he said     i had feared the worst  mr .  baley .  i feared the meeting with the chairman was premature and that nothing you could say would help the situation .  yet you managed it so well .  i was lost in admiration  listening to you .  at any moment  i expected amadiro to demand that his word be taken against an earthman who  after all  was in a constant state of semimadness at finding himself on a strange planet in the open      baley said frigidly     with all respect  dr .  fastolfe  i was not in a constant state of semimadness .  last night was exceptional  but it was the only time i lost control .  for the rest of my stay on aurora  i may have been uncomfortable from time to time  but i was always in my perfect mind .     some of the anger he had suppressed at considerable cost to himself in the confrontation with the chairman was expressing itself now .     only during the storm  sir  except  of course     recollecting     for a moment or two on the approaching spaceship      he was not conscious of the manner in which the thought   the memory  the interpretation  came to him or at what speed .  one moment it did not exist  the next moment it was full blown in his mind  as though it had been there all the time and needed only the bursting of a soap bubble veil to show it .     jehoshaphat .     he said in an awed whisper .  then  with his fist coming down on the table and rattling the dishes     jehoshaphat .        what is it  mr .  baley .     asked fastolfe  startled .  baley stared at him and heard the question only belatedly .     nothing  dr .  fastolfe .  i was just thinking of dr .  amadiro   s infernal gall in doing the damage to jander and then laboring to fix the blame on you  in arranging to have me go half mad in the storm last night and then using that as a way of casting doubt on my statements .  i was just  momentarily  angry .        well  no need to be  mr .  baley .  and actually  it is quite impossible for amadiro to have immobilized jander .  it remains purely a chance event .    to he sure  it is possible that amadiro   s investigation may have increased the odds of such a chance event taking place  but i would not argue the matter .     baley heard the statement with half of one ear .  what he had just said to fastolfe was fiction and what fastolfe was saying didn   t matter .  it was  as the chairman would have said  irrelevant .  in fact  everything that had happened  everything that baley had explained  was irrelevant .    but nothing had to be changed because of that .  except one thing  after a while .  jehoshaphat .  he whispered in the silence of his mind and turned suddenly to the lunch  eating with gusto and with joy .      .   once again  baley crossed the lawn between fastolfe   s establishment and gladia   s .  he would be seeing gladia for the fourth time in three days  and  his heart seemed to compress into a hard knot in his chest  now for the last time .  giskard was with him but at a distance  more intent than ever on the surroundings .  surely  with the chairman in full possession of the facts  there should be a relaxation of any concern for baley   s safety  if there ever had been any  by rights  when it was daneel who had been in danger .  presumably  giskard had not yet been reinstructed in the matter .  only once did he approach baley and that was when the latter called out     giskard  where   s daneel .     swiftly  giskard covered the ground between them  as though reluctant to speak in anything but a quiet tone .     daneel is on his way to the spaceport  sir  in the company of several others of the staff  in order to make arrangements for your transportation to earth .  when you are taken to the spaceport  he will meet you there and be on the ship with you  taking his final leave of you at earth .        good news .  i treasure every day of companionship with daneel .  and you  giskard .  will you accompany us .        no  sir .  i am instructed to remain on aurora .  however  daneel will serve you well  even in my absence .        i am sure of that  giskard  but i will miss you .        thank you  sir     said giskard and retreated as rapidly as he had come .  baley gazed after him speculatively for a moment or so .    no  first things first .  he had to see gladia .      .   she advanced to greet him  and what a world of change had taken place in two days .  she was not joyous  she was not dancing  she was not bubbling  there was still the grave look of one who had suffered a shock and a loss  but the troubled aura around her was gone .  there was a kind of serenity now  as though she had grown aware of the fact that life continued after all and might even  on occasion  be sweet .  she managed a smile  warm and friendly  as she advanced to him and held out her hand .     oh  take it  take it  elijah     she said when he hesitated .     it   s ridiculous for you to hang back and pretend you don   t want to touch me after last night .  you see  i still remember it and i haven   t come to regret it .  quite the contrary .     baley performed the unusual operation  for him  of smiling in return .     i remember it  too  gladia  and i don   t regret it either .  i would even like to do it again  but i have come to say good bye .     a shade fell across her face .     then you   ll be going back to earth .  yet the report i got by way of the robot network that always operates between fastolfe   s establishment and my own is that all went well .  you can   t have failed        i did not fail .  dr .  fastolfe  has  in fact  won completely .  i don   t believe there will be any suggestion at all that he was in any way involved in jander   s death .        because of what you had to say  elijah .        i believe so .        i knew it .     there was a tinge of self satisfaction to that .     i knew you would do it when i told them to get you on the case .    but then why are you being sent home .        precisely because the case is solved .  if i remain here longer  i will be a foreign irritant in the body politic  apparently .     she looked at him dubiously for a moment and said     i   m not sure what you mean by that .  it sounds like an earth expression to me .  but never mind .  were you able to find out who killed jander .  that is the important part .     baley looked around .  giskard was standing in one niche  one of gladia   s robots in another .  gladia interpreted the look without trouble .  she said     now  elijah  you must learn to stop worrying about robots .  you don   t worry about the presence of the chair  do you  or of these drapes .     baley nodded .     well  then  gladia  i   m sorry  i   m terribly sorry  but i had to tell them of the fact that jander was your husband .     her eyes opened wide and he hastened on .     i had to .  it was essential to the case  but i promise it won   t affect your status on aurora .     as briefly as he might  he summarized the events of the confrontation and concluded     so  you see  no one killed jander .  the immobilization was the result of a chance change in his positronic pathways  though the probabilities of that chance change may have been enhanced by what had been going on .        and i never knew     she moaned .     i never knew .  i connived at this amadiro   s foul plan .    and he is the one responsible just as much  as though he had deliberately hacked away at him with a sledgehammer .        gladia     said baley earnestly     that is uncharitable .  he had no intention of doing harm to jander and what he was doing was  in his own eyes  for the good of aurora .  as it is  he is punished .  he is defeated  his plans are in shambles  and the robotics institute will come under the domination of dr .  fastolfe .  you yourself could not work out a more suitable punishment  no matter how you tried .     she said     i   ll think about that .    but what do i do with santirix gremionis  this good looking young lackey whose job it was to lure me away .  no wonder he appeared to cling to hope despite my repeated refusal .  well  he   ll come here again and i will have the pleasure of      baley shook his head violently .     gladia  no .  i have interviewed him and i assure you he had no knowledge of what was going on .  he was as much deceived as you were .  in fact  you have it reversed .  he was not persistent because it was important to lure you away .  he was useful to amadiro because he was so persistent  and that persistence was out of regard for you .  out of love  if the word means on aurora what it means on earth .        on aurora  it is choreography .  jander was a robot and you are an earthman .  it is different with the aurorans .        so you have explained .  but gladia  you learned from jander to take  you learned from me  not that i meant it  to give .  if you benefit by learning  is it not only right and fair that you should teach in your turn .  gremionis is sufficiently attracted to you to be willing to learn .  he already defies auroran convention by persisting in the face of your refusal .  he will defy more .  you can teach him to give and take and you will learn to do both in alternation or together  in company with him .     gladia looked searchingly into his eyes .     elijah  are you trying to get rid of me .     slowly  baley nodded .     yes  gladia  i am .  it   s your happiness i want at this moment  more than i have ever wanted anything for myself or for earth .  i can   t give you happiness  but if gremionis can give it to you  i will be as happy  almost as happy as if it were i myself who were making the gift .     gladia  he may surprise you with how eagerly he will break through the choreography when you show him how .  and the word will somehow spread  so that others will come to swoon at your feet  and gremionis may find it possible to teach other women .  gladia  it may be that you will revolutionize auroran sex before you are through .  you will have three centuries in which to do so .     gladia stared at him and then broke into a laugh .     you are teasing .  you are being deliberately foolish .  i wouldn   t have thought it of you  elijah .  you always look so long faced and grave .  jehoshaphat .      and  with the last word  she tried to imitate his somber baritone .   baley said     perhaps i   m teasing a little  but i mean it in essence .  promise me that you will give gremionis his chance .     she came closer to him and  without hesitation  he put his arm around her .  she placed her finger on his lips and he made a small kissing motion .  she said softly     wouldn   t you rather have me for yourself  elijah .     he said  just as softly  and unable to become unaware of the robots in the room      yes  i would  gladia .  i am ashamed to say that at this moment i would be content to have the earth fall to pieces if i could have you  but i can   t .  in a few hours  i   ll be off aurora and there   s no way you will be allowed to go with me .  nor do i think i will ever be allowed to come back to aurora  nor is it possible that you will ever visit earth .     i will never see you again  gladia  but i will never forget you  either .  i will die in a few decades and when i do you will be as young as you are now  so we would have to say good bye soon whatever we could imagine as happening .     she put her head against his chest .     oh  elijah  twice you came into my life  each time for just a few hours .  twice you   ve done so much for me and then said good bye .  the first time all i could do was touch your face  but what a difference that made .  the second time  i did so much more  and again what a difference that made .  i   ll never forget you  elijah  if i live more centuries than i can count .     baley said     then let it not be the kind of memory that cuts you off from happiness .  accept gremionis and make him happy   and let him make you happy as well .  and  remember  there is nothing to prevent you from sending me letters .  the hyperpost between aurora and earth exists .        i will  elijah .  and you will write to me as well .        i will  gladia .     then there was silence and  reluctantly  they moved apart .  she remained standing in the middle of the room and when he went to the door and turned back  she was still standing there with a little smile .  his lips shaped  good bye .  and then because there was no sound  he could not have done it with sound  he added  my love .  and her lips moved  too .  goode bye  my dearest love .  and he turned and walked out and knew he would never see her in tangible form  never touch her again .      .   it was a while before elijah could bring himself to consider the task that still lay before him .  he shad walked in silence perhaps half the distance back to fastolfe   s establishment before he stopped and lifted his arm .  the observant giskard was at his side in a moment .  baley said     how much time before i must leave for the spaceport  giskard .        three hours and ten minutes  sir .     baley thought a moment .     i would like to walk over to that tree there and sit down with my back against the trunk and spend some time there alone .  with you  of course  but away from other human beings .        in the open  sir .     the robot   s voice was unable to express surprise and shock  but somehow baley had the feeling that  if giskard were human  those words would express those feelings .     yes     said baley .     i have to think and  after last night  a calm day like this  sunny  cloudless  mild  scarcely seems dangerous .  i   ll go indoors if i get agoraphobic .  i promise .  so will you join me .        yes  sir .        good .     baley led the way .  they reached the tree and baley touched the trunk gingerly and then stared at his finger  which remained perfectly clean .  reassured that leaning against the trunk would not dirty him  he inspected the ground and then sat down carefully and rested his back against the tree .  it was not nearly as comfortable as the back of a chair would have been  but there was a feeling of peace  oddly enough  that perhaps he would not have had inside a room .  giskard remained standing and baley said     won   t you sit down  too .        i am as comfortable standing  sir .        i know that  giskard  but i will think better if i don   t have to look up at you .        i could not guard you against possible harm as efficiently if i were seated  sir .        i know that  too  giskard  but there is no reasonable danger at the moment .  my mission is over  the case is    solved  dr .  fastolfe   s position is secure .  you can risk being seated and i order you to sit down .     giskard at once sat down  facing baley  but his eyes continued to wander in this direction and that and were ever alert .  baley looked at the sky  through the leaves of the tree  green against blue  listened to the susurration of insects and to the sudden call of a bird  noted a disturbance of grass nearby that might have meant a small animal passing by  and again thought how oddly peaceful it all was and how different this peacefulness was from the clamor of the city .  this was a quiet peace  an unhurried peace  a removed peace .  for the first time  baley caught a faint suggestion of how it might be to prefer outside to the city .  he caught himself being thankful to his experiences on aurora  to the storm most of all   for he knew now that he would be able to leave earth and face the  conditions of whatever new world he might settle on  he and ben  and perhaps jessie .  he said     last night  in the darkness of the storm  i wondered if i might have seen .  aurora   s satellite were it not for the clouds .  it has a satellite  if i recall my reading correctly .        two  actually  sir .  the larger is tithonus  but it is still so small that it appears only as a moderately bright star .  the smaller is not visible at all to the unaided eye and is simply called tithonus ii  when it is referred to at all .        thank you .    and thank you  giskard  for rescuing me last night .     he looked at the robot .     i don   t know the proper way of thanking you .        it is not necessary to thank me at all .  i was merely following the dictates of the first law .  i had no choice in the matter .        nevertheless  i may even owe you my life and it is important that you know i understand this .    and now  giskard  what ought ito do .        concerning what matter  sir .        my mission is over .  dr .  fastolfe   s views are secure .  earth   s future may be assured .  it would seem i have nothing more to do and yet there is the matter of jander .        i do not understand  sir .        well  it seems settled that he died by a chance shift of positronic potential in his brain  but fastolfe admits the chance of that is infinitesimally small .  even with amadiro   s activities  the chance  though possibly greater  would remain infinitesimally small .  at least  so fastolfe thinks .  it continues to seem to me  then  that jander   s death was one of deliberate roboticide .  yet i don   t dare raise this point now .  i don   t want to unsettle matters that have been brought to such a satisfactory conclusion .  i don   t want to put fastolfe in jeopardy again .  i don   t want to make gladia unhappy .  i don   t know what to do .  i can   t talk to a human being about this  so i   m talking to you  giskard .        yes  sir .        i can always order you to erase whatever i have said and to remember it no more .        yes  sir .        in your opinion  what ought i to do .     giskard said     if there is a roboticide  sir  there must be someone capable of committing the act .  only dr .  fastolfe is capable of committing it and he says he did not do it .        yes  we started with that situation .  i believe dr .  fastolfe and am quite certain he did not do it .        then how could there have been a roboticide  sir .        suppose that someone else knew as much about robots as dr .  fastolfe does  giskard .     baley drew up his knees and clasped his hands around them .  he did not look at giskard and seemed lost in thought .     who might that be  sir .     asked giskard .  and finally  baley reached the crucial point .  he said     you  giskard .         .   if giskard had been human  he might have simply stared  silent and stunned  or he might have raged angrily  or shrunk back in terror  or had any of a dozen responses .  because he was a robot  he showed no sign of any emotion whatever and simply said     why do you say so  sir .     baley said     i am quite certain  giskard  that you know exactly how i have come to this conclusion  but you will do me a favor if you allow me  in this quiet place and iii this bit of time before i must leave  to explain the matter for my own benefit .  i would like to hear myself talk about it .  and i would like you to correct me where i am wrong .        by all means  sir .        i suppose my initial mistake was to suppose that you are a less complicated and more primitive robot than daneel is  simply because you look less human .  a human being will always suppose that  the more human a robot is  the more advanced  complicated  and intelligent he will be .  to be sure  a robot like you is easily designed and one like daneel is a great problem for men like amadiro and can be handled only by a robotics genius such as fastolfe .  however  the difficulty in designing daneel lies  i suspect  in reproducing all the human aspects such as facial expression  intonation of voice  gestures and movements that are extraordinarily intricate but have nothing really to do with complexity of mind .  am i right .        quite right  sir .        so i automatically underestimated you  as does everyone .  yet you gave yourself away even before we landed on aurora .  you remember  perhaps  that during the landing  i was overcome by an agoraphobic spasm and was  for a moment  even more helpless than i was last night in the storm .        i do  sir .        at the time  daneel was in the cabin with me  while you were outside the door .  i was falling into a kind of catatonic state  noiselessly  and he was  perhaps  not looking at me and so knew nothing of it .  you were outside the cabin and yet it was you who dashed in and turned off the viewer i was holding .  you got there first  ahead of daneel  though his reflexes are as fast as yours  i   m sure  as he demonstrated when he prevented dr .  fastolfe from striking me .        surely it cannot be that dr .  fastolfe was striking you .        he wasn   t .  he was merely demonstrating daneel   s reflexes .    and yet  as i say  in the cabin you got there first .  i was scarcely in condition to observe that fact  but i have been trained to observe and i am not put entirely out of action even by agoraphobic terror  as i showed last night .  i did notice you were there first  though i tended to forget the fact .  there is  of course  only one logical solution .     baley paused  as though expecting giskard to agree  but the robot said nothing .   in later years  this was what baley pictured first when thinking of his stay on aurora .  not the storm .  not even gladia .  it was  rather  the quiet time under the tree   with the green leaves against the blue sky  the mild breeze  the soft sound of animals  and giskard opposite him with faintly glowing eyes .   baley said     it would seem that you could somehow detect my state of mind and  even through the closed door  tell that i was having a seizure of some sort .  or  to put it briefly and perhaps simplistically  you can read minds .        yes  sir     said giskard quietly .     and you can somehow influence minds  too .  i believe you noted that i had detected this and you obscured it in my mind  so that i somehow did not remember or did not see the significance  if i did casually recall the situation .  yet you did not do that entirely efficiently  perhaps because your powers are limited      giskard said     sir  the first law is paramount .  i had to come to your rescue  although i quite realized that would give me away .  and i had to obscure your mind minimally  in order not to damage it in any way .     baley nodded .     you have your difficulties  i see .  obscured minimally  so i did remember it when my mind was sufficiently relaxed and could think by free association .  just before i lost consciousness in the storm  i knew you would find me first  as you had on the ship .  you may have found me by infrared radiation  but every mammal and bird was radiating as well and that might be confusing  but you could also detect mental activity  even if i were unconscious  and that would help you to find me .        it certainly helped     said giskard .     when i did remember  close to sleep or unconsciousness  i would forget again when fully conscious .  last night  however  i remembered for the third time and i was not alone .  gladia was with me and could repeat what i had said  which was    he was there first .     and even then i could not remember the meaning  until a chance remark of dr .  fastolfe   s led to a thought that worked its way past the obscuration .  then  once it dawned on me  i remembered other things .  thus  when i was wondering if i were really landing on aurora  you assured me that our destination was aurora before i actually asked .    i presume you allow no one to know of your mind reading ability .        that is true  sir .        why is that .        my mind reading gives me a unique ability to obey the first law  sir  so i value its existence .  i can prevent harm to human beings far more efficiently .  it seemed to me  however  that neither dr .  fastolfe  nor any other human being  would long tolerate a mind reading robot  so i keep the ability secret .  dr .  fastolfe loves to tell the legend of the mind reading robot who was destroyed by susan calvin and i would not want him to duplicate dr .  calvin   s feat .        yes  he told the legend to me .  i suspect that he knows  subliminally  that you read minds or he wouldn   t harp on the legend so .  and it is dangerous for him to do so  as far as you are concerned  i should think .  certainly  it helped put the matter in my mind        i do what i can to neutralize the danger without unduly tampering with dr .  fastolfe   s mind .  dr .  fastolfe invariably stresses the legendary and impossible nature of the story when he tells it .        yes  i remember that  too .  but if fastolfe does not know you can read minds  it must be that you were not designed originally with these powers .  how  then  do you come to have them .    no  don   t tell me  giskard .  let me suggest something .  miss vasilia was particularly fascinated with you when she was a young woman first becoming interested in robotics .  she told me that she had experimented by programming you under fastolfe   s distant supervision .  could it be that  at one time  quite by accident  she did something that gave you the power .  is that correct .        that is correct  sir .        and do you know what that something is .        yes  sir .        are you the only mind reading robot that exists .        so far  yes  sir .  there will be others .        if i asked you what it was that dr .  vasilia did to you to give you such powers  or if dr .  fastolfe did  would you tell us by virtue of the second law .        no  sir  for it is my judgment that it would do you harm to know and my refusal to tell you under the first law would take precedence .  the problem would not arise  however  for i would know that someone was going to ask the question and give the order and i would remove the impulse to do so from the mind before it could be done .        yes     said baley .     evening before last  as we were walking from gladia   s to fastolfe   s  i asked daneel if he had had any contact with jander during the latter   s stay with gladia and he answered quite simply that he had not .  i then turned to ask you the same question and  somehow  i never did .  you quashed the impulse for me to do so  i take it .        yes  sir .        because if i had asked     you would have had to say that you knew him well at that time and you were not prepared to have me know that .        i was not  sir .        but during this period of contact with jander  you knew he was being tested by amadiro because  i presume  you could read jander   s mind or detect his positronic potentials         yes  sir  the same ability covers both robotic and human mental activity .  robots are far easier to understand .        you disapproved of amadiro   s activities because you agreed with fastolfe on the matter of settling the galaxy .        yes  sir .        why did you not stop amadiro .  why did you not remove from his mind the impulse to test jander .     giskard said     sir  i do not lightly tamper with minds .  amadiro   s resolve was so deep and complex that  to remove it  i would have had to do much  and his mind is an advanced and important one that i would be reluctant to damage .  i let the matter continue for a great while  during which i pondered on which action would best fulfill my first law needs .  finally  i decided on the proper manner to correct the situation .  it was not an easy decision .        you decided to immobilize jander before amadiro could work out the method for designing a true humaniform robot .  you knew how to do so  since you had  over the years  gained a perfect understanding of fastolfe   s theories from fastolfe   s mind .  is that right .        exactly  sir .        so that fastolfe was not the only one  after all  expert enough to immobilize jander .        in a sense  he was  sir .  my own ability is merely the reflection  or the extension  of his .        but it will do .  did you not see that this immobilization would place fastolfe in great danger .  that he would be the natural suspect .  did you plan on admitting your action and revealing your abilities if that were necessary to save him .     giskard said     i did indeed see that dr .  fastolfe would be in a painful situation  but i did not intend to admit my guilt .  i had hoped to utilize the situation as a wedge for getting you to aurora .        getting me here .  was that your idea .     baley felt rather stupefied .     yes  sir .  with your permission  i would like to explain .     baley said     please do .     giskard said     i knew of you from miss gladia and from dr .  fastolfe  not only from what they said but from what was in their minds .  i learned of the situation on earth .  earthmen  it was clear  live behind walls  which they find difficult to escape from  but it was just as clear to me that aurorans live behind walls  too .     aurorans live behind walls made of robots  who shield them from all the vicissitudes of life and who  in amadiro   s plans  would build up shielded societies to wall up aurorans settling new worlds .  aurorans also live behind walls made up of their own extended lives  which forces them to overvalue individuality and keeps them from pooling their scientific resources .  nor do they indulge in the rough and tumble of controversy  but  through their chairman  demand a short circuiting of all uncertainty and that decisions on solutions be reached before problems are aired .  they could not be bothered with actually thrashing out best solutions .  what they wanted were quiet solutions .     the earthman   s walls are crude and literal  so that their existence is obtrusive and obvious  and there are always some who long to escape .  the aurorans    walls are immaterial and aren   t even seen as walls  so that none can even conceive of escaping .  it seemed to me  then  that it must be earthmen and not aurorans  or any other spacers  who must settle the galaxy and establish what will someday become a galactic empire .     all this was dr .  fastolfe   s reasoning and i agreed with it .  dr .  fastolfe was  however  satisfied with the reasoning  while i  given my own abilities  could not be .  i had to examine the mind of at least one earthman directly  in order that i might check my conclusions  and you were the earthman i thought i could bring to aurora .  the immobilization of jander served both to stop amadiro and to be the occasion for your visit .  i pushed miss gladia very slightly to have her suggest your coming to dr .  fastolfe  i pushed him in turn  very slightly  to have him suggest it to the chairman  and i pushed the chairman  very slightly  to have him agree .  once you arrived  i studied you and was pleased with what i found .     giskard stopped speaking and became robotically impassive again .  baley frowned .     it occurs to me that i have earned no credit in what i have done here .  you must have seen to it that i found my way to the truth .        no  sir .  on the contrary .  i placed barriers in your way   reasonable ones  of course .  i refused to let you recognize my abilities  even though i was forced to give myself away .  i made sure that you felt dejection and despair at odd times .  i encouraged you to risk the open  in order to study your responses .  yet you found your way through and over all these obstacles and i was pleased .     i found that you longed for the walls of your city but recognized that you must learn to do without them .  i found that you suffered from the view of aurora from space and from your exposure to the storm  but that neither prevented you from thinking nor drove you from your problem .  i found that you accept your shortcomings and your brief life  and that you do not dodge controversy .     baley said     how do you know i am representative of earth people generally .        i know you are not .  but from your mind  i know there are some like you and we will build with those .  i will see to it  and now that i know clearly the path that must be followed  i will prepare other robots like myself  and they will see to it  too .     baley said suddenly     you mean that mind reading robots will come to earth .        no  i do not .  and you are right to be alarmed .  involving robots directly will mean the construction of the very walls that are dooming aurora and the spacer worlds to paralysis .  earthmen will have to settle the galaxy without robots of any kind .  it will mean difficulties  dangers  and harm without measure   events that robots would labor to prevent if they were present   but  in the end  human beings will be better off for having worked on their own .  and perhaps someday  some long away day in the future  robots can intervene once more .  who can tell .     baley said curiously     do you see the future .        no  sir  but studying minds as i do  i can tell dimly that there are laws that govern human behavior as the three laws of robotics govern robotic behavior  and with these it may be that the future will be dealt with  after a fashion  someday .  the human laws are far more complicated than the laws of robotics are and i do not have any idea as to how they may be organized .  they may be statistical in nature  so that they might not be fruitfully expressed except when dealing with huge populations .  they may be very loosely binding  so that they might not make sense unless those huge populations are unaware of the operation of those laws .        tell me  giskard  is this what dr .  fastolfe refers to as the future science of    psychohistory    .        yes  sir .  i have gently inserted it into his mind  in order that the process of working it out begin .  it will be needed someday  now that the existence of the spacer worlds as a long lived robotized culture is coming to an end and a new wave of human expansion by short lived human beings  without robots  will be beginning .     and now     giskard rose to his feet     i think  sir  that we must go to dr .  fastolfe   s establishment and prepare for your leavetaking .  all that we have said here will not be repeated  of course .        it is strictly confidential  i assure you     said baley .     indeed     said giskard calmly .     but you need not fear the responsibility of having to remain silent .  i will allow you to remember  but you will never have the urge to repeat the matter   not the slightest .     baley lifted his eyebrows in resignation over that and said     one thing  though  giskard  before you clamp down on me .  will you see to it that gladia is not disturbed on this planet  that she is not treated unkindly because she is a solarian and has accepted a robot as her husband  and  and that she will accept the offers of gremionis .        i heard your final conversation with miss gladia  sir  and i understand .  it will he taken care of .  now  sir  may i take my leave of you while no other is watching .     giskard thrust out his hand in the most human gesture baley had ever seen him make .  baley took it .  the fingers were hard and cool in his grip .     good bye  friend giskard .     giskard said     good bye  friend elijah  and remember that  although people apply the phrase to aurora  it is  from this point on  earth itself that is the true world of the dawn .      about the author  isaac asimov was born in the soviet union to his great surprise .  he moved quickly to correct the situation .  when his parents emigrated to the united states  isaac  three years old at the time  stowed away in their baggage .  he has been an american citizen since the age of eight .  brought up in brooklyn  and educated in its public schools  he eventually found his way to columbia university and  over the protests of the school administration  managed to annex a series of degrees in chemistry  up to and including a ph . d .  he then infiltrated boston university and climbed the academic ladder  ignoring all cries of outrage  until he found himself professor of biochemistry .  meanwhile  at the age of nine  he found the love of his life  in the inanimate sense  when he discovered his first science fiction magazine .  by the time he was eleven  he began to write stories  and at eighteen  he actually worked up the nerve to submit one .  it was rejected .  after four long months of tribulation and suffering  he sold his first story and  thereafter  he never looked back .  in       when he was twenty one years old  he wrote the classic short story    nightfall    and his future was assured .  shortly before that he had begun writing his robot stories  and shortly after that he had begun his foundation series .  what was left except quantity .  at the present time  he has published over     books  distributed through every major division of the dewey system of library classification  and shows no signs of slowing up .  he remains as youthful  as lively  and ass lovable as ever  and grows more handsome with each year .  you can be sure that this is so since he has written this little essay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity is notorious .  he is married to janet jeppson  phsychiatrist and writer  has two children by a previous marriage  and lives in new york city .
