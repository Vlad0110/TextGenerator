equal rites   a discworld   novel      terry pratchett      acknowledgements   thanks to neil gaiman  who loaned us the last  surviving copy of the liber paginarum fulvarum   and a big hallo to all the kids at the h . p .   lovecraft holiday fun club .   i would like it to be clearly understood that this  book is not wacky .  only dumb redheads in  fifties    sitcoms are wacky .   no  it   s not zany  either .       contents   acknowledgements      begin reading    about the author    praise    books by terry pratchett    copyright    about the publisher      begin reading      this is a story about magic and where it goes and perhaps more importantly where it comes from and why  although it doesn   t pretend to answer all or any of these questions .   it may  however  help to explain why gandalf never got married and why merlin was a man .  because this is also a story about sex  although probably not in the athletic  tumbling  count the legs and divide by two sense unless the characters get totally beyond the author   s control .  they might .   however  it is primarily a story about a world .  here it comes now .  watch closely  the special effects are quite expensive .   a bass note sounds .  it is a deep  vibrating chord that hints that the brass section may break in at any moment with a fanfare for the cosmos  because the scene is the blackness of deep space with a few stars glittering like the dandruff on the shoulders of god .   then it comes into view overhead  bigger than the biggest  most unpleasantly armed starcruiser in the imagination of a three ring filmmaker  a turtle  ten thousand miles long .  it is great a   tuin  one of the rare astrochelonians from a universe where things are less as they are and more like people imagine them to be  and it carries on its meteor pocked shell four giant elephants who bear on their enormous shoulders the great round wheel of the discworld .   as the viewpoint swings around  the whole of the world can be seen by the light of its tiny orbiting sun .  there are continents  archipelagos  seas  deserts  mountain ranges and even a tiny central ice cap .  the inhabitants of this place  it is obvious  won   t have any truck with global theories .  their world  bounded by an encircling ocean that falls forever into space in one long waterfall  is as round and flat as a geological pizza  although without the anchovies .   a world like that  which exists only because the gods enjoy a joke  must be a place where magic can survive .  and sex too  of course .      he came walking through the thunderstorm and you could tell he was a wizard  partly because of the long cloak and carven staff but mainly because the raindrops were stopping several feet from his head  and steaming .   it was good thunderstorm country  up here in the ramtop mountains  a country of jagged peaks  dense forests and little river valleys so deep the daylight had no sooner reached the bottom than it was time to leave again .  ragged wisps of cloud clung to the lesser peaks below the mountain trail along which the wizard slithered and slid .  a few slot eyed goats watched him with mild interest .  it doesn   t take a lot to interest goats .   sometimes he would stop and throw his heavy staff into the air .  it always came down pointing the same way and the wizard would sigh  pick it up  and continue his squelchy progress .   the storm walked around the hills on legs of lightning  shouting and grumbling .   the wizard disappeared around the bend in the track and the goats went back to their damp grazing .   until something else caused them to look up .  they stiffened  their eyes widening  their nostrils flaring .   this was strange  because there was nothing on the path .  but the goats still watched it pass by until it was out of sight .      there was a village tucked in a narrow valley between steep woods .  it wasn   t a large village  and wouldn   t have shown up on a map of the mountains .  it barely showed up on a map of the village .   it was  in fact  one of those places that exist merely so that people can have come from them .  the universe is littered with them  hidden villages  windswept little towns under wide skies  isolated cabins on chilly mountains  whose only mark on history is to be the incredibly ordinary place where something extraordinary started to happen .  often there is no more than a little plaque to reveal that  against all gynecological probability  someone very famous was born halfway up a wall .   mist curled between the houses as the wizard crossed a narrow bridge over the swollen stream and made his way to the village smithy  although the two facts had nothing to do with one another .  the mist would have curled anyway  it was experienced mist and had got curling down to a fine art .   the smithy was fairly crowded  of course .  a smithy is one place where you can depend on finding a good fire and someone to talk to .  several villagers were lounging in the warm shadows but  as the wizard approached  they sat up expectantly and tried to look intelligent  generally with indifferent success .   the smith didn   t feel the need to be quite so subservient .  he nodded at the wizard  but it was a greeting between equals  or at least between equals as far as the smith was concerned .  after all  any halfway competent blacksmith has more than a nodding acquaintance with magic  or at least likes to think he has .   the wizard bowed .  a white cat that had been sleeping by the furnace woke up and watched him carefully .      what is the name of this place  sir .     said the wizard .   the blacksmith shrugged .      bad ass     he said .      bad    .         ass     repeated the blacksmith  his tone defying anyone to make something of it .   the wizard considered this .      a name with a story behind it     he said at last     which were circumstances otherwise i would be pleased to hear .  but i would like to speak to you  smith  about your son .         which one .     said the smith  and the hangers on sniggered .  the wizard smiled .      you have seven sons  do you not .  and you yourself were an eighth son .      the smith   s face stiffened .  he turned to the other villagers .      all right  the rain   s stopping     he said .     piss off  the lot of you .  me and       he looked at the wizard with raised eyebrows .      drum billet     said the wizard .      me and mr .  billet have things to talk about .     he waved his hammer vaguely and  one after another  craning over their shoulders in case the wizard did anything interesting  the audience departed .   the smith drew a couple of stools from under a bench .  he took a bottle out of a cupboard by the water tank and poured a couple of very small glasses of clear liquid .   the two men sat and watched the rain and the mist rolling over the bridge .  then the smith said     i know what son you mean .  old granny is up with my wife now .  eighth son of an eighth son  of course .  it did cross my mind but i never gave it much thought  to be honest .  well  well .  a wizard in the family  eh .         you catch on very quickly     said billet .  the white cat jumped down from its perch  sauntered across the floor and vaulted into the wizard   s lap  where it curled up .  his thin fingers stroked it absentmindedly .      well  well     said the smith again .     a wizard in bad ass  eh .         possibly  possibly     said billet .     of course  he   ll have to go to university first .  he may do very well  of course .      the smith considered the idea from all angles  and decided he liked it a lot .  a thought struck him .      hang on     he said .     i   m trying to remember what my father told me .  a wizard who knows he   s going to die can sort of pass on his sort of wizardness to a sort of successor  right .         i have never heard it put so succinctly  yes     said the wizard .      so you   re going to sort of die .         oh yes .     the cat purred as the fingers tickled it behind the ear .   the smith looked embarrassed .     when .      the wizard thought for a moment .     in about six minutes    time .         oh .         don   t worry     said the wizard .     i   m quite looking forward to it  to tell you the truth .  i   ve heard it   s quite painless .      the blacksmith considered this .     who told you .     he said at last .   the wizard pretended not to hear him .  he was watching the bridge  looking for telltale turbulence in the mist .      look     said the smith .     you   d better tell me how we go about bringing up a wizard  you see  because there isn   t a wizard in these parts and           it will all sort itself out     said billet pleasantly .     the magic has guided me to you and the magic will take care of everything .  it usually does .  did i hear a cry .      the blacksmith looked at the ceiling .  above the splash of the rain he could make out the sound of a pair of new lungs at full bore .   the wizard smiled .     have him brought down here     he said .   the cat sat up and looked interestedly at the forge   s wide doorway .  as the smith called excitedly up the stairs it jumped down and padded slowly across the floor  purring like a bandsaw .   a tall white haired woman appeared at the bottom of the stairs  clutching a bundle in a blanket .  the smith hurried her over to where the wizard sat .      but       she began .      this is very important     said the smith importantly .     what do we do now  sir .      the wizard held up his staff .  it was man high and nearly as thick as his wrist  and covered with carvings that seemed to change as the smith looked at them  exactly as if they didn   t want him to see what they were .      the child must hold it     said drum billet .  the smith nodded  and fumbled in the blanket until he located a tiny pink hand .  he guided it gently to the wood .  it gripped it tightly .      but       said the midwife .      it   s all right  granny  i know what i   m about .  she   s a witch  sir  don   t mind her .  right     said the smith .     now what .      the wizard was silent .      what do we do n       the smith began  and stopped .  he leaned down to look at the old wizard   s face .  billet was smiling  but it was anyone   s guess what the joke was .   the smith pushed the baby back into the arms of the frantic midwife .  then  as respectfully as possible  he unpried the thin  pale fingers from the staff .   it had a strange  greasy feel  like static electricity .  the wood itself was almost black  but the carvings were slightly lighter  and hurt the eyes if you tried to make out precisely what they were supposed to be .      are you pleased with yourself .     said the midwife .      eh .  oh .  yes .  as a matter of fact  yes .  why .      she twitched aside a fold of the blanket .  the smith looked down  and swallowed .      no     he whispered .     he said           and what would he know about it .     sneered granny .      but he said it would be a son .         doesn   t look like a son to me  laddie .      the smith flopped down on his stool  his head in his hands .      what have i done .     he moaned .      you   ve given the world its first female wizard     said the midwife .     whosa itsywitsy  den .         what .         i was talking to the baby .      the white cat purred and arched its back as if it was rubbing up against the legs of an old friend .  which was odd  because there was no one there .         i was foolish     said a voice in tones no mortal could hear .     i assumed the magic would know what it was doing .      perhaps it does .      if only i could do something        there is no going back .  there is no going back  said the deep  heavy voice like the closing of crypt doors .   the wisp of nothingness that was drum billet thought for a while .      but she   s going to have a lot of problems .      that   s what life is all about .  so i   m told .  i wouldn   t know  of course .      what about reincarnation .      death hesitated .   you wouldn   t like it  he said .  take it from me .      i   ve heard that some people do it all the time .      you   ve got to be trained to it .  you   ve got to start off small and work up .  you   ve no idea how horrible it is to be an ant .      it   s bad .      you wouldn   t believe it .  and with your karma an ant is too much to expect .   the baby had been taken back to its mother and the smith sat disconsolately watching the rain .   drum billet scratched the cat behind its ears and thought about his life .  it had been a long one  that was one of the advantages of being a wizard  and he   d done a lot of things he hadn   t always felt good about .  it was about time that     i haven   t got all day  you know  said death  reproachfully .   the wizard looked down at the cat and realized for the first time how odd it looked now .   the living often don   t appreciate how complicated the world looks when you are dead  because while death frees the mind from the straitjacket of three dimensions it also cuts it away from time  which is only another dimension .  so while the cat that rubbed up against his invisible legs was undoubtedly the same cat that he had seen a few minutes before  it was also quite clearly a tiny kitten and a fat  half blind old moggy and every stage in between .  all at once .  since it had started off small it looked like a white  cat shaped carrot  a description that will have to do until people invent proper four dimensional adjectives .   death   s skeletal hand tapped billet gently on the shoulder .   come away  my son .      there   s nothing i can do .      life is for the living .  anyway  you   ve given her your staff .      yes .  there is that .         the midwife   s name was granny weatherwax .  she was a witch .  that was quite acceptable in the ramtops  and no one had a bad word to say about witches .  at least  not if he wanted to wake up in the morning the same shape as he went to bed .   the smith was still staring gloomily at the rain when she came back down the stairs and clapped a warty hand on his shoulder .   he looked up at her .      what shall i do  granny .     he said  unable to keep the pleading out of his voice .      what have you done with the wizard .         i put him out in the fuel store .  was that right .         it   ll do for now     she said briskly .     and now you must burn the staff .      they both turned to stare at the heavy staff  which the smith had propped in the forge   s darkest corner .  it almost appeared to be looking back at them .      but it   s magical     he whispered .      well .         will it burn .         never knew wood that didn   t .         it doesn   t seem right .      granny weatherwax swung shut the big doors and turned to him angrily .      now you listen to me  gordo smith .     she said .     female wizards aren   t right either .  it   s the wrong kind of magic for women  is wizard magic  it   s all books and stars and jommetry .  she   d never grasp it .  whoever heard of a female wizard .         there   s witches     said the smith uncertainly .     and enchantresses too  i   ve heard .         witches is a different thing altogether     snapped granny weatherwax .     it   s magic out of the ground  not out of the sky  and men never could get the hang of it .  as for enchantresses     she added .     they   re no better than they should be .  you take it from me  just burn the staff  bury the body and don   t let on it ever happened .      smith nodded reluctantly  crossed over to the forge  and pumped the bellows until the sparks flew .  he went back for the staff .   it wouldn   t move .      it won   t move .      sweat stood out of his brow as he tugged at the wood .  it remained uncooperatively immobile .      here  let me try     said granny  and reached past him .  there was a snap and a smell of scorched tin .   smith ran across the forge  whimpering slightly  to where granny had landed upside down against the opposite wall .      are you all right .      she opened two eyes like angry diamonds and said     i see .  that   s the way of it  is it .         the way of what .     said smith  totally bewildered .      help me up  you fool .  and fetch me a chopper .      the tone of her voice suggested that it would be a very good idea not to disobey .  smith rummaged desperately among the junk at the back of the forge until he found an old double headed ax .      right .  now take off your apron .         why .  what do you intend to do .     said the smith  who was beginning to lose his grip on events .  granny gave an exasperated sigh .      it   s leather  you idiot .  i   m going to wrap it around the handle .  it   ll not catch me the same way twice .      smith struggled out of the heavy leather apron and handed it to her very gingerly .  she wrapped it around the ax and made one or two passes in the air .  then  a spiderlike figure in the glow of the nearly incandescent furnace  she stalked across the room and with a grunt of triumph and effort brought the heavy blade sweeping down right in the center of the staff .   there was a click .  there was a noise like a partridge .  there was a thud .   there was silence .   smith reached up very slowly  without moving his head  and touched the ax blade .  it wasn   t on the ax anymore .  it had buried itself in the door by his head  taking a tiny nick out of his ear .   granny stood looking slightly blurred from hitting an absolutely immovable object  and stared at the stub of wood in her hands .      rrrrightttt     she stuttered .     iiiinnn tthhatttt cccasseee           no     said smith firmly  rubbing his ear .     whatever it is you   re going to suggest  no .  leave it .  i   ll pile some stuff around it .  no one   ll notice .  leave it .  it   s just a stick .         just a stick .         have you got any better ideas .  ones that won   t take my head off .      she glared at the staff  which appeared not to notice .      not right now     she admitted .     but you just give me time           all right  all right .  anyway  i   ve got things to do  wizards to bury  you know how it is .      smith took a spade from beside the back door and hesitated .      granny .         what .         do you know how wizards like to be buried .         yes .         well  how .      granny weatherwax paused at the bottom of the stairs .      reluctantly .      later  night fell gently as the last of the world   s slow light flowed out of the valley  and a pale  rain washed moon shone down in a night studded with stars .  and in a shadowy orchard behind the forge there was the occasional clink of a spade or a muffled curse .   in the cradle upstairs the world   s first female wizard dreamed of nothing much .   the white cat lay half asleep on its private ledge near the furnace .  the only sound in the warm dark forge was the crackle of the coals as they settled down under the ash .   the staff stood in the corner  where it wanted to be  wrapped in shadows that were slightly blacker than shadows normally are .   time passed  which  basically  is its job .   there was a faint tinkle  and a swish of air .  after a while the cat sat up and watched with interest .      dawn came .  up here in the ramtops dawn was always impressive  especially when a storm had cleared the air .  the valley occupied by bad ass overlooked a panorama of lesser mountains and foothills  colored purple and orange in the early morning light that flowed gently over them  because light travels at a dilatory pace in the disc   s vast magical field  and far off the great plains were still a puddle of shadows .  even further off the sea gave an occasional distant sparkle .   in fact  from here you could see right to the edge of the world .   that wasn   t poetic imagery but plain fact  since the world was quite definitely flat and was  furthermore  known to be carried through space on the backs of four elephants that in turn stood on the shell of great a   tuin  the great sky turtle .   back down there in bad ass the village is waking up .  the smith has just gone into the forge and found it tidier than it has been for the last hundred years  with all the tools back in their right places  the floor swept and a new fire laid in the furnace .  he is sitting on the anvil  which has been moved right across the room  and is watching the staff and is trying to think .      nothing much happened for seven years  except that one of the apple trees in the smithy orchard grew perceptibly taller than the others and was frequently climbed by a small girl with brown hair  a gap in her front teeth  and the sort of features that promised to become  if not beautiful  then at least attractively interesting .   she was named eskarina  for no particular reason other than that her mother liked the sound of the word  and although granny weatherwax kept a careful watch on her she failed to spot any signs of magic whatsoever .  it was true that the girl spent more time climbing trees and running around shouting than little girls normally did  but a girl with four older brothers still at home can be excused a lot of things .  in fact  the witch began to relax and started to think the magic had not taken hold after all .   but magic has a habit of lying low  like a rake in the grass .      winter came round again  and it was a bad one .  the clouds hung around the ramtops like big fat sheep  filling the gulleys with snow and turning the forests into silent  gloomy caverns .  the high passes were closed and the caravans wouldn   t come again until spring .  bad ass became a little island of heat and light .   over breakfast esk   s mother said     i   m worried about granny weatherwax .  she hasn   t been around lately .      smith looked at her over his porridge spoon .      i   m not complaining     he said .     she           she   s got a long nose     said esk .   her parents glared at her .      there   s no call to make that kind of remark     said her mother sternly .      but father said she   s always poking her           eskarina .         but he said           i said           yes  but  he did say that she had        smith reached down and slapped her .  it wasn   t very hard  and he regretted it instantly .  the boys got the flat of his hand and occasionally the length of his belt whenever they deserved it .  the trouble with his daughter  though  was not ordinary naughtiness but the infuriating way she had of relentlessly pursuing the thread of an argument long after she should have put it down .  it always flustered him .   she burst into tears .  smith stood up  angry and embarrassed at himself  and stumped off to the forge .   there was a loud crack  and a thud .   they found him out cold on the floor .  afterward he always maintained that he   d hit his head on the doorway .  which was odd  because he wasn   t very tall and there had always been plenty of room before  but he was certain that whatever happened had nothing to do with the blur of movement from the forge   s darkest corner .   somehow the events set the seal on the day .  it became a broken crockery day  a day of people getting under each other   s feet and being peevish .  esk   s mother dropped a jug that had belonged to her grandmother and a whole box of apples in the loft turned out to be moldy .  in the forge the furnace went sullen and refused to draw .  jaims  the oldest son  slipped on the packed ice in the road and hurt his arm .  the white cat  or possibly one of its descendants  since the cats led a private and complicated life of their own in the hayloft next to the forge  went and climbed up the chimney in the scullery and refused to come down .  even the sky pressed in like an old mattress  and the air felt stuffy  despite the snow .   frayed nerves and boredom and bad temper made the air hum like thunderstorm weather .      right .  that   s it .  that   s just about enough .     shouted esk   s mother .     cern  you and gulta and esk can go and see how granny is and   where   s esk .      the two youngest boys looked up from where they were halfheartedly fighting under the table .      she went out to the orchard     said gulta .     again .         go and fetch her in  then  and be off .         but it   s cold .         it   s going to snow again .         it   s only a mile and the road is clear enough and who was so keen to be out in it when we had the first snowfall .  go on with you  and don   t come back till you   re in a better temper .      they found esk sitting in a fork of the big apple tree .  the boys didn   t like the tree much .  for one thing  it was so covered in mistletoe that it looked green even in midwinter  its fruit was small and went from stomach twisting sourness to wasp filled rottenness overnight  and although it looked easy enough to climb it had a habit of breaking twigs and dislodging feet at inconvenient moments .  cern once swore that a branch had twisted just to spill him off .  but it tolerated esk  who used to go and sit in it if she was annoyed or fed up or just wanted to be by herself  and the boys sensed that every brother   s right to gently torture his sister ended at the foot of its trunk .  so they threw a snowball at her .  it missed .      we   re going to see old weatherwax .         but you don   t have to come .         because you   ll just slow us down and probably cry anyway .      esk looked down at them solemnly .  she didn   t cry a lot  it never seemed to achieve much .      if you don   t want me to come then i   ll come     she said .  this sort of thing passes for logic among siblings .      oh  we want you to come     said gulta quickly .      very pleased to hear it     said esk  dropping on to the packed snow .   they had a basket containing smoked sausages  preserved eggs and   because their mother was prudent as well as generous   a large jar of peach preserve that no one in the family liked very much .  she still made it every year when the little wild peaches were ripe  anyway .   the people of bad ass had learned to live with the long winter snows and the roads out of the village were lined with boards to reduce drifting and  more important  stop travelers from straying .  if they lived locally it wouldn   t matter too much if they did  because an unsung genius on the village council several generations previously had come up with the idea of carving markers in every tenth tree in the forest around the village  out to a distance of nearly two miles .  it had taken ages  and re cutting markers was always a job for any man with spare time  but in winters where a blizzard could lose a man within yards of his home many a life had been saved by the pattern of notches found by probing fingers under the clinging snow .   it was snowing again when they left the road and started up the track where  in summer  the witch   s house nestled in a riot of raspberry thickets and weird witch growth .      no footprints     said cern .      except for foxes     said gulta .     they say she can turn herself into a fox .  or anything .  a bird  even .  anything .  that   s how she always knows what   s going on .      they looked around cautiously .  a scruffy crow was indeed watching them from a distant tree stump .      they say there   s a whole family over crack peak way that can turn themselves into wolves     said gulta  who wasn   t one to leave a promising subject     because one night someone shot a wolf and next day their auntie was limping with an arrow wound in her leg  and           i don   t think people can turn themselves into animals     said esk  slowly .      oh yes  miss clever .         granny is quite big .  if she turned herself into a fox what would happen to all the bits that wouldn   t fit .         she   d just magic them away     said cern .      i don   t think magic works like that     said esk .     you can   t just make things happen  there   s a sort of   like a seesaw thing  if you push one end down  the other end goes up       her voice trailed off .   they gave her a look .      i can   t see granny on a seesaw     said gulta .  cern giggled .      no  i mean every time something happens  something else has to happen too   i think     said esk uncertainly  picking her way around a deeper than usual snowdrift .     only in the   opposite direction .         that   s silly     said gulta     because  look  you remember when that fair came last summer and there was a wizard with it and he made all those birds and things appear out of nothing .  i mean it just happened  he just said these words and waved his hands  and it just happened .  there weren   t any seesaws .         there was a swing     said cern .     and a thing where you had to throw things at things to win things .         and you didn   t hit anything  gul .         nor did you  you said the things were stuck to the things so you couldn   t knock them off  you said        their conversation wandered away like a couple of puppies .  esk listened with half an ear .  i know what i mean  she told herself .  magic   s easy  you just find the place where everything is balanced and push .  anyone could do it .  there   s nothing magical about it .  all the funny words and waving the hands is just   it   s only for     she stopped  surprised at herself .  she knew what she meant .  the idea was right up there in the front of her mind .  but she didn   t know how to say it in words  even to herself .   it was a horrible feeling to find things in your head and not know how they fitted .  it        come on  we   ll be all day .      she shook her head and hurried after her brothers .   the witch   s cottage consisted of so many extensions and lean tos that it was difficult to see what the original building had looked like  or even if there had ever been one .  in the summer it was surrounded by dense beds of what granny loosely called    the herbs      strange plants  hairy or squat or twining  with curious flowers or vivid fruits or unpleasantly bulging pods .  only granny knew what they were all for  and any wood pigeon hungry enough to attack them generally emerged giggling to itself and bumping into things  or  sometimes  never emerged at all  .   now everything was deep under the snow .  a forlorn windsock flapped against its pole .  granny didn   t hold with flying but some of her friends still used broomsticks .      it looks deserted     said cern .      no smoke     said gulta .   the windows look like eyes  thought esk  but kept it to herself .      it   s only granny   s house     she said .     there   s nothing wrong .      the cottage radiated emptiness .  they could feel it .  the windows did look like eyes  black and menacing against the snow .  and no one in the ramtops let their fire go out in the winter  as a matter of pride .   esk wanted to say    let   s go home     but she knew that if she did the boys would run for it .  instead she said     mother says there   s a key on a nail in the privy     and that was nearly as bad .  even an ordinary unknown privy held minor terrors like wasps    nests  large spiders  mysterious rustling things in the roof and  one very bad winter  a small hibernating bear that caused acute constipation in the family until it was persuaded to bed down in the haybarn .  a witch   s privy could contain anything .      i   ll go and look  shall i .     she added .      if you like     said gulta airily  almost successfully concealing his relief .   in fact  when she managed to get the door open against the piled snow  it was neat and clean and contained nothing more sinister than an old almanack  or more precisely about half an old almanack  carefully hung on a nail .  granny had a philosophical objection to reading  but she   d be the last to say that books  especially books with nice thin pages  didn   t have their uses .   the key shared a ledge by the door with a chrysalis and the stump of a candle .  esk took it gingerly  trying not to disturb the chrysalis  and hurried back to the boys .   it was no use trying the front door .  front doors in bad ass were used only by brides and corpses  and granny had always avoided becoming either .  around the back the snow was piled in front of the door and no one had broken the ice on the water butt .   the light was starting to pour out of the sky by the time they dug through to the door and managed to persuade the key to turn .   inside  the big kitchen was dark and chilly and smelled only of snow .  it was always dark  but they were used to seeing a big fire in the wide chimney and smelling the thick fumes of whatever it was she was boiling up this time  which sometimes gave you a headache or made you see things .   they wandered around uncertainly  calling  until esk decided they couldn   t put off going upstairs any longer .  the clonk of the thumb latch on the door to the cramped staircase sounded a lot louder than it ought to .   granny was on the bed  with her arms tightly folded across her chest .  the tiny window had blown open .  fine snow had blown in across the floor and over the bed .   esk stared at the patchwork quilt under the old woman  because there were times when a little detail could expand and fill the whole world .  she barely heard cern start to cry  she remembered her father  strangely enough  making the quilt two winters before when the snow was almost as bad and there wasn   t much to do in the forge  and how he   d used all kinds of rags that had found their way to bad ass from every part of the world  like silk  dilemma leather  water cotton and tharga wool and  of course  since he wasn   t much good at sewing either  the result was a rather strange lumpy thing more like a flat tortoise than a quilt  and her mother had generously decided to give it to granny last hogswatchnight  and        is she dead .     asked gulta  as if esk was an expert in these things .   esk stared up at granny weatherwax .  the old woman   s face looked thin and gray .  was that how dead people looked .  shouldn   t her chest be going up and down .   gulta pulled himself together .      we ought to go and get someone and we ought to go now because it will get dark in a minute     he said flatly .     but cern will stay here .      his brother looked at him in horror .      what for .     he said .      someone has got to stay with dead people     said gulta .     remember when old uncle derghart died and father had to go and sit up with all the candles and things all night .  otherwise something nasty comes and takes your soul off to   to somewhere     he ended lamely .     and then people come back and haunt you .      cern opened his mouth to start to cry again .  esk said hurriedly     i   ll stay .  i don   t mind .  it   s only granny .      gulta looked at her in relief .      light some candles or something     he said .     i think that   s what you   re supposed to do .  and then        there was a scratching from the windowsill .  a crow had landed  and stood there blinking suspiciously at them .  gulta shouted and threw his hat at it .  it flew off with a reproachful caw and he shut the window .      i   ve seen it around here before     he said .     i think granny feeds it .  fed it     he corrected himself .     anyway  we   ll be back with people  we   ll be hardly any time .  come on  ce .      they clattered down the dark stairs .  esk saw them out of the house and bolted the door behind them .   the sun was a red ball above the mountains  and there were already a few early stars out .   she wandered around the dark kitchen until she found a scrap of dip candle and a tinderbox .  after a great deal of effort she managed to light the candle and stood it on the table  although it didn   t really light the room  it simply peopled the darkness with shadows .  then she found granny   s rocking chair by the cold fireplace  and settled down to wait .   time passed .  nothing happened .   then there was a tapping at the window .  esk took up the candle stub and peered through the thick round panes .   a beady yellow eye blinked back at her .   the candle guttered  and went out .   she stood stock still  hardly breathing .  the tapping started again  and then stopped .  there was a short silence  and then the door latch rattled .   something nasty comes  the boys had said .   she felt her way back across the room until she nearly tripped over the rocking chair  and dragged it back and wedged it as best she could in front of the door .  the latch gave a final clonk and went silent .   esk waited  listening until the silence roared in her ears .  then something started to bang against the little window in the scullery  softly but insistently .  after a while it stopped .  a moment later it started again in the bedroom above her   a faint scrabbling noise  a claw kind of noise .   esk felt that bravery was called for  but on a night like this bravery lasted only as long as a candle stayed alight .  she felt her way back across the dark kitchen  eyes tightly shut  until she reached the door .   there was a thump from the fireplace as a big lump of soot fell down  and when she heard the desperate scratchings coming from the chimney she slipped the bolts  threw open the door and darted out into the night .   the cold struck like a knife .  frost had put a crust on the snow .  she didn   t care where she was going  but quiet terror gave her a burning determination to get there as fast as she could .      inside the cottage the crow landed heavily in the fireplace  surrounded by soot and muttering irritably to itself .  it hopped into the shadows  and a moment later there was the bang of the latch of the stairway door and the sound of fluttering on the stairs .      esk reached up as high as she could and felt around the tree for the marker .  this time she was lucky  but the pattern of dots and grooves told her she was over a mile from the village and had been running in the wrong direction .   there was a cheese rind moon and a sprinkling of stars  small and bright and pitiless .  the forest around her was a pattern of black shadows and pale snow and  she was aware  not all the shadows were standing still .   everyone knew there were wolves in the mountains  because on some nights their howls echoed down from the high tops  but they seldom came near the village   the modern wolves were the offspring of ancestors that had survived because they had learned that human meat had sharp edges .   but the weather was hard  and this pack was hungry enough to forget all about natural selection .   esk remembered what all the children were told .  climb a tree .  light a fire .  when all else fails  find a stick and at least hurt them .  never try to outrun them .   the tree behind her was a beech  smooth and unclimbable .   esk watched a long shadow detach itself from a pool of darkness in front of her  and move a little closer .  she knelt down  tired  frightened  unable to think  and scrabbled under the burning cold snow for a stick .      granny weatherwax opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling  which was cracked and bulged like a tent .   she concentrated on remembering that she had arms  not wings  and didn   t need to hop .  it was always wise to lie down for a bit after a borrow  to let one   s mind get used to one   s body  but she knew she didn   t have the time .      drat the child     she muttered  and tried to fly on to the bedrail .  the crow  who had been through all this dozens of times before and who considered  insofar as birds can consider anything  which is a very short distance indeed  that a steady diet of bacon rinds and choice kitchen scraps and a warm roost for the night was well worth the occasional inconvenience of letting granny share its head  watched her with mild interest .   granny found her boots and thumped down the stairs  sternly resisting the urge to glide .  the door was wide open and there was already a drift of fine snow on the floor .      oh  bugger     she said .  she wondered if it was worth trying to find esk   s mind  but human minds were never so sharp and clear as animal minds and anyway the overmind of the forest itself made impromptu searching as hard as listening for a waterfall in a thunderstorm .  but even without looking she could feel the packmind of the wolves  a sharp  rank feeling that filled the mouth with the taste of blood .   she could just make out the small footprints in the crust  half filled with fresh snow .  cursing and muttering  granny weatherwax pulled her shawl around her and set out .      the white cat awoke from its private ledge in the forge when it heard the sounds coming from the darkest corner .  smith had carefully shut the big doors behind him when he went off with the nearly hysterical boys  and the cat watched with interest as a thin shadow prodded at the lock and tested the hinges .   the doors were oak  hardened by heat and time  but that didn   t prevent them being blown right across the street .   smith heard a sound in the sky as he hurried along the track .  so did granny .  it was a determined whirring sound  like the flight of geese  and the snowclouds boiled and twisted as it passed .   the wolves heard it  too  as it spun low over the treetops and hurtled down into the clearing .  but they heard it far too late .   granny weatherwax didn   t have to follow the footprints now .  she aimed herself for the distant flashes of weird light  the strange swishing and thumping  and the howls of pain and terror .  a couple of wolves bolted past her with their ears flattened in grim determination to have it away on their paws no matter what stood in their way .   there was the crackle of breaking branches .  something big and heavy landed in a fir tree by granny and crashed  whimpering  into the snow .  another wolf passed her in a flat trajectory at about head height and bounced off a tree trunk .   there was silence .   granny pushed her way between the snow covered branches .   she could see that the snow was flattened in a white circle .  a few wolves lay at its edges  either dead or wisely deciding to make no move .   the staff stood upright in the snow and granny got the feeling it was turning to face her as she walked carefully past it .   there was also a small heap in the center of the circle  curled tightly up inside itself .  granny knelt down with some effort and reached out gently .   the staff moved .  it was little more than a tremble  but her hand stopped just before it touched esk   s shoulder .  granny glared up at the wooden carvings  and dared it to move again .   the air thickened .  then the staff seemed to back away while not moving  while at the same time something quite indefinable made it absolutely clear to the old witch that as far as the staff was concerned this wasn   t a defeat  it was merely a tactical consideration  and it wouldn   t like her to think she had won in any way  because she hadn   t .   esk gave a shudder .  granny patted her vaguely .      it   s me  little one .  it   s only old granny .      the hump didn   t uncurl .   granny bit her lip .  she was never quite certain about children  thinking of them   when she thought about them at all   as coming somewhere between animals and people .  she understood babies .  you put milk in one end and kept the other end as clean as possible .  adults were even easier  because they did the feeding and cleaning themselves .  but in between was a world of experience that she had never really inquired about .  as far as she was aware  you just tried to stop them catching anything fatal and hoped that it would all turn out all right .   granny  in fact  was at a loss  but she knew she had to do something .      didda nasty wolfie fwiten us  den .     she hazarded .   for quite the wrong reasons  this seemed to work .  from the depths of the ball a muffled voice said     i am eight  you know .         people who are eight don   t curl up in the middle of the snow     said granny  feeling her way through the intricacies of adult child conversation .   the ball didn   t answer .      i   ve probably got some milk and biscuits at home     granny ventured .   there was no perceptible effect .      eskarina smith  if you don   t behave this minute i will give you such a smack .      esk poked her head out cautiously .      there   s no need to be like that     she said .   when smith reached the cottage granny had just arrived  leading esk by the hand .  the boys peered around from behind him .      um     said smith  not quite aware of how to begin a conversation with someone who was supposed to be dead .     they  um  told me you were   ill .     he turned and glared at his sons .      i was just having a rest and i must have dozed off .  i sleeps very sound .         yes     said smith  uncertainly .     well .  all   s well  then .  what   s up with esk .         she took a bit of a fright     said granny  squeezing the girl   s hand .     shadows and whatnot .  she needs a good warm .  i was going to put her in my bed  she   s a bit mazed  if that   s all right with you .      smith wasn   t absolutely sure that it was all right with him .  but he was quite sure that his wife  like every other woman in the village  held granny weatherwax in solemn regard  even in awe  and that if he started to object he would rapidly get out of his depth .      fine  fine     he said     if it   s no trouble .  i   ll send along for her in the morning  shall i .         that   s right     said granny .     i   d invite you in  but there   s me without a fire           no  no  that   s all right     said smith hurriedly .     i   ve got my supper waiting .  drying up     he added  looking down at gulta  who opened his mouth to say something and wisely thought better of it .   when they had gone  with the sound of the two boys    protests ringing out among the trees  granny opened the door  pushed esk inside  and bolted it behind them .  she took a couple of candles from her store above the dresser and lit them .  then she pulled some old but serviceable wool blankets  still smelling of anti moth herbs  from an old chest  wrapped esk in them and sat her in the rocking chair .   she got down on her knees  to an accompaniment of clicks and grunts  and started to lay the fire .  it was a complicated business involving dry fungus punk  wood shavings  bits of split twig and much puffing and swearing .   esk said     you don   t have to do it like that  granny .      granny stiffened  and looked at the fireback .  it was a rather nice one smith had cast for her  years ago  with an owl and bat motif .  currently  though  she wasn   t interested in the design .      oh yes .     she said  her voice dead level .     you know of a better way  do you .         you could magic it alight .      granny paid great attention to arranging bits of twig on the reluctant flames .      how would i do that  pray .     she said  apparently addressing her remarks to the fireback .      er     said esk     i   i can   t remember .  but you must know anyway  don   t you .  everyone knows you can do magic .         there   s magic     said granny     and then again  there   s magic .  the important thing  my girl  is to know what magic is for and what it isn   t for .  and you can take it from me  it was never intended for lighting fires  you can be absolutely certain of that .  if the creator had meant us to use magic for lighting fires  then he wouldn   t have given us   er  matches .         but could you light a fire with magic .     said esk  as granny slung an ancient black kettle on its hook .     i mean  if you wanted to .  if it was allowed .         maybe     said granny  who couldn   t  fire had no mind  it wasn   t alive  and they were two of the three reasons .      you could light it much better .         if a thing   s worth doing  it   s worth doing badly     said granny  fleeing into aphorisms  the last refuge of an adult under siege .      yes  but           but me no buts .      granny rummaged in a dark wooden box on the dresser .  she prided herself on her unrivaled knowledge of the properties of ramtops herbage   none knew better than she the many uses of earwort  maiden   s wish and love lies oozing   but there were times when she had to resort to her small stock of jealously traded and carefully hoarded medicines from forn parts  which as far as she was concerned was anywhere farther than a day   s journey  to achieve the desired effect .   she shredded some dry red leaves into a mug  topped it up with honey and hot water from the kettle  and pushed it into esk   s hands .  then she put a large round stone under the grate   later on  wrapped in a scrap of blanket  it would make a bedwarmer   and  with a stern injunction to the girl not to stir from the chair  went out into the scullery .   esk drummed her heels on the chair legs and sipped the drink .  it had a strange  peppery taste .  she wondered what it was .  she   d tasted granny   s brews before  of course  with a greater or lesser amount of honey in them depending on whether she thought you were making too much of a fuss  and esk knew that she was famous throughout the mountains for special potions for illnesses that her mother   and some young women too  once in a while   just hinted at with raised eyebrows and lowered voices     when granny came back she was asleep .  she didn   t remember being put to bed  or granny bolting the windows .   granny weatherwax went back downstairs and pulled her rocking chair closer to the fire .   there was something there  she told herself  lurking away in the child   s mind .  she didn   t like to think about what it was  but she remembered what had happened to the wolves .  and all that about lighting fires with magic .  wizards did that  it was one of the first things they learned .   granny sighed .  there was only one way to be sure  and she was getting rather old for this sort of thing .   she picked up the candle and went out through the scullery into the lean to that housed her goats .  they watched her without fear  each sitting in its pen like a furry blob  three mouths working rhythmically on the day   s hay .  the air smelled warm and slightly flatulent .   up in the rafters was a small owl  one of a number of creatures who found that living with granny was worth the occasional inconvenience .  it came to her hand at a word  and she stroked its bullet head thoughtfully as she looked for somewhere comfortable to lie .  a pile of hay it would have to be .   she blew out the candle and lay back  with the owl perched on her finger .   the goats chewed  burped and swallowed their way through their cozy night .  they made the only sound in the building .   granny   s body stilled .  the owl felt her enter its mind  and graciously made room .  granny knew she would regret this  borrowing twice in one day would leave her good for nothing in the morning  and with a terrible desire to eat mice .  of course  when she was younger she thought nothing of it  running with the stags  hunting with the foxes  learning the strange dark ways of the moles  hardly spending a night in her own body .  but it was getting harder now  especially coming back .  maybe the time would come when she couldn   t get back  maybe the body back home would be so much dead flesh  and maybe that wouldn   t be such a bad way of it  at that .   this was the sort of thing wizards could never know .  if it occurred to them to enter a creature   s mind they   d do it like a thief  not out of wickedness but because it simply wouldn   t occur to them to do it any other way  the daft buggers .  and what good would it do to take over an owl   s body .  you couldn   t fly  you needed to spend a lifetime learning .  but the gentle way was to ride in its mind  steering it as gently as a breeze stirs a leaf .   the owl stirred  fluttered up on to the little windowsill  and glided silently into the night .   the clouds had cleared and the thin moon made the mountains gleam .  granny peered out through owl eyes as she sped silently between the ranks of trees .  this was the only way to travel  once a body had the way of it .  she liked borrowing birds best of all  using them to explore the high  hidden valleys where no one went  the secret lakes between black cliffs  the tiny walled fields on the scraps of flat ground  tucked on the sheer rock faces  that were the property of hidden and secretive beings .  once she had ridden with the geese that passed over the mountains every spring and autumn  and had got the shock of her life when she nearly went beyond range of returning .   the owl broke out of the forest and skimmed across the rooftops of the village  alighting in a shower of snow on the biggest apple tree in smith   s orchard .  it was heavy with mistletoe .   she knew she was right as soon as her claws touched the bark .  the tree resented her  she could feel it trying to push her away .   i   m not going  she thought .   in the silence of the night the tree said  bully me  then  just because i   m a tree .  typical woman .   at least you   re useful now  thought granny .  better a tree than a wizard  eh .   it   s not such a bad life  thought the tree .  sun .  fresh air .  time to think .  bees  too  in the spring .   there was something lascivious about the way the tree said    bees    that quite put granny  who had several hives  off the idea of honey .  it was like being reminded that eggs were unborn chickens .   i   ve come about the girl  esk  she hissed .   a promising child  thought the tree  i   m watching her with interest .  she likes apples  too .   you beast  said granny  shocked .   what did i say .  pardon me for not breathing  i   m sure .   granny sidled closer to the trunk .   you must let her go  she thought .  the magic is starting to come through .   already .  i   m impressed  said the tree .   it   s the wrong sort of magic .  screeched granny .  it   s wizard magic  not women   s magic .  she doesn   t know what it is yet  but it killed a dozen wolves tonight .   great .  said the tree .  granny hooted with rage .   great .  supposing she had been arguing with her brothers  and lost her temper  eh .   the tree shrugged .  snowflakes cascaded from its branches .   then you must train her  it said .   train .  what do i know from training wizards .   then send her to the university .   she   s female .  hooted granny  bouncing up and down on her branch .   well .  who says women can   t be wizards .   granny hesitated .  the tree might as well have asked why fish couldn   t be birds .  she drew a deep breath  and started to speak .  and stopped .  she knew a cutting  incisive  withering and above all a self evident answer existed .  it was just that  to her extreme annoyance  she couldn   t quite bring it to mind .   women have never been wizards .  it   s against nature .  you might as well say that witches can be men .   if you define a witch as one who worships the pancreative urge  that is  venerates the basic   the tree began  and continued for several minutes .  granny weatherwax listened in impatient annoyance to phrases like mother goddesses and primitive moon worship and told herself that she was well aware of what being a witch was all about  it was about herbs and curses and flying around of nights and generally keeping on the right side of tradition  and it certainly didn   t involve mixing with goddesses  mothers or otherwise  who apparently got up to some very questionable tricks .  and when the tree started talking about dancing naked she tried not to listen  because although she was aware that somewhere under her complicated strata of vests and petticoats there was some skin  that didn   t mean to say she approved of it .   the tree finished its monologue .   granny waited until she was quite sure that it wasn   t going to add anything  and said  that   s witchcraft  is it .   its theoretical basis  yes .   you wizards certainly get some funny ideas .   the tree said  not a wizard any more  just a tree .   granny ruffled her feathers .   well  just you listen to me  mr .  so called theoretical basis tree  if women were meant to be wizards they   d be able to grow long white beards and she is not going to be a wizard  is that quite clear  wizardry is not the way to use magic  do you hear  it   s nothing but lights and fire and meddling with power and she   ll be having no part of it and good night to you .   the owl swooped away from the branch .  it was only because it would interfere with the flying that granny wasn   t shaking with rage .  wizards .  they talked too much and pinned spells down in books like butterflies but  worst of all  they thought theirs was the only magic worth practicing .   granny was absolutely certain of one thing .  women had never been wizards  and they weren   t about to start now .      she arrived back at the cottage in the pale shank of the night .  her body  at least  was rested after its slumber in the hay  and granny had hoped to spend a few hours in the rocking chair  putting her thoughts in order .  this was the time  when night wasn   t quite over but day hadn   t quite begun  when thoughts stood out bright and clear and without disguise .  she     the staff was leaning against the wall  by the dresser .   granny stood quite still .      i see     she said at last .     so that   s the way of it  is it .  in my own house  too .      moving very slowly  she walked over to the inglenook  threw a couple of split logs on to the embers of the fire  and pumped the bellows until the flames roared up the chimney .   when she was satisfied she turned  muttered a few precautionary protective spells under her breath  and grabbed the staff .  it didn   t resist  she nearly fell over .  but now she had it in her hands  and felt the tingle of it  the distinctive thunderstorm crackle of the magic in it  and she laughed .   it was as simple as this  then .  there was no fight in it now .   calling down a curse upon wizards and all their works she raised the staff above her head and brought it down with a clang across the firedogs  over the hottest part of the fire .   esk screamed .  the sound bounced down through the bedroom floorboards and scythed through the dark cottage .   granny was old and tired and not entirely clear about things after a long day  but to survive as a witch requires an ability to jump to very large conclusions and as she stared at the staff in the flames and heard the scream her hands were already reaching for the big black kettle .  she upended it over the fire  dragged the staff out of the cloud of steam  and ran upstairs  dreading what she might see .   esk was sitting up in the narrow bed  unsinged but shrieking .  granny took the child in her arms and tried to comfort her  she wasn   t sure how one went about it  but a distracted patting on the back and vague reassuring noises seemed to work  and the screams became wails and  eventually  sobs .  here and there granny could pick out words like    fire    and    hot     and her mouth set in a thin  bitter line .   finally she settled the child down  tucked her in  and crept quietly down stairs .   the staff was back against the wall .  she was not surprised to see that the fire hadn   t marked it at all .   granny turned her rocking chair to face it  and sat down with her chin in her hand and an expression of grim determination .   presently the chair began to rock  of its own accord .  it was the only sound in a silence that thickened and spread and filled the room like a terrible dark fog .      next morning  before esk got up  granny hid the staff in the thatch  well out of harm   s way .   esk ate her breakfast and drank a pint of goat   s milk without the least sign of the events of the last twenty four hours .  it was the first time she had been inside granny   s cottage for more than a brief visit  and while the old woman washed the dishes and milked the goats she made the most of her implied license to explore .   she found that life in the cottage wasn   t entirely straightforward .  there was the matter of the goats    names  for example .      but they   ve got to have names .     she said .     everything   s got a name .      granny looked at her around the pear shaped flanks of the head nanny  while the milk squirted into the low pail .      i daresay they   ve got names in goat     she said vaguely .     what do they want names in human for .         well     said esk  and stopped .  she thought for a bit .     how do you make them do what you want  then .         they just do  and when they want me they holler .      esk gravely gave the head goat a wisp of hay .  granny watched her thoughtfully .  goats did have names for themselves  she well knew  there was    goat who is my kid        goat who is my mother        goat who is herd leader     and half a dozen other names not least of which was    goat who is this goat .     they had a complicated herd system and four stomachs and a digestive system that sounded very busy on still nights  and granny had always felt that calling all this names like buttercup was an insult to a noble animal .      esk .     she said  making up her mind .      yes .         what would you like to be when you grow up .      esk looked blank .     don   t know .         well     said granny  her hands still milking     what do you think you will do when you are grown up .         don   t know .  get married  i suppose .         do you want to .      esk   s lips started to shape themselves around the d  but she caught granny   s eye and stopped  and thought .      all the grown ups i know are married     she said at last  and thought some more .     except you     she added  cautiously .      that   s true     said granny .      didn   t you want to get married .      it was granny   s turn to think .      never got around to it     she said at last .     too many other things to do  you see .         father says you   re a witch     said esk  chancing her arm .      i am that .      esk nodded .  in the ramtops witches were accorded a status similar to that which other cultures gave to nuns  or tax collectors  or cesspit cleaners .  that is to say  they were respected  sometimes admired  generally applauded for doing a job which logically had to be done  but people never felt quite comfortable in the same room with them .   granny said     would you like to learn the witching .         magic  you mean .     asked esk  her eyes lighting up .      yes  magic .  but not firework magic .  real magic .         can you fly .         there   s better things than flying .         and i can learn them .         if your parents say yes .      esk sighed .     my father won   t .         then i shall have a word with him     said granny .         now you just listen to me  gordo smith .      smith backed away across his forge  hands half raised to ward off the old woman   s fury .  she advanced on him  one finger stabbing the air righteously .      i brought you into the world  you stupid man  and you   ve got no more sense in you now than you had then           but       smith tried  dodging around the anvil .      the magic   s found her .  wizard magic .  wrong magic  do you understand .  it was never intended for her .         yes  but           have you any idea of what it can do .      smith sagged .     no .      granny paused  and deflated a little .      no     she repeated  more softly .     no  you wouldn   t .      she sat down on the anvil and tried to think calm thoughts .      look .  magic has a sort of   life of its own .  that doesn   t matter  because   anyway  you see  wizard magic       she looked up at his big  blank expression and tried again .     well  you know cider .      smith nodded .  he felt he was on firmer ground here  but he wasn   t certain of where it was going to lead .      and then there   s the licker .  applejack     said the witch .  the smith nodded .  everyone in bad ass made applejack in the winter  by leaving cider tubs outside overnight and taking out the ice until a tiny core of alcohol was left .      well  you can drink lots of cider and you just feel better and that   s it  isn   t it .      the smith nodded again .      but applejack  you drink that in little mugs and you don   t drink a lot and you don   t drink it often  because it goes right to your head .      the smith nodded again and  aware that he wasn   t making a major contribution to the dialogue  added     that   s right .         that   s the difference     said granny .      the difference from what .      granny sighed .     the difference between witch magic and wizard magic     she said .     and it   s found her  and if she doesn   t control it  then there are those who will control her .  magic can be a sort of door  and there are unpleasant things on the other side .  do you understand .      the smith nodded .  he didn   t really understand  but he correctly surmised that if he revealed this fact granny would start going into horrible details .      she   s strong in her mind and it might take a while     said granny .     but sooner or later they   ll challenge her .      smith picked up a hammer from his bench  looked at it as though he had never seen it before  and put it down again .      but     he said     if it   s wizard magic she   s got  learning witchery won   t be any good  will it .  you said they   re different .         they   re both magic .  if you can   t learn to ride an elephant  you can at least learn to ride a horse .         what   s an elephant .         a kind of badger     said granny .  she hadn   t maintained forest credibility for forty years by ever admitting ignorance .   the blacksmith sighed .  he knew he was beaten .  his wife had made it clear that she favored the idea and  now that he came to think about it  there were some advantages .  after all  granny wouldn   t last forever  and being father to the area   s only witch might not be too bad  at that .      all right     he said .   and so  as the winter turned and started the long  reluctant climb toward spring  esk spent days at a time with granny weatherwax  learning witchcraft .   it seemed to consist mainly of things to remember .   the lessons were quite practical .  there was cleaning the kitchen table and basic herbalism .  there was mucking out the goats and the uses of fungi .  there was doing the washing and the summoning of the small gods .  and there was always tending the big copper still in the scullery and the theory and practice of distillation .  by the time the warm rim winds were blowing  and the snow remained only as little streaks of slush on the hub side of trees  esk knew how to prepare a range of ointments  several medicinal brandies  a score of special infusions  and a number of mysterious potions that granny said she might learn the use of in good time .   what she hadn   t done was any magic at all .      all in good time     repeated granny vaguely .      but i   m supposed to be a witch .         you   re not a witch yet .  name me three herbs good for the bowels .      esk put her hands behind her back  closed her eyes  and said     the flowering tops of greater peahane  the root pith of old man   s trousers  the stems of the bloodwater lily  the seedcases of           all right .  where may water gherkins be found .         peat bogs and stagnant pools  from the months of           good .  you   re learning .         but it   s not magic .      granny sat down at the kitchen table .      most magic isn   t     she said .     it   s just knowing the right herbs  and learning to watch the weather  and finding out the ways of animals .  and the ways of people  too .         that   s all it is .     said esk  horrified .      all .  it   s a pretty big all     said granny     but no  it isn   t all .  there   s other stuff .         can   t you teach me .         all in good time .  there   s no call to go showing yourself yet .         showing myself .  who to .      granny   s eyes darted toward the shadows in the corners of the room .      never you mind .      then even the last lingering tails of snow had gone and the spring gales roared around the mountains .  the air in the forest began to smell of leaf mold and turpentine .  a few early flowers braved the night frosts  and the bees started to fly .      now bees     said granny weatherwax     is real magic .      she carefully lifted the lid of the first hive .      your bees     she went on     is your mead  your wax  your bee gum  your honey .  a wonderful thing is your bee .  ruled by a queen  too     she added  with a touch of approval .      don   t they sting you .     said esk  standing back a little .  bees boiled out of the comb and overflowed the rough wooden sides of the box .      hardly ever     said granny .     you wanted magic .  watch .      she put a hand into the struggling mass of insects and made a shrill  faint piping noise at the back of her throat .  there was a movement in the mass  and a large bee  longer and fatter than the others  crawled on to her hand .  a few workers followed it  stroking it and generally ministering to it .      how did you do that .     said esk .      ah     said granny     wouldn   t you like to know .         yes .  i would .  that   s why i asked  granny     said esk  severely .      do you think i used magic .      esk looked down at the queen bee .  she looked up at the witch .      no     she said     i think you just know a lot about bees .      granny grinned .      exactly correct .  that   s one form of magic  of course .         what  just knowing things .         knowing things that other people don   t know     said granny .  she carefully dropped the queen back among her subjects and closed the lid of the hive .      and i think it   s time you learned a few secrets     she added .   at last  thought esk .      but first  we must pay our respects to the hive     said granny .  she managed to sound the capital h .   without thinking  esk bobbed a curtsey .   granny   s hand clipped the back of her head .      bow  i told you     she said  without rancor .     witches bow .     she demonstrated .      but why .     complained esk .      because witches have got to be different  and that   s part of the secret     said granny .   they sat on a bleached bench in front of the rimward wall of the cottage .  in front of them the herbs were already a foot high  a sinister collection of pale green leaves .      right     said granny  settling herself down .     you know the hat on the hook by the door .  go and fetch it .      esk obediently went inside and unhooked granny   s hat .  it was tall  pointed and  of course  black .   granny turned it over in her hands and regarded it carefully .      inside this hat     she said solemnly     is one of the secrets of witchcraft .  if you cannot tell me what it is  then i might as well teach you no more  because once you learn the secret of the hat there is no going back .  tell me what you know about the hat .         can i hold it .         be my guest .      esk peered inside the hat .  there was some wire stiffening to give it a shape  and a couple of hatpins .  that was all .   there was nothing particularly strange about it  except that no one in the village had one like it .  but that didn   t make it magical .  esk bit her lip  she had a vision of herself being sent home in disgrace .   it didn   t feel strange  and there were no hidden pockets .  it was just a typical witch   s hat .  granny always wore it when she went into the village  but in the forest she just wore a leather hood .   she tried to recall the bits of lessons that granny grudgingly doled out .  it isn   t what you know  it   s what other people don   t know .  magic can be something right in the wrong place  or something wrong in the right place .  it can be     granny always wore it to the village .  and the big black cloak  which certainly wasn   t magical  because for most of the winter it had been a goat blanket and granny washed it in the spring .   esk began to feel the shape of the answer and she didn   t like it much .  it was like a lot of granny   s answers .  just a word trick .  she just said things you knew all the time  but in a different way so they sounded important .      i think i know     she said at last .      out with it  then .         it   s in sort of two parts .         well .         it   s a witch   s hat because you wear it .  but you   re a witch because you wear the hat .  um .         so       prompted granny .      so people see you coming in the hat and the cloak and they know you   re a witch and that   s why your magic works .     said esk .      that   s right     said granny .     it   s called headology .     she tapped her silver hair  which was drawn into a tight bun that could crack rocks .      but it   s not real .     esk protested .     that   s not magic  it   s   it   s           listen     said granny     if you give someone a bottle of red jollop for their wind it may work  right  but if you want it to work for sure then you let their mind make it work for them .  tell    em it   s moonbeams bottled in fairy wine or something .  mumble over it a bit .  it   s the same with cursing .         cursing .     said esk  weakly .      aye  cursing  my girl  and no need to look so shocked .  you   ll curse  when the need comes .  when you   re alone  and there   s no help to hand  and        she hesitated and  uncomfortably aware of esk   s questioning eyes  finished lamely        and people aren   t showing respect .  make it loud  make it complicated  make it long  and make it up if you have to  but it   ll work all right .  next day  when they hit their thumb or they fall off a ladder or their dog drops dead they   ll remember you .  they   ll behave better next time .         but it still doesn   t seem like magic     said esk  scuffing the dust with her feet .      i saved a man   s life once     said granny .     special medicine twice a day .  boiled water with a bit of berry juice in it .  told him i   d bought it from the dwarves .  that   s the biggest part of doct   rin  really .  most people   ll get over most things if they put their minds to it  you just have to give them an interest .      she patted esk   s hand as nicely as possible .     you   re a bit young for this     she said     but as you grow older you   ll find most people don   t set foot outside their own heads much .  you too     she added gnomically .      i don   t understand .         i   d be very surprised if you did     said granny briskly     but you can tell me five herbs suitable for dry coughs .      spring began to unfold in earnest .  granny started taking esk on long walks that took all day  to hidden ponds or high on to the mountain scree to collect rare plants .  esk enjoyed that  high on the hills where the sun beat down strongly but the air was nevertheless freezing cold .  plants grew thickly and hugged the ground .  from some of the highest peaks she could see all the way to the rim ocean that ran around the edge of the world  in the other direction the ramtops marched into the distance  wrapped in eternal winter .  they went all the way to the hub of the world where  it was generally agreed  the gods lived on a ten mile high mountain of rock and ice .      gods are all right     said granny  as they ate their lunch and looked at the view .     you don   t bother gods  and gods don   t come bothering you .         do you know many gods .         i   ve seen the thundergods a few times     said granny     and hoki  of course .         hoki .      granny chewed a crustless sandwich .     oh  he   s a nature god     she said .     sometimes he manifests himself as an oak tree  or half a man and half a goat  but mainly i see him in his aspect as a bloody nuisance .  you only find him in the deep woods  of course .  he plays the flute .  very badly  if you must know .      esk lay on her stomach and looked out across the lands below while a few hardy  self employed bumblebees patrolled the thyme clusters .  the sun was warm on her back but  up here  there were still drifts of snow on the hubside of rocks .      tell me about the lands down there     she said lazily .   granny peered disapprovingly at ten thousand miles of landscape .      they   re just other places     she said .     just like here  only different .         are there cities and things .         i daresay .         haven   t you ever been to look .      granny sat back  gingerly arranging her skirt to expose several inches of respectable flannelette to the sun  and let the heat caress her old bones .      no     she said .     there   s quite enough troubles around here without going to look for them in forn parts .         i dreamed of a city once     said esk .     it had hundreds of people in it  and there was this building with big gates  and they were magical gates        a sound like tearing cloth came from behind her .  granny had fallen asleep .      granny .         mhnf .      esk thought for a moment .     are you having a good time .     she said artfully .      mnph .         you said you   d show me some real magic  all in good time     said esk     and this is a good time .         mnph .      granny weatherwax opened her eyes and looked straight up at the sky  it was darker up here  more purple than blue .  she thought  why not .  she   s a quick learner .  she knows more herblore than i do .  at her age old gammer tumult had me borrowing and shifting and sending all the hours of the day .  maybe i   m being too cautious .      just a bit .     pleaded esk .   granny turned it over in her mind .  she couldn   t think of any more excuses .  i   m surely going to regret this  she told herself  displaying considerable foresight .      all right     she said shortly .      real magic .     said esk .     not more herbs or headology .         real magic  as you call it  yes .         a spell .         no .  a borrowing .      esk   s face was a picture of expectation .  she looked more alive  it seemed to granny  than she had ever been before .   granny looked over the valleys stretching out before them until she found what she was after .  a gray eagle was circling lazily over a distant blue hazed patch of forest .  its mind was currently at ease .  it would do nicely .   she called it gently  and it began to circle toward them .      the first thing to remember about borrowing is that you must be comfortable and somewhere safe     she said  smoothing out the grass behind her .     bed   s best .         but what is borrowing .         lie down and hold my hand .  do you see the eagle up there .      esk squinted into the dark  hot sky .   there were   two doll figures on the grass below as she pivoted on the wind     she could feel the whip and wire of the air through her feathers .  because the eagle was not hunting  but simply enjoying the feel of the sun on its wings  the land below was a mere unimportant shape .  but the air  the air was a complex  changing three dimensional thing  an interlocked pattern of spirals and curves that stretched away into the distance  a switchback of currents built around thermal pillars .  she        felt a gentle pressure restraining her .      the next thing to remember     said granny   s voice  very close     is not to upset the owner .  if you let it know you   re there it   ll either fight you or panic  and you won   t stand a chance either way .  it   s had a lifetime of being an eagle  and you haven   t .      esk said nothing .      you   re not frightened  are you .     said granny .     it can take you that way the first time  and           i   m not frightened     said esk  and    how do i control it .         you don   t .  not yet .  anyway  controlling a truly wild creature isn   t easily learned .  you have to   sort of suggest to it that it might feel inclined to do things .  with a tame animal  of course  it   s all different .  but you can   t make any creature do anything that is totally against its nature .  now try and find the eagle   s mind .      esk could sense granny as a diffuse silver cloud at the back of her own mind .  after some searching she found the eagle .  she almost missed it .  its mind was small  sharp and purple  like an arrowhead .  it was concentrating entirely on flying  and took no notice of her .      good     said granny approvingly .     we   re not going to go far .  if you want to make it turn  you must           yes  yes     said esk .  she flexed her fingers  wherever they were  and the bird leaned against the air and turned .      very good     said granny  taken aback .     how did you do that .         i   don   t know .  it just seemed obvious .         hmph .     granny gently tested the tiny eagle mind .  it was still totally oblivious of its passengers .  she was genuinely impressed  a very rare occurrence .   they floated over the mountain  while esk excitedly explored the eagle   s senses .  granny   s voice droned through her consciousness  giving instructions and guidance and warnings .  she listened with half an ear .  it sounded far too complicated .  why couldn   t she take over the eagle   s mind .  it wouldn   t hurt it .   she could see how to do it  it was just a knack  like snapping your fingers   which in fact she had never managed to achieve   and then she   d be able to experience flying for real  not at second hand .   then she could        don   t     said granny calmly .     no good will come of it .         what .         do you really think you   re the first  my girl .  do you think we haven   t all thought what a fine thing it would be  to take on another body and tread the wind or breathe the water .  and do you really think it would be as easy as that .      esk glowered at her .      no need to look like that     said granny .     you   ll thank me one day .  don   t you start playing around before you know what you   re about  eh .  before you get up to tricks you   ve got to learn what to do if things go wrong .  don   t try to walk before you can run .         i can feel how to do it  granny .         that   s as maybe .  it   s harder than it seems  is borrowing  although i   ll grant you   ve got a knack .  that   s enough for today  bring us in over ourselves and i   ll show you how to return .      the eagle beat the air over the two recumbent forms and esk saw  in her mind   s eye  two channels open for them .  granny   s mindshape vanished .   now     granny had been wrong .  the eagle mind barely fought  and didn   t have time to panic .  esk held it wrapped in her own mind .  it writhed for an instant  and then melted into her .   granny opened her eyes in time to see the bird give a hoarse cry of triumph  curve down low over the grass grown scree  and skim away down the mountainside .  for a moment it was a vanishing dot and then it had gone  leaving only another echoing shriek .   granny looked down at esk   s silent form .  the girl was light enough  but it was a long way home and the afternoon was dwindling .      drat     she said  with no particular emphasis .  she stood up  brushed herself down and  with a grunt of effort  hauled esk   s inert body over her shoulder .   high in the crystal sunset air above the mountains the eagle esk sought more height  drunk with the sheer vitality of flight .   on the way home granny met a hungry bear .  granny   s back was giving her gyp  and she was in no mood to be growled at .  she muttered a few words under her breath and the bear  to its brief amazement  walked heavily into a tree and didn   t regain consciousness for several hours .      when she reached the cottage granny put esk   s body to bed and drew up the fire .  she brought the goats in and milked them  and finished the chores of the evening .   she made sure all the windows were open and  when it began to grow dark  lit a lantern and put it on the windowsill .   granny weatherwax didn   t sleep more than a few hours a night  as a rule  and woke again at midnight .  the room hadn   t changed  although the lantern had its own little solar system of very stupid moths .   when she woke again at dawn the candle had long burned down and esk was still sleeping the shallow  unwakable sleep of the borrower .   when she took the goats out to their paddock she looked intently at the sky .   noon came  and gradually the light drained out of another day .  she paced the floor of the kitchen aimlessly .  occasionally she would throw herself into frantic bouts of housework  ancient crusts were unceremoniously dug out of the cracks in the flagstones  and the fireback was scraped free of the winter   s soot and blackleaded to within an inch of its life .  a nest of mice in the back of the dresser were kindly but firmly ejected into the goatshed .   sunset came .   the light of the discworld was old and slow and heavy .  from the cottage door granny watched as it drained off the mountains  flowing in golden rivers through the forest .  here and there it pooled in hollows until it faded and vanished .   she drummed her fingers sharply on the doorpost  humming a small and bitter little tune .   dawn came  and the cottage was empty except for esk   s body  silent and unmoving on the bed .      but as the golden light flowed slowly across the discworld like the first freshing of the tide over mudflats the eagle circled higher into the dome of heaven  beating the air down with slow and powerful wingbeats .   the whole of the world was spread out beneath esk   all the continents  all the islands  all the rivers and especially the great ring of the rim ocean .   there was nothing else up here  not even sound .   esk gloried in the feel of it  willing her flagging muscles into greater effort .  but something was wrong .  her thoughts seemed to be chasing around beyond her control  and disappearing .  pain and exhilaration and weariness poured into her mind  but it was as if other things were spilling out at the same time .  memories dwindled away on the wind .  as fast as she could latch on to a thought it evaporated  leaving nothing behind .   she was losing chunks of herself  and she couldn   t remember what she was losing .  she panicked  burrowing back to the things she was sure of     i am esk  and i have stolen the body of an eagle and the feel of wind in feathers  the hunger  the search of the not sky below     she tried again .  i am esk and seeking the windpath  the pain of muscle  the cut of the air  the cold of it     i am esk high over air damp wet white  above everything  the sky is thin     i am i am .      granny was in the garden  among the beehives  the early morning wind whipping at her skirts .  she went from hive to hive  tapping on their roofs .  then  in the thickets of borage and beebalm that she had planted around them  she stood with her arms outstretched in front of her and sang something in tones so high that no normal person could have heard them .   but a roar went up from the hives  and then the air was suddenly thick with the heavy  big eyed  deep voiced shapes of drone bees .  they circled over her head  adding their own bass humming to her chant .   then they were gone  soaring into the growing light over the clearing and streaming away over the trees .   it is well known   at least  it is well known to witches   that all colonies of bees are  as it were  just one part of the creature called the swarm  in the same way that individual bees are component cells of the hivemind .  granny didn   t mingle her thoughts with the bees very often  partly because insect minds were strange  alien things that tasted of tin  but mostly because she suspected that the swarm was a good deal more intelligent than she was .   she knew that the drones would soon reach the wild bee colonies in the deep forest  and within hours every corner of the mountain meadows would be under very close scrutiny indeed .  all she could do was wait .   at noon the drones returned  and granny read in the sharp acid thoughts of the hivemind that there was no sign of esk .   she went back into the cool of the cottage and sat down in the rocking chair  staring at the doorway .   she knew what the next step was .  she hated the very idea of it .  but she fetched a short ladder  climbed up creakily on to the roof  and pulled the staff from its hiding place in the thatch .   it was icy cold .  it steamed .      above the snowline  then     said granny .   she climbed down  and rammed the staff into a flowerbed .  she glared at it .  she had a nasty feeling that it was glaring back .      don   t think you   ve won  because you haven   t     she snapped .     it   s just that i haven   t got the time to mess around .  you must know where she is .  i command you to take me to her .      the staff regarded her woodenly .      by       granny paused  her invocations were a little rusty        by stock and stone i order it .      activity  movement  liveliness   all these words would be completely inaccurate descriptions of the staff   s response .   granny scratched her chin .  she remembered the little lesson all children get taught  what   s the magic word .      please .     she suggested .   the staff trembled  rose a little way out of the ground  and turned in the air so that it hung invitingly at waist height .   granny had heard that broomsticks were once again very much the fashion among younger witches  but she didn   t hold with it .  there was no way a body could look respectable while hurtling through the air aboard a household implement .  besides  it looked decidedly draughty .   but this was no time for respectability .  pausing only to snatch her hat from its hook behind the door she scrambled up on to the staff and perched as best she could  sidesaddle of course  and with her skirts firmly gripped between her knees .      right     she said .     now wha aaaaaaaaa        across the forest animals broke and scattered as the shadow passed overhead  crying and cursing .  granny clung on with whitened knuckles  her thin legs kicking wildly as  high above the treetops  she learned important lessons about centers of gravity and air turbulence .  the staff shot onward  heedless of her yells .   by the time it had come out over the upland meadows she had come to terms with it somewhat  which meant that she could just about hang on with knees and hands provided she didn   t mind being upside down .  her hat  at least  was useful  being aerodynamically shaped .   the staff plunged between black cliffs and along high bare valleys where  it was said  rivers of ice had once flowed in the days of the ice giants .  the air became thin and sharp in the throat .   they came to an abrupt halt over a snowdrift .  granny fell off  and lay panting in the snow while she tried to remember why she was going through all this .   there was a bundle of feathers under an overhang a few feet away .  as granny approached it a head rose jerkily  and the eagle glared at her with fierce  frightened eyes .  it tried to fly  and toppled over .  when she reached out to touch it  it took a neat triangle of flesh out of her hand .      i see     said granny quietly  to no one in particular .  she looked around  and found a boulder of about the right size .  she disappeared behind it for a few seconds  for the sake of respectability  and reappeared with a petticoat in her hand .  the bird thrashed around  ruining several weeks of meticulous petit point embroidery  but she managed to bundle it up and hold it so that she could avoid its sporadic lunges .   granny turned to the staff  which was now upright in the snowdrift .      i shall walk back     she told it coldly .   it turned out that they were in a spur valley overlooking a drop of several hundred feet on to sharp black rocks .      very well  then     she conceded     but you   re to fly slowly  d   you understand .  and no going high .      in fact  because she was slightly more experienced and perhaps because the staff was taking more care  too  the ride back was almost sedate .  granny was almost persuaded that  given time  she could come to merely dislike flying  instead of loathing it .  what it needed was some way of stopping yourself from having to look at the ground .      the eagle sprawled on the rag rug in front of the empty hearth .  it had drunk some water  over which granny had mumbled a few of the charms she normally said to impress patients  but you never knew  there might be some power in them  and it had also gulped a few strips of raw meat .   what it had not done was display the least sign of intelligence .   she wondered whether she had the right bird .  she risked another pecking and stared hard into its evil orange eyes  and tried to convince herself that way down in their depths  almost beyond sight  was a strange little flicker .   she probed around inside its head .  the eagle mind was still there right enough  vivid and sharp  but there was something else .  mind  of course  has no color  but nevertheless the strands of the eagle   s mind seemed to be purple .  around them and tangled among them were faint strands of silver .   esk had learned too late that mind shapes body  that borrowing is one thing but that the dream of truly taking on another form had its built in penalty .   granny sat and rocked .  she was at a loss  she knew that .  unraveling the tangled minds was beyond her power  beyond any power in the ramtops  beyond even     there was no sound  but maybe there was a change in the texture of the air .  she looked up at the staff  which had been suffered to come back into the cottage .      no     she said firmly .   then she thought  whose benefit did i say that for .  mine .  there   s power there  but it   s not my kind of power .   there isn   t any other kind around  though .  and even now i may be too late .   i might never have been early enough .   she reached out again into the bird   s head to calm its fears and dispel its panic .  it allowed her to pick it up and sat awkwardly on her wrist  its talons gripping tight enough to draw blood .   granny took the staff and made her way upstairs  to where esk lay on the narrow bed in the low bedroom with its ancient contoured ceiling .   she made the bird perch on the bedrail and turned her attention to the staff .  once more the carvings shifted under her glare  never quite revealing their true form .   granny was no stranger to the uses of power  but she knew she relied on gentle pressure subtly to steer the tide of things .  she didn   t put it like that  of course   she would have said that there was always a lever if you knew where to look .  the power in the staff was harsh  fierce  the raw stuff of magic distilled out of the forces that powered the universe itself .   there would be a price .  and granny knew enough about wizardry to be certain that it would be a high one .  but if you were worried about the price  then why were you in the shop .   she cleared her throat  and wondered what the hell she was supposed to do next .  perhaps if she     the power hit her like a halfbrick .  she could feel it take her and lift her so that she was amazed to look down and see her feet still firmly on the floorboards .  she tried to take a step forward and magical discharges crackled in the air around her .  she reached out to steady herself against the wall and the ancient wooden beam under her hand stirred and started to sprout leaves .  a cyclone of magic swirled around the room  picking up dust and briefly giving it some very disturbing shapes  the jug and basin on the washstand  with the particularly fetching rosebud pattern  broke into fragments .  under the bed the third member of the traditional china trio turned into something horrible and slunk away .   granny opened her mouth to swear and thought better of it when her words blossomed out into rainbow edged clouds .   she looked down at esk and the eagle  which seemed oblivious to all this  and tried to concentrate .  she let herself slide inside its head and again she could see the strands of mind  the silver threads bound so closely around the purple that they took on the same shape .  but now she could see where the strands ended  and where a judicious tug or push would begin to unravel them .  it was so obvious she heard herself laugh  and the sound curved away in shades of orange and red and vanished into the ceiling .   time passed .  even with the power throbbing through her head it was a painfully hard task  like threading a needle by moonlight  but eventually she had a handful of silver .  in the slow  heavy world in which she now appeared to be she took the hank and threw it slowly toward esk .  it became a cloud  swirled like a whirlpool  and vanished .   she was aware of a shrill chittering noise  and shadows on the edge of sight .  well  it happened to everyone sooner or later .  they had come  drawn as always by a discharge of magic .  you just had to learn to ignore them .      granny woke with bright sunlight skewering into her eyes .  she was slumped against the door  and her whole body felt as though it had toothache .   she reached out blindly with one hand  found the edge of the washstand  and pulled herself into a sitting position .  she was not really surprised to see that the jug and basin looked just the same as they had always done  in fact sheer curiosity overcame her aches and she gave a quick glance under the bed to check that  yes  things were as normal .   the eagle was still hunched on the bedpost .  in the bed esk was asleep  and granny saw that it was a true sleep and not the stillness of a vacant body .   all she had to do now was hope that esk wouldn   t wake up with an irresistible urge to pounce on rabbits .   she carried the unresisting bird downstairs and let it free outside the back door .  it flew heavily up into the nearest tree  where it settled to rest .  it had a feeling it ought to have a grudge against somebody  but for the life of it  it couldn   t remember why .      esk opened her eyes and stared for a long time at the ceiling .  over the months she had grown familiar with every lump and crack of the plaster  which created a fantastic upside down landscape that she had peopled with a private and complex civilization .   her mind thronged with dreams .  she pulled an arm out from under the sheets and stared at it  wondering why it wasn   t covered with feathers .  it was all very puzzling .   she pushed the covers back  swung her legs to the edge of the bed  spread her wings into the rush of the wind and glided out into the world     the thump on the bedroom floor brought granny scurrying up the stairs  to take her in her arms and hold her tight as the terror hit her .  she rocked back and forth on her heels  making meaningless soothing noises .   esk looked up at her through a mask of horror .      i could feel myself vanishing .         yes  yes .  better now     murmured granny .      you don   t understand .  i couldn   t even remember my name .     esk shrieked .      but you can remember now .      esk hesitated  checking .     yes     she said     yes  of course .  now .         so no harm done .         but        granny sighed .     you have learned something     she said  and thought it safe to insert a touch of sternness into her voice .     they say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing  but it is not one half so bad as a lot of ignorance .         but what happened .         you thought that borrowing wasn   t enough .  you thought it would be a fine thing to steal another   s body .  but you must know that a body is like   like a jelly mold .  it sets a shape on its contents  d   you see .  you can   t have a girl   s mind in an eagle   s body .  not for long  at any rate .         i became an eagle .         yes .         not me at all .      granny thought for a while .  she always had to pause when conversations with esk led her beyond the reaches of a decent person   s vocabulary .      no     she said at last     not in the way you mean .  just an eagle with maybe some strange dreams sometimes .  like when you dream you   re flying  perhaps it would remember walking and talking .         urgh .         but it   s all over now     said granny  treating her to a thin smile .     you   re your true self again and the eagle has got its mind back .  it   s sitting in the big beech by the privy  i should like you to put out some food for it .      esk sat back on her heels  staring at a point past granny   s head .      there were some strange things     she said conversationally .  granny spun around .      i meant  in a sort of dream i saw things     said esk .  the old woman   s shock was so visible that she hesitated  frightened that she had said something wrong .      what kind of things .     said granny flatly .      sort of big creatures  all sorts of shapes .  just sitting around .         was it dark .  i mean  these things  were they in the dark .         there were stars  i think .  granny .      granny weatherwax was staring at the wall .      granny .     esk repeated .      mmph .  yes .  oh .     granny shook herself .     yes .  i see .  now i would like you to go downstairs and get the bacon that is in the pantry and put it out for the bird  do you understand .  it would be a good idea to thank it  too .  you never know .      when esk returned granny was buttering bread .  she pulled her stool up to the table  but the old woman waved the breadknife at her .      first things first .  stand up .  face me .      esk did so  puzzled .  granny stuck the knife in the bread board and shook her head .      drat it     she said to the world at large .     i don   t know what way they have of it  there should be some kind of ceremony if i know wizards  they always have to complicate things           what do you mean .      granny seemed to ignore her  but crossed to the dark corner by the dresser .      probably you should have one foot in a bucket of cold porridge and one glove on and all that kind of stuff     she went on .     i didn   t want to do this  but they   re forcing my hand .         what are you talking about  granny .      the old witch yanked the staff out of its shadow and waved it vaguely at esk .      here .  it   s yours .  take it .  i just hope this is the right thing to do .      in fact the presentation of a staff to an apprentice wizard is usually a very impressive ceremony  especially if the staff has been inherited from an elder mage  by ancient lore there is a long and frightening ordeal involving masks and hoods and swords and fearful oaths about people   s tongues being cut out and their entrails torn by wild birds and their ashes scattered to the eight winds and so on .  after some hours of this sort of thing the apprentice can be admitted to the brotherhood of the wise and enlightened .   there is also a long speech .  by sheer coincidence granny got the essence of it in a nutshell .   esk took the staff and peered at it .      it   s very nice     she said uncertainly .     the carvings are pretty .  what   s it for .         sit down now .  and listen properly for once .  on the day you were born                 and that   s the shape of it .      esk looked hard at the staff  then at granny .      i   ve got to be a wizard .         yes .  no .  i don   t know .         that isn   t really an answer  granny     esk said reproachfully .     am i or amp   t i .         women can   t be wizards     said granny bluntly .     it   s agin nature .  you might as well have a female blacksmith .         actually i   ve watched dad at work and i don   t see why           look     said granny hurriedly     you can   t have a female wizard any more than you can have a male witch  because           i   ve heard of male witches     said esk meekly .      warlocks .         i think so .         i mean there   s no male witches  only silly men     said granny hotly .     if men were witches  they   d be wizards .  it   s all down to       she tapped her head       headology .  how your mind works .  men   s minds work different from ours  see .  their magic   s all numbers and angles and edges and what the stars are doing  as if that really mattered .  it   s all power .  it   s all       granny paused  and dredged up her favorite word to describe all she despised in wizardry        jommetry .         that   s all right  then     said esk  relieved .     i   ll stay here and learn witchery .         ah     said granny gloomily     that   s all very well for you to say .  i don   t think it will be as easy as that .         but you said that men can be wizards and women can be witches and it can   t be the other way around .         that   s right .         well  then     said esk triumphantly     it   s all solved  isn   t it .  i can   t help but be a witch .      granny pointed to the staff .  esk shrugged .      it   s just an old stick .      granny shook her head .  esk blinked .      no .         no .         and i can   t be a witch .         i don   t know what you can be .  hold the staff .         what .         hold the staff .  now  i   ve laid the fire in the grate .  light it .         the tinderbox is       esk began .      you once told me there were better ways of lighting fires .  show me .      granny stood up .  in the dimness of the kitchen she seemed to grow until she filled it with shifting  ragged shadows  shot with menace .  her eyes glared down at esk .      show me     she commanded  and her voice had ice in it .      but       said esk desperately  clutching the heavy staff to her and knocking her stool over in her haste to back away .      show me .      with a scream esk spun around .  fire flared from her fingertips and arced across the room .  the kindling exploded with a force that hurled the furniture around the room and a ball of fierce green light spluttered on the hearth .   changing patterns sped across it as it spun sizzling on the stones  which cracked and then flowed .  the iron fireback resisted bravely for a few seconds before melting like wax  it made a final appearance as a red smear across the fireball and then vanished .  a moment later the kettle went the same way .   just when it seemed that the chimney would follow them the ancient hearthstone gave up  and with a final splutter the fireball sank from view .   the occasional crackle or puff of steam signaled its passage through the earth .  apart from that there was silence  the loud hissing silence that comes after an ear splattering noise  and after the actinic glare the room seemed pitch dark .   eventually granny crawled out from behind the table and crept as closely as she dared to the hole  which was still surrounded by a crust of lava .  she jerked back as another cloud of superheated steam mushroomed up .      they say there   s dwarf mines under the ramtops     she said inconsequentially .     my  but them little buggers is in for a surprise .      she prodded the little puddle of cooling iron where the kettle had been  and added     shame about the fireback .  it had owls on it  you know .      she patted her singed hair gingerly with a shaking hand .     i think this calls for a nice cup of  a nice cup of cold water .      esk sat looking in wonder at her hand .      that was real magic .     she said at last     and i did it .         one type of real magic     corrected granny .     don   t forget that .  and you don   t want to do that all the time  neither .  if it   s in you  you   ve got to learn to control it .         can you teach me .         me .  no .         how can i learn if no one will teach me .         you   ve got to go where they can .  wizard school .         but you said        granny paused in the act of filling a jug from the water bucket .      yes  yes     she snapped     never mind what i said  or common sense or anything .  sometimes you just have to go the way things take you  and i reckon you   re going to wizard school one way or the other .      esk considered this .      you mean it   s my destiny .     she said at last .   granny shrugged .     something like that .  probably .  who knows .      that night  long after esk had been sent to bed  granny put on her hat  lit a fresh candle  cleared the table  and pulled a small wooden box from its secret hiding place in the dresser .  it contained a bottle of ink  an elderly quill pen  and a few sheets of paper .   granny was not entirely happy when faced with the world of letters .  her eyes protruded  her tongue stuck out  small beads of sweat formed on her forehead  but the pen scratched its way across the page to the accompaniment of the occasional quiet    drat    or    bugger the thing .      the letter read as follows  although this version lacks the candle wax  blots  crossings out and damp patches of the original .       to ther hed wizzard   unsene universety   greatings  i hop you ar well  i am sending to you won escarrina smith  shee hath thee maekings of wizzardery but whot may be ferther dun wyth hyr i knowe not shee is a gode worker and clene about hyr person allso skilled in diuerse arts of thee howse  i will send monies wyth hyr may you liv longe and ende youre days in pese  and oblije  esmerelder weatherwaxe  mss  wytch .     granny held it up to the candlelight and considered it critically .  it was a good letter .  she had got    diuerse    out of the almanack  which she read every night .  it was always predicting    diuerse plagues    and    diuerse ill fortune .     granny wasn   t entirely sure what it meant  but it was a damn good word all the same .   she sealed it with candle wax and put it on the dresser .  she could leave it for the carrier to take when she went into the village tomorrow  to see about a new kettle .      next morning granny took some pains over her dress  selecting a black dress with a frog and bat motif  a big velvet cloak  or at least a cloak made of the sort of stuff velvet looks like after thirty years of heavy wear  and the pointed hat of office which was crucified with hatpins .   their first call was to the stonemason  to order a replacement hearthstone .  then they called on the smith .   it was a long and stormy meeting .  esk wandered out into the orchard and climbed up to her old place in the apple tree while from the house came her father   s shouts  her mother   s wails and long silent pauses which meant that granny weatherwax was speaking softly in what esk thought of as her    just so    voice .  the old woman had a flat  measured way of speaking sometimes .  it was the kind of voice the creator had probably used .  whether there was magic in it  or just headology  it ruled out any possibility of argument .  it made it clear that whatever it was talking about was exactly how things should be .   the breeze shook the tree gently .  esk sat on a branch idly swinging her legs .   she thought about wizards .  they didn   t often come to bad ass  but there were a fair number of stories about them .  they were wise  she recalled  and usually very old and they did powerful  complex and mysterious magics and almost all of them had beards .  they were also  without exception  men .   she was on firmer ground with witches  because she   d trailed off with granny to visit a couple of villages    witches farther along the hills  and anyway witches figured largely in ramtop folklore .  witches were cunning  she recalled  and usually very old  or at least they tried to look old  and they did slightly suspicious  homely and organic magics and some of them had beards .  they were also  without exception  women .   there was some fundamental problem in all that which she couldn   t quite resolve .  why wouldn   t     cern and gulta hurtled down the path and came to a pushing  shoving halt under the tree .  they peered up at their sister with a mixture of fascination and scorn .  witches and wizards were objects of awe  but sisters weren   t .  somehow  knowing your own sister was learning to be a witch sort of devalued the whole profession .      you can   t really do spells     said cern .     can you .         course you can   t     said gulta .     what   s this stick .      esk had left the staff leaning against the tree .  cern prodded it cautiously .      i don   t want you to touch it     said esk hurriedly .     please .  it   s mine .      cern normally had all the sensitivity of a ball bearing  but his hand stopped in mid prod  much to his surprise .      i didn   t want to anyway     he muttered to hide his confusion .     it   s only an old stick .         is it true you can do spells .     asked gulta .     we heard granny say you could .         we listened at the door     added cern .      you said i couldn   t     said esk  airily .      well  can you or can   t you .     said gulta  his face reddening .      perhaps .         you can   t .      esk looked down at his face .  she loved her brothers  when she reminded herself to  in a dutiful sort of way  although she generally remembered them as a collection of loud noises in trousers .  but there was something awfully piglike and unpleasant about the way gulta was staring up at her  as though she had personally insulted him .   she felt her body start to tingle  and the world suddenly seemed very sharp and clear .      i can     she said .   gulta looked from her to the staff  and his eyes narrowed .  he kicked it viciously .      old stick .      he looked  she thought  exactly like a small angry pig .   cern   s screams brought granny and his parents first to the back door and then running down the cinder path .   esk was perched in the fork of the apple tree  an expression of dreamy contemplation on her face .  cern was hiding behind the tree  his face a mere rim around a red  tonsil vibrating bawl .   gulta was sitting rather bewildered in a pile of clothing that no longer fitted him  wrinkling his snout .   granny strode up to the tree until her hooked nose was level with esk   s .      turning people into pigs is not allowed     she hissed .     even brothers .         i didn   t do it  it just happened .  anyway  you must admit it   s a better shape for him     said esk evenly .      what   s going on .     said smith .     where   s gulta .  what   s this pig doing here .         this pig     said granny weatherwax     is your son .      there was a sigh from esk   s mother as she collapsed gently backward  but smith was slightly less unprepared .  he looked sharply from gulta  who had managed to untangle himself from his clothing and was now rooting enthusiastically among the early windfalls  to his only daughter .      she did this .         yes .  or it was done through her     said granny  looking suspiciously at the staff .      oh .     smith looked at his fifth son .  he had to admit that the shape suited him .  he reached out without looking and fetched the screaming cern a thump on the back of his head .      can you turn him back again .     he asked .  granny spun around and glared the question at esk  who shrugged .      he didn   t believe i could do magic     she said calmly .      yes  well  i think you   ve made the point     said granny .     and now you will turn him back  madam .  this instant .  do you hear .         don   t want to .  he was rude .         i see .      esk gazed down defiantly .  granny glared up sternly .  their wills clanged like cymbals and the air between them thickened .  but granny had spent a lifetime bending recalcitrant creatures to her bidding and  while esk was a surprisingly strong opponent  it was obvious that she would give in before the end of the paragraph .      oh  all right     she whined .     i don   t know why anyone would bother turning him into a pig when he was doing such a good job of it all by himself .      she didn   t know where the magic had come from  but she mentally faced that way and made a suggestion .  gulta reappeared  naked  with an apple in his mouth .      awts aughtning .     he said .   granny spun around on smith .      now will you believe me .     she snapped .     do you really think she   s supposed to settle down here and forget all about magic .  can you imagine her poor husband if she marries .         but you always said it was impossible for women to be wizards     said smith .  he was actually rather impressed .  granny weatherwax had never been known to turn anyone into anything .      never mind that now     said granny  calming down a bit .     she needs training .  she needs to know how to control .  for pity   s sake put some clothes on that child .         gulta  get dressed and stop grizzling     said his father  and turned back to granny .      you said there was some sort of teaching place .     he hazarded .      the unseen university  yes .  it   s for training wizards .         and you know where it is .         yes     lied granny  whose grasp of geography was slightly worse than her knowledge of subatomic physics .   smith looked from her to his daughter  who was sulking .      and they   ll make a wizard of her .     he said .   granny sighed .      i don   t know what they   ll make of her     she said .      and so it was that  a week later  granny locked the cottage door and hung the key on its nail in the privy .  the goats had been sent to stay with a sister witch further along the hills  who had also promised to keep an eye on the cottage .  bad ass would just have to manage without a witch for a while .   granny was vaguely aware that you didn   t find the unseen university unless it wanted you to  and the only place to start looking was the town of ohulan cutash  a sprawl of a hundred or so houses about fifteen miles away .  it was where you went to once or twice a year if you were a really cosmopolitan bad assian  granny had only been once before in her entire life and hadn   t approved of it at all .  it had smelt all wrong  she   d got lost  and she distrusted city folk with their flashy ways .   they got a lift on the cart that came out periodically with metal for the smithy .  it was gritty  but better than walking  especially since granny had packed their few possessions in a large sack .  she sat on it for safety .   esk sat cradling the staff and watching the woods go by .  when they were several miles outside the village she said     i thought you told me plants were different in forn parts .         so they are .         these trees look just the same .      granny regarded them disdainfully .      nothing like as good     she said .   in fact she was already feeling slightly panicky .  her promise to accompany esk to unseen university had been made without thinking  and granny  who picked up what little she knew of the rest of the disc from rumor and the pages of her almanack  was convinced that they were heading into earthquakes  tidal waves  plagues and massacres  many of them diuerse or even worse .  but she was determined to see it through .  a witch relied too much on words ever to go back on them .   she was wearing serviceable black  and concealed about her person were a number of hatpins and a breadknife .  she had hidden their small store of money  grudgingly advanced by smith  in the mysterious strata of her underwear .  her skirt pockets jingled with lucky charms  and a freshly forged horseshoe  always a potent preventative in time of trouble  weighed down her handbag .  she felt about as ready as she ever would be to face the world .   the track wound down between the mountains .  for once the sky was clear  the high ramtops standing out crisp and white like the brides of the sky  with their trousseaux stuffed with thunderstorms  and the many little streams that bordered or crossed the path flowed sluggishly through strands of meadowsweet and go faster root .   by lunchtime they reached the suburb of ohulan  it was too small to have more than one  which was just an inn and a handful of cottages belonging to people who couldn   t stand the pressures of urban life  and a few minutes later the cart deposited them in the town   s main  indeed its only  square .   it turned out to be market day .   granny weatherwax stood uncertainly on the cobbles  holding tightly to esk   s shoulder as the crowd swirled around them .  she had heard that lewd things could happen to country women who were freshly arrived in big cities  and she gripped her handbag until her knuckles whitened .  if any male stranger had happened to so much as nod at her it would have gone very hard indeed for him .   esk   s eyes were sparkling .  the square was a jigsaw of noise and color and smell .  on one side of it were the temples of the disc   s more demanding deities  and weird perfumes drifted out to join with the reeks of commerce in a complex ragrug of fragrances .  there were stalls filled with enticing curiosities that she itched to investigate .   granny let the both of them drift with the crowd .  the stalls were puzzling her as well .  she peered among them  although never for one minute relaxing her vigilance against pickpockets  earthquakes and traffickers in the erotic  until she spied something vaguely familiar .   there was a small covered stall  black draped and musty  that had been wedged into a narrow space between two houses .  inconspicuous though it was  it nevertheless seemed to be doing a very busy trade .  its customers were mainly women  of all ages  although she did notice a few men .  they all had one thing in common  though .  no one approached it directly .  they all sort of strolled almost past it  then suddenly ducked under its shady canopy .  a moment later and they would be back again  hand just darting away from bag or pocket  competing for the world   s most nonchalant walk title so effectively that a watcher might actually doubt what he or she had just seen .   it was quite amazing that a stall so many people didn   t know was there should be quite so popular .      what   s in there .     said esk .     what   s everyone buying .         medicines     said granny firmly .      there must be a lot of very sick people in towns     said esk gravely .   inside  the stall was a mass of velvet shadows and the herbal scent was thick enough to bottle .  granny poked a few bundles of dry leaves with an expert finger .  esk pulled away from her and tried to read the scrawled labels on the bottles in front of her .  she was expert at most of granny   s preparations  but she didn   t recognize anything here .  the names were quite amusing  like tiger oil  maiden   s prayer and husband   s helper  and one or two of the stoppers smelled like granny   s scullery after she had done some of her secret distillations .   a shape moved in the stall   s dim recesses and a brown wrinkled hand slid lightly on to hers .      can i assist you  missy .     said a cracked voice  in tones of syrup of figs     is it your fortune you want telling  or is it your future you want changing  maybe .         she   s with me     snapped granny  spinning around     and your eyes are betraying you  hilta goatfounder  if you can   t tell her age .      the shape in front of esk bent forward .      esme weatherwax .     it asked .      the very same     said granny .     still selling thunder drops and penny wishes  hilta .  how goes it .         all the better for seeing you     said the shape .     what brings you down from the mountains  esme .  and this child   your assistant  perhaps .         what   s it you   re selling  please .     asked esk .  the shape laughed .      oh  things to stop things that shouldn   t be and help things that should  love     it said .     let me just close up  my dears  and i will be right with you .      the shape bustled past esk in a nasal kaleidoscope of fragrances and buttoned up the curtains at the front of the stall .  then the drapes at the back were thrown up  letting in the afternoon sunlight .      can   t stand the dark and fug myself     said hilta goat founder     but the customers expect it .  you know how it is .         yes     esk nodded sagely .     headology .      hilta  a small fat woman wearing an enormous hat with fruit on it  glanced from her to granny and grinned .      that   s the way of it     she agreed .     will you take some tea .      they sat on bales of unknown herbs in the private corner made by the stall between the angled walls of the houses  and drank something fragrant and green out of surprisingly delicate cups .  unlike granny  who dressed like a very respectable raven  hilta goatfounder was all lace and shawls and colors and earrings and so many bangles that a mere movement of her arms sounded like a percussion section falling off a cliff .  but esk could see the likeness .   it was hard to describe .  you couldn   t imagine them curtseying to anyone .      so     said granny     how goes the life .      the other witch shrugged  causing the drummers to lose their grip again  just when they had nearly climbed back up .      like the hurried lover  it comes and goe       she began  and stopped at granny   s meaningful glance at esk .      not bad  not bad     she amended hurriedly .     the council have tried to run me out once or twice  you know  but they all have wives and somehow it never quite happens .  they say i   m not the right sort  but i say there   d be many a family in this town a good deal bigger and poorer if it wasn   t for madame goatfounder   s pennyroyal preventives .  i know who comes into my shop  i do .  i remember who buys buckeroo drops and shonuff ointment  i do .  life isn   t bad .  and how is it up in your village with the funny name .         bad ass     said esk helpfully .  she picked a small clay pot off the counter and sniffed at its contents .      it is well enough     conceded granny .     the handmaidens of nature are ever in demand .      esk sniffed again at the powder  which seemed to be pennyroyal with a base she couldn   t quite identify  and carefully replaced the lid .  while the two women exchanged gossip in a kind of feminine code  full of eye contact and unspoken adjectives  she examined the other exotic potions on display .  or rather  not on display .  in some strange way they appeared to be artfully half hidden  as if hilta wasn   t entirely keen to sell .      i don   t recognize any of these     she said  half to herself .     what do they give to people .         freedom     said hilta  who had good hearing .  she turned back to granny .     how much have you taught her .         not that much     said granny .     there   s power there  but what kind i   m not sure .  wizard power  it might be .      hilta turned around very slowly and looked esk up and down .      ah     she said     that explains the staff .  i wondered what the bees were talking about .  well  well .  give me your hand  child .      esk held out her hand .  hilta   s fingers were so heavy with rings it was like dipping into a sack of walnuts .   granny sat upright  radiating disapproval  as hilta began to inspect esk   s palm .      i really don   t think that is necessary     she said sternly .     not between us .         you do it  granny     said esk     in the village .  i   ve seen you .  and teacups .  and cards .      granny shifted uneasily .     yes  well     she said .     it   s all according .  you just hold their hand and people do their own fortune telling .  but there   s no need to go around believing it  we   d all be in trouble if we went around believing everything .         the powers that be have many strange qualities  and puzzling and varied are the ways in which they make their desires known in this circle of firelight we call the physical world     said hilta solemnly .  she winked at esk .      well  really     snapped granny .      no  straight up     said hilta .     it   s true .         hmph .         i see you going upon a long journey     said hilta .      will i meet a tall dark stranger .     said esk  examining her palm .     granny always says that to women  she says           no     said hilta  while granny snorted .     but it will be a very strange journey .  you   ll go a long way while staying in the same place .  and the direction will be a strange one .  it will be an exploration .         you can tell all that from my hand .         well  mainly i   m just guessing     said hilta  sitting back and reaching for the teapot  the lead drummer  who had climbed halfway back  fell on to the toiling cymbalists  .  she looked carefully at esk and added     a female wizard  eh .         granny is taking me to unseen university     said esk .   hilta raised her eyebrows .     do you know where it is .      granny frowned .     not in so many words     she admitted .     i was hoping you could give me more explicit directions  you being more familiar with bricks and things .         they say it has many doors  but the ones in this world are in the city of ankh morpork     said hilta .  granny looked blank .     on the circle sea     hilta added .  granny   s look of polite inquiry persisted .     five hundred miles away     said hilta .      oh     said granny .   she stood up and brushed an imaginary speck of dust off her dress .      we   d better be going  then     she added .   hilta laughed .  esk quite liked the sound .  granny never laughed  she merely let the corners of her mouth turn up  but hilta laughed like someone who had thought hard about life and had seen the joke .      start tomorrow  anyway     she said .     i   ve got room at home  you can stay with me  and tomorrow you   ll have the light .         we wouldn   t want to presume     said granny .      nonsense .  why not have a look around while i pack up the stall .         ohulan was the market town for a wide sprawling countryside and the market day didn   t end at sunset .  instead  torches flared at every booth and stall and light blared forth from the open doorways of the inns .  even the temples put out colored lamps to attract nocturnal worshippers .   hilta moved through the crowd like a slim snake through dry grass  her entire stall and stock reduced to a surprisingly small bundle on her back  and her jewelry rattling like a sackful of flamenco dancers .  granny stumped along behind her  her feet aching from the unaccustomed prodding of the cobbles .   and esk got lost .   it took some effort  but she managed it .  it involved ducking between two stalls and then scurrying down a side alley .  granny had warned her at length about the unspeakable things that lurked in cities  which showed that the old woman was lacking in a complete understanding of headology  since esk was now determined to see one or two of them for herself .   in fact  since ohulan was quite barbaric and uncivilized the only things that went on after dark to any degree were a little thievery  some amateurish trading in the courts of lust  and drinking until you fell over or started singing or both .   according to the standard poetic instructions one should move through a fair like the white swan at evening moves o   er the bay  but because of certain practical difficulties esk settled for moving through the crowds like a small dodgem car  bumping from body to body with the tip of the staff waving a yard above her head .  it caused some heads to turn  and not only because it had hit them  wizards occasionally passed through the town and it was the first time anyone had seen one four feet tall with long hair .   anyone watching closely would have noticed strange things happening as she passed by .   there was  for example  the man with three upturned cups who was inviting a small crowd to explore with him the exciting world of chance and probability as it related to the position of a small dried pea .  he was vaguely aware of a small figure watching him solemnly for a few moments  and then a sackful of peas cascaded out of every cup he picked up .  within seconds he was knee deep in legumes .  he was a lot deeper in trouble   he suddenly owed everyone a lot of money .   there was a small and wretched monkey that for years had shuffled vaguely at the end of a chain while its owner played something dreadful on a pipe organ .  it suddenly turned  narrowed its little red eyes  bit its keeper sharply in the leg  snapped its chain and had it away over the rooftops with the night   s takings in a tin cup .  history is silent about what they were spent on .   a boxful of marzipan ducks on a nearby stall came to life and whirred past the stallholder to land  quacking happily  in the river  where  by dawn  they had all melted  that   s natural selection for you  .   the stall itself sidled off down an alley and was never seen again .   esk  in fact  moved through the fair more like an arsonist moves through a hayfield or a neutron bounces through a reactor  poets notwithstanding  and the hypothetical watcher could have detected her random passage by tracing the outbreaks of hysteria and violence .  but  like all good catalysts  she wasn   t actually involved in the processes she initiated  and by the time all the non hypothetical potential watchers took their eyes off them she had been buffeted somewhere else .   she was also beginning to tire .  while granny weatherwax approved of night on general principles  she certainly didn   t hold with promiscuous candlelight   if she had any reading to do after dark she generally persuaded the owl to come and sit on the back of her chair  and read through its eyes .  so esk expected to go to bed around sunset  and that was long past .   there was a doorway ahead of her that looked friendly .  cheerful sounds were sliding out on the yellow light  and pooling on the cobbles .  with the staff still radiating random magic like a demon lighthouse she headed for it  weary but determined .   the landlord of the fiddler   s riddle considered himself to be a man of the world  and this was right  because he was too stupid to be really cruel  and too lazy to be really mean and although his body had been around quite a lot his mind had never gone further than the inside of his own head .   he wasn   t used to being addressed by sticks .  especially when they spoke in a small piping voice  and asked for goat   s milk .   cautiously  aware that everyone in the inn was looking at him and grinning  he pulled himself across the bar top until he could see down .  esk stared up at him .  look    em right in the eye  granny had always said  focus your power on    em  stare    em out  no one can outstare a witch     cept a goat  of course .   the landlord  whose name was skiller  found himself looking directly down at a small child who seemed to be squinting .      what .     he said .      milk     said the child  still focusing furiously .     you get it out of goats .  you know .      skiller sold only beer  which his customers claimed he got out of cats .  no self respecting goat would have endured the smell in the fiddler   s riddle .      we haven   t got any     he said .  he looked hard at the staff and his eyebrows met conspiratorially over his nose .      you could have a look     said esk .   skiller eased himself back across the bar  partly to avoid the gaze  which was causing his eyes to water in sympathy  and partly because a horrible suspicion was congealing in his mind .   even second rate barmen tend to resonate with the beer they serve  and the vibrations coming from the big barrels behind him no longer had the twang of hop and head .  they were broadcasting an altogether more lactic note .   he turned a tap experimentally  and watched a thin stream of milk curdle in the drip bucket .   the staff still poked up over the edge of the counter  like a periscope .  he could swear that it was staring at him too .      don   t waste it     said a voice .     you   ll be grateful for it one day .      it was the same tone of voice granny used when esk was less than enthusiastic about a plateful of nourishing sallet greens  boiled yellow until the last few vitamins gave in  but to skiller   s hypersensitive ears it wasn   t an injunction but a prediction .  he shivered .  he didn   t know where he would have to be to make him grateful for a drink of ancient beer and curdled milk .  he   d rather be dead first .   perhaps he would be dead first .   he very carefully wiped a nearly clean mug with his thumb and filled it from the tap .  he was aware that a large number of his guests were quietly leaving .  no one liked magic  especially in the hands of a woman .  you never could tell what they might take it into their heads to do next .      your milk     he said  adding     miss .         i   ve got some money     esk said .  granny had always told her  always be ready to pay and you won   t have to  people always like you to feel good about them  it   s all headology .      no  wouldn   t dream of it     said skiller hastily .  he leaned over the bar .     if you could see  er  your way clear to turning the rest back  though .  not much call for milk in these parts .      he sidled along a little way .  esk had leaned the staff against the bar while she drank her milk  and it was making him uncomfortable .   esk looked at him over a mustache of cream .      i didn   t turn it into milk  i just knew it would be milk because i wanted milk     she said .     what did you think it was .         er .  beer .      esk thought about this .  she vaguely remembered trying beer once  and it had tasted sort of secondhand .  but she could recall something which everyone in bad ass reckoned was much better than beer .  it was one of granny   s most guarded recipes .  it was good for you  because there was only fruit in it  plus lots of freezing and boiling and careful testing of little drops with a lighted flame .   granny would put a very small spoonful in her milk if it was a really cold night .  it had to be a wooden spoon  on account of what it did to metal .   she concentrated .  she could picture the taste in her mind  and with the little skills that she was beginning to accept but couldn   t understand she found she could take the taste apart into little colored shapes     skiller   s thin wife came out of their back room to see why it had all gone so quiet  and he waved her into shocked silence as esk stood swaying very slightly with her eyes closed and her lips moving .      little shapes that you didn   t need went back into the great pool of shapes  and then you found the extra ones you needed and put them together  and then there was a sort of hook thing which meant that they would turn anything suitable into something just like them  and then     skiller turned very carefully and regarded the barrel behind him .  the smell of the room had changed  he could feel the pure gold sweating gently out of that ancient woodwork .   with some care he took a small glass from his store under the counter and let a few splashes of the dark golden liquid escape from the tap .  he looked at it thoughtfully in the lamplight  turned the glass around methodically  sniffed it a few times  and tossed its contents back in one swallow .   his face remained unchanged  although his eyes went moist and his throat wobbled somewhat .  his wife and esk watched him as a thin beading of sweat broke out on his forehead .  ten seconds passed  and he was obviously out to break some heroic record .  there may have been steam curling out of his ears  but that could have been a rumor .  his fingers drummed a strange tattoo on the bartop .   at last he swallowed  appeared to reach a decision  turned solemnly to esk  and said     hwarl  ish gnish saaarghs ishghs oorgsh .      his brow wrinkled as he ran the sentence past his mind again and made a second attempt .      aargh argh shaah gok .      he gave up .      bharrgsh nargh .      his wife snorted and took the glass out of his unprotesting hand .  she sniffed it .  she looked at the barrels  all ten of them .  she met his unsteady eye .  in a private paradise for two they soundlessly calculated the selling price of six hundred gallons of triple distilled white mountain peach brandy and ran out of numbers .   mrs .  skiller was quicker on the uptake than her husband .  she bent down and smiled at esk  who was too tired to squint back .  it wasn   t a particularly good smile  because mrs .  skiller didn   t get much practice .      how did you get here  little girl .     she said  in a voice that suggested gingerbread cottages and the slamming of big stove doors .      i got lost from granny .         and where   s granny now  dear .     clang went the oven doors again  it was going to be a tough night for all wanderers in metaphorical forests .      just somewhere  i expect .         would you like to go to sleep in a big feather bed  all nice and warm .      esk looked at her gratefully  even while vaguely realizing that the woman had a face just like an eager ferret  and nodded .   you   re right .  it   s going to take more than a passing wood chopper to sort this out .      granny  meanwhile  was two streets away .  she was also  by the standards of other people  lost .  she would not see it like that .  she knew where she was  it was just that everywhere else didn   t .   it has already been mentioned that it is much harder to detect a human mind than  say  the mind of a fox .  the human mind  seeing this as some kind of a slur  wants to know why .  this is why .   animal minds are simple  and therefore sharp .  animals never spend time dividing experience into little bits and speculating about all the bits they   ve missed .  the whole panoply of the universe has been neatly expressed to them as things to  a  mate with   b  eat   c  run away from  and  d  rocks .  this frees the mind from unnecessary thoughts and gives it a cutting edge where it matters .  your normal animal  in fact  never tries to walk and chew gum at the same time .   the average human  on the other hand  thinks about all sorts of things around the clock  on all sorts of levels  with interruptions from dozens of biological calendars and time pieces .  there   s thoughts about to be said  and private thoughts  and real thoughts  and thoughts about thoughts  and a whole gamut of subconscious thoughts .  to a telepath the human head is a din .  it is a railway terminus with all the tannoys talking at once .  it is a complete fm waveband   and some of those stations aren   t reputable  they   re outlawed pirates on forbidden seas who play late night records with limbic lyrics .   granny  trying to locate esk by mind magic alone  was trying to find a straw in a haystack .   she was not succeeding  but enough blips of sense reached her through the heterodyne wails of a thousand brains all thinking at once to convince her that the world was  indeed  as silly as she had always believed it was .   she met hilta at the corner of the street .  she was carrying her broomstick  the better to conduct an aerial search  with great stealth  however  the men of ohulan were right behind stay long ointment but drew the line at flying women  .  she was distraught .      not so much as a hint of her     said granny .      have you been down to the river .  she might have fallen in .         then she   d have just fallen out again .  anyway  she can swim .  i think she   s hiding  drat her .         what are we going to do .      granny gave her a withering look .     hilta goatfounder  i   m ashamed of you  acting like a cowin .  do i look worried .      hilta peered at her .      you do .  a bit .  your lips have gone all thin .         i   m just angry  that   s all .         gypsies always come here for the fair  they might have taken her .      granny was prepared to believe anything about city folk but here she was on firmer ground .      then they   re a lot dafter than i   d give them credit for     she snapped .     look  she   s got the staff .         what good would that do .     said hilta  who was close to tears .      i don   t think you   ve understood anything i   ve told you     said granny severely .     all we need to do is go back to your place and wait .         what for .         the screams or the bangs or the fireballs or whatever     granny said vaguely .      that   s heartless .         oh  i expect they   ve got it coming to them .  come on  you go on ahead and put the kettle on .      hilta gave her a mystified look  then climbed on her broom and rose slowly and erratically into the shadows among the chimneys .  if broomsticks were cars  this one would be a split window morris minor .   granny watched her go  then stumped along the wet streets after her .  she was determined that they wouldn   t get her up in one of those things .      esk lay in the big  fluffy and slightly damp sheets of the spare bed in the attic room of the riddle .  she was tired  but couldn   t sleep .  the bed was too chilly  for one thing .  she wondered uneasily if she dared try to warm it up  but thought better of it .  she couldn   t seem to get the hang of fire spells  no matter how carefully she experimented .  they either didn   t work at all or worked only too well .  the woods around the cottage were becoming treacherous with the holes left by disappearing fireballs  at least  if the wizardry thing didn   t work then granny said she   d have a fine future as a privy builder or well sinker .   she turned over and tried to ignore the bed   s faint smell of mushrooms .  then she reached out in the darkness until her hand found the staff  propped against the bedhead .  mrs .  skiller had been quite insistent about taking it downstairs  but esk had hung on like grim death .  it was the only thing in the world she was absolutely certain belonged to her .   the varnished surface with its strange carvings felt oddly comforting .  esk went to sleep  and dreamed bangles  and strange packages  and mountains .  and distant stars above the mountains  and a cold desert where strange creatures lurched across the dry sand and stared at her through insect eyes     there was a creak on the stairs .  then another .  then a silence  the sort of choking  furry silence made by someone standing as still as possible .   the door swung open .  skiller made a blacker shadow against the candlelight on the stairs  and there was a faintly whispered conversation before he tiptoed as silently as he could toward the bedhead .  the staff slipped sideways as his first cautious grope dislodged it  but he caught it quickly and let his breath out very slowly .   so he hardly had enough left to scream with when the staff moved in his hands .  he felt the scaliness  the coil and muscle of it     esk sat bolt upright in time to see skiller roll backward down the steep stairladder  still flailing desperately at something quite invisible that coiled around his arms .  there was another scream from below as he landed on his wife .   the staff clattered to the floor and lay surrounded by a faint octarine glow .   esk got out of the bed and padded across the floor .  there was a terrible cursing  it sounded unhealthy .  she peered around the door and looked down on the face of mrs .  skiller .      give me that staff .      esk reached down behind her and gripped the polished wood .     no     she said .     it   s mine .         it   s not the right sort of thing for little girls     snapped the barman   s wife .      it belongs to me     said esk  and quietly closed the door .  she listened for a moment to the muttering from below and tried to think of what to do next .  turning the couple into something would probably only cause a fuss and  anyway  she wasn   t quite certain how to do it .   the fact was the magic only really worked when she wasn   t thinking about it .  her mind seemed to get in the way .   she padded across the room and pushed open the tiny window .  the strange nighttime smells of civilization drifted in   the damp smell of streets  the fragrance of garden flowers  the distant hint of an overloaded privy .  there were wet tiles outside .   as skiller started back up the stairs she pushed the staff out on to the roof and crawled after it  steadying herself on the carvings above the window .  the roof dipped down to an outhouse and she managed to stay at least vaguely upright as she half slid  half scrambled down the uneven tiles .  a six foot drop on to a stack of old barrels  a quick scramble down the slippery wood  and she was trotting easily across the inn yard .   as she kicked up the street mists she could hear the sounds of argument coming from the riddle .      skiller rushed past his wife and laid a hand on the tap of the nearest barrel .  he paused  and then wrenched it open .   the smell of peach brandy filled the room  sharp as knives .  he shut off the flow and relaxed .      afraid it would turn into something nasty .     asked his wife .  he nodded .      if you hadn   t been so clumsy       she began .      i tell you it bit me .         you could have been a wizard and we wouldn   t have to bother with all this .  have you got no ambition .      skiller shook his head .     i reckon it takes more than a staff to make a wizard     he said .     anyway  i heard where it said wizards aren   t allowed to get married  they   re not even allowed to       he hesitated .      to what .  allowed to what .      skiller writhed .     well .  you know .  thing .         i   m sure i don   t know what you   re talking about     said mrs .  skiller briskly .      no  i suppose not .      he followed her reluctantly out of the darkened barroom .  it seemed to him that perhaps wizards didn   t have such a bad life  at that .   he was proved right when the following morning revealed that the ten barrels of peach brandy had  indeed  turned into something nasty .      esk wandered aimlessly through the gray streets until she reached ohulan   s tiny river docks .  broad flat bottomed barges bobbed gently against the wharves  and one or two of them curled wisps of smoke from friendly stovepipes .  esk clambered easily on to the nearest  and used the staff to lever up the oilcloth that covered most of it .   a warm smell  a mixture of lanolin and midden  drifted up .  the barge was laden with wool .   it   s silly to go to sleep on an unknown barge  not knowing what strange cliffs may be drifting past when you awake  not knowing that bargees traditionally get an early start  setting out before the sun is barely up   not knowing what new horizons might greet one on the morrow     you know that .  esk didn   t .      esk awoke to the sound of someone whistling .  she lay quite still  reeling the evening   s events across her mind until she remembered why she was here  and then rolled over very carefully and raised the oilcloth a fraction .   here she was  then .  but    here    had moved .      this is what they call sailing  then     she said  watching the far bank glide past     it doesn   t seem very special .      it didn   t occur to her to start worrying .  for the first eight years of her life the world had been a particularly boring place and now that it was becoming interesting esk wasn   t about to act ungrateful .   the distant whistler was joined by a barking dog .  esk lay back in the wool and reached out until she found the animal   s mind  and borrowed it gently .  from its inefficient and disorganized brain she learned that there were at least four people on this barge  and many more on the others that were strung out in line with it on the river .  some of them seemed to be children .   she let the animal go and looked out at the scenery again for a long time   the barge was passing between high orange cliffs now  banded with so many colors of rock it looked as though some hungry god had made the all time record club sandwich   and tried to avoid the next thought .  but it persisted  arriving in her mind like the unexpected limbo dancer under the lavatory door of life .  sooner or later she would have to go out .  it wasn   t her stomach that was pressing the point  but her bladder brooked no delay .   perhaps if she     the oilcloth over her head was pulled aside swiftly and a big bearded head beamed down at her .      well  well     it said .     what have we here  then .  a stowaway  yesno .      esk gave it a stare .     yes     she said .  there seemed no sense in denying it .     could you help me out please .         aren   t you afraid i shall throw you to the   the pike .     said the head .  it noticed her perplexed look .     big freshwater fish     it added helpfully .     fast .  lot of teeth .  pike .      the thought hadn   t occurred to her at all .     no     she said truthfully .     why .  will you .         no .  not really .  there   s no need to be frightened .         i   m not .         oh .     a brown arm appeared  attached to the head by the normal arrangements  and helped her out of her nest in the fleeces .   esk stood on the deck of the barge and looked around .  the sky was bluer than a biscuit barrel  fitting neatly over a broad valley through which the river ran as sluggishly as a planning inquiry .   behind her the ramtops still acted as a hitching rail for clouds  but they no longer dominated as they had done for as long as esk had known them .  distance had eroded them .      where   s this .     she said  sniffing the new smells of swamp and sedge .      the upper valley of the river ankh     said her captor .     what do you think of it .      esk looked up and down the river .  it was already much wider than it had been at ohulan .      i don   t know .  there   s certainly a lot of it .  is this your ship .         boat     he corrected .  he was taller than her father  although not quite so old  and dressed like a gypsy .  most of his teeth had turned gold  but esk decided it wasn   t the time to ask why .  he had the kind of real deep tan that rich people spend ages trying to achieve with expensive holidays and bits of tinfoil  when really all you need to do to obtain one is work your arse off in the open air every day .  his brow crinkled .      yes  it   s mine     he said  determined to regain the initiative .     and what are you doing on it  i would like to know .  running away from home  yesno .  if you were a boy i   d say are you going to seek your fortune .         can   t girls seek their fortune .         i think they   re supposed to seek a boy with a fortune     said the man  and gave a     carat grin .  he extended a brown hand  heavy with rings .     come and have some breakfast .         i   d actually like to use your privy     she said .  his mouth dropped open .      this is a barge  yesno .         yes .         that means there   s only the river .     he patted her hand .     don   t worry     he added .     it   s quite used to it .         granny stood on the wharf  her boot tap tap tapping on the wood .  the little man who was the nearest thing ohulan had to a dockmaster was being treated to the full force of one of her stares  and was visibly wilting .  her expression wasn   t perhaps as vicious as thumbscrews  but it did seem to suggest that thumbscrews were a real possibility .      they left before dawn  you say     she said .      yes ss     he said .     er .  i didn   t know they weren   t supposed to .         did you see a little girl on board .     tap tap went her boot .      um .  no .  i   m sorry .     he brightened .     they were zoons     he said     if the child was with them she won   t come to harm .  you can always trust a zoon  they say .  very keen on family life .      granny turned to hilta  who was fluttering like a bewildered butterfly  and raised her eyebrows .      oh yes     hilta trilled .     the zoons have a very good name .         mmph     said granny .  she turned on her heel and stumped back toward the center of the town .  the dockmaster sagged as though a coat hanger had just been removed from his shirt .   hilta   s lodgings were over an herbalist   s and behind a tannery  and offered splendid views of the rooftops of ohulan .  she liked it because it offered privacy  always appreciated by  as she put it     my more discerning clients who prefer to make their very special purchases in an atmosphere of calm where discretion is forever the watchword .      granny weatherwax looked around the sitting room with barely concealed scorn .  there were altogether too many tassels  bead curtains  astrological charts and black cats in the place .  granny couldn   t abide cats .  she sniffed .      is that the tannery .     she said accusingly .      incense     said hilta .  she rallied bravely in the face of granny   s scorn .     the customers appreciate it     she said .     it puts them in the right frame of mind .  you know how it is .         i would have thought one could carry out a perfectly respectable business  hilta  without resorting to parlor tricks     said granny  sitting down and beginning the long and tricky business of removing her hatpins .      it   s different in towns     said hilta .     one has to move with the times .         i   m sure i don   t know why .  is the kettle on .     granny reached across the table and took the velvet cover off hilta   s crystal ball  a sphere of quartz as big as her head .      never could get the hang of this damn silicon stuff     she said .     a bowl of water with a drop of ink in it was good enough when i was a girl .  let   s see  now        she peered into the dancing heart of the ball  trying to use it to focus her mind on the whereabouts of esk .  a crystal was a tricky thing to use at the best of times  and usually staring into it meant that the one thing the future could be guaranteed to hold was a severe migraine .  granny distrusted them  considering them to smack of wizardry  for two pins  it always seemed to her  the wretched thing would suck your mind out like a whelk from a shell .      damn thing   s all sparkly     she said  huffing on it and wiping it with her sleeve .  hilta peered over her shoulder .      that   s not sparkle  that means something     she said slowly .      what .         i   m not sure .  can i try .  it   s used to me .     hilta pushed a cat off the other chair and leaned forward to peer into the glass depths .      mnph .  feel free     said granny     but you won   t find           wait .  something   s coming through .         looks all sparkly from here     granny insisted .     little silver lights all floating around  like in them little snowstorm in a bottle toys .  quite pretty  really .         yes  but look beyond the flakes        granny looked .   this was what she saw .   the viewpoint was very high up and a wide swathe of country lay below her  blue with distance  through which a broad river wriggled like a drunken snake .  there were silver lights floating in the foreground but they were  in a manner of speaking  just a few flakes in the great storm of lights that turned in a great lazy spiral  like a geriatric tornado with a bad attack of snow  and funneled down  down to the hazy landscape .  by screwing up her eyes granny could just make out some dots on the river .   occasionally some sort of lightning would sparkle briefly inside the gently turning funnel of motes .   granny blinked and looked up .  the room seemed very dark .      odd sort of weather     she said  because she couldn   t really think of anything better .  even with her eyes shut the glittering motes still danced across her vision .      i don   t think it   s weather     said hilta .     i don   t actually think people can see it  but the crystal shows it .  i think it   s magic  condensing out of the air .         into the staff .         yes .  that   s what a wizard   s staff does .  it sort of distills magic .      granny risked another glance at the crystal .      into esk     she said  carefully .      yes .         there looks like quite a lot of it .         yes .      not for the first time  granny wished she knew more about how wizards worked their magic .  she had a vision of esk filling up with magic  until every tissue and pore was bloated with the stuff .  then it would start leaking   slowly at first  arcing to ground in little bursts  but then building up to a great discharge of occult potentiality .  it could do all kinds of damage .      drat     she said .     i never did like that staff .         at least she   s heading toward the university place     said hilta .     they   ll know what to do .         that   s as may be .  how far down river do you reckon they are .         twenty miles or so .  those barges only go at walking pace .  the zoons aren   t in any hurry .         right .     granny stood up  her jaw set defiantly .  she reached for her hat and picked up her sack of possessions .      reckon i can walk faster than a barge     she said .     the river   s all bendy but i can go in straight lines .         you   re going to walk after her .     said hilta  aghast .     but there   s forests and wild animals .         good  i could do with getting back to civilization .  she needs me .  that staff is taking over .  i said it would  but did anyone listen .         did they .     said hilta  still trying to work out what granny meant by getting back to civilization .      no     said granny coldly .      his name was amschat b   hal zoon .  he lived on the raft with his three wives and three children .  he was a liar .   what always annoyed the enemies of the zoon tribe was not simply their honesty  which was infuriatingly absolute  but their total directness of approach .  the zoons had never heard about a euphemism  and wouldn   t understand what to do with it if they had one  except that they would certainly have called it    a nice way of saying something nasty .      their rigid adherence to the truth was apparently not enjoined on them by a god  as is usually the case  but appeared to have a genetic base .  the average zoon could no more tell a lie than breathe underwater and  in fact  the very concept was enough to upset them considerably  telling a lie meant no less than totally altering the universe .   this was something of a drawback to a trading race and so  over the millennia  the elders of the zoon studied this strange power that everyone else had in such abundance and decided that they should possess it too .   young men who showed faint signs of having such a talent were encouraged  on special ceremonial occasions  to bend the truth ever further on a competitive basis .  the first recorded zoon proto lie was     actually my grandfather is quite tall     but eventually they got the hang of it and the office of tribal liar was instituted .   it must be understood that while the majority of zoon cannot lie they have great respect for any zoon who can say that the world is other than it is  and the liar holds a position of considerable eminence .  he represents his tribe in all his dealings with the outside world  which the average zoon long ago gave up trying to understand .  zoon tribes are very proud of their liars .   other races get very annoyed about all this .  they feel that the zoon ought to have adopted more suitable titles  like    diplomat    or    public relations officer .     they feel they are poking fun at the whole thing .      is all that true .     said esk suspiciously  looking around the barge   s crowded cabin .      no     said amschat firmly .  his junior wife  who was cooking porridge over a tiny ornate stove  giggled .  his three children watched esk solemnly over the edge of the table .      don   t you ever tell the truth .         do you .     amschat grinned his goldmine grin  but his eyes were not smiling .     why do i find you on my fleeces .  amschat is no kidnapper .  there will be people at home who will worry  yesno .         i expect granny will come looking for me     said esk     but i don   t think she will worry much .  just be angry  i expect .  anyway  i   m going to ankh morpork .  you can put me off the ship              boat              if you like .  i don   t mind about the pike .         i can   t do that     said amschat .      was that a lie .         no .  there is wild country around us  robbers and   things .      esk nodded brightly .     that   s settled  then     she said .     i don   t mind sleeping in the fleeces .  and i can pay my way .  i can do       she hesitated  her unfinished sentence hung like a little curl of crystal in the air while discretion made a successful bid for control of her tongue .        helpful things     she finished lamely .   she was aware that amschat was looking slightly sideways at his senior wife  who was sewing by the stove .  by zoon tradition she wore nothing but black .  granny would have thoroughly approved .      what sort of helpful things .     he asked .     washing and sweeping  yesno .         if you like     said esk     or distillation using the bifold or triple alembic  the making of varnishes  glazes  creams  zuumchats and punes  the rendering of waxes  the manufacture of candles  the proper selection of seeds  roots and cuttings  and most preparations from the eighty marvelous herbs  i can spin  card  rett  flallow and weave on the hand  frame  harp and noble looms and i can knit if people start the wool on for me  i can read soil and rock  do carpentry up to the three way mortise and tenon  predict weather by means of beastsign and skyreck  make increase in bees  brew five types of mead  make dyes and mordants and pigments  including a fast blue  i can do most types of whitesmithing  mend boots  cure and fashion most leathers  and if you have any goats i can look after them .  i like goats .      amschat looked at her thoughtfully .  she felt she was expected to continue .      granny never likes to see people sitting around doing nothing     she offered .     she always says a girl who is good with her hands will never want for a living     she added  by way of further explanation .      or a husband  i expect     nodded amschat  weakly .      actually  granny had a lot to say about that           i bet she did     said amschat .  he looked at the senior wife  who nodded almost imperceptibly .      very well     he said .     if you can make yourself useful you can stay .  and can you play a musical instrument .      esk returned his steady gaze  not batting an eyelid .     probably .         and so esk  with the minimum of difficulty and only a little regret  left the ramtops and their weather and joined the zoons on their great trading journey down the ankh .   there were at least thirty barges with at least one sprawling zoon family on each  and no two vessels appeared to be carrying the same cargo  most of them were strung together  and the zoons simply hauled on the cable and stepped on to the next deck if they fancied a bit of socializing .   esk set up home in the fleeces .  it was warm  smelled slightly of granny   s cottage and  much more important  meant that she was undisturbed .   she was getting a bit worried about magic .   it was definitely getting out of control .  she wasn   t doing magic  it was just happening around her .  and she sensed that people probably wouldn   t be too happy if they knew .   it meant that if she washed up she had to clatter and splash at length to conceal the fact that the dishes were cleaning themselves .  if she did some darning she had to do it on some private part of the deck to conceal the fact that the edges of the hole raveled themselves together as if   as if by magic .  then she woke up on the second day of her voyage to find that several of the fleeces around the spot where she had hidden the staff had combed  carded and spun themselves into neat skeins during the night .   she put all thoughts of lighting fires out of her head .   there were compensations  though .  every sluggish turn of the great brown river brought new scenes .  there were dark stretches hemmed in with deep forest  through which the barges traveled in the dead center of the river with the men armed and the women below   except for esk  who sat listening with interest to the snortings and sneezings that followed them through the bushes on the banks .  there were stretches of farmland .  there were several towns much larger than ohulan .  there were even some mountains  although they were old and flat and not young and frisky like her mountains .  not that she was homesick  exactly  but sometimes she felt like a boat herself  drifting on the edge of an infinite rope but always attached to an anchor .   the barges stopped at some of the towns .  by tradition only the men went ashore  and only amschat  wearing his ceremonial lying hat  spoke to non zoons .  esk usually went with him .  he tried hinting that she should obey the unwritten rules of zoon life and stay afloat  but a hint was to esk what a mosquito bite was to the average rhino because she was already learning that if you ignore the rules people will  half the time  quietly rewrite them so that they don   t apply to you .   anyway  it seemed to amschat that when esk was with him he always got a very good price .  there was something about a small child squinting determinedly at them from behind his legs that made even market hardened merchants hastily conclude their business .   in fact  it began to worry him .  when a market broker in the walled town of zemphis offered him a bag of ultramarines in exchange for a hundred fleeces a voice from the level of his pockets said     they   re not ultramarines .         listen to the child .     said the broker  grinning .  amschat solemnly held one of the stones to his eye .      i am listening     he said     and they do indeed look like ultramarines .  they have the glit and shimmy .      esk shook her head .     they   re just spircles     she said .  she said it without thinking  and regretted it immediately as both men turned to stare at her .   amschat turned the stone over in his palm .  putting the chameleon spircle stones into a box with some real gems so that they appeared to change their hue was a traditional trick  but these had the true inner blue fire .  he looked up sharply at the broker .  amschat had been finely trained in the art of the lie .  he recognized the subtle signs  now that he came to think about it .      there seems to be a doubt     he said     but    tis easily resolved  we need only take them to the assayer in pine street because the world knows that spircles will dissolve in hypactic fluid  yesno .      the broker hesitated .  amschat had changed position slightly  and the set of his muscles suggested that any sudden movement on the broker   s part would see him flat in the dust .  and that damn child was squinting at him as though she could see through to the back of his mind .  his nerve broke .      i regret this unfortunate dispute     he said .     i had accepted the stones as ultramarines in good faith but rather than cause disharmony between us i will ask you to accept them as   as a gift  and for the fleeces may i offer this roseatte of the first sorting .      he took a small red stone from a tiny velvet pouch .  amschat hardly looked at it but  without taking his eyes off the man  passed it down to esk .  she nodded .   when the merchant had hurried off amschat took esk   s hand and half dragged her to the assayer   s stall  which was little more than a niche in the wall .  the old man took the smallest of the blue stones  listened to amschat   s hurried explanation  poured out a saucerful of hypactic fluid and dropped the stone in .  it frothed into nothingness .      very interesting     he said .  he took another stone in a tweezer and examined it under a glass .      they are indeed spircles  but remarkably fine specimens in their own right     he concluded .     they are by no means worthless  and i for example would be prepared to offer you   is there something wrong with the little girl   s eyes .      amschat nudged esk  who stopped trying out another look .         i would offer you  shall we say  two zats of silver .         shall we say five .     said amschat pleasantly .      and i would like to keep one of the stones     said esk .  the old man threw up his hands .      but they are mere curios .     he said .     of value only to a collector .         a collector may yet sell them to an unsuspecting purchaser as finest roseattes or ultramarines     said amschat     especially if he was the only assayer in town .      the assayer grumbled a bit at this  but at last they settled on three zats and one of the spircles on a thin silver chain for esk .   when they were out of earshot amschat handed her the tiny silver coins and said     these are yours .  you have earned them .  but       he hunkered down so that his eyes were on a level with hers        you must tell me how you knew the stones were false .      he looked worried  but esk sensed that he wouldn   t really like the truth .  magic made people uncomfortable .  he wouldn   t like it if she said simply  spircles are spircles and ultramarines are ultramarines  and though you may think they look the same that is because most people don   t use their eyes in the right way .  nothing can entirely disguise its true nature .   instead she said     the dwarves mine spircles near the village where i was born  and you soon learn to see how they blend light in a funny way .      amschat looked into her eyes for some time .  then he shrugged .      okay     he said .     fine .  well  i have some further business here .  why don   t you buy yourself some new clothes  or something .  i   d warn you against unscrupulous traders but  somehow  i don   t know  i don   t think you will have any trouble .      esk nodded .  amschat strode off through the market place .  at the first corner he turned  looked at her thoughtfully  and then disappeared among the crowds .   well  that   s the end of sailing  esk told herself .  he   s not quite sure but he   s going to be watching me now and before i know what   s happening the staff will be taken away and there   ll be all sorts of trouble .  why does everyone get so upset about magic .   she gave a philosophical sigh and set about exploring the possibilities of the town .   there was the question of the staff  though .  esk had rammed it deep among the fleeces  which were not going to be unloaded yet .  if she went back for it people would start asking questions  and she didn   t know the answers .   she found a convenient alleyway and scuttled down it until a deep doorway gave her the privacy she required .   if going back was out of the question then only one thing remained .  she held out a hand and closed her eyes .   she knew exactly what she wanted to do   it lay in front of her eyes .  the staff mustn   t come flying through the air  wrecking the barge and drawing attention to itself .  all she wanted  she told herself  was for there to be a slight change in the way the world was organized .  it shouldn   t be a world where the staff was in the fleeces  it should be a world where it was in her hand .  a tiny change  an infinitesimal alteration to the way things were .   if esk had been properly trained in wizardry she would have known that this was impossible .  all wizards knew how to move things about  starting with protons and working upward  but the important thing about moving something from a to z  according to basic physics  was that at some point it should pass through the rest of the alphabet .  the only way one could cause something to vanish at a and appear at z would be to shuffle the whole of reality sideways .  the problems this would cause didn   t bear thinking about .   esk  of course  had not been trained  and it is well known that a vital ingredient of success is not knowing that what you   re attempting can   t be done .  a person ignorant of the possibility of failure can be a halfbrick in the path of the bicycle of history .   as esk tried to work out how to move the staff the ripples spread out in the magical ether  changing the discworld in thousands of tiny ways .  most went entirely unnoticed .  perhaps a few grains of sand lay on their beaches in a slightly different position  or the occasional leaf hung on its tree in a marginally different way .  but then the wavefront of probability struck the edge of reality and rebounded like the slosh off the side of the pond which  meeting the laggard ripples coming the other way  caused small but important whirlpools in the very fabric of existence .  you can have whirlpools in the fabric of existence  because it is a very strange fabric .   esk was completely ignorant of all this  of course  but was quite satisfied when the staff dropped out of thin air into her hand .   it felt warm .   she looked at it for some time .  she felt that she ought to do something about it  it was too big  too distinctive  too inconvenient .  it attracted attention .      if i   m taking you to ankh morpork     she said thoughtfully     you   ve got to go in disguise .      a few late flickers of magic played around the staff  and then it went dark .   eventually esk solved the immediate problem by finding a stall in the main zemphis marketplace that sold broomsticks  buying the largest  carrying it back to her doorway  removing the handle and ramming the staff deep into the birch twigs .  it didn   t seem right to treat a noble object in this way  and she silently apologized to it .   it made a difference  anyway .  no one looked twice at a small girl carrying a broom .   she bought a spice pasty to eat while exploring  the stallholder carelessly shortchanged her  and only realized later that he had inexplicably handed over two silver pieces  also  rats mysteriously got in and ate all his stock during the night  and his grandmother was struck by lightning  .   the town was smaller than ohulan  and very different because it lay on the junction of three trade routes quite apart from the river itself .  it was built around one enormous square which was a cross between a permanent exotic traffic jam and a tent village .  camels kicked mules  mules kicked horses  horses kicked camels and they all kicked humans  there was a riot of colors  a din of noise  a nasal orchestration of smells and the steady  heady sound of hundreds of people working hard at making money .   one reason for the bustle was that over large parts of the continent other people preferred to make money without working at all  and since the disc had yet to develop a music recording industry they were forced to fall back on older  more traditional forms of banditry .   strangely enough these often involved considerable effort .  rolling heavy rocks to the top of cliffs for a decent ambush  cutting down trees to block the road  and digging a pit lined with spikes while still keeping a wicked edge on a dagger probably involved a much greater expenditure of thought and muscle than more socially acceptable professions but  nevertheless  there were still people misguided enough to endure all this  plus long nights in uncomfortable surroundings  merely to get their hands on perfectly ordinary large boxes of jewels .   so a town like zemphis was the place where caravans split  mingled and came together again  as dozens of merchants and travelers banded together for protection against the socially disadvantaged on the trails ahead .  esk  wandering unregarded amidst the bustle  learned all this by the simple method of finding someone who looked important and tugging on the hem of his coat .   this particular man was counting bales of tobacco and would have succeeded but for the interruption .      what .         i said  what happening here .      the man meant to say     push off and bother someone else .     he meant to give her a light cuff about the head .  so he was astonished to find himself bending down and talking seriously to a small  grubby faced child holding a large broomstick  which also  it seemed to him later  was in some indefinable way paying attention  .   he explained about the caravans .  the child nodded .      people all get together to travel .         precisely .         where to .         all sorts of places .  sto lat  pseudopolis   ankh morpork  of course           but the river goes there     said esk  reasonably .     barges .  the zoons .         ah  yes     said the merchant     but they charge high prices and they can   t carry everything and  anyway  no one trusts them much .         but they   re very honest .         huh  yes     he said .     but you know what they say  never trust an honest man .     he smiled knowingly .      who says that .         they do .  you know .  people     he said  a certain uneasiness entering his voice .      oh     said esk .  she thought about it .     they must be very silly     she said primly .     thank you  anyway .      he watched her wander off and got back to his counting .  a moment later there was another tug at his coat .      fiftysevenfiftysevenfiftysevenwell .     he said  trying not to lose his place .      sorry to bother you again     said esk     but those bale things           what about them fiftysevenfiftysevenfiftyseven .         well  are they supposed to have little white worm things in them .         fiftysev   what .     the merchant lowered his slate and stared at esk     what little worms .         wriggly ones .  white     added esk  helpfully .     all sort of burrowing about in the middle of the bales .         you mean tobacco threadworm .     he looked wild eyed at the stack of bales being unloaded by  now he came to think about it  a vendor with the nervous look of a midnight sprite who wants to get away before you find out what fairy gold turns into in the morning .     but he told me these had been well stored and   how do you know  anyway .      the child had disappeared among the crowds .  the merchant looked hard at the spot where she had been .  he looked hard at the vendor  who was grinning nervously .  he looked hard at the sky .  then took his sampling knife out of his pocket  stared at it for a moment  appeared to reach a decision  and sidled toward the nearest bale .   esk  meanwhile  had by random eavesdropping found the caravan being assembled for ankh morpork .  the trail boss was sitting at a table made up of a plank across two barrels .   he was busy .   he was talking to a wizard .   seasoned travelers know that a party setting out to cross possibly hostile country should have a fair number of swords in it but should definitely have a wizard in case there is any need for magic arts and  even if these do not become necessary  for lighting fires .  a wizard of the third rank or above does not expect to pay for the privilege of joining the party .  rather  he expects to be paid .  delicate negotiations were even now coming to a conclusion .      fair enough  master treatle  but what of the young man .     said the trail boss  one adab gander  an impressive figure in a trollhide jerkin  rakishly floppy hat and a leather kilt .     he   s no wizard  i can see .         he is in training     said treatle   a tall skinny wizard whose robes declared him to be a mage of the ancient and truly original brothers of the silver star  one of the eight orders of wizardry .      then no wizard he     said gander .     i know the rules  and you   re not a wizard unless you   ve got a staff .  and he hasn   t .         even now he travels to the unseen university for that small detail     said treatle loftily .  wizards parted with money slightly less readily than tigers parted with their teeth .   gander looked at the lad in question .  he had met a good many wizards in his time and considered himself a good judge and he had to admit that this boy looked like good wizard material .  in other words  he was thin  gangling  pale from reading disturbing books in unhealthy rooms  and had watery eyes like two lightly poached eggs .  it crossed gander   s mind that one must speculate in order to accumulate .   all he needs to get right to the top  he thought  is a bit of a handicap .  wizards are martyrs to things like asthma and flat feet  it somehow seems to give them their drive .      what   s your name  lad .     he said  as kindly as possible .      sssssssssssssss    said the boy .  his adam   s apple bobbed like a captive balloon .  he turned to his companion  full of mute appeal .      simon     said treatle .         imon     agreed simon  thankfully .      can you cast fireballs or whirling spells  such as might be hurled against an enemy .      simon looked sideways at treatle .      nnnnnnnnnn     he ventured .      my young friend follows higher magic than the mere hurling of sorceries     said the wizard .         o     said simon .   gander nodded .      well     he said     maybe you will indeed be a wizard  lad .  maybe when you have your fine staff you   ll consent to travel with me one time  yes .  i will make an investment in you  yes .         y           just nod     said gander  who was not naturally a cruel man .   simon nodded gratefully .  treatle and gander exchanged nods and then the wizard strode off  with his apprentice trailing behind under a weight of baggage .   gander looked down at the list in front of him and carefully crossed out    wizard .      a small shadow fell across the page .  he glanced up and gave an involuntary start .      well .     he said coldly .      i want to go to ankh morpork     said esk     please .  i   ve got some money .         go home to your mother  child .         no  really .  i want to seek my fortune .      gander sighed .     why are you holding that broomstick .     he said .   esk looked at it as though she had never seen it before .      everything   s got to be somewhere     she said .      just go home  my girl     said gander .     i   m not taking any runaways to ankh morpork .  strange things can happen to little girls in big cities .      esk brightened .     what sort of strange things .         look  i said go home  right .  now .      he picked up his chalk and went on ticking off items on his slate  trying to ignore the steady gaze that seemed to be boring through the top of his head .      i can be helpful     said esk  quietly .   gander threw down the chalk and scratched his chin irritably .      how old are you .     he said .      nine .         well  miss nine years old  i   ve got two hundred animals and a hundred people that want to go to ankh  and half of them hate the other half  and i   ve not got enough people who can fight  and they say the roads are pretty bad and the bandits are getting really cheeky up in the paps and the trolls are demanding a bigger bridge toll this year and there   s weevils in the supplies and i keep getting these headaches and where  in all this  do i need you .         oh     said esk .  she looked around the crowded square .     which one of these roads goes to ankh  then .         the one over there  with the gate .         thank you     she said gravely .     goodbye .  i hope you don   t have any more trouble and your head gets better .         right     said gander uncertainly .  he drummed his fingers on the tabletop as he watched esk walk away in the direction of the ankh road .  a long  winding road .  a road haunted by thieves and gnolls .  a road that wheezed through high mountain passes and crawled  panting  over deserts .      oh  bugger     he said  under his breath .     hey .  you .         granny weatherwax was in trouble .   first of all  she decided  she should never have allowed hilta to talk her into borrowing her broomstick .  it was elderly  erratic  would fly only at night and even then couldn   t manage a speed much above a trot .   its lifting spells had worn so thin that it wouldn   t even begin to operate until it was already moving at a fair lick .  it was  in fact  the only broomstick ever to need bump starting .   and it was while granny weatherwax  sweating and cursing  was running along a forest path holding the damn thing at shoulder height for the tenth time that she had found the bear trap .   the second problem was that a bear had found it first .  in fact this hadn   t been too much of a problem because granny  already in a bad temper  hit it right between the eyes with the broomstick and it was now sitting as far away from her as it was possible to get in a pit  and trying to think happy thoughts .   it was not a very comfortable night and the morning wasn   t much better for the party of hunters who  around dawn  peered over the edge of the pit .      about time  too     said granny .     get me out .      the startled heads withdrew and granny could hear a hasty whispered conversation .  they had seen the hat and broomstick .   finally a bearded head reappeared  rather reluctantly  as if the body it was attached to was being pushed forward .      um     it began     look  mother           i   m not a mother     snapped granny .     i   m certainly not your mother  if you ever had mothers  which i doubt .  if i was your mother i   d have run away before you were born .         it   s only a figure of speech     said the head reproachfully .      it   s a damned insult is what it is .      there was another whispered conversation .      if i don   t get out     said granny in ringing tones     there will be trouble .  do you see my hat  eh .  do you see it .      the head reappeared .      that   s the whole point  isn   t it .     it said .     i mean  what will there be if we let you out .  it seems less risky all around if we just sort of fill the pit in .  nothing personal  you understand .      granny realized what it was that was bothering her about the head .      are you kneeling down .     she said accusingly .     you   re not  are you .  you   re dwarves .      whisper  whisper .      well  what about it .     asked the head defiantly .     nothing wrong with that  is there .  what have you got against dwarves .         do you know how to repair broomsticks .         magic broomsticks .         yes .      whisper  whisper .      what if we do .         well  we could come to some arrangement           the dwarf halls rang to the sound of hammers  although mainly for effect .  dwarves found it hard to think without the sound of hammers  which they found soothing  so well off dwarves in the clerical professions paid goblins to hit small ceremonial anvils  just to maintain the correct dwarvish image .   the broomstick lay between two trestles .  granny weatherwax sat on a rock outcrop while a dwarf half her height  wearing an apron that was a mass of pockets  walked around the broom and occasionally poked it .   eventually he kicked the bristles and gave a long intake of breath  a sort of reverse whistle  which is the secret sign of craftsmen across the universe and means that something expensive is about to happen .      weellll     he said .     i could get the apprentices in to look at this  i could .  it   s an education in itself .  and you say it actually managed to get airborne .         it flew like a bird     said granny .   the dwarf lit a pipe .     i should very much like to see that bird     he said reflectively .     i should imagine it   s quite something to watch  a bird like that .         yes  but can you repair it .     said granny .     i   m in a hurry .      the dwarf sat down  slowly and deliberately .      as for repair     he said     well  i don   t know about repair .  rebuild  maybe .  of course  it   s hard to get the bristles these days even if you can find people to do the proper binding  and the spells need           i don   t want it rebuilt  i just want it to work properly     said granny .      it   s an early model  you see     the dwarf plugged on .     very tricky  those early models .  you can   t get the wood        he was picked up bodily until his eyes were level with granny   s .  dwarves  being magical in themselves as it were  are quite resistant to magic but her expression looked as though she was trying to weld his eyeballs to the back of his skull .      just repair it     she hissed .     please .         what  make a bodge job .     said the dwarf  his pipe clattering to the floor .      yes .         patch it up  you mean .  betray my training by doing half a job .         yes     said granny .  her pupils were two little black holes .      oh     said the dwarf .     right  then .         gander the trail boss was a worried man .   they were three mornings out from zemphis  making good time  and were climbing now toward the rocky pass through the mountains known as the paps of scilla  there were eight of them  gander often wondered who scilla had been  and whether he would have liked her  .   a party of gnolls had crept up on them during the night .  the nasty creatures  a variety of stone goblin  had slit the throat of a guard and must have been poised to slaughter the entire party .  only     only no one knew quite what had happened next .  the screams had woken them up  and by the time people had puffed up the fires and treatle the wizard had cast a blue radiance over the campsite the surviving gnolls were distant  spidery shadows  running as if all the legions of hell were after them .   judging by what had happened to their colleagues  they were probably right .  bits of gnolls hung from the nearby rocks  giving them a sort of jolly  festive air .  gander wasn   t particularly sorry about that   gnolls liked to capture travelers and practice hospitality of the red hot knife and bludgeon kind   but he was nervous of being in the same area as something that went through a dozen wiry and wickedly armed gnolls like a spoon through a lightly boiled egg but left no tracks .   in fact the ground was swept clean .   it had been a very long night  and the morning didn   t seem to be an improvement .  the only person more than half awake was esk  who had slept through the whole thing under one of the wagons and had complained only of odd dreams .   still  it was a relief to get away from that macabre sight .  gander considered that gnolls didn   t look any better inside than out .  he hated their guts .   esk sat on treatle   s wagon  talking to simon who was steering inexpertly while the wizard caught up with some sleep behind them .   simon did everything inexpertly .  he was really good at it .  he was one of those tall lads apparently made out of knees  thumbs and elbows .  watching him walk was a strain  you kept waiting for the strings to snap  and when he talked the spasm of agony on his face if he spotted an s or w looming ahead in the sentence made people instinctively say them for him .  it was worth it for the grateful look which spread across his acned face like sunrise on the moon .   at the moment his eyes were streaming with hay fever .      did you want to be a wizard when you were a little boy .      simon shook his head .     i just www              wanted              tto find out how things www              worked .            yes .  then someone in my village told the university and mmaster t treatle was sent to bring me .  i shall be a www              wizard              one day .  master treatle says i have an exceptional grasp of th theory .     simon   s damp eyes misted over and an expression almost of bliss drifted across his ravaged face .      he t tells me they   ve got thousands of b books in the library at unseen university     he said  in the voice of a man in love .     more b books than anyone could read in a lifetime .         i   m not sure i like books     said esk conversationally .     how can paper know things .  my granny says books are only good if the paper is thin .         no  that   s not right     said simon urgently .     books are full of www       he gulped air and gave her a pleading look .         words .        said esk  after a moment   s thought .         yes  and they can change th things .  th that   s wuwuw  that wuwuw   whha whha              what              i must f find .  i know it   s th there  somewhere in all the old books .  they ssss              say           there   s no new spells but i know that it   s there somewhere  hiding  the wwwwwuwu              words           yes  that no wiwiwi              wizard .        said esk  her face a frown of concentration .      yes  has ever found .     his eyes closed and he smiled a beatific smile and added     the words that will change the world .         what .         eh .     said simon  opening his eyes in time to stop the oxen wandering off the track .      you said all those wubbleyous .         i did .         i heard you .  try again .      simon took a deep breath .     the worworwor   the wuwuw       he said .     the wowowoo       he continued .      it   s no good  it   s gone     he said .     it happens sometimes  if i don   t think about it .  master treatle says i   m allergic to something .         allergic to double yous .         no  sisssisi              silly       said esk  generously .         there   s sososo              something              in the air  p pollen maybe  or g grass dust .  master treatle has tried to find the cause of it but no magic seems to h help it .      they were passing through a narrow pass of orange rock .  simon looked at it disconsolately .      my granny taught me some hay fever cures     esk said .     we could try those .      simon shook his head .  it looked touch and go whether it would fall off .      tried everything     he said .     fine wwiwwi   magician i   d make  eh  can   t even sss   utter the wowo   name .         i could see where that would be a problem     said esk .  she watched the scenery for a while  marshaling a train of thought .      is it  er  possible for a woman to be  you know  a wizard .     she said eventually .   simon stared at her .  she gave him a defiant look .   his throat strained .  he was trying to find a sentence that didn   t start with a w .  in the end he was forced to make concessions .      a curious idea     he said .  he thought some more  and started to laugh until esk   s expression warned him .      rather funny  really     he added  but the laughter in his face faded and was replaced by a puzzled look .     never really t thought about it  before .         well .  can they .     you could have shaved with esk   s voice .      of course they can   t .  it is self evident  child .  simon  return to your studies .      treatle pushed aside the curtain that led into the back of the wagon and climbed out on to the seat board .   the look of mild panic took up its familiar place on simon   s face .  he gave esk a pleading glance as treatle took the reins from his hands  but she ignored him .      why not .  what   s so self evident .      treatle turned and looked down at her .  he hadn   t really paid much attention before  she was simply just another figure around the campfires .   he was the vice chancellor of unseen university  and quite used to seeing vague scurrying figures getting on with essential but unimportant jobs like serving his meals and dusting his rooms .  he was stupid  yes  in the particular way that very clever people can be stupid  and maybe he had all the tact of an avalanche and was as self centered as a tornado  but it would never have occurred to him that children were important enough to be unkind to .   from long white hair to curly boots  treatle was a wizard   s wizard .  he had the appropriate long bushy eyebrows  spangled robe and patriarchal beard that was only slightly spoiled by the yellow nicotine stains  wizards are celibate but  nevertheless  enjoy a good cigar  .      it will all become clear to you when you grow up     he said .     it   s an amusing idea  of course  a nice play on words .  a female wizard .  you might as well invent a male witch .         warlocks     said esk .      pardon me .         my granny says men can   t be witches     said esk .     she says if men tried to be witches they   d be wizards .         she sounds a very wise woman     said treatle .      she says women should stick to what they   re good at     esk went on .      very sensible of her .         she says if women were as good as men they   d be a lot better .      treatle laughed .      she   s a witch     said esk  and added in her mind  there  what do you think of that  mr .  so called cleverwizard .      my dear good young lady  am i supposed to be shocked .  i happen to have a great respect for witches .      esk frowned .  he wasn   t supposed to say that .      you have .         yes indeed .  i happen to believe that witchcraft is a fine career  for a woman .  a very noble calling .         you do .  i mean  it is .         oh yes .  very useful in rural districts for  for people who are   having babies  and so forth .  however  witches are not wizards .  witchcraft is nature   s way of allowing women access to the magical fluxes  but you must remember it is not high magic .         i see .  not high magic     said esk grimly .      oh no .  witchcraft is very suitable for helping people through life  of course  but           i expect women aren   t really sensible enough to be wizards     said esk .     i expect that   s it  really .         i have nothing but the highest respect for women     said treatle  who hadn   t noticed the fresh edge to esk   s tone .     they are without parallel when  when           for having babies and so forth .         there is that  yes     the wizard conceded generously .     but they can be a little unsettling at times .  a little too excitable .  high magic requires great clarity of thought  you see  and women   s talents do not lie in that direction .  their brains tend to overheat .  i am sorry to say there is only one door into wizardry and that is the main gate at unseen university and no woman has ever passed through it .         tell me     said esk     what good is high magic  exactly .      treatle smiled at her .      high magic  my child     he said     can give us everything we want .         oh .         so put all this wizard nonsense out of your head  all right .     treatle gave her a benevolent smile .     what is your name  child .         eskarina .         and why do you go to ankh  my dear .         i thought i might seek my fortune     muttered esk     but i think perhaps girls don   t have fortunes to seek .  are you sure wizards give people what they want .         of course .  that is what high magic is for .         i see .      the whole caravan was traveling only a little faster than walking pace .  esk jumped down  pulled the staff from its temporary hiding place among the bags and pails on the side of the wagon  and ran back along the line of carts and animals .  through her tears she caught a glimpse of simon peering from the back of the wagon  an open book in his hands .  he gave her a puzzled smile and started to say something  but she ran on and veered off the track .   scrubby whinbushes scratched her legs as she scrambled up a clay bank and then she was running free across a barren plateau  hemmed in by the orange cliffs .   she didn   t stop until she was good and lost but the anger still burned brightly .  she had been angry before  but never like this  normally anger was like the red flame you got when the forge was first lit  all glow and sparks  but this anger was different   it had the bellows behind it  and had narrowed to the tiny blue white flame that cuts iron .   it made her body tingle .  she had to do something about it or burst .   why was it that when she heard granny ramble on about witchcraft she longed for the cutting magic of wizardry  but whenever she heard treatle speak in his high pitched voice she would fight to the death for witchcraft .  she   d be both  or none at all .  and the more they intended to stop her  the more she wanted it .   she   d be a witch and a wizard too .  and she would show them .   esk sat down under a low spreading juniper bush at the foot of a steep  sheer cliff  her mind seething with plans and anger .  she could sense doors being slammed before she had barely begun to open them .  treatle was right  they wouldn   t let her inside the university .  having a staff wasn   t enough to be a wizard  there had to be training too  and no one was going to train her .   the midday sun beat down off the cliff and the air around esk began to smell of bees and gin .  she lay back  looking at the near purple dome of the sky through the leaves and  eventually  she fell asleep .   one side effect of using magic is that one tends to have realistic and disturbing dreams .  there is a reason for this  but even thinking about it is enough to give a wizard nightmares .   the fact is that the minds of wizards can give thoughts a shape .  witches normally work with what actually exists in the world  but a wizard can  if he   s good enough  put flesh on his imagination .  this wouldn   t cause any trouble if it wasn   t for the fact that the little circle of candlelight loosely called    the universe of time and space    is adrift in something much more unpleasant and unpredictable .  strange things circle and grunt outside the flimsy stockades of normality  there are weird hootings and howlings in the deep crevices at the edge of time .  there are things so horrible that even the dark is afraid of them .   most people don   t know this and this is just as well because the world could not really operate if everyone stayed in bed with the blankets over their head  which is what would happen if people knew what horrors lay a shadow   s width away .   the problem is people interested in magic and mysticism spend a lot of time loitering on the very edge of the light  as it were  which gets them noticed by the creatures from the dungeon dimensions who then try to use them in their indefatigable efforts to break into this particular reality .   most people can resist this  but the relentless probing by the things is never stronger than when the subject is asleep .   bel shamharoth  c   hulagen  the insider   the hideous old dark gods of the necrotelicomnicon  the book known to certain mad adepts by its true name of liber paginarum fulvarum  are always ready to steal into a slumbering mind .  the nightmares are often colorful and always unpleasant .   esk had got used to them ever since that first dream after her first borrowing  and familiarity had almost replaced terror .  when she found herself sitting on a glittering  dusty plain under unexplained stars she knew it was time for another one .      drat     she said .     all right  come on then .  bring on the monsters .  i just hope it isn   t the one with his winkle on his face .      but this time it seemed that the nightmare had changed .  esk looked around and saw  rearing up behind her  a tall black castle .  its turrets disappeared among the stars .  lights and fireworks and interesting music cascaded from its upper battlements .  the huge double doors stood invitingly open .  there seemed to be quite an amusing party going on in there .   she stood up  brushed the silver sand off her dress  and set off for the gates .   she had almost reached them when they slammed .  they didn   t appear to move  it was simply that in one instant they were lounging ajar  and the next they were tight shut with a clang that shook the horizons .   esk reached out and touched them .  they were black  and so cold that ice was beginning to form on them .   there was a movement behind her .  she turned around and saw the staff  without its broomstick disguise  standing upright in the sand .  little worms of light crept around its polished wood and crept around the carvings no one could ever quite identify .   she picked it up and smashed it against the doors .  there was a shower of octarine sparks  but the black metal was unscathed .   esk   s eyes narrowed .  she held the staff at arm   s length and concentrated until a thin line of fire leapt from the wood and burst against the gate .  the ice flashed into steam but the darkness   she was sure now that it wasn   t metal   absorbed the power without so much as glowing .  she doubled the energy  letting the staff put all its stored magic into a beam that was now so bright that she had to shut her eyes  and could still see it as a brilliant line in her mind  .   then it winked out .   after a few seconds esk ran forward and touched the doors gingerly .  the coldness nearly froze her fingers off .   and from the battlements above she could hear the sound of sniggering .  laughter wouldn   t have been so bad  especially an impressive demonic laugh with lots of echo  but this was just   sniggering .   it went on for a long time .  it was one of the most unpleasant sounds esk had ever heard .      she woke up shivering .  it was long after midnight and the stars looked damp and chilly  the air was full of the busy silence of the night  which is created by hundreds of small furry things treading very carefully in the hope of finding dinner while avoiding being the main course .   a crescent moon was setting and a thin gray glow toward the rim of the world suggested that  against all probability  another day was on the cards .   someone had wrapped esk in a blanket .      i know you   re awake     said the voice of granny weatherwax .     you could make yourself useful and light a fire .  there   s damn all wood in these parts .      esk sat up  and clutched at the juniper bush .  she felt light enough to float away .      fire .     she muttered .      yes .  you know .  pointing the finger and whoosh     said granny sourly .  she was sitting on a rock  trying to find a position that didn   t upset her arthritis .      i   i don   t think i can .         you tell me .     said granny cryptically .   the old witch leaned forward and put her hand on esk   s forehead  it was like being caressed by a sock full of warm dice .      you   re running a bit of a temperature     she added .     too much hot sun and cold ground .  that   s forn parts for you .      esk let herself slump forward until her head lay in granny   s lap  with its familiar smells of camphor  mixed herbs and a trace of goat .  granny patted her in what she hoped was a soothing way .   after a while esk said  in a low voice     they   re not going to allow me into the university .  a wizard told me  and i dreamed about it  and it was one of those true dreams .  you know  like you told me  a maty thing .         metterfor     said granny calmly .      one of them .         did you think it would be easy .     asked granny .     did you think you   d walk into their gates waving your staff .  here i am  i want to be a wizard  thank you very much .         he told me there   s no women allowed in the university .         he   s wrong .         no  i could tell he was telling the truth .  you know  granny  you can tell how           foolish child .  all you could tell was that he thought he was telling the truth .  the world isn   t always as people see it .         i don   t understand     said esk .      you   ll learn     said granny .     now tell me .  this dream .  they wouldn   t let you into their university  right .         yes  and they laughed .         and then you tried to burn down the doors .      esk turned her head in granny   s lap and opened a suspicious eye .      how did you know .      granny smiled  but as a lizard would smile .      i was miles away     she said .     i was bending my mind toward you  and suddenly you seemed to be everywhere .  you shone out like a beacon  so you did .  as for the fire   look around .      in the halflight of dawn the plateau was a mass of baked clay .  in front of esk the cliff was glassy and must have flowed like tar under the onslaught  there were great gashes across it which had dripped molten rock and slag .  when esk listened she could hear the faint    pink  pink    of cooling rock .      oh     she said     did i do that .         so it would appear     said granny .      but i was asleep .  i was only dreaming .         it   s the magic     said granny .     it   s trying to find a way out .  the witch magic and the wizard magic are  i don   t know  sort of feeding off each other .  i think .      esk bit her lip .      what can i do .     she asked .     i dream of all sorts of things .         well  for a start we   re going straight to the university     decided granny .     they must be used to apprentices not being able to control magic and having hot dreams  else the place would have burned down years ago .      she glanced toward the rim  and then down at the broomstick beside her .      we will pass over the running up and down  the tightening of the broomstick   s bindings  the muttered curses against dwarves  the brief moments of hope as the magic flickered fitfully  the horrible black feelings as it died  the tightening of the bindings again  the running again  the sudden catching of the spell  the scrambling aboard  the yelling  the takeoff     esk clung to granny with one hand and held her staff in the other as they  frankly  pottered along a few hundred feet above the ground .  a few birds flew alongside them  interested in this new flying tree .      bugger off .     screamed granny  taking off her hat and flapping it .      we   re not going very fast  granny     said esk meekly .      we   re going quite fast enough for me .      esk looked around .  behind them the rim was a blaze of gold  barred with cloud .      i think we ought to go lower  granny     she said urgently .     you said the broomstick won   t fly in sunlight .     she glanced down at the landscape below them .  it looked sharp and inhospitable .  it also looked expectant .      i know what i   m doing  miss     snapped granny  gripping the broomstick hard and trying to make herself as light as possible .   it has already been revealed that light on the discworld travels slowly  the result of its passage through the disc   s vast and ancient magical field .   so dawn isn   t the sudden affair that it is on other worlds .  the new day doesn   t erupt  it sort of sloshes gently across the sleeping landscape in the same way that the tide sneaks in across the beach  melting the sandcastles of the night .  it tends to flow around mountains .  if the trees are close together it comes out of woods cut to ribbons and sliced with shadows .   an observer on some suitable high point  let   s say for the sake of argument a wisp of cirro stratus on the edge of space  would remark on how lovingly the light spreads across the land  how it leaps forward on the plains and slows down when it encounters high ground  how beautifully it     actually  there are some kinds of observers who  faced with all this beauty  will whine that you can   t have heavy light and certainly wouldn   t be able to see it  even if you could .  to which one can only reply  so how come you   re standing on a cloud .   so much for cynicism .  but down on the disc itself the broomstick barreled forward on the cusp of dawn  dropping ever backward in the shadow of night .      granny .      day burst upon them .  ahead of the broomstick the rocks seemed to flash into flame as the light washed over them .  granny felt the stick lurch and stared with horrified fascination at the little scudding shadow below them .  it was getting closer .      what will happen when we hit the ground .         that depends if i can find some soft rocks     said granny in a preoccupied voice .      the broomstick   s going to crash .  can   t we do anything .         well  i suppose we could get off .         granny     said esk  in the exasperated and remarkably adult voice children use to berate their wayward elders .     i don   t think you quite understand .  i don   t want to hit the ground .  it   s never done anything to me .      granny was trying to think of a suitable spell and regretting that headology didn   t work on rocks  and had she detected the diamond edge to esk   s tone perhaps she wouldn   t have said     tell the broomstick that  then .      and they would indeed have crashed .  but she remembered in time to grab her hat and brace herself .  the broomstick gave a shudder  tilted        and the landscape blurred .      it was really quite a short trip but one that granny knew she would always remember  generally around three o   clock in the morning after eating rich food .  she would remember the rainbow colors that hummed in the rushing air  the horrible heavy feeling  the impression that something very big and heavy was sitting on the universe .   she would remember esk   s laughter .  she would remember  despite her best efforts  the way the ground sped below them  whole mountain ranges flashing past with nasty zipping noises .   most of all  she would remember catching up with the night .   it appeared ahead of her  a ragged line of darkness running ahead of the remorseless morning .  she stared in horrified fascination as the line became a blot  a stain  a whole continent of blackness that raced toward them .   for an instant they were poised on the crest of the dawn as it broke in silent thunder on the land .  no surfer ever rode such a wave  but the broomstick broke through the broil of light and shot smoothly through into the coolness beyond .   granny let herself breathe out .   darkness took some of the terror out of the flight .  it also meant that if esk lost interest the broomstick ought to be able to fly under its own rather rusty magic .       .     granny said  and cleared her bone dry throat for a second try .     esk .         this is fun  isn   t it .  i wonder how i make it happen .         yes  fun     said granny weakly .     but can i fly the stick  please .  i don   t want us to go over the edge .  please .         is it true that there   s a giant waterfall all around the edge of the world  and you can look down and see stars .     said esk .      yes .  can we slow down now .         i   d like to see it .         no .  i mean  no  not now .      the broomstick slowed .  the rainbow bubble around it vanished with an audible pop .  without a jolt  without so much as a shudder  granny found herself flying at a respectable speed again .   granny had built a solid reputation on always knowing the answer to everything .  getting her to admit ignorance  even to herself  was an astonishing achievement .  but the worm of curiosity was chewing at the apple of her mind .      how     she said at last     did you do that .      there was a thoughtful silence behind her .  then esk said     i don   t know .  i just needed it  and it was in my head .  like when you remember something you   ve forgotten .         yes  but how .         i   i don   t know .  i just had a picture of how i wanted things to be  and  and i  sort of   went into the picture .      granny stared into the night .  she had never heard of magic like that  but it sounded awfully powerful and probably lethal .  went into the picture .  of course  all magic changed the world in some way  wizards thought there was no other use for it   they didn   t truck with the idea of leaving the world as it was and changing the people   but this sounded more literal .  it needed thinking about .  on the ground .   for the first time in her life granny wondered whether there might be something important in all these books people were setting such store by these days  although she was opposed to books on strict moral grounds  since she had heard that many of them were written by dead people and therefore it stood to reason reading them would be as bad as necromancy .  among the many things in the infinitely varied universe with which granny did not hold was talking to dead people  who by all accounts had enough troubles of their own .   but not  she was inclined to feel  as many as she had .  she looked down bemusedly at the dark ground and wondered vaguely why the stars were below her .   for a cardiac moment she wondered if they had indeed flown over the edge  and then she realized that the thousands of little pinpoints below her were too yellow  and flickered .  besides  whoever heard of stars arranged in such a neat pattern .      it   s very pretty     said esk .     is it a city .      granny scanned the ground wildly .  if it was a city  then it was too big .  but now she had time to think about it  it certainly smelled like a lot of people .   the air around them reeked of incense and grain and spices and beer  but mainly of the sort of smell that was caused by a high water table  thousands of people  and a robust approach to drainage .   she mentally shook herself .  the day was hard on their heels .  she looked for an area where the torches were dim and widely spaced  reasoning that this would mean a poor district and poor people did not object to witches  and gently pointed the broom handle downward .   she managed to get within five feet of the ground before dawn arrived for the second time .      the gates were indeed big and black and looked as if they were made out of solid darkness .   granny and esk stood among the crowds that thronged the square outside the university and stared up at them .  finally esk said     i can   t see how people get in .         magic  i expect     said granny sourly .     that   s wizards for you .  anyone else would have bought a doorknocker .      she waved her broomstick in the direction of the tall doors .      you   ve got to say some hocuspocus word to get in  i shouldn   t wonder     she added .   they had been in ankh morpork for three days and granny was beginning to enjoy herself  much to her surprise .  she had found them lodgings in the shades  an ancient part of the city whose inhabitants were largely nocturnal and never inquired about one another   s business because curiosity not only killed the cat but threw it in the river with weights tied to its feet .  the lodgings were on the top floor next to the well guarded premises of a respectable dealer in stolen property because  as granny had heard  good fences make good neighbors .   the shades  in brief  were an abode of discredited gods and unlicensed thieves  ladies of the night and peddlers in exotic goods  alchemists of the mind and strolling mummers  in short  all the grease on civilization   s axle .   and yet  despite the fact that these people tend to appreciate the soft magics  there was a remarkable shortage of witches .  within hours the news of granny   s arrival had seeped through the quarter and a stream of people crept  sidled or strutted toward her door  seeking potions and charms and news of the future and various personal and specialized services that witches traditionally provide for those whose lives are a little clouded or full of stormy weather .   she was at first annoyed  and then embarrassed  and then flattered  her clients had money  which was useful  but they also paid in respect  and that was a rock hard currency .   in short  granny was even wondering about the possibility of acquiring slightly larger premises with a bit of garden and sending for her goats .  the smell might be a problem  but the goats would just have to put up with it .   they had visited the sights of ankh morpork  its crowded docks  its many bridges  its souks  its casbahs  its streets lined with nothing but temples .  granny had counted the temples with a thoughtful look in her eyes  gods were always demanding that their followers acted other than according to their true natures  and the human fallout this caused made plenty of work for witches .   the terrors of civilization had so far failed to materialize  although a cutpurse had tried to make off with granny   s handbag .  to the amazement of passersby granny called him back  and back he came  fighting his feet which had totally ceased to obey him .  no one quite saw what happened to her eyes when she stared into his face or heard the words she whispered in his cowering ear  but he gave her back all her money plus quite a lot of money belonging to other people  and before she let him go had promised to have a shave  stand up straight  and be a better person for the rest of his life .  by nightfall granny   s description was circulated to all the chapter houses of the guild of thieves  cutpurses  housebreakers and allied trades   with strict instructions to avoid her at all costs .  thieves  being largely creatures of the night themselves  know trouble when it stares them in the face .   granny had also written two more letters to the university .  there had been no reply .      i liked the forest best     said esk .         i dunno     said granny .     this is a bit like the forest  really .  anyway  people certainly appreciate a witch here .         they   re very friendly     esk conceded .     you know the house down the street  where that fat lady lives with all those young ladies you said were her relatives .         mrs .  palm     said granny cautiously .     very respectable lady .         people come to visit them all night long .  i watched .  i   m surprised they get any sleep .         um     said granny .      it must be a trial for the poor woman with all those daughters to feed  too .  i think people could be more considerate .         well now     said granny     i   m not sure that        she was rescued by the arrival at the gates of the university of a large  brightly painted wagon .  its driver reined in the oxen a few feet from granny and said     excuse me  my good woman  but would you be so kind as to move  please .      granny stepped aside  affronted by this display of down right politeness and particularly upset at being thought of as anyone   s good woman  and the driver saw esk .   it was treatle .  he grinned like a worried snake .      i say .  it   s the young lady who thinks women should be wizards  isn   t it .         yes     said esk  ignoring a sharp kick on the ankle from granny .      what fun .  come to join us  have you .         yes     said esk  and then because something about treatle   s manner seemed to demand it  she added     sir .  only we can   t get in .         we .     said treatle  and then glanced at granny     oh  yes  of course .  this would be your aunt .         my granny .  only not really my granny  just sort of everyone   s granny .      granny gave a stiff nod .      well  we cannot have this     said treatle  in a voice as hearty as a plum pudding .     my word  no .  our first lady wizard left on the doorstep .  that would be a disgrace .  may i accompany you .      granny grasped esk firmly by the shoulder .      if it   s all the same to you       she began .  but esk twisted out of her grip and ran toward the cart .      you can really take me in .     she said  her eyes shining .      of course .  i am sure the heads of the orders will be most gratified to meet you .  most astonished and astounded     he said  and gave a little laugh .      eskarina smith       said granny  and then stopped .  she looked at treatle .      i don   t know what is in your mind  mr .  wizard  but i don   t like it     she said .     esk  you know where we live .  be a fool if you must  but you might at least be your own fool .      she turned on her heel and strode off across the square .      what a remarkable woman     said treatle  vaguely .     i see you still have your broomstick .  capital .      he let go of the reins for a moment and made a complicated sign in the air with both hands .   the big doors swung back  revealing a wide courtyard surrounded by lawns .  behind them was a great rambling building  or buildings  it was hard to tell  because it didn   t look so much as if it had been designed as that a lot of buttresses  arches  towers  bridges  domes  cupolas and so forth had huddled together for warmth .      is that it .     said esk .     it looks sort of   melted .         yes  that   s it     said treatle .     alma mater  gaudy armors eagle tour and so on .  of course  it   s a lot bigger inside than out  like an iceberg or so i   m given to understand  i   ve never seen the things .  unseen university  only of course a lot of it is unseen .  just go in the back and fetch simon  will you .      esk pushed aside the heavy curtains and peered into the back of the wagon .  simon was lying on a pile of rugs  reading a very large book and making notes on scraps of paper .   he looked up  and gave her a worried smile .      is that you .     he said .      yes     said esk  with conviction .      we thought you   d left us .  everyone thought you were riding with everyone else and then wwwwhen we stopped           i sort of caught up .  i think mr .  treatle wants you to come and look at the university .         we   re here .     he said  and gave her an odd look     you   re here .         yes .         how .         mr .  treatle invited me in  he said everyone would be astounded to meet me .     uncertainty flashed a fin in the depths of her eyes .     was he right .      simon looked down at his book  and dabbed at his running eyes with a red handkerchief .          he has t these little f fancies     he muttered     bbbut he   s not a bad person .      bewildered  esk looked down at the yellowed pages open in front of the boy .  they were full of complicated red and black symbols which in some inexplicable way were as potent and unpleasant as a ticking parcel  but which nevertheless drew the eye in the same way that a really bad accident does .  one felt that one would like to know their purpose  while at the same time suspecting that if you found out you would really prefer not to have done .   simon saw her expression and hastily shut the book .      just some magic     he mumbled .     something i   m wwwww              working       said esk  automatically .      thank you .  on .         it must be quite interesting  reading books     said esk .      sort of .  can   t you read  esk .      the astonishment in his voice stung her .      i expect so     she said defiantly .     i   ve never tried .         esk wouldn   t have known what a collective noun was if it had spat in her eye  but she knew there was a herd of goats and a coven of witches .  she didn   t know what you called a lot of wizards .  an order of wizards .  a conspiracy .  a circle .   whatever it was  it filled the university .  wizards strolled among the cloisters and sat on benches under the trees .  young wizards scuttled along pathways as bells rang  with their arms full of books or   in the case of senior students   with their books flapping through the air after them .  the air had the greasy feel of magic and tasted of tin .   esk walked along between treatle and simon and drank it all in .  it wasn   t just that there was magic in the air  but it was tamed and working  like a millrace .  it was power  but it was harnessed .   simon was as excited as she was  but it showed only because his eyes watered more and his stutter got worse .  he kept stopping to point out the various colleges and research buildings .   one was quite low and brooding  with high narrow windows .      t that   s the l l library     said simon  his voice bursting with wonder and respect .     can i have a l l look .         plenty of time for that later     said treatle .  simon gave the building a wistful look .      all the b books of magic ever written     he whispered .      why are the windows barred .     said esk .   simon swallowed .     um  b because b books of m magic aren   t like other b books  they lead a           that   s enough     snapped treatle .  he looked down at esk as if he had just noticed her  and frowned .      why are you here .         you invited me in     said esk .      me .  oh yes .  of course .  sorry  mind wandering .  the young lady who wants to be a wizard .  let us see  shall we .      he led the way up a broad flight of steps to an impressive pair of doors .  at least  they were designed to be impressive .  the designer had invested deeply in heavy locks  curly hinges  brass studs and an intricately carved archway to make it absolutely clear to anyone entering that they were not very important people at all .   he was a wizard .  he had forgotten the doorknocker .   treatle rapped on the door with his staff .  it hesitated for a while  and then slowly slid back its bolts and swung open .   the hall was full of wizards and boys .  and boys    parents .   there are two ways of getting into unseen university  in fact there are three  but at this time wizards hadn   t realized it  .   the first is to achieve some great work of magic  such as the recovery of an ancient and powerful relic or the invention of a totally new spell  but in these times it was seldom done .  in the past there had been great wizards capable of forming whole new spells from the chaotic raw magic of the world  wizards from whom as it were all the spells of wizardry had flowed  but those days had gone  there were no more sorcerers .   so the more typical method was to be sponsored by a senior and respected wizard  after a suitable period of apprenticeship .   competition was stiff for a university place and the honor and privileges an unseen degree could bring .  many of the boys milling around the hall  and launching minor spells at each other  would fail and have to spend their lives as lowly magicians  mere magical technologists with defiant beards and leather patches on their elbows who congregated in small jealous groups at parties .   not for them the coveted pointy hat with optional astrological symbols  or the impressive robes  or the staff of authority .  but at least they could look down on conjurers  who tended to be jolly and fat and inclined to drop their aitches and drink beer and go around with sad thin women in spangly tights and really infuriate magicians by not realizing how lowly they were and kept telling them jokes .  lowliest of all   apart from witches  of course   were thaumaturgists  who never got any schooling at all .  a thaumaturgist could just about be trusted to wash out an alembic .  many spells required things like mold from a corpse dead of crushing  or the semen of a living tiger  or the root of a plant that gave an ultrasonic scream when it was uprooted .  who was sent to get them .  right .   it is a common error to refer to the lower magical ranks as hedge wizards .  in fact hedge wizardry is a very honored and specialized form of magic that attracts silent  thoughtful men of the druidical persuasion and topiaric inclinations .  if you invited a hedge wizard to a party he would spend half the evening talking to your potted plant .  and he would spend the other half listening .   esk noticed that there were some women in the hall  because even young wizards had mothers and sisters .  whole families had turned up to bid the favored sons farewell .  there was a considerable blowing of noses  wiping of tears and the clink of coins as proud fathers tucked a little spending money into their offspring   s hands .   very senior wizards were perambulating among the crowds  talking to the sponsoring wizards and examining the prospective students .   several of them pushed through the throng to meet treatle  moving like gold trimmed galleons under full sail .  they bowed gravely to him and looked approvingly at simon .      this is young simon  is it .     said the fattest of them  beaming at the boy .     we   ve heard great reports of you  young man .  eh .  what .         simon  bow to archchancellor cutangle  archmage of the wizards of the silver star     said treatle .  simon bowed apprehensively .   cutangle looked at him benevolently .     we   ve heard great things about you  my boy     he said .     all this mountain air must be good for the brain  eh .      he laughed .  the wizards around him laughed .  treatle laughed .  which esk thought was rather funny  because there wasn   t anything particularly amusing happening .      i ddddon   t know  ssss           from what we hear it must be the only thing you don   t know  lad .     said cutangle  his jowls waggling .  there was another carefully timed bout of laughter .   cutangle patted simon on the shoulder .      this is the scholarship boy     he said .     quite astounding results  never seen better .  self taught  too .  astonishing  what .  isn   t that so  treatle .         superb  archchancellor .      cutangle looked around at the watching wizards .      perhaps you could give us a sample     he said .     a little demonstration  perhaps .      simon looked at him in animal panic .      a actually i   m not very g g g           now  now     said cutangle  in what he probably really did think was an encouraging tone of voice .     do not be afraid .  take your time .  when you are ready .      simon licked his dry lips and gave treatle a look of mute appeal .      um     he said     y you s s s s  .     he stopped and swallowed hard .     the f f f f        his eyes bulged .  the tears streamed from his eyes  and his shoulders heaved .   treatle patted him reassuringly on the back .      hay fever     he explained .     don   t seem to be able to cure it .  tried everything .      simon swallowed  and nodded .  he waved treatle away with his long white hands and closed his eyes .   for a few seconds nothing happened .  he stood with his lips moving soundlessly  and then silence spread out from him like candlelight .  ripples of noiselessness washed across the crowds in the hall  striking the walls with all the force of a blown kiss and then curling back in waves .  people watched their companions mouthing silently and then went red with effort when their own laughter was as audible as a gnat   s squeak .   tiny motes of light winked into existence around his head .  they whirled and spiraled in a complex three dimensional dance  and then formed a shape .   in fact it seemed to esk that the shape had been there all the time  waiting for her eyes to see it  in the same way that a perfectly innocent cloud can suddenly become  without changing in any way  a whale or a ship or a face .   the shape around simon   s head was the world .   that was quite clear  although the glitter and rush of the little lights blurred some of the detail .  but there was great a   tuin the sky turtle  with the four elephants on its back  and on them the disc itself .  there was the sparkle of the great waterfall around the edge of the world  and there at the very hub a tiny needle of rock that was the great mountain cori celesti  where the gods lived .   the image expanded and homed in on the circle sea and then on ankh itself  the little lights flowing away from simon and winking out of existence a few feet from his head .  now they showed the city from the air  rushing toward the watchers .  there was the university itself  growing larger .  there was the great hall        there were the people  watching silent and open mouthed  and simon himself  outlined in specks of silver light .  and a tiny sparkling image in the air around him  and that image contained an image and another and another     there was a feeling that the universe had been turned inside out in all dimensions at once .  it was a bloated  swollen sensation .  it sounded as though the whole world had said    gloop .      the walls faded .  so did the floor .  the paintings of former great mages  all scrolls and beards and slightly constipated frowns  vanished .  the tiles underfoot  a rather nice black and white pattern  evaporated   to be replaced by fine sand  gray as moonlight and cold as ice .  strange and unexpected stars glittered overhead  on the horizon were low hills  eroded not by wind or rain in this weatherless place but by the soft sandpaper of time itself .   no one else seemed to have noticed .  no one else  in fact  seemed alive .  esk was surrounded by people as still and silent as statues .   and they weren   t alone .  there were other   things   behind them  and more were appearing all the time .  they had no shape  or rather they seemed to be taking their shapes at random from a variety of creatures  they gave the impression that they had heard about arms and legs and jaws and claws and organs but didn   t really know how they all fitted together .  or didn   t care .  or were so hungry they hadn   t bothered to find out .   they made a sound like a swarm of flies .   they were the creatures out of her dreams  come to feed on magic .  she knew they weren   t interested in her now  except in the nature of an after dinner mint .  their whole concentration was focused on simon  who was totally unaware of their presence .   esk kicked him smartly on the ankle .   the cold desert vanished .  the real world rushed back .  simon opened his eyes  smiled faintly  and gently fell backward into esk   s arms .   a buzz went up from the wizards  and several of them started to clap .  no one seemed to have noticed anything odd  apart from the silver lights .   cutangle shook himself  and raised a hand to quell the crowd .      quite   astonishing     he said to treatle .     you say he worked it out all by himself .         indeed  lord .         no one helped him at all .         there was no one to help him     said treatle .     he was just wandering from village to village  doing small spells .  but only if people paid him in books or paper .      cutangle nodded .     it was no illusion     he said     yet he didn   t use his hands .  what was he saying to himself .  do you know .         he says it   s just words to make his mind work properly     said treatle  and shrugged .     i can   t understand half of what he says and that   s a fact .  he says he   s having to invent words because there aren   t any for the things he   s doing .      cutangle glanced sideways at his fellow mages .  they nodded .      it will be an honor to admit him to the university     he said .     perhaps you would tell him so when he wakes up .      he felt a tugging at his robe  and looked down .      excuse me     said esk .      hallo  young lady     said cutangle  in a sugarmouse voice .     have you come to see your brother enter the university .         he   s not my brother     said esk .  there were times when the world had seemed to be full of brothers  but this wasn   t one of them .      are you important .     she said .   cutangle looked at his colleagues  and beamed .  there were fashions in wizardry  just like anything else  sometimes wizards were thin and gaunt and talked to animals  the animals didn   t listen  but it   s the thought that counts  while at other times they tended toward the dark and saturnine  with little black pointed beards .  currently aldermanic was in .  cutangle swelled with modesty .      quite important     he said .     one does one   s best in the service of one   s fellow man .  yes .  quite important  i would say .         i want to be a wizard     said esk .   the lesser wizards behind cutangle stared at her as if she was a new and interesting kind of beetle .  cutangle   s face went red and his eyes bulged .  he looked down at esk and seemed to be holding his breath .  then he started to laugh .  it started somewhere down in his extensive stomach regions and worked its way up  echoing from rib to rib and causing minor wizard quakes across his chest until it burst forth in a series of strangled snorts .  it was quite fascinating to watch  that laugh .  it had a personality all of its own .   but he stopped when he saw esk   s stare .  if the laugh was a music hall clown then esk   s determined squint was a white wash bucket on a fast trajectory .      a wizard .     he said     you want to be a wizard .         yes     said esk  pushing the dazed simon into treatle   s reluctant arms .     i   m the eighth son of an eighth son .  i mean daughter .      the wizards around her were looking at one another and whispering .  esk tried to ignore them .      what did she say .         is she serious .         i always think children are so delightful at that age  don   t you .         you   re the eighth son of an eighth daughter .     said cutangle .     really .         the other way around  only not exactly     said esk  defiantly .   cutangle dabbed his eyes with a handkerchief .      this is quite fascinating     he said .     i don   t think i   ve ever heard of something quite like this before .  eh .      he looked around at his growing audience .  the people at the back couldn   t see esk and were craning to check if some interesting magic was going on .  cutangle was at a loss .      well  now     he said .     you want to be a wizard .         i keep telling everyone but no one seems to listen     said esk .      how old are you  little girl .         nearly nine .         and you want to be a wizard when you grow up .         i want to be a wizard now     said esk firmly .     this is the right place  isn   t it .      cutangle looked at treatle and winked .      i saw that     said esk .      i don   t think there   s ever been a lady wizard before     said cutangle .     i rather think it might be against the lore .  wouldn   t you rather be a witch .  i understand it   s a fine career for girls .      a minor wizard behind him started to laugh .  esk gave him a look .      being a witch is quite good     she conceded .     but i think wizards have more fun .  what do you think .         i think you are a very singular little girl     said cutangle .      what does that mean .         it means there   s only one of you     said treatle .      that   s right     said esk     and i still want to be a wizard .      words failed cutangle .     well  you can   t     he said .     the very idea .      he drew himself up to his full width and turned away .  something tugged at his robe .      why not .     said a voice .   he turned .      because     he said  slowly and deliberately     because   the whole idea is completely laughable  that   s why .  and it   s absolutely against the lore .         but i can do wizard magic .     said esk  the faintest suggestion of a tremble in her voice .   cutangle bent down until his face was level with hers .      no you can   t     he hissed .     because you are not a wizard .  women aren   t wizards  do i make myself clear .         watch     said esk .   she extended her right hand with the fingers spread and sighted along it until she spotted the statue of malich the wise  the founder of the university .  instinctively the wizards between her and it edged out of the way  and then felt rather silly .      i mean it     she said .      go away  little girl     said cutangle .      right     said esk .  she squinted hard at the statue and concentrated        the great doors of unseen university are made of octiron  a metal so unstable that it can only exist in a universe saturated with raw magic .  they are impregnable to all force save magic  no fire  no battering ram  no army can breach them .   which is why most ordinary visitors to the university use the back door  which is made of perfectly normal wood and doesn   t go around terrorizing people  or even stand still terrorizing people .  it had a proper knocker and everything .   granny examined the doorposts carefully and gave a grunt of satisfaction when she spotted what she was looking for .  she hadn   t doubted that it would be there  cunningly concealed by the natural grain of the wood .   she grasped the knocker  which was shaped like a dragon   s head  and rapped smartly  three times .  after a while the door was opened by a young woman with her mouth full of clothes pegs .      ot oo oo ont .     she inquired .   granny bowed  giving the girl a chance to take in the pointy black hat with the batwing hatpins .  it had an impressive effect  she blushed and  peering out into the quiet alleyway  hurriedly motioned granny inside .   there was a big mossy courtyard on the other side of the wall  crisscrossed with washing lines .  granny had the chance to become one of the very few women to learn what it really is that wizards wear under their robes  but modestly averted her eyes and followed the girl across the flagstones and down a wide flight of steps .   they led into a long  high tunnel lined with archways and  currently  full of steam .  granny caught sight of long lines of washtubs in the big rooms off to the sides  the air had the warm fat smell of ironing .  a gaggle of girls carrying wash baskets pushed past her and hurried up the steps   then stopped  halfway up  and turned slowly to look at her .   granny set her shoulders back and tried to look as mysterious as possible .   her guide  who still hadn   t got rid of her clothes pegs  led her down a side passage into a room that was a maze of shelves piled with laundry .  in the very center of the maze  sitting at a table  was a very fat woman with a ginger wig .  she had been writing in a very large laundry book   it was still open in front of her   but was currently inspecting a large stained vest .      have you tried bleaching .     she asked .      yes  m   m     said the maid beside her .      what about tincture of myrryt .         yes  m   m .  it just turned it blue  m   m .         well  it   s a new one on me     said the laundry woman .     and ay   ve seen brimstone and soot and dragon blood and demon blood and aye don   t know what else .     she turned the vest over and read the nametape carefully sewn inside .     hmm .  granpone the white .  he   s going to be granpone the gray if he doesn   t take better care of his laundry .  aye tell you  girl  a white magician is just a black magician with a good housekeeper .  take it        she caught sight of granny  and stopped .      ee ocked hat hee oor     said granny   s guide  dropping a hurried curtsy .     oo ed hat           yes  yes  thank you  ksandra  you may go     said the fat woman .  she stood up and beamed at granny  and with an almost perceptible click wound her voice up several social classes .      pray hexcuse us     she said .     you find us hall at sixes and sevens  it being washing day and heverything .  his this a courtesy call or may i make so bold as to ask       she lowered her voice      his there a message from the hother sade .      granny looked blank  but only a fraction of a second .  the witchmarks on the doorpost had said that the housekeeper welcomed witches and was particularly anxious for news of her four husbands  she was also in random pursuit of a fifth  hence the ginger wig and  if granny   s ears weren   t deceiving her  the creak of enough whalebone to infuriate an entire ecology movement .  gullible and foolish  the signs had said .  granny withheld judgment  because city witches didn   t seem that bright themselves .   the housekeeper must have mistaken her expression .      don   t be afraid     she said .     may staff have distinct instructions to welcome witches  although of course they upstairs don   t approve .  no doubt you would like a cup of tea and something to eat .      granny bowed solemnly .      and aye will see if we can   t find a nice bundle of old clothes for you  too     the housekeeper beamed .      old clothes .  oh .  yes .  thank you  m   m .      the housekeeper swept forward with a sound like an elderly tea clipper in a gale  and beckoned granny to follow her .      aye   ll have the tea brought to my flat .  tea with a lot of tea leaves .      granny stumped along after her .  old clothes .  did this fat woman really mean it .  the nerve .  of course  if they were good quality     there seemed to be a whole world under the university .  it was a maze of cellars  coldrooms  stillrooms  kitchens and sculleries  and every inhabitant was either carrying something  pumping something  pushing something or just standing around and shouting .  granny caught glimpses of rooms full of ice  and others glowing with the heat from red hot cooking stoves  wall sized .  bakeries smelled of new bread and taprooms smelled of old beer .  everything smelled of sweat and wood smoke .   the housekeeper led her up an old spiral staircase and unlocked the door with one of the large number of keys that hung from her belt .   the room inside was pink and frilly .  there were frills on things that no one in their right mind would frill .  it was like being inside candyfloss .      very nice     said granny .  and  because she felt it was expected of her     tasteful .     she looked around for something unfrilly to sit on  and gave up .      whatever am aye thinking of .     the housekeeper trilled .     aye   m mrs .  whitlow but i expect you know  of course .  and aye have the honor to be addressing    .         eh .  oh  granny weatherwax     said granny .  the frills were getting to her .  they gave pink a bad name .      ay   m psychic myself  of course     said mrs .  whitlow .      granny had nothing against fortune telling provided it was done badly by people with no talent for it .  it was a different matter if people who ought to know better did it  though .  she considered that the future was a frail enough thing at best  and if people looked at it hard they changed it .  granny had some quite complex theories about space and time and why they shouldn   t be tinkered with  but fortunately good fortune tellers were rare and anyway people preferred bad fortune tellers  who could be relied upon for the correct dose of uplift and optimism .   granny knew all about bad fortune telling .  it was harder than the real thing .  you needed a good imagination .   she couldn   t help wondering if mrs .  whitlow was a born witch who somehow missed her training .  she was certainly laying siege to the future .  there was a crystal ball under a sort of pink frilly tea cozy  and several sets of divinatory cards  and a pink velvet bag of rune stones  and one of those little tables on wheels that no prudent witch would touch with a ten foot broomstick  and   granny wasn   t sure on this point   either some special dried monkey turds from a llamassary or some dried llama turds from a monastery  which apparently could be thrown in such a way as to reveal the sum total of knowledge and wisdom in the universe .  it was all rather sad .      or there   s the tea leaves  of course     said mrs .  whitlow  indicating the big brown pot on the table between them .     aye know witches often prefer them  but they always seem so  well  common to me .  no offense meant .      there probably wasn   t any offense meant  at that  thought granny .  mrs .  whitlow was giving her the sort of look generally used by puppies when they   re not sure what to expect next  and are beginning to worry that it may be the rolled up newspaper .   she picked up mrs .  whitlow   s cup and had started to peer into it when she caught the disappointed expression that floated across the housekeeper   s face like a shadow across a snowfield .  then she remembered what she was doing  and turned the cup widdershins three times  made a few vague passes over it and mumbled a charm  which she normally used to cure mastitis in elderly goats  but never mind  .  this display of obvious magical talent seemed to cheer up mrs .  whitlow no end .   granny wasn   t normally very good at tea leaves  but she squinted at the sugar encrusted mess at the bottom of the cup and let her mind wander .  what she really needed now was a handy rat or even a cockroach that happened to be somewhere near esk  so that she could borrow its mind .   what granny actually found was that the university had a mind of its own .      it is well known that stone can think  because the whole of electronics is based on that fact  but in some universes men spend ages looking for other intelligences in the sky without once looking under their feet .  that is because they   ve got the time span all wrong .  from stone   s point of view the universe is hardly created and mountain ranges are bouncing up and down like organ stops while continents zip backward and forward in general high spirits  crashing into each other from the sheer joy of momentum and getting their rocks off .  it is going to be quite some time before stone notices its disfiguring little skin disease and starts to scratch  which is just as well .   the rocks from which unseen university was built  however  have been absorbing magic for several thousand years and all that random power has had to go somewhere .   the university has  in fact  developed a personality .   granny could sense it like a big and quite friendly animal  just waiting to roll over on its roof and have its floor scratched .  it was paying no attention to her  however .  it was watching esk .   granny found the child by following the threads of the university   s attention and watched in fascination as the scenes unfolded in the great hall           in there .      the voice came from a long way away .      mmph .         aye said  what do you see in there .     repeated mrs .  whitlow .      eh .         aye said  what do           oh .     granny reeled her mind in  quite confused .  the trouble with borrowing another mind was  you always felt out of place when you got back to your own body  and granny was the first person ever to read the mind of a building .  now she was feeling big and gritty and full of passages .      are you all right .      granny nodded  and opened her windows .  she extended her east and west wings and tried to concentrate on the tiny cup held in her pillars .   fortunately mrs .  whitlow put her plaster complexion and stony silence down to occult powers at work  while granny found that a brief exposure to the vast silicon memory of the university had quite stimulated her imagination .   in a voice like a draughty corridor  which made the housekeeper very impressed  she wove a future full of keen young men fighting for mrs .  whitlow   s ample favors .  she also spoke very quickly  because what she had seen in the great hall made her anxious to go around to the main gates again .      there is another thing     she added .      yes .  yes .         i see you hiring a new servant   you do hire the servants here  don   t you .  right   and this one is a young girl  very economical  very good worker  can turn her hand to anything .         what about her  then .     said mrs .  whitlow  already savoring granny   s surprisingly graphic descriptions of her future and drunk with curiosity .      the spirits are a little unclear on this point     said granny     but it is very important that you hire her .         no problem there     said mrs .  whitlow     can   t keep servants here  you know  not for long .  it   s all the magic .  it leaks down here  you know .  especially from the library  where they keep all them magical books .  two of the top floor maids walked out yesterday  actually  they said they were fed up going to bed not knowing what shape they would wake up in the morning .  the senior wizards turn them back  you know .  but it   s not the same .         yes  well  the spirits say this young lady won   t be any trouble as far as that is concerned     said granny grimly .      if she can sweep and scrub she   s welcome  aye   m sure     said mrs .  whitlow  looking puzzled .      she even brings her own broom .  according to the spirits  that is .         how very helpful .  when is this young lady going to arrive .         oh  soon  soon   that   s what the spirits say .      a faint suspicion clouded the housekeeper   s face .     this isn   t the sort of thing spirits normally say .  where do they say that  exactly .         here     said granny .     look  the little cluster of tea leaves between the sugar and this crack here .  am i right .      their eyes met .  mrs .  whitlow might have had her weakness but she was quite tough enough to rule the below stairs world of the university .  however  granny could outstare a snake  after a few seconds the housekeeper   s eyes began to water .      yes  aye expect you are     she said meekly  and fished a handkerchief from the recesses of her bosom .      well then     said granny  sitting back and replacing the teacup in its saucer .      there are plenty of opportunities here for a young woman willing to work hard     said mrs .  whitlow .     aye myself started as a maid  you know .         we all do     said granny vaguely .     and now i must be going .     she stood up and reached for her hat .      but           must hurry .  urgent appointment     said granny over her shoulder as she hurried down the steps .      there   s a bundle of old clothes        granny paused  her instincts battling for mastery .      any black velvet .         yes  and some silk .      granny wasn   t sure she approved of silk  she   d heard it came out of a caterpillar   s bottom  but black velvet had a powerful attraction .  loyalty won .      put it on one side  i may call again     she shouted  and ran down the corridor .   cooks and scullery maids darted for cover as the old woman pounded along the slippery flagstones  leapt up the stairs to the courtyard and skidded out into the lane  her shawl flying out behind her and her boots striking sparks from the cobbles .  once out into the open she hitched up her skirts and broke into a full gallop  turning the corner into the main square in a screeching two boot drift that left a long white scratch across the stones .   she was just in time to see esk come running through the gates  in tears .         the magic just wouldn   t work .  i could feel it there but it just wouldn   t come out .         perhaps you were trying too hard     said granny .     magic   s like fishing .  jumping around and splashing never caught any fish  you have to bide quiet and let it happen natural .         and then everyone laughed at me .  someone even gave me a sweet .         you got some profit out of the day  then     said granny .      granny .     said esk accusingly .      well  what did you expect .     she asked .     at least they only laughed at you .  laughter don   t hurt .  you walked up to chief wizard and showed off in front of everyone and only got laughed at .  you   re doing well  you are .  have you eaten the sweet .      esk scowled .     yes .         what kind was it .         toffee .         can   t abide toffee .         huh     said esk     i suppose you want me to get peppermint next time .         don   t you sarky me  young fellow me lass .  nothing wrong with peppermint .  pass me that bowl .      another advantage of city life  granny had discovered  was glassware .  some of her more complicated potions required apparatus which either had to be bought from the dwarves at extortionate rates or  if ordered from the nearest human glassblower  arrived in straw and  usually  pieces .  she had tried blowing her own and the effort always made her cough  which produced some very funny results .  but the city   s thriving alchemy profession meant that there were whole shops full of glass for the buying  and a witch could always arrange bargain prices .   she watched carefully as yellow steam surged along a twisty maze of tubing and eventually condensed as one large  sticky droplet .  she caught it neatly on the end of a glass spoon and very carefully tipped it into a tiny glass phial .   esk watched her through her tears .      what   s that .     she asked .      it   s a neveryoumind     said granny  sealing the phial   s cork with wax .      a medicine .         in a manner of speaking .     granny pulled her writing set toward her and selected a pen .  her tongue stuck out of the corner of her mouth as she very carefully wrote out a label  with much scratching and pausing to work out the spellings .      who   s it for .         mrs .  herapath  the glassblower   s wife .      esk blew her nose .     he   s the one who doesn   t blow much glass  isn   t he .      granny looked at her over the top of the desk .      how do you mean .         when she was talking to you yesterday she called him old mister once a fortnight .         mmph     said granny .  she carefully finished the sentence     dylewt in won pint warter and won droppe in hys tee and be shure to wear loose clowthing allso that no vysitors exspected .      one day  she told herself  i   m going to have to have that talk with her .   the child seemed curiously dense .  she had already assisted at enough births and taken the goats to old nanny annaple   s billy without drawing any obvious conclusions .  granny wasn   t quite certain what she should do about it  but the time never seemed appropriate to bring up the subject .  she wondered whether  in her hearts of hearts  she was too embarrassed  she felt like a farrier who could shoe horses  cure them  rear them and judge them  but had only the sketchiest idea about how one rode them .   she pasted the label on to the phial and wrapped it carefully in plain paper .   now .      there is another way into the university     she said  looking sidelong at esk  who was making a disgruntled job of mashing herbs in a mortar .     a witches    way .      esk looked up .  granny treated herself to a thin smile and started work on another label  writing labels was always the hard part of magic  as far as she was concerned .      but i don   t expect you   d be interested     she went on .     it   s not very glamorous .         they laughed at me     esk mumbled .      yes .  you said .  so you won   t be wanting to try again  then .  i quite understand .      there was silence broken only by the scratching of granny   s pen .  eventually esk said     this way           mmph .         it   ll get me into the university .         of course     said granny haughtily .     i said i   d find a way  didn   t i .  a very good way  too .  you won   t have to bother with lessons  you can go all over the place  no one will notice you   you   ll be invisible really   and  well  you can really clean up .  but of course  after all that laughing  you won   t be interested .  will you .            pray have another cup of tea  mrs .  weatherwax .     said mrs .  whitlow .      mistress     said granny .      pardon .         it   s mistress weatherwax     said granny .     three sugars  please .      mrs .  whitlow pushed the bowl toward her .  much as she looked forward to granny   s visits it came expensive in sugar .  sugar lumps never seemed to last long around granny .      very bad for the figure     she said .     and the teeth  so aye hear .         i never had a figure to speak of and my teeth take care of themselves     said granny .  it was true  more   s the pity .  granny suffered from robustly healthy teeth  which she considered a big drawback in a witch .  she really envied nanny annaple  the witch over the mountain  who managed to lose all her teeth by the time she was twenty and had real crone credibility .  it meant you ate a lot of soup  but you also got a lot of respect .  and then there was warts .  without any effort nanny managed to get a face like a sockful of marbles  while granny had tried every reputable wart causer and failed to raise even the obligatory nose wart .  some witches had all the luck .      mmph .     she said  aware of mrs .  whitlow   s fluting .      aye said     said mrs .  whitlow     that young eskarina is a real treasure .  quate the little find .  she keeps the floors spotless  spotless .  no task too big .  aye said to her yesterday  aye said  that broom of yours might as well have a life of its own  and do you know what she said .         i couldn   t even venture a guess     said granny  weakly .      she said the dust was afraid of it .  can you imagine .         yes     said granny .   mrs .  whitlow pushed her teacup toward her and gave her an embarrassed smile .   granny sighed inwardly and squinted into the none too clean depths of the future .  she was definitely beginning to run out of imagination .      the broom whisked down the corridor raising a great cloud of dust which  if you looked hard at it  seemed somehow to be sucked back into the broomstick .  if you looked even harder you   d see that the broom handle had strange markings on it  which were not so much carved as clinging and somehow changed shape as you watched .   but no one looked .   esk sat at one of the high deep windows and stared out over the city .  she was feeling angrier than usual  so the broom attacked the dust with unusual vigor .  spiders ran desperate eight legged dashes for safety as ancestral cobwebs disappeared into the void .  in the walls mice clung to each other  legs braced against the inside of their holes .  wood worm scrabbled in the ceiling beams as they were drawn  inexorably  backward down their tunnels .         you can really clean up     said esk .     huh .      there were some good points  she had to admit .  the food was simple but there was plenty of it  and she had a room to herself somewhere in the roof and it was quite luxurious because here she could lie in until five a . m .   which to granny   s way of thinking was practically noon .  the work certainly wasn   t hard .  she just started sweeping until the staff realized what was expected of it  and then she could amuse herself until it was finished .  if anyone came the staff would immediately lean itself nonchalantly against a wall .   but she wasn   t learning any wizardry .  she could wander into empty classrooms and look at the diagrams chalked on the board  and on the floor too in the more advanced classes  but the shapes were meaningless .  and unpleasant .   they reminded esk of the pictures in simon   s book .  they looked alive .   she gazed out across the rooftops of ankh morpork and reasoned like this  writing was only the words that people said  squeezed between layers of paper until they were fossilized  fossils were well known on the discworld  great spiraled shells and badly constructed creatures that were left over from the time when the creator hadn   t really decided what he wanted to make and was  as it were  just idly messing around with the pleistocene  .  and the words people said were just shadows of real things .  but some things were too big to be really trapped in words  and even the words were too powerful to be completely tamed by writing .   so it followed that some writing was actually trying to become things .  esk   s thoughts became confused things at this point  but she was certain that the really magic words were the ones that pulsed angrily  trying to escape and become real .   they didn   t look very nice .   but then she remembered the previous day .   it had been rather odd .  the university classrooms were designed on the funnel principle  with tiers of seats   polished by the bottoms of the disc   s greatest mages   looking precipitously down into a central area where there was a workbench  a couple of blackboards and enough floor space for a decent sized instructional octogram .  there was a lot of dead space under the tiers and esk had found it a quite useful observation post  peering around between the apprentice wizards    pointy boots at the instructor .  it was very restful  with the droning of the lecturers drifting over her as gently as the buzzing of the slightly zonked bees in granny   s special herb garden .  there never seemed to be any practical magic  it always seemed to be just words .  wizards seemed to like words .   but yesterday had been different .  esk had been sitting in the dusty gloom  trying to do even some very simple magic  when she heard the door open and boots clump across the floor .  that was surprising in itself .  esk knew the timetable  and the second year students who normally occupied this room were down for beginners    dematerialization with jeophal the spry in the gym .   students of magic had little use for physical exercise  the gym was a large room lined with lead and rowan wood  where neophytes could work out at high magic without seriously unbalancing the universe  although not always without seriously unbalancing themselves .  magic had no mercy on the ham fisted .  some clumsy students were lucky enough to walk out  others were removed in bottles .    esk peeped between the slats .  these weren   t students  they were wizards .  quite high ones  to judge by their robes .  and there was no mistaking the figure that climbed on to the lecturer   s dais like a badly strung puppet  bumping heavily into the lectern and absentmindedly apologizing to it .  it was simon .  no one else had eyes like two raw eggs in warm water and a nose bright red from blowing .  for simon  the pollen count always went to infinity .   it occurred to esk that  minus his general allergy to the whole of creation and with a decent haircut and a few lessons in deportment  the boy could look quite handsome .  it was an unusual thought  and she squirreled it away for future consideration .   when the wizards had settled down  simon began to talk .  he read from notes  and every time he stuttered over a word the wizards  as one man  without being able to stop themselves  chorused it for him .   after a while a stick of chalk rose from the lectern and started to write on the blackboard behind him .  esk had picked up enough about wizard magic to know that this was an astounding achievement   simon had been at the university for a couple of weeks  and most students hadn   t mastered light levitation by the end of their second year .   the little white stub skittered and squeaked across the blackness to the accompaniment of simon   s voice .  even allowing for the stutter  he was not a very good speaker .  he dropped notes .  he corrected himself .  he ummed and ahhed .  and as far as esk was concerned he wasn   t saying anything very much .  phrases filtered down to her hiding place .     basic fabric of the universe    was one  and she didn   t understand what that was  unless he meant denim  or maybe flannelette .     mutability of the possibility matrix    she couldn   t guess at all .   sometimes he seemed to be saying that nothing existed unless people thought it did  and the world was really only there at all because people kept on imagining it .  but then he seemed to be saying that there was lots of worlds  all nearly the same and all sort of occupying the same place but all separated by the thickness of a shadow  so that everything that ever could happen would have somewhere to happen in .    esk could get to grips with this .  she had half suspected it ever since she cleaned out the senior wizards    lavatory  or rather while the staff got on with the job while esk examined the urinals and  with the assistance of some half remembered details of her brothers in the tin bath in front of the fire at home  formulated her unofficial general theory of comparative anatomy .  the senior wizards    lavatory was a magical place  with real running water and interesting tiles and  most importantly  two big silver mirrors fixed to opposite walls so that someone looking into one could see themselves repeated again and again until the image was too small to see .  it was esk   s first introduction to the idea of infinity .  more to the point  she had a suspicion that one of the mirror esks  right on the edge of sight  was waving at her .    there was something disturbing about the phrases simon used .  half the time he seemed to be saying that the world was about as real as a soap bubble  or a dream .   the chalk shrieked its way across the board behind him .  sometimes simon had to stop and explain symbols to the wizards  who seemed to esk to be getting excited at some very silly sentences .  then the chalk would start again  curving across the darkness like a comet  trailing its dust behind it .   the light was fading out of the sky outside .  as the room grew more gloomy the chalked words glowed and the blackboard appeared to esk to be not so much dark as simply not there at all  but just a square hole cut out of the world .   simon talked on  about the world being made up of tiny things whose presence could only be determined by the fact that they were not there  little spinning balls of nothinness that magic could shunt together to make stars and butterflies and diamonds .  everything was made up of emptiness .   the funny thing was  he seemed to find this fascinating .   esk was only aware that the walls of the room grew as thin and insubstantial as smoke  as if the emptiness in them was expanding to swallow whatever it was that defined them as walls  and instead there was nothing but the familiar cold  empty  glittering plain with its distant worn hills  and the creatures that stood as still as statues  looking down .   there were a lot more of them now .  they seemed for all the world to be clustering like moths around a light .   one important difference was that a moth   s face  even close up  was as friendly as a bunny rabbit   s compared to the things watching simon .   then a servant came in to light the lamps and the creatures vanished  turning into perfectly harmless shadows that lurked in the corners of the room .      at some time in the recent past someone had decided to brighten the ancient corridors of the university by painting them  having some vague notion that learning should be fun .  it hadn   t worked .  it   s a fact known throughout the universes that no matter how carefully the colors are chosen  institutional decor ends up as either vomit green  unmentionable brown  nicotine yellow or surgical appliance pink .  by some little understood process of sympathetic resonance  corridors painted in those colors always smell slightly of boiled cabbage   even if no cabbage is ever cooked in the vicinity .   somewhere in the corridors a bell rang .  esk dropped lightly from her windowsill  grabbed the staff and started to sweep industriously as doors were flung open and the corridors filled with students .  they streamed past her on two sides  like water around a rock .  for a few minutes there was utter confusion .  then doors slammed  a few laggard feet pattered away in the distance  and esk was by herself again .   not for the first time  esk wished that the staff could talk .  the other servants were friendly enough  but you couldn   t talk to them .  not about magic  anyway .   she was also coming to the conclusion that she ought to learn to read .  this reading business seemed to be the key to wizard magic  which was all about words .  wizards seemed to think that names were the same as things  and that if you changed the name  you changed the thing .  at least  it seemed to be something like that     reading .  that meant the library .  simon had said there were thousands of books in it  and among all those words there were bound to be one or two she could read .  esk put the staff over her shoulder and set off resolutely for mrs .  whitlow   s office .   she was nearly there when a wall said    psst .     when esk stared at it it turned out to be granny .  it wasn   t that granny could make herself invisible  it was just that she had this talent for being able to fade into the foreground so that she wasn   t noticed .      how are you getting on  then .     asked granny .     how   s the magic coming along .         what are you doing here  granny .     said esk .      been to tell mrs .  whitlow her fortune     said granny  holding up a large bundle of old clothes with some satisfaction .  her smile faded under esk   s stern gaze .      well  things are different in the city     she said .     city people are always worried about the future  it comes from eating unnatural food .  anyway     she added  suddenly realizing that she was whining     why shouldn   t i tell fortunes .         you always said hilta was playing on the foolishness of her sex     said esk .     you said that them as tell fortunes should be ashamed of themselves  and anyway  you don   t need old clothes .         waste not  want not     said granny primly .  she had spent her entire life on the old clothes standard and wasn   t about to let temporary prosperity dislodge her     are you getting enough to eat .         yes     said esk .     granny  about this wizard magic  it   s all words           always said it was     said granny .      no  i mean       esk began  but granny waved a hand irritably .      can   t be bothered with this at the moment     she said .     i   ve got some big orders to fill by tonight  if it goes on like this i   m going to have to train someone up .  can   t you come and see me when you get an afternoon off  or whatever it is they give you .         train someone up .     said esk  horrified .     you mean as a witch .         no     said granny .     i mean  perhaps .         but what about me .         well  you   re going your own way     said granny .     wherever that is .         mmph     said esk .  granny stared at her .      i   ll be off  then     she said at last .  she turned and strode off toward the kitchen entrance .  as she did so her cloak swirled out  and esk saw that it was now lined with red .  a dark  winy red  but red nevertheless .  on granny  who had never been known to wear any visible clothing that was other than a serviceable black  it was quite shocking .         the library .     said mrs .  whitlow .     aye don   t think anyone cleans the library .     she looked genuinely puzzled .      why .     said esk     doesn   t it get dusty .         well     said mrs .  whitlow .  she thought for a while .     aye suppose it must do  since you come to mention it .  aye never really thought about it .         you see  i   ve cleaned everywhere else     said esk  sweetly .      yes     said mrs .  whitlow     you have  haven   t you .         well  then .         it   s just that we   ve never   done it before     said mrs .  whitlow     but for the life of me  aye can   t think why .         well  then     said esk .         ook .     said the head librarian  and backed away from esk .  but she had heard about him and had come prepared .  she offered him a banana .   the orangutan reached out slowly and then snatched it with a grin of triumph .   there may be universes where librarianship is considered a peaceful sort of occupation  and where the risks are limited to large volumes falling off the shelves on to one   s head  but the keeper of a magic library is no job for the unwary .  spells have power  and merely writing them down and shoving them between covers doesn   t do anything to reduce it .  the stuff leaks .  books tend to react with one another  creating randomized magic with a mind of its own .  books of magic are usually chained to their shelves  but not to prevent them being stolen     one such accident had turned the librarian into an ape  since when he had resisted all attempts to turn him back  explaining in sign language that life as an orangutan was considerably better than life as a human being  because all the big philosophical questions resolved themselves into wondering where the next banana was coming from .  anyway  long arms and prehensile feet were ideal for dealing with high shelves .   esk gave him the whole bunch of bananas and scurried away amongst the books before he could object .   esk had never seen more than one book at a time and so the library was  for all she knew  just like any other library .  true  it was a bit odd the way the floor seemed to become the wall in the distance  and there was something strange about the way the shelves played tricks on the eyes and seemed to twist through rather more dimensions than the normal three  and it was quite surprising to look up and see shelves on the ceiling  with the occasional student wandering unconcernedly among them .   the truth was that the presence of so much magic distorted the space around it .  down in the stacks the very denim  or possibly flannelette  of the universe was tortured into very peculiar shapes .  the millions of trapped words  unable to escape  bent reality around them .   it seemed logical to esk that among all these books should be one that told you how to read all the others .  she wasn   t sure how to find it  but deep in her soul she felt it would probably have pictures of cheerful rabbits and happy kittens on the cover .   the library certainly wasn   t silent .  there was the occasional zip and sizzle of a magical discharge  and an octarine spark would flash from shelf to shelf .  chains clinked  faintly .  and  of course  there was the faint rustle of thousands of pages in their leather bound prisons .   esk made sure no one was paying her any attention and pulled at the nearest volume .  it sprang open in her hands  and she saw gloomily that there were the same unpleasant types of diagram that she had noticed in simon   s book .  the writing was entirely unfamiliar  and she was glad about that   it would be horrible to know what all those letters  which seemed to be made up of ugly creatures doing complicated things to each other  actually meant .  she forced the cover shut  even though the words seemed to be desperately pushing back .  there was a drawing of a creature on the front  it looked suspiciously like one of the things from the cold desert .  it certainly didn   t look like a happy kitten .      hallo .  esk  isn   t it .  h how d did you get h here .      it was simon  standing there with a book under each arm .  esk blushed .      granny won   t tell me     she said .     i think it   s something to do with men and women .      simon looked at her blankly .  then he grinned .  esk thought about the question a second time .      i work here .  i sweep up .     she waved the staff in explanation .      in here .      esk stared at him .  she felt alone  and lost  and more than a little betrayed .  everyone seemed to be busy living their own lives  except her .  she would spend the rest of her life cleaning up after wizards .  it wasn   t fair  and she   d had enough .      actually i don   t .  actually i   m learning to read so i can be a wizard .      the boy regarded her through his damp eyes for some seconds .  then he gently took the book out of esk   s hands and read its title .      demonylogie malyfycorum of henchanse thee unsaty factory .  how did you think you could learn to r read this .         um     said esk     well  you just keep trying until you can  don   t you .  like milking  or knitting  or       her voice faded away .      i don   t know about that .  these books can be a bit  well  aggressive .  if you d don   t be careful they start reading you .         what do you mean .         t they ssss              say       said esk  automatically .         that there was once a wwww              wizard              who started to r read the necrotelecomnicon and let his m mind wwwwww              wander              and next morning they f found all his clothes on the chair and h his hat on t top of them and the b book had        esk put her fingers in her ears  but not too hard in case she missed anything .      i don   t want to know about it if it   s horrid .            had a lot more pages .      esk took her fingers out of her ears .     was there anything on the pages .      simon nodded solemnly .     yes .  on every sssingle one of th them there www           no     said esk .     i don   t even want to imagine it .  i thought reading was more peaceful than that  i mean  granny read her almanack every day and nothing ever happened to her .         i d daresay ordinary tame www              words              are all right     simon conceded  magnanimously .      are you absolutely certain .     said esk .      it   s just that words can have power     said simon  slotting the book firmly back on its shelf  where it rattled its chains at him .     and they do say the p pen is mightier than the sss              sword     said esk .     all right  but which would you rather be hit with .         um  i d don   t think it   s any use m me t telling you you shouldn   t be in here  is it .     said the young wizard .   esk gave this due consideration .     no     she said     i don   t think it is .         i could send for the p porters and have you t taken away .         yes  but you won   t .         i just d don   t www              want              you to get hurt  you see .  i r really don   t .  this can b be a ddddangerou        esk caught a faint swirling in the air above his head .  for a moment she saw them  the great gray shapes from the cold place .  watching .  and in the calm of the library  when the weight of magic was wearing the universe particularly thin  they had decided to act .   around her the muted rustling of the books rose to a desperate riffling of pages .  some of the more powerful books managed to jerk out of their shelves and swung  flapping madly  from the end of their chains .  a huge grimoire plunged from its eyrie on the topmost shelf   tearing itself free of its chain in the process   and flopped away like a frightened chicken  scattering its pages behind it .   a magical wind blew away esk   s headscarf and her hair streamed out behind her .  she saw simon trying to steady himself against a bookshelf as books exploded around him .  the air was thick and tasted of tin .  it buzzed .      they   re trying to get in .     she screamed .   simon   s tortured face turned to her .  a fear crazed incunable hit him heavily in the small of the back and knocked him to the heaving floor before it bounced high over the shelves .  esk ducked as a flock of thesauri wheeled past  towing their shelf behind them  and scuttled on hands and knees toward him .      that   s what   s making the books so frightened .     she shrieked in his ear .     can   t you see them up there .      simon mutely shook his head .  a book burst its bindings over them  showering them in pages .   horror can steal into the mind via all the senses .  there   s the sound of the little meaningful chuckle in the locked dark room  the sight of half a caterpillar in your forkful of salad  the curious smell from the lodger   s bedroom  the taste of slug in the cauliflower cheese .  touch doesn   t normally get a look in .   but something happened to the floor under esk   s hands .  she looked down  her face a rictus of horror  because the dusty floorboards suddenly felt gritty .  and dry .  and very  very cold .   there was fine silver sand between her fingers .   she grabbed the staff and  sheltering her eyes against the wind  waved it at the towering figures above her .  it would have been nice to report that a searing flash of pure white fire cleansed the greasy air .  it failed to materialize     the staff twisted like a snake in her hand and caught simon a crack on the side of the head .   the gray things wavered and vanished .   reality returned  and tried to pretend that it had never left .  silence settled like thick velvet  wave after wave of it .  a heavy  echoing silence .  a few books dropped heavily out of the air  feeling silly .   the floor under esk   s feet was undoubtedly wooden .  she kicked it hard to make sure .   there was blood on the floor  and simon lay very quietly in the center of it .  esk stared down at him  and then up at the still air  and then at the staff .  it looked smug .   she was aware of distant voices and hurrying feet .   a hand like a fine leather glove slipped gently into hers and a voice behind said    ook     very softly .  she turned  and found herself staring down into the gentle  inner tube face of the librarian .  he put his finger to his lips in an unmistakable gesture and tugged gently at her hand .      i   ve killed him .     she whispered .   the librarian shook his head  and tugged insistently .      ook     he explained     ook .      he dragged her reluctantly down a side alleyway in the maze of ancient shelving a few seconds before a party of senior wizards  drawn by the noise  rounded the corner .      the books have been fighting again           oh no .  it   ll take ages to capture all the spells again  you know they go and find places to hide           who   s that on the floor .      there was a pause .      he   s knocked out .  a shelf caught him  by the looks of it .         who is he .         that new lad .  you know  the one they say has got a whole head full of brains .         if that shelf had been a bit closer we   d be able to see if they were right .         you two  get him along to the infirmary .  the rest of you better get these books rounded up .  where   s the damn librarian .  he ought to know better than to let a critical mass build up .      esk glanced sideways at the orangutan  who waggled his eyebrows at her .  he pulled a dusty volume of gardening spells out of the shelves beside him  extracted a soft brown banana from the recess behind it  and ate it with the quiet relish of one who knows that whatever the problems are  they belong firmly to human beings .   she looked the other way  at the staff in her hand  and her lips went thin .  she knew her grip hadn   t slipped .  the staff had lunged at simon  with murder in its heartwood .      the boy lay on a hard bed in a narrow room  a cold towel folded across his forehead .  treatle and cutangle watched him carefully .      how long has it been .     said cutangle .   treatle shrugged .     three days .         and he hasn   t come around once .         no .      cutangle sat down heavily on the edge of the bed  and pinched the bridge of his nose wearily .  simon had never looked particularly healthy  but now his face had a horrible sunken look .      a brilliant mind  that one     he said .     his explanation of the fundamental principles of magic and matter   quite astounding .      treatle nodded .      the way he just absorbs knowledge     said cutangle     i   ve been a working wizard all my life  and somehow i never really understood magic until he explained it .  so clear .  so  well  obvious .         everyone says that     said treatle gloomily .     they say it   s like having a hoodwink pulled off and seeing the daylight for the first time .         that   s exactly it     said cutangle     he   s sorcerer material  sure enough .  you were right to bring him here .      there was a thoughtful pause .      only       said treatle .      only what .     asked cutangle .      only what was it you understood .     said treatle .     that   s what   s bothering me .  i mean  can you explain it .         how do you mean  explain .     cutangle looked worried .      what he keeps talking about     said treatle  a hint of desperation in his voice .     oh  it   s the genuine stuff  i know .  but what exactly is it .      cutangle looked at him  his mouth open .  eventually he said     oh  that   s easy .  magic fills the universe  you see  and every time the universe changes  no  i mean every time magic is invoked  the universe changes  only in every direction at once  d   you see  and       he moved his hands uncertainly  trying to recognize a spark of comprehension in treatle   s face .     to put it another way  any piece of matter  like an orange or the world or  or              a crocodile .     suggested treatle .      yes  a crocodile  or   whatever  is basically shaped like a carrot .         i don   t remember that bit     said treatle .      i   m sure that   s what he said     said cutangle .  he was starting to sweat .      no  i remember the bit where he seemed to suggest that if you went far enough in any direction you would see the back of your head     treatle insisted .      you   re sure he didn   t mean someone else   s head .      treatle thought for a bit .      no  i   m pretty sure he said the back of your own head     he said .     i think he said he could prove it .      they considered this in silence .   finally cutangle spoke  very slowly and carefully .      i look at it all like this     he said .     before i heard him talk  i was like everyone else .  you know what i mean .  i was confused and uncertain about all the little details of life .  but now     he brightened up     while i   m still confused and uncertain it   s on a much higher plane  d   you see  and at least i know i   m bewildered about the really fundamental and important facts of the universe .      treatle nodded .     i hadn   t looked at it like that     he said     but you   re absolutely right .  he   s really pushed back the boundaries of ignorance .  there   s so much about the universe we don   t know .      they both savored the strange warm glow of being much more ignorant than ordinary people  who were ignorant of only ordinary things .   then treatle said     i just hope he   s all right .  he   s over the fever but he just doesn   t seem to want to wake up .      a couple of servants came in with a bowl of water and fresh towels .  one of them carried a rather tatty broomstick .  as they began to change the sweat soaked sheets under the boy the two wizards left  still discussing the vast vistas of unknowingness that simon   s genius had revealed to the world .   granny waited until their footsteps had died away and took off her headscarf .      damn thing     she said .     esk  go and listen at the door .     she removed the towel from simon   s head and felt his temperature .      it was very good of you to come     said esk .     and you so busy with your work  and everything .         mmmph .     granny pursed her lips .  she pulled up simon   s eyelids and sought his pulse .  she laid an ear on his xylophone chest and listened to his heart .  she sat for some time quite motionless  probing around inside his head .   she frowned .      is he all right .     said esk anxiously .   granny looked at the stone walls .      drat this place     she said .     it   s no place for sick people .         yes  but is he all right .         what .     granny was startled out of her thoughts .     oh .  yes .  probably .  wherever he is .      esk stared at her  and then at simon   s body .      nobody   s home     said granny  simply .      what do you mean .         listen to the child     said granny .     you   d think i taught her nothing .  i mean his mind   s wandering .  he   s gone out of his head .      she looked at simon   s body with something verging on admiration .      quite surprisin     really     she added .     i never yet met a wizard who could borrow .      she turned to esk  whose mouth was a horrified o .      i remember when i was a girl  old nanny annaple went wanderin    .  got too wrapped up with being a vixen  as i recall .  took us days to find her .  and then there was you  too .  i never would have found you if it wasn   t for that staff thing  and   what have you done with it  girl .         it hit him     esk muttered .     it tried to kill him .  i threw it in the river .         not a nice thing to do to it after it saved you     said granny .      it saved me by hitting him .         didn   t you realize .  he was callin    to   them things .         that   s not true .      granny stared into esk   s defiant eyes and the thought came to her mind  i   ve lost her .  three years of work down the privy .  she couldn   t be a wizard but she might have been a witch .      why isn   t it true  miss clever .     she said .      he wouldn   t do something like that .     esk was near to tears .     i heard him speak  he   s   well  he   s not evil  he   s a brilliant person  he nearly understands how everything works  he   s           i expect he   s a very nice boy     said granny sourly .     i never said he was a black wizard  did i .         they   re horrible things .     esk sobbed .     he wouldn   t call out to them  he wants everything that they   re not  and you   re a wicked old        the slap rang like a bell .  esk staggered back  white with shock .  granny stood with her hand upraised  trembling .   she   d struck esk once before   the blow a baby gets to introduce it to the world and give it a rough idea of what to expect from life .  but that had been the last time .  in their years under the same roof there had been cause enough  when milk had been left to boil over or the goats had been carelessly left without water  but a sharp word or a sharper silence had done more than force ever could and left no bruises .   she grabbed esk firmly by the shoulders and stared into her eyes .      listen to me     she said urgently .     didn   t i always say to you that if you use magic you should go through the world like a knife goes through water .  didn   t i say that .      esk  mesmerized like a cornered rabbit  nodded .      and you thought that was just old granny   s way  didn   t you .  but the fact is that if you use magic you draw attention to yourself .  from them .  they watch the world all the time .  ordinary minds are just vague to them  they hardly bother with them  but a mind with magic in it shines out  you see  it   s a beacon to them .  it   s not darkness that calls them  it   s light  light that creates the shadows .         but   but   why are they interested .  what do they w want .         life and shape     said granny .   she sagged  and let go of esk .      they   re pathetic  really     she said .     they   ve got no life or shape themselves but what they can steal .  they could no more survive in this world than a fish could live in a fire  but that doesn   t stop them trying .  and they   re just bright enough to hate us because we   re alive .      esk shivered .  she remember the gritty feel of the cold sand .      what are they .  i always thought they were just a sort   a sort of demon .         nah .  no one really knows .  they   re just the things from the dungeon dimensions outside the universe  that   s all .  shadow creatures .      she turned back to the prone form of simon .      you wouldn   t have any idea where he is  would you .     she said  looking shrewdly at esk .     not gone off flying with the seagulls  has he .      esk shook her head .      no     said granny     i didn   t think so .  they   ve got him  haven   t they .      it wasn   t a question .  esk nodded  her face a mask of misery .      it   s not your fault     said granny     his mind gave them an opening  and when he was knocked out they took it back with them .  only        she drummed her fingers on the edge of the bed  and appeared to reach a decision .      who   s the most important wizard around here .     she demanded .      um  lord cutangle     said esk .     he   s the archchancellor .  he was one of the ones who was in here .         the fat one  or the one like a streak of vinegar .      esk dragged her mind from the image of simon on the cold desert and found herself saying     he   s an eighth level wizard and a      mage  actually .         you mean he   s bent .     said granny .     all this hanging around wizards has made you take them seriously  my girl .  they all call themselves the lord high this and the imperial that  it   s all part of the game .  even magicians do it  you   d think they   d be more sensible at least  but no  they call around saying they   re the amazing bonko and doris .  anyway  where is this high rumtiddlypo .         they   ll be at dinner in the great hall     said esk .     can he bring simon back  then .         that   s the difficult part     said granny .     i daresay we could all get something back easily enough  walking and talking just like anyone .  whether it would be simon is quite another sack of ferrets .      she stood up .     let   s find this great hall  then .  no time to waste .         um  women aren   t allowed in     said esk .   granny stopped in the doorway .  her shoulders rose .  she turned around very slowly .      what did you say .     she said .     did these old ears deceive me  and don   t say they did because they didn   t .         sorry     said esk .     force of habit .         i can see you   ve been getting ideas below your station     said granny coldly .     go and find someone to watch over the lad  and let   s see what   s so great about this hall that i mustn   t set foot in it .      and thus it was that while the entire faculty of unseen university were dining in the venerable hall the doors were flung back with a dramatic effect that was rather spoiled when one of them rebounded off a waiter and caught granny a crack on the shin .  instead of the defiant strides she had intended to make across the checkered floor she was forced to half hop  half limp .  but she hoped that she hopped with dignity .   esk hurried along behind her  acutely aware of the hundreds of eyes that were turned toward them .   the roar of conversation and the clatter of cutlery faded away .  a couple of chairs were knocked over .  at the far end of the hall she could see the most senior wizards at their high table  which in fact bobbed a few feet off the floor .  they were staring .   a medium grade wizard   esk recognized him as a lecturer in applied astrology   rushed toward them  waving his hands .      nononono     he shouted .     wrong door .  you must go away .         don   t mind me     said granny calmly  pushing past him .      nonono  it   s against the lore  you must go away now .  ladies are not allowed in here .         i   m not a lady  i   m a witch     said granny .  she turned to esk .     is he very important .         i don   t think so     said esk .      right .     granny turned to the lecturer     go and find me an important wizard  please .  quickly .      esk tapped her on the back .  a couple of wizards with a rather greater presence of mind had nipped smartly out of the door behind them  and now several college porters were advancing threateningly up the hall  to the cheers and cat calls of the students .  esk had never much liked the porters  who lived a private life in their lodge  but now she felt a pang of sympathy for them .   two of them reached out hairy hands and grabbed granny   s shoulders .  her arm disappeared behind her back and there was a brief flurry of movement that ended with the men hopping away  clutching bits of themselves and swearing .      hatpin     said granny .  she grabbed esk with her free hand and swept toward the high table  glaring at anyone who so much as looked as if they were going to get in her way .  the younger students  who knew free entertainment when they saw it  stamped and cheered and banged their plates on the long tables .  the high table settled on the tiles with a thump and the senior wizards hurriedly lined up behind cutangle as he tried to summon up his reserves of dignity .  his efforts didn   t really work  it is very hard to look dignified with a napkin tucked into one   s collar .   he raised his hands for silence  and the hall waited expectantly as granny and esk approached him .  granny was looking interestedly at the ancient paintings and statues of bygone mages .      who are them buggers .     she said out of the corner of her mouth .      they used to be chief wizards     whispered esk .      they look constipated .  i never met a wizard who was regular     said granny .      they   re a nuisance to dust  that   s all i know     said esk .   cutangle stood with legs planted wide apart  arms akimbo and stomach giving an impression of a beginners    ski slope  the whole of him therefore adopting a pose usually associated with henry viii but with an option on henry ix and x as well .      well .     he said     what is the meaning of this outrage .         is he important .     said granny to esk .      i  madam  am the archchancellor .  and i happen to run this university .  and you  madam  are trespassing in very dangerous territory indeed .  i warn you that   stop looking at me like that .      cutangle staggered backward  his hands raised to ward off granny   s gaze .  the wizards behind him scattered  turning over tables in their haste to avoid the stare .   granny   s eyes had changed .   esk had never seen them like this before .  they were perfectly silver  like little round mirrors  reflecting all they saw .  cutangle was a vanishingly small dot in their depths  his mouth open  his tiny matchstick arms waving in desperation .   the archchancellor backed into a pillar  and the shock made him recover .  he shook his head irritably  cupped a hand and sent a stream of white fire streaking toward the witch .   without dropping her iridescent stare granny raised a hand and deflected the flames toward the roof .  there was an explosion and a shower of tile fragments .   her eyes widened .   cutangle vanished .  where he had been standing a huge snake coiled  poised to strike .   granny vanished .  where she had been standing was a large wicker basket .   the snake became a giant reptile from the mists of time .   the basket became the snow wind of the ice giants  coating the struggling monster with ice .   the reptile became a saber toothed tiger  crouched to spring .   the gale became a bubbling tar pit .   the tiger managed to become an eagle  stooping .   the tar pits became a tufted hood .   then the images began to flicker as shape replaced shape .  stroboscope shadows danced around the hall .  a magical wind sprang up  thick and greasy  striking octarine sparks from beards and fingers .  in the middle of it all esk  peering through streaming eyes  could just make out the two figures of granny and cutangle  glossy statues in the midst of the hurtling images .   she was also aware of something else  a high pitched sound almost beyond hearing .   she had heard it before  on the cold plain   a busy chittering noise  a beehive noise  an anthill sound        they   re coming .     she screamed above the din .     they   re coming now .      she scrambled out from behind the table where she had taken refuge from the magical duel and tried to reach granny .  a gust of raw magic lifted her off her feet and bowled her into a chair .   the buzzing was louder now  so that the air roared like a three week corpse on a summer   s day .  esk made another attempt to reach granny and recoiled when green fire roared along her arm and singed her hair .   she looked around wildly for the other wizards  but those who had fled from the effects of the magic were cowering behind overturned furniture while the occult storm raged over their heads .   esk ran down the length of the hall and out into the dark corridor .  shadows curled around her as she hurried  sobbing  up the steps and along the buzzing corridors toward simon   s narrow room .   something would try to enter the body  granny had said .  something that would walk and talk like simon  but would be something else     a cluster of students were hovering anxiously outside the door .  they turned pale faces toward esk as she darted toward them  and were sufficiently shaken to draw back nervously in the face of her determined progress .      something   s in there     said one of them .      we can   t open the door .      they looked at her expectantly .  then one of them said     you wouldn   t have a pass key  by any chance .      esk grabbed the doorhandle and turned it .  it moved slightly  but then spun back with such force it nearly took the skin off her hands .  the chittering inside rose to a crescendo and there was another noise  too  like leather flapping .      you   re wizards .     she screamed .     bloody well wizz .         we haven   t done telekinesis yet     said one of them .      i was ill when we did firethrowing           actually  i   m not very good at dematerialization        esk went to the door  and then stopped with one foot in the air .  she remembered granny talking about how even buildings had a mind  if they were old enough .  the university was very old .   she stepped carefully to one side and ran her hands over the ancient stones .  it had to be done carefully  so as not to frighten it   and now she could feel the mind in the stones  slow and simple  but still mind .  it pulsed around her  she could feel the little sparkles deep in the rock .   something was hooting behind the door .   the three students watched in astonishment as esk stood rock still with her hands and forehead pressed against the wall .   she was almost there .  she could feel the weight of herself  the ponderousness of her body  the distant memories of the dawn of time when rock was molten and free .  for the first time in her life she knew what it was like to have balconies .   she moved gently through the building mind  refining her impressions  looking as fast as she dared for this corridor  this door .   she stretched out one arm  very carefully .  the students watched as she uncurled one finger  very slowly .   the door hinges began to creak .   there was a moment of tension and then the nails sprang from the hinges and clattered into the wall behind her .  the planks began to bend as the door still tried to force itself open against the strength of   whatever was holding it shut .   the wood billowed .   beams of blue light lanced out into the corridor  moving and dancing as indistinct shapes shuffled through the blinding brilliance inside the room .  the light was misty and actinic  the sort of light to make steven spielberg reach for his copyright lawyer .   esk   s hair leapt from her head so that she looked like an ambulant dandelion .  little firesnakes of magic crackled across her skin as she stepped through the doorway .   the students outside watched in horror as she disappeared into the light .   it vanished in a silent explosion .   when they eventually found enough courage to look inside the room  they saw nothing there but the sleeping body of simon .  and esk  silent and cold on the floor  breathing very slowly .  and the floor was covered with a fine layer of silver sand .      esk floated through the mists of the world  noticing with a curious impersonal feeling the precise way in which she passed through solid matter .   there were others with her .  she could hear their chittering .   fury rose like bile .  she turned and set out after the noise  fighting the seductive forces that kept telling her how nice it would be just to relax her grip on her mind and sink into a warm sea of nothingness .  being angry  that was the thing .  she knew it was most important to stay really angry .   the discworld fell away  and lay below her as it did on the day she had been an eagle .  but this time the circle sea was below her   it certainly was circular  as if god had run out of ideas   and beyond it lay the arms of the continent  and the long chain of the ramtops marching all the way to the hub .  there were other continents she had never heard of  and tiny island chains .   as her point of view changed  the rim came into sight .  it was nighttime and  since the disc   s orbiting sun was below the world  it lit up the long waterfall that girdled the edge .   it also lit up great a   tuin the world turtle .  esk had often wondered if the turtle was really a myth .  it seemed a lot of trouble to go to just to move a world .  but there it was  almost as big as the disc it carried  frosted with stardust and pocked with meteor craters .   its head passed in front of her and she looked directly into an eye big enough to float all the fleets in the world .  she had heard it said that if you could look far enough into the direction that great a   tuin was staring  you would see the end of the universe .  maybe it was just the set of its beak  but great a   tuin looked vaguely hopeful  even optimistic .  perhaps the end of everything wasn   t as bad as all that .   dreamlike  she reached out and tried to borrow the biggest mind in the universe .   she stopped herself just in time  like a child with a toy toboggan who expected a little gentle slope and suddenly looks out of the magnificent mountains  snow covered  stretching into the icefields of infinity .  no one would ever borrow that mind  it would be like trying to drink all the sea .  the thoughts that moved through it were as big and as slow as glaciers .   beyond the disc were the stars  and there was something wrong with them .  they were swirling like snowflakes .  every now and again they would settle down and look as immobile as they always did  and then they   d suddenly take it into their heads to dance .   real stars shouldn   t do that  esk decided .  which meant she wasn   t looking at real stars .  which meant she wasn   t exactly in a real place .  but a chittering close at hand reminded her that she could almost certainly really die if she once lost track of those noises .  she turned and pursued the sounds through the stellar snowstorm .   and the stars jumped  and settled  jumped  and settled     as she swooped upward esk tried to concentrate on everyday things  because if she let her mind dwell on precisely what it was she was following then she knew she would turn back  and she wasn   t sure she knew the way .  she tried to remember the eighteen herbs that cured earache  which kept her occupied for a while because she could never recall the last four .   a star swooped past  and then was violently jerked away  it was about twenty feet across .   when she ran out of herbs she started on the diseases of goats  which took quite a long time because goats can catch a lot of things that cows can catch plus a lot of things plus that sheep plus catch plus a complete range of horrible ailments of their very own .  when she had finished listing wooden udder  ear wilt and the octarine garget she tried to recall the complex code of dots and lines that they used to cut in the trees around bad ass  so that lost villagers could find their way home on snowy nights .   she was only as far as dot dot dot dash dot dash  hub by turnwise  one mile from the village  when the universe around her vanished with a faint pop .  she fell forward  hit something hard and gritty and rolled to a halt .   the grittiness was sand .  fine  dry  cold sand .  you could tell that even if you dug down several feet it would be just as cold and just as dry .   esk lay with her face in it for a moment  summoning the courage to look up .  she could just see  a few feet away from her  the hem of someone   s dress .  something   s dress  she corrected herself .  unless it was a wing .  it could be a wing  a particularly tatty and leathery one .   her eyes followed it up until she found a face  higher than a house  outlined against the starry sky .  its owner was obviously trying to look nightmarish  but had tried too hard .  the basic appearance was that of a chicken that had been dead for about two months  but the unpleasant effect was rather spoiled by warthog tusks  moth antennae  wolf ears and a unicorn spike .  the whole thing had a self assembled look  as if the owner had heard about anatomy but couldn   t quite get to grips with the idea .   it was staring  but not at her .  something behind her occupied all its interest .  esk turned her head very slowly .   simon was sitting cross legged in the center of a circle of things .  there were hundreds of them  as still and silent as statues  watching him with reptilian patience .   there was something small and angular held in his cupped hands .  it gave off a fuzzy blue light that made his face look strange .   other shapes lay on the ground beside him  each in its little soft glow .  they were the regular sort of shapes that granny dismissed airily as jommetry   cubes  many sided diamonds  cones  even a globe .  each one was transparent and inside was     esk edged closer .  no one was taking any notice of her .   inside a crystal sphere that had been tossed aside on to the sand floated a blue green ball  crisscrossed with tiny white cloud patterns and what could almost have been continents if anyone was silly enough to try to live on a ball .  it might have been a sort of model  except something about its glow told esk that it was quite real and probably very big and not   in every sense   totally inside the sphere .   she put it down very gently and sidled over to a ten sided block in which floated a much more acceptable world .  it was properly disc shaped  but instead of the rimfall there was a wall of ice and instead of the hub there was a gigantic tree  so big that its roots merged into mountain ranges .   a prism beside it held another slowly turning disc  surrounded by little stars .  but there were no ice walls around this one  just a red gold thread that turned out on closer inspection to be a snake   a snake big enough to encircle a world .  for reasons best known to itself it was biting its own tail .   esk turned the prism over and over curiously  noticing how the little disc inside stayed resolutely upright .   simon giggled softly .  esk replaced the snake disc and peered carefully over his shoulder .   he was holding a small glass pyramid .  there were stars in it  and occasionally he would give it a little shake so that the stars swirled up like snow in the wind  and then settled back in their places .  then he would giggle .   and beyond the stars     it was the discworld .  a great a   tuin no bigger than a small saucer toiled along under a world that looked like the work of an obsessive jeweler .   jiggle  swirl .  jiggle  swirl  giggle .  there were already hairline cracks in the glass .   esk looked at simon   s blank eyes and then up into the hungry faces of the nearest things  and then she reached across and pulled the pyramid out of his hands and turned and ran .   the things didn   t stir as she scurried toward them  bent almost double  with the pyramid clasped tightly to her chest .  but suddenly her feet were no longer running over the sand and she was being lifted into the frigid air  and a thing with a face like a drowned rabbit turned slowly toward her and extended a talon .   you   re not really here  esk told herself .  it   s only a sort of dream  what granny calls an annaloggy .  you can   t really be hurt  it   s all imagination .  there   s absolutely no harm that can come to you  it   s all really inside your mind .   i wonder if it knows that .   the talon picked her out of the air and the rabbit face split like a banana skin .  there was no mouth  just a dark hole  as if the thing was itself an opening to an even worse dimension  a place by comparison with which freezing sand and moonless moonlight would be a jolly afternoon at the seaside .   esk held the disc pyramid and flailed with her free hand at the claw around her .  it had no effect .  the darkness loomed over her  a gateway to total oblivion .   she kicked it as hard as she could .   which was not  given the circumstances  very hard .  but where her foot struck there was an explosion of white sparks and a pop   which would have been a much more satisfying bang if the thin air here didn   t suck the sound away .   the thing screeched like a chainsaw encountering  deep inside an unsuspecting sapling  a lurking and long forgotten nail .  the others around it set up a sympathetic buzzing .   esk kicked again and the thing shrieked and dropped her to the sand .  she was bright enough to roll  with the tiny world hugged protectively to her  because even in a dream a broken ankle can be painful .   the thing lurched uncertainly above her .  esk   s eyes narrowed .  she put the world down very carefully  hit the thing very hard around the point where its shins would be  if there were shins under that cloak  and picked up the world again in one neat movement .   the creature howled  bent double  and then toppled slowly  like a sackful of coat hangers .  when it hit the ground it collapsed into a mass of disjointed limbs  the head rolled away and rocked to a standstill .   is that all .  thought esk .  they can hardly walk  even .  when you hit them they just fall over .   the nearest things chittered and tried to back away as she marched determinedly toward them  but since their bodies seemed to be held together more or less by wishful thinking they weren   t very good at it .  she hit one  which had a face like a small family of squid  and it deflated into a pile of twitching bones and bits of fur and odd ends of tentacle  very much like a greek meal .  another was slightly more successful and had begun to shamble uncertainly away before esk caught it a crack on one of its five shins .   it flailed desperately as it fell and brought down another two .   by then the others had managed to lurch out of her way and stood watching from a distance .   esk took a few steps toward the nearest one .  it tried to move away  and fell over .   they may have been ugly .  they may have been evil .  but when it came to poetry in motion  the things had all the grace and coordination of a deck chair .   esk glared at them  and took a look at the disc in its glass pyramid .  all the excitement didn   t seem to have disturbed it a bit .   she   d been able to get out  if this indeed was out and if the disc could be said to be in .  but how was one supposed to get back .   somebody laughed .  it was the sort of laugh     basically  it was p   ch   zarni   chiwkov .  this epiglottis throt tling word is seldom used on the disc except by highly paid stunt linguists and  of course  the tiny tribe of the k   turni  who invented it .  it has no direct synonym  although the cumhoolie word    squernt        the feeling upon finding that the previous occupant of the privy has used all the paper     begins to approach it in general depth of feeling .  the closest translation is as follows   the nasty little sound of a sword being unsheathed right behind one at just the point when one thought one had disposed of one   s enemies     although k   turni speakers say that this does not convey the cold sweating  heart stopping  gut freezing sense of the original .   it was that kind of laugh .   esk turned around slowly .  simon drifted toward her across the sand  with his hands cupped in front of him .  his eyes were tight shut .      did you really think it would be as easy as that .     he said .  or something said  it didn   t sound like simon   s voice  but like dozens of voices speaking at once .      simon .     she said  uncertainly .      he is of no further use to us     said the thing with simon   s shape .     he has shown us the way  child .  now give us our property .      esk backed away .      i don   t think it belongs to you     she said     whoever you are .      the face in front of her opened its eyes .  there was nothing there but blackness   not a color  just holes into some other space .      we could say that if you gave it to us we would be merciful .  we could say we would let you go from here in your own shape .  but there wouldn   t really be much point in us saying that  would there .         i wouldn   t believe you     said esk .      well  then .      the simon thing grinned .      you   re only putting off the inevitable     it said .      suits me .         we could take it anyway .         take it  then .  but i don   t think you can .  you can   t take anything unless it   s given to you  can you .      they circled round .      you   ll give it to us     said the simon thing .   some of the other things were approaching now  striding back across the desert with horrible jerky motions .      you   ll get tired     it continued .     we can wait .  we   re very good at waiting .      it made a feint to the left  but esk swung around to face it .      that doesn   t matter     she said .     i   m only dreaming this  and you can   t get hurt in dreams .      the thing paused  and looked at her with its empty eyes .      have you got a word in your world  i think it   s called    psychosomatic    .         never heard of it     snapped esk .      it means you can get hurt in your dreams .  and what is so interesting is that if you die in your dreams you stay here .  that would be niiiiice .      esk glanced sideways at the distant mountains  sprawled on the chilly horizon like melted mud pies .  there were no trees  not even any rocks .  just sand and cold stars and     she felt the movement rather than heard it and turned with the pyramid held between her hands like a club .  it hit the simon thing in midleap with a satisfying thump  but as soon as it hit the ground it somersaulted forward and bounced upright with unpleasant ease .  but it had heard her gasp and had seen the brief pain in her eyes .  it paused .      ah  that hurt you  did it not .  you don   t like to see another one suffer  yes .  not this one  it seems .      it turned and beckoned  and two of the tall things lurched over to it and gripped it firmly by the arms .   its eyes changed .  the darkness faded  and then simon   s own eyes looked out of his face .  he stared up at the things on either side of him and struggled briefly  but one had several pairs of tentacles wrapped around his wrist and the other was holding his arm in the world   s largest lobster claw .   then he saw esk  and his eyes fell to the little glass pyramid .      run away .     he hissed .     take it away from here .  don   t let them get it .     he grimaced as the claw tightened on his arm .      is this a trick .     said esk .     who are you really .         don   t you recognize me .     he said wretchedly .     what are you doing in my dream .         if this is a dream then i   d like to wake up  please     said esk .      listen .  you must run away now  do you understand .  don   t stand there with your mouth open .      give it to us  said a cold voice inside esk   s head .   esk looked down at the glass pyramid with its unconcerned little world and stared up at simon  her mouth an o of puzzlement .      but what is it .         look hard at it .      esk peered through the glass .  if she squinted it seemed that the little disc was granular  as if it was made up of millions of tiny specks .  if she looked hard at the specks        it   s just numbers .     she said .     the whole world   it   s all made up of numbers           it   s not the world  it   s an idea of the world     said simon .     i created it for them .  they can   t get through to us  do you see  but ideas have got a shape here .  ideas are real .      give it to us .      but ideas can   t hurt anyone .         i turned things into numbers to understand them  but they just want to control     simon said bitterly .     they burrowed into my numbers like        he screamed .   give it to us or we will take him to bits .   esk looked up at the nearest nightmare face .      how do i know i can trust you .     she said .   you can   t trust us .  but you have no choice .   esk looked at the ring of faces that not even a necrophile could love  faces put together from a fishmonger   s midden  faces picked randomly from things that lurked in deep ocean holes and haunted caves  faces that were not human enough to gloat or leer but had all the menace of a suspiciously v shaped ripple near an incautious bather .   she couldn   t trust them .  but she had no choice .      something else was happening  in a place as far away as the thickness of a shadow .   the student wizards had run back to the great hall  where cutangle and granny weatherwax were still locked in the magical equivalent of indian arm wrestling .  the flagstones under granny were half melted and cracked and the table behind cutangle had taken root and already bore a rich crop of acorns .   one of the students had earned several awards for bravery by daring to tug at cutangle   s cloak     and now they were crowded into the narrow room  looking at the two bodies .   cutangle summoned doctors of the body and doctors of the mind  and the room buzzed with magic as they got to work .   granny tapped him on the shoulder .      a word in your ear  young man     she said .      hardly young  madam     sighed cutangle     hardly young .     he felt drained .  it had been decades since he   d dueled in magic  although it was common enough among students .  he had a nasty feeling that granny would have won eventually .  fighting her was like swatting a fly on your own nose .  he couldn   t think what had come over him to try it .   granny led him out into the passage and around the corner to a window seat .  she sat down  leaning her broomstick against the wall .  rain drummed heavily on the roofs outside  and a few zigzags of lightning indicated a storm of ramtop proportions approaching the city .      that was quite an impressive display     she said     you nearly won once or twice there .         oh     said cutangle  brightening up .     do you really think so .      granny nodded .   cutangle patted at various bits of his robe until he located a tarry bag of tobacco and a roll of paper .  his hands shook as he fumbled a few shreds of secondhand pipeweed into a skinny homemade .  he ran the wretched thing across his tongue  and barely moistened it .  then a dim remembrance of propriety welled up in the back of his mind .      um     he said     do you mind if i smoke .      granny shrugged .  cutangle struck a match on the wall and tried desperately to navigate the flame and the cigarette into approximately the same position .  granny gently took the match from his trembling hand and lit it for him .   cutangle sucked on the tobacco  had a ritual cough and settled back  the glowing end of the rollup the only light in the dim corridor .      they   ve gone wandering     said granny at last .      i know     said cutangle .      your wizards won   t be able to get them back .         i know that  too .         they might get something back  though .         i wish you hadn   t said that .      there was a pause while they contemplated what might come back  inhabiting living bodies  acting almost like the original inhabitants .      it   s probably my fault       they said in unison  and stopped in astonishment .      you first  madam     said cutangle .      them cigaretty things     asked granny     are they good for the nerves .      cutangle opened his mouth to point out very courteously that tobacco was a habit reserved for wizards  but thought better of it .  he extended the tobacco pouch toward granny .   she told him about esk   s birth  and the coming of the old wizard  and the staff  and esk   s forays into magic .  by the time she had finished she had succeeded in rolling a tight  thin cylinder that burned with a small blue flame and made her eyes water .      i don   t know that shaky nerves wouldn   t be better     she wheezed .   cutangle wasn   t listening .      this is quite astonishing     he said .     you say the child didn   t suffer in any way .         not that i noticed     said granny .     the staff seemed   well  on her side  if you know what i mean .         and where is this staff now .         she said she threw it in the river        the old wizard and the elderly witch stared at each other  their faces illuminated by a flare of lightning outside .   cutangle shook his head .     the river   s flooding     he said .     it   s a million to one chance .      granny smiled grimly .  it was the sort of smile that wolves ran away from .  granny grasped her broomstick purposefully .      million to one chances     she said     crop up nine times out of ten .         there are storms that are frankly theatrical  all sheet lightning and metallic thunder rolls .  there are storms that are tropical and sultry  and incline to hot winds and fireballs .  but this was a storm of the circle sea plains  and its main ambition was to hit the ground with as much rain as possible .  it was the kind of storm that suggests that the whole sky has swallowed a diuretic .  the thunder and lightning hung around in the background  supplying a sort of chorus  but the rain was the star of the show .  it tap danced across the land .   the grounds of the university stretched right down to the river .  by day they were a neat formal pattern of gravel paths and hedges  but in the middle of a wet wild night the hedges seemed to have moved and the paths had simply gone off somewhere to stay dry .   a weak wyrdlight shone inefficiently among the dripping leaves .  but most of the rain found its way through anyway .      can you use one of them wizard fireballs .         have a heart  madam .         are you sure she would have come this way .         there   s a sort of jetty thing down here somewhere  unless i   m lost .      there was the sound of a heavy body blundering wetly into a bush  and then a splash .      i   ve found the river  anyway .      granny weatherwax peered through the soaking darkness .  she could hear a roaring and could dimly make out the white crests of floodwater .  there was also the distinctive river smell of the ankh  which suggested that several armies had used it first as a urinal and then as a sepulcher .   cutangle splashed dejectedly toward her .      this is foolishness     he said     meaning no offense  madam .  but it   ll be out to sea on this flood .  and i   ll die of cold .         you can   t get any wetter than you are now .  anyway  you walk wrong for rain .         i beg your pardon .         you go all hunched up  you fight it  that   s not the way .  you should   well  move between the drops .     and  indeed  granny seemed to be merely damp .      i   ll bear that in mind .  come on  madam .  it   s me for a roaring fire and a glass of something hot and wicked .      granny sighed .     i don   t know .  somehow i expected to see it sticking out of the mud  or something .  not just all this water .      cutangle patted her gently on the shoulder .      there may be something else we can do       he began  and was interrupted by a zip of lightning and another roll of thunder .      i said maybe there   s something       he began again .      what was that i saw .     demanded granny .      what was what .     said cutangle  bewildered .      give me some light .      the wizard sighed wetly  and extended a hand .  a bolt of golden fire shot out across the foaming water and hissed into oblivion .      there .     said granny triumphantly .      it   s just a boat     said cutangle .     the boys use them in the summer        he waded after granny   s determined figure as fast as he could .      you can   t be thinking of taking it out on a night like this     he said .     it   s madness .      granny slithered along the wet planking of the jetty  which was already nearly under water .      you don   t know anything about boats .     cutangle protested .      i shall have to learn quickly  then     replied granny calmly .      but i haven   t been in a boat since i was a boy .         i wasn   t actually asking you to come .  does the pointy bit go in front .      cutangle moaned .      this is all very creditable     he said     but perhaps we can wait till morning .      a flash of lightning illuminated granny   s face .      perhaps not     cutangle conceded .  he lumbered along the jetty and pulled the little rowing boat toward him .  getting in was a matter of luck but he managed it eventually  fumbling with the painter in the darkness .   the boat swung out into the flood and was carried away  spinning slowly .   granny clung to the seat as it rocked in the turbulent waters  and looked expectantly at cutangle through the murk .      well .     she said .      well what .     said cutangle .      you said you knew all about boats .         no .  i said you didn   t .         oh .      they hung on as the boat wallowed heavily  miraculously righted itself  and was carried backward downstream .      when you said you hadn   t been in a boat since you were a boy       granny began .      i was two years old  i think .      the boat caught on a whirlpool  spun around  and shot off across the flow .      i had you down as the sort of boy who was in and out of boats all day long .         i was born up in the mountains .  i get seasick on damp grass  if you must know     said cutangle .   the boat banged heavily against a submerged tree trunk  and a wavelet lapped the prow .      i know a spell against drowning     he added miserably .      i   m glad about that .         only you have to say it while you   re standing on dry land .         take your boots off .     granny commanded .      what .         take your boots off  man .      cutangle shifted uneasily on his bench .      what have you in mind .     he said .      the water is supposed to be outside the boat  i know that much .     granny pointed to the dark tide sloshing around the bilges     fill your boots with water and tip it over the side .      cutangle nodded .  he felt that the last couple of hours had somehow carried him along without him actually touching the sides  and for a moment he nursed the strangely consoling feeling that his life was totally beyond his control and whatever happened no one could blame him .  filling his boots with water while adrift on a flooded river at midnight with what he could only describe as a woman seemed about as logical as anything could be in the circumstances .   a fine figure of a woman  said a neglected voice at the back of his mind .  there was something about the way she used the tattered broomstick to scull the boat across the choppy water that troubled long forgotten bits of cutangle   s subconscious .   not that he could be certain about the fine figure  of course  what with the rain and the wind and granny   s habit of wearing her entire wardrobe in one go .  cutangle cleared his throat uncertainly .  metaphorically a fine figure  he decided .      um  look     he said .     this is all very creditable  but consider the facts  i mean  the rate of drift and so forth  you see .  it could be miles out on the ocean by now .  it might never come to shore again .  it might even go over the rimfall .      granny  who had been staring out across the water  turned around .      can   t you think of anything else at all helpful that we could be doing .     she demanded .   cutangle bailed for a few moments .      no     he said .      have you ever heard of anyone coming back .         no .         then it   s worth a try  isn   t it .         i never liked the ocean     said cutangle .     it ought to be paved over .  there   s dreadful things in it  down in the deep bits .  ghastly sea monsters .  or so they say .         keep bailing  my lad  or you   ll be able to see if they   re right .      the storm rolled backward and forward overhead .  it was lost here on the flat river plains  it belonged in the high ramtops  where they knew how to appreciate a good storm .  it grumbled around  looking for even a moderately high hill to throw lightning at .   the rain settled down to the gentle patter of rain that is quite capable of keeping it up for days .  a sea fog also rolled in to assist it .      if we had some oars we could row  if we knew where we were going     said cutangle .  granny didn   t answer .   he heaved a few more bootfuls of water over the side  and it occurred to him that the gold braiding on his robe would probably never be the same again .  it would be nice to think it might matter  one day .      i don   t suppose you do know which way the hub is  by any chance .     he ventured .     just making conversation .         look for the mossy side of trees     said granny without turning her head .      ah     said cutangle  and nodded .   he peered down gloomily at the oily waters  and wondered which particular oily waters they were .  judging by the salty smell they were out in the bay now .   what really terrified him about the sea was that the only thing between him and the horrible things that lived at the bottom of it was water .  of course  he knew that logically the only thing that separated him from  say  the man eating tigers in the jungles of klatch was mere distance  but that wasn   t the same thing at all .  tigers didn   t rise up out of the chilly depths  mouths full of needle teeth     he shivered .      can   t you feel it .     asked granny .     you can taste it in the air .  magic .  it   s leaking out from something .         it   s not actually water soluble     said cutangle .  he smacked his lips once or twice .  there was indeed a tinny taste to the fog  he had to admit  and a faint greasiness to the air .      you   re a wizard     said granny  severely .     can   t you call it up or something .         the question has never arisen     said cutangle .     wizards never throw their staffs away .         it   s around here somewhere     snapped granny .     help me look for it  man .      cutangle groaned .  it had been a busy night  and before he tried any more magic he really needed twelve hours    sleep  several good meals  and a quiet afternoon in front of a big fire .  he was getting too old  that was the trouble .  but he closed his eyes and concentrated .   there was magic around  all right .  there are some places where magic naturally accumulates .  it builds up around deposits of the transmundane metal octiron  in the wood of certain trees  in isolated lakes  it sleets through the world and those skilled in such things can catch it and store it .  there was a store of magic in the area .      it   s potent     he said .     very potent .     he raised his hands to his temples .      it   s getting bloody cold     said granny .  the insistent rain had turned to snow .   there was a sudden change in the world .  the boat stopped  not with a jar  but as if the sea had suddenly decided to become solid .  granny looked over the side .   the sea had become solid .  the sound of the waves was coming from a long way away and getting farther away all the time .   she leaned over the side of the boat and tapped on the water .      ice     she said .  the boat was motionless in an ocean of ice .  it creaked ominously .   cutangle nodded slowly .      it makes sense     he said .     if they are   where we think they are  then it   s very cold .  as cold as the night between the stars  it is said .  so the staff feels it too .         right     said granny  and stepped out of the boat .     all we have to do is find the middle of the ice and there   s the staff  right .         i knew you were going to say that .  can i at least put my boots on .      they wandered across the frozen waves  with cutangle stopping occasionally to try and sense the exact location of the staff .  his robes were freezing on him .  his teeth chattered .      aren   t you cold .     he said to granny  whose dress fairly crackled as she walked .      i   m cold     she conceded     i just ain   t shivering .         we used to have winters like this when i was a lad     said cutangle  blowing on his fingers .     it doesn   t snow in ankh  hardly .         really     said granny  peering ahead through the freezing fog .      there was snow on the tops of the mountains all year round  i recall .  oh  you don   t get temperatures like you did when i was a boy .      at least  until now     he added  stamping his feet on the ice .  it creaked menacingly  reminding him that it was all that lay between him and the bottom of the sea .  he stamped again  as softly as possible .      what mountains were these .     asked granny .      oh  the ramtops .  up toward the hub  in fact .  place called brass neck .      granny   s lips moved .     cutangle  cutangle     she said softly .     any relation to old acktur cutangle .  used to live in a big old house under leaping mountain  had a lot of sons .         my father .  how on disc d   you know that .         i was raised up there     said granny  resisting the temptation merely to smile knowingly .     next valley .  bad ass .  i remember your mother .  nice woman  kept brown and white chickens  i used to go up there to buy eggs for me mam .  that was before i was called to witching  of course .         i don   t remember you     said cutangle .     of course  it was a long time ago .  there was always a lot of children around our house .     he sighed .     i suppose it   s possible i pulled your hair once .  it was the sort of thing i used to do .         maybe .  i remember a fat little boy .  rather unpleasant .         that might have been me .  i seem to recall a rather bossy girl  but it was a long time ago .  a long time ago .         i didn   t have white hair in those days     said granny .      everything was a different color in those days .         that   s true .         it didn   t rain so much in the summer time .         the sunsets were redder .         there were more old people .  the world was full of them     said the wizard .      yes  i know .  and now it   s full of young people .  funny  really .  i mean  you   d expect it to be the other way round .         they even had a better kind of air .  it was easier to breathe     said cutangle .  they stamped on through the swirling snow  considering the curious ways of time and nature .      ever been home again .     said granny .   cutangle shrugged .     when my father died .  it   s odd  i   ve never said this to anyone  but   well  there were my brothers  because i am an eighth son of course  and they had children and even grandchildren  and not one of them can hardly write his name .  i could have bought the whole village .  and they treated me like a king  but   i mean  i   ve been to places and seen things that would curdle their minds  i   ve faced down creatures wilder than their nightmares  i know secrets that are known to a very few           you felt left out     said granny .     there   s nothing strange in that .  it happens to all of us .  it was our choice .         wizards should never go home     said cutangle .      i don   t think they can go home     agreed granny .     you can   t cross the same river twice  i always say .      cutangle gave this some thought .      i think you   re wrong there     he said .     i must have crossed the same river  oh  thousands of times .         ah  but it wasn   t the same river .         it wasn   t .         no .      cutangle shrugged .     it looked like the same bloody river .         no need to take that tone     said granny .     i don   t see why i should listen to that sort of language from a wizard who can   t even answer letters .      cutangle was silent for a moment  except for the castanet chatter of his teeth .      oh     he said .     oh  i see .  they were from you  were they .         that   s right .  i signed them on the bottom .  it   s supposed to be a sort of clue  isn   t it .         all right  all right .  i just thought they were a joke  that   s all     said cutangle sullenly .      a joke .         we don   t get many applications from women .  we don   t get any        i wondered why i didn   t get a reply     said granny .      i threw them away  if you must know .         you could at least have   there it is .         where .  where .  oh  there .      the fog parted and they now saw it clearly   a fountain of snowflakes  an ornamental pillar of frozen air .  and below it     the staff wasn   t locked in ice  but lay peacefully in a seething pool of water .   one of the unusual aspects of a magical universe is the existence of opposites .  it has already been remarked that darkness isn   t the opposite of light  it is simply the absence of light .  in the same way absolute zero is merely the absence of heat .  if you want to know what real cold is  the cold so intense that water can   t even freeze but anti boils  look no further than this pool .   they looked in silence for some seconds  their bickering forgotten .  then cutangle said slowly     if you stick your hand in that  your fingers   ll snap like carrots .         do you think you can lift it out by magic .     said granny .   cutangle started to pat his pockets and eventually produced his rollup bag .  with expert fingers he shredded the remains of a few dogends into a fresh paper and licked it into shape  without taking his eyes off the staff .      no     he said .     but i   ll try anyway .      he looked longingly at the cigarette and then poked it behind his ear .  he extended his hands  fingers splayed  and his lips moved soundlessly as he mumbled a few words of power .   the staff spun in its pool and then rose gently away from the ice  where it immediately became the center of a cocoon of frozen air .  cutangle groaned with the effort   direct levitation is the hardest of the practical magics  because of the ever present danger of the well known principles of action and reaction  which means that a wizard attempting to lift a heavy item by mind power alone faces the prospect of ending up with his brains in his boots .      can you stand it upright .     said granny .   with great delicacy the staff turned slowly in the air until it hung in front of granny a few inches above the ice .  frost glittered on its carvings  but it seemed to cutangle   through the red haze of migraine that hovered in front of his eyes   to be watching him .  resentfully .   granny adjusted her hat and straightened up purposefully .      right     she said .  cutangle swayed .  the tone of voice cut through him like a diamond saw .  he could dimly remember being scolded by his mother when he was small  well  this was that voice  only refined and concentrated and edged with little bits of carborundum  a tone of command that would have a corpse standing to attention and could probably have marched it halfway across its cemetery before it remembered it was dead .   granny stood in front of the hovering staff  almost melting its icy covering by the sheer anger in her gaze .      this is your idea of proper behavior  is it .  lying around on the sea while people die .  oh  very well done .      she stomped around in a semicircle .  to cutangle   s bewilderment  the staff turned to follow her .      so you were thrown away     snapped granny .     so what .  she   s hardly more than a child  and children throw us all away sooner or later .  is this loyal service .  have you no shame  lying around sulking when you could be of some use at last .      she leaned forward  her hooked nose a few inches from the staff .  cutangle was almost certain that the staff tried to lean backward out of her way .      shall i tell you what happens to wicked staffs .     she hissed .     if esk is lost to the world  shall i tell you what i will do to you .  you were saved from the fire once  because you could pass on the hurt to her .  next time it won   t be the fire .      her voice sank to a whiplash whisper .      first it   ll be the spokeshave .  and then the sandpaper  and the auger  and the whittling knife           i say  steady on     said cutangle  his eyes watering .         and what   s left i   ll stake out in the woods for the fungus and the woodlice and the beetles .  it could take years .      the carvings writhed .  most of them had moved around the back  out of granny   s gaze .      now     she said .     i   ll tell you what i   m going to do .  i   m going to pick you up and we are all going back to the university  aren   t we .  otherwise it   s blunt saw time .      she rolled up her sleeves and extended a hand .      wizard     she said     i shall want you to release it .      cutangle nodded miserably .      when i say now  now .  now .         cutangle opened his eyes again .   granny was standing with her left arm extended full length in front of her  her hand clamped around the staff .   the ice was exploding off it  in gouts of steam .      right     finished granny     and if this happens again i shall be very angry  do i make myself clear .      cutangle lowered his hands and hurried toward her .      are you hurt .      she shook her head .     it   s like holding a hot icicle     she said .     come on  we haven   t got time to stand around chatting .         how are we going to get back .         oh  show some backbone  man  for goodness sake .  we   ll fly .      granny waved her broomstick .  the archchancellor looked at it doubtfully .      on that .         of course .  don   t wizards fly on their staffs .         it   s rather undignified .         if i can put up with that  so can you .         yes  but is it safe .      granny gave him a withering look .      do you mean in the absolute sense .     she asked .     or  say  compared with staying behind on a melting ice floe .            this is the first time i have ever ridden on a broomstick     said cutangle .      really .         i thought you just had to get on them and they flew     said the wizard .     i didn   t know you had to do all that running up and down and shouting at them .         it   s a knack     said granny .      i thought they went faster     cutangle continued     and  to be frank  higher .         what do you mean  higher .     asked granny  trying to compensate for the wizard   s weight on the pillion as they turned back upriver .  like pillion passengers since the dawn of time  he persisted in leaning the wrong way .      well  more sort of above the trees     said cutangle  ducking as a dripping branch swept his hat away .      there   s nothing wrong with this broomstick that you losing a few stone wouldn   t cure     snapped granny .     or would you rather get off and walk .         apart from the fact that half the time my feet are touching the ground anyway     said cutangle .     i wouldn   t want to embarrass you .  if someone had asked me to list all the perils of flying  you know  it would never have occurred to me to include having one   s legs whipped to death by tall bracken .         are you smoking .     said granny  staring grimly ahead .     something   s burning .         it was just to calm my nerves what with all this headlong plunging through the air  madam .         well  put it out this minute .  and hold on .      the broomstick lurched upward and increased its speed to that of a geriatric jogger .      mr .  wizard .         hallo .         when i said hold on           yes .         i didn   t mean there .      there was a pause .      oh .  yes .  i see .  i   m terribly sorry .         that   s all right .         my memory isn   t what it was   i assure you   no offense meant .         none taken .      they flew in silence for a moment .      nevertheless     said granny thoughtfully     i think that  on the whole  i would prefer you to move your hands .         rain gushed across the leads of unseen university and poured into the gutters where ravens    nests  abandoned since the summer  floated like very badly built boats .  the water gurgled along ancient  crusted pipes .  it found its way under tiles and said hallo to the spiders under the eaves .  it leapt from gables and formed secret lakes high amongst the spires .   whole ecologies lived in the endless rooftops of the university  which by comparison made gormenghast look like a toolshed on a railway allotment  birds sang in tiny jungles grown from apple pips and weed seeds  little frogs swam in the upper gutters  and a colony of ants were busily inventing an interesting and complex civilization .   one thing the water couldn   t do was gurgle out of the ornamental gargoyles ranged around the roofs .  this was because the gargoyles wandered off and sheltered in the attics at the first sign of rain .  they held that just because you were ugly it didn   t mean you were stupid .   it rained streams .  it rained rivers .  it rained seas .  but mainly it rained through the roof of the great hall  where the duel between granny and cutangle had left a very large hole  and treatle felt that it was somehow raining on him personally .   he stood on a table organizing the teams of students who were taking down the paintings and ancient tapestries before they got soaked .  it had to be a table  because the floor was already several inches deep in water .   not rainwater  unfortunately .  this was water with real personality  the kind of distinctive character water gets after a long journey through silty countryside .  it had the thick texture of authentic ankh water   too stiff to drink  too runny to plough .   the river had burst its banks and a million little water courses were flowing backward  bursting in through the cellars and playing peek a boo under the flagstones .  there was the occasional distant boom as some forgotten magic in a drowned dungeon shorted out and surrendered up its power  treatle wasn   t at all keen on some of the unpleasant bubblings and hissings that were escaping to the surface .   he thought again how nice it would be to be the sort of wizard who lived in a little cave somewhere and collected herbs and thought significant thoughts and knew what the owls were saying .  but probably the cave would be damp and the herbs would be poisonous and treatle could never be sure  when all was said and done  exactly what thoughts were really significant .   he got down awkwardly and paddled through the dark swirling waters .  well  he had done his best .  he   d tried to organize the senior wizards into repairing the roof by magic  but there was a general argument over the spells that could be used and a consensus that this was in any case work for artisans .   that   s wizards for you  he thought gloomily as he waded between the dripping arches  always probing the infinite but never noticing the definite  especially in the matter of household chores .  we never had this trouble before that woman came .   he squelched up the steps  lit by a particularly impressive flash of lightning .  he had a cold certainty that while of course no one could possibly blame him for all this  everybody would .  he seized the hem of his robe and wrung it out wretchedly  then he reached for his tobacco pouch .   it was a nice green waterproof one .  that meant that all the rain that had got into it couldn   t get out again .  it was indescribable .   he found his little clip of papers .  they were fused into one lump  like the legendary pound note found in the back pockets of trousers after they have been washed  spun  dried and ironed .      bugger     he said  with feeling .      i say .  treatle .      treatle looked around .  he had been the last to leave the hall  where even now some of the benches were beginning to float .  whirlpools and patches of bubble marked the spots where magic was leaking from the cellars  but there was no one to be seen .   unless  of course  one of the statues had spoken .  they had been too heavy to move  and treatle remembered telling the students that a thorough wash would probably do them good .   he looked at their stern faces and regretted it .  the statues of very powerful dead mages were sometimes more lifelike than statues had any right to be .  maybe he should have kept his voice down .      yes .     he ventured  acutely aware of the stony stares .      up here  you fool .      he looked up .  the broomstick descended heavily through the rain in a series of swoops and jerks .  about five feet above the water it lost its few remaining aerial pretensions  and flopped noisily into a whirlpool .      don   t stand there  idiot .      treatle peered nervously into the gloom .      i   ve got to stand somewhere     he said .      i mean give us a hand .     snapped cutangle  rising from the wavelets like a fat and angry venus .     the lady first  of course .      he turned to granny  who was fishing around in the water .      i   ve lost my hat     she said .   cutangle sighed .     does that really matter at a time like this .         a witch has got to have a hat  otherwise who   s to know .     said granny .  she made a grab as something dark and sodden drifted by  cackled triumphantly  tipped out the water and rammed the hat on her head .  it had lost its stiffening and flopped rather rakishly over one eye .      right     she said  in a tone of voice that suggested the whole universe had just better watch out .   there was another brilliant flash of lightning  which shows that even the weather gods have a well developed sense of theater .      it rather suits you     said cutangle .      excuse me     said treatle     but isn   t she the w           never mind that     said cutangle  taking granny   s hand and helping her up the steps .  he flourished the staff .      but it   s against the lore to allow w        he stopped and stared as granny reached out and touched the damp wall by the door .  cutangle tapped him on the chest .      show me where it   s written down     said cutangle .      they   re in the library     granny interrupted .      it was the only dry place     said treatle     but           this building is frightened of thunderstorms     said granny .     it could do with comforting .         but the lore       repeated treatle desperately .   granny was already striding down the passage  with cutangle hopping along behind .  he turned .      you heard the lady     he said .   treatle watched them go  with his mouth hanging open .  when their footsteps had died away in the distance he stood silently for a moment  thinking about life and where his could have gone wrong .   however  he wasn   t going to be accused of disobedience .   very carefully  without knowing exactly why  he reached out and gave the wall a friendly pat .      there  there     he said .   strangely enough  he felt a lot better .      it occurred to cutangle that he ought to lead the way in his own premises  but granny in a hurry was no match for a near terminal nicotine addict and he kept up only by a sort of crabwise leaping .      it   s this way     he said  splashing through the puddles .      i know .  the building told me .         yes  i was meaning to ask about that     said cutangle     because you see it   s never said anything to me and i   ve lived here for years .         have you ever listened to it .         not exactly listened  no     cutangle conceded .     not as such .         well then     said granny  edging past a waterfall where the kitchen steps used to be  mrs .  whitlow   s washing would never be the same again  .     i think it   s up here and along the passage  isn   t it .      she swept past a trio of astonished wizards  who were surprised by her and completely startled by her hat .   cutangle panted after her and caught her arm at the doors to the library .      look     he said desperately     no offense  miss   um  mistress           i think esmerelda will suffice now .  what with us having shared a broomstick and everything .         can i go in front .  it is my library     he begged .   granny turned around  her face a mask of surprise .  then she smiled .      of course .  i   m so sorry .         for the look of the thing  you see     said cutangle apologetically .  he pushed the door open .   the library was full of wizards  who care about their books in the same way that ants care about their eggs and in time of difficulty carry them around in much the same way .  the water was getting in even here  and turning up in rather odd places because of the library   s strange gravitational effects .  all the lower shelves had been cleared and relays of wizards and students were pilling the volumes on every available table and dry shelf .  the air was full of the sound of angry rustling pages  which almost drowned out the distant fury of the storm .   this was obviously upsetting the librarian  who was scurrying from wizard to wizard  tugging ineffectually at their robes and shouting    ook .      he spotted cutangle and knuckled rapidly toward him .  granny had never seen an orangutan before  but wasn   t about to admit it  and remained quite calm in the face of a small pot bellied man with extremely long arms and a size    skin on a size   body .      ook     it explained     ooook .         i expect so     said cutangle shortly  and grabbed the nearest wizard  who was tottering under the weight of a dozen grimoires .  the man stared at him as if he were a ghost  looked sideways at granny  and dropped the books on the floor .  the librarian winced .      archchancellor .     gasped the wizard     you   re alive .  i mean   we heard you   d been spirited away by       he looked at granny again        i mean  we thought   treatle told us           oook     said the librarian  shooing some pages back between their covers .      where are young simon and the girl .  what have you done with them .     granny demanded .      they   we put them over here     said the wizard  backing away .     um           show us     said cutangle .     and stop stuttering  man  you think you   d never seen a woman before .      the wizard swallowed hard and nodded vigorously .      certainly .  and   i mean   please follow me   um           you weren   t going to say anything about the lore  were you .     asked cutangle .      um   no  archchancellor .         good .      they followed hard on his trodden down heels as he scurried between the toiling wizards  most of whom stopped working to stare as granny strode past .      this is getting embarrassing     said cutangle  out of the corner of his mouth .     i shall have to declare you an honorary wizard .      granny stared straight ahead and her lips hardly moved .      you do     she hissed     and i will declare you an honorary witch .      cutangle   s mouth snapped shut .   esk and simon were lying on a table in one of the side reading rooms  with half a dozen wizards watching over them .  they drew back nervously as the trio approached  with the librarian swinging along behind .      i   ve been thinking     said cutangle .     surely it would be better to give the staff to simon .  he is a wizard  and           over my dead body     said granny .     yours  too .  they   re getting their power through him  do you want to give them more .      cutangle sighed .  he had been admiring the staff  it was one of the best he had seen .      very well .  you   re right  of course .      he leaned down and laid the staff on esk   s sleeping form  and then stood back dramatically .   nothing happened .   one of the wizards coughed nervously .   nothing continued to happen .   the carvings on the staff appeared to be grinning .      it   s not working     said cutangle     is it .         ook .         give it time     said granny .   they gave it time .  outside the storm strode around the sky  trying to lift the lids off houses .   granny sat down on a pile of books and rubbed her eyes .  cutangle   s hands strayed toward his tobacco pocket .  the wizard with the nervous cough was helped out of the room by a colleague .      ook     said the librarian .      i know .     said granny  so that cutangle   s half rolled homemade shot out of his nerveless fingers in a shower of tobacco .      what .         it   s not finished .         what .         she can   t use the staff  of course     said granny  standing up .      but you said she swept the floors with it and it protects her and       cutangle began .      nonono     said granny .     that means the staff uses itself or it uses her  but she   s never been able to use it  d   you see .      cutangle stared at the two quiet bodies .     she should be able to use it .  it   s a proper wizard   s staff .         oh     said granny .     so she   s a proper wizard  is she .      cutangle hesitated .      well  of course not .  you can   t ask us to declare her a wizard .  where   s the precedent .         the what .     asked granny  sharply .      it   s never happened before .         lots of things have never happened before .  we   re only born once .      cutangle gave her a look of mute appeal .     but it   s against the l        he began to say    lore     but the word mumbled into silence .      where does it say it .     said granny triumphantly .     where does it say women can   t be wizards .      the following thoughts sped through cutangle   s mind      it doesn   t say it anywhere  it says it everywhere .      but young simon seemed to say that everywhere is much like nowhere that you can   t really tell the difference .      do i want to be remembered as the first archchancellor to allow women into the university .  still   i   d be remembered that   s for sure .      she really is a rather impressive woman when she stands in that sort of way .      that staff has got ideas of its own .      there   s a sort of sense to it .      i would be laughed at .      it might not work .      it might work .      she couldn   t trust them .  but she had no choice .   esk stared at the terrible faces peering down at her  and the lanky bodies  mercifully cloaked .   her hands tingled .   in the shadow world  ideas are real .  the thought seemed to travel up her arms .   it was a buoyant sort of thought  a thought full of fizz .  she laughed  and moved her hands apart  and the staff sparkled in her hands like solid electricity .   the things started to chitter nervously and one or two at the back started to lurch away .  simon fell forward as his captor hastily let go  and he landed on his hands and knees in the sand .      use it .     he shouted .     that   s it .  they   re frightened .      esk gave him a smile  and continued to examine the staff .  for the first time she could see what the carvings actually were .   simon snatched up the pyramid of the world and ran toward her .      come on .     he said .     they hate it .         pardon .     said esk .      use the staff     said simon urgently  and reached out for it .     hey .  it bit me .         sorry     said esk .     what were we talking about .     she looked up and regarded the keening things as it were for the first time .     oh  those .  they only exist inside our heads .  if we didn   t believe in them  they wouldn   t exist at all .      simon looked around at them .      i can   t honestly say i believe you     he said .      i think we should go home now     said esk .     people will be worrying .      she moved her hands together and the staff vanished  although for a moment her hands glowed as though they were cupped around a candle .   the things howled .  a few of them fell over .      the important thing about magic is how you don   t use it     said esk  taking simon   s arm .   he stared at the crumbling figures around him  and grinned foolishly .      you don   t use it .     he queried .      oh yes     said esk  as they walked toward the things .     try it yourself .      she extended her hands  brought the staff out of the air  and offered it to him .  he went to take it  then drew back his hand .      uh  no     he said     i don   t think it likes me much .         i think it   s all right if i give it to you .  it can   t really argue with that     said esk .      where does it go .         it just becomes an idea of itself  i think .      he reached out his hand again and closed his fingers around the shining wood .      right     he said  and raised it in the classical revengeful wizard   s pose .     i   ll show them .         no  wrong .         what do you mean  wrong .  i   ve got the power .         they   re sort of   reflections of us     said esk .     you can   t beat your reflections  they   ll always be as strong as you are .  that   s why they draw nearer to you when you start using magic .  and they don   t get tired .  they feed off magic  so you can   t beat them with magic .  no  the thing is   well  not using magic because you can   t  that   s no use at all .  but not using magic because you can  that really upsets them .  they hate the idea .  if people stopped using magic they   d die .      the things ahead of them fell over each other in their haste to back away .   simon looked at the staff  then at esk  then at the things then back at the staff .      this needs a lot of thinking about     he said uncertainly    i   d really like to work this out .         i expect you   ll do it very well .         because you   re saying that the real power is when you go right through magic and out the other side .         it works  though  doesn   t it .      they were alone on the cold plain now .  the things were distant stick figures .      i wonder if this is what they mean by sorcery .     said simon .      i don   t know .  it might be .         i   d really like to work this out     said simon again  turning the staff over and over in his hands .     we could set up some experiments  you know  into deliberately not using magic .  we could carefully not draw an octogram on the floor  and we could deliberately not call up all sorts of things  and   it makes me sweat just to think about it .         i   d like to think about how to get home     said esk  looking down at the pyramid .      well  that is supposed to be my idea of the world .  i should be able to find a way .  how do you do this thing with the hands .      he moved his hands together .  the staff slid between them  the light glowing through his fingers for a moment  and then vanished .  he grinned .     right .  now all we have to do is look for the university           cutangle lit his third rollup from the stub of the second .  this last cigarette owed a lot to the creative powers of nervous energy  and looked like a camel with the legs cut off .   he had already watched the staff lift itself gently from esk and land on simon .   now it had floated up into the air again .   other wizards had crowded into the room .  the librarian was sitting under the table .      if only we had some idea what is going on     said cutangle .     it   s the suspense i can   t stand .         think positively  man     snapped granny .     and put out that bloody cigarette  i can   t imagine anyone wanting to come back to a room that smells like a fireplace .      as one man the assembled college of wizards turned their faces toward cutangle  expectantly .   he took the smoldering mess out of his mouth and  with a glare that none of the assembled wizards cared to meet  trod it underfoot .      probably time i gave it up anyway     he said .     that goes for the rest of you  too .  worse than an ashpit in this place  sometimes .      then he saw the staff .  it was     the only way cutangle could describe the effect was that it seemed to be going very fast while staying in exactly the same place .   streamers of gas flared away from it and vanished  if they were gas .  it blazed like a comet designed by an inept special effects man .  colored sparks leapt out and disappeared somewhere .   it was also changing color  starting with a dull red and then climbing through the spectrum until it was a painful violet .  snakes of white fire coruscated along its length .    there should be a word for words that sound like things would sound like if they made a noise  he thought .  the word    glisten    does indeed gleam oilily  and if there was ever a word that sounded exactly the way sparks look as they creep across burned paper  or the way the lights of cities would creep across the world if the whole of human civilization was crammed into one night  then you couldn   t do better than    coruscate .       he knew what would happen next .      look out     he whispered .     it   s going to go        in total silence  in the kind of silence in fact that sucks in sounds and stifles them  the staff flashed into pure octarine along the whole of its length .   the eighth color  produced by light falling through a strong magical field  blazed out through bodies and bookshelves and walls .  other colors blurred and ran together  as though the light was a glass of gin poured over the watercolor painting of the world .  the clouds over the university glowed  twisted into fascinating and unexpected shapes  and streamed upward .   an observer above the disc would have seen a little patch of land near the circle sea sparkle like a jewel for several seconds  then wink out .   the silence of the room was broken by a wooden clatter as the staff dropped out of the air and bounced on the table .   someone said    ook     very faintly .   cutangle eventually remembered how to use his hands and raised them to where he hoped his eyes would be .  everything had gone black .      is   anyone else there .     he said .      gods  you don   t know how glad i am to hear you say that     said another voice .  the silence was suddenly full of babble .      are we still where we were .         i don   t know .  where were we .         here  i think .         can you reach out .         not unless i am quite certain about what i   m going to touch  my good man     said the unmistakable voice of granny weatherwax .      everyone try and reach out     said cutangle  and choked down a scream as a hand like a warm leather glove closed around his ankle .  there was a satisfied little    ook     which managed to convey relief  comfort and the sheer joy of touching a fellow human being or  in this case  anthropoid .   there was a scratch and then a blessed flare of red light as a wizard on the far side of the room lit a cigarette .      who did that .         sorry  archchancellor  force of habit .         smoke all you like  that man .         thank you  archchancellor .         i think i can see the outline of the door now     said another voice .      granny .         yes  i can definitely see           esk .         i   m here  granny .         can i smoke too  sir .         is the boy with you .         yes .         ook .         i   m here .         what   s happening .         everyone stop talking .      ordinary light  slow and easy on the eye  sidled back into the library .   esk sat up  dislodging the staff .  it rolled under the table .  she felt something slip over her eyes  and reached up for it .      just a moment     said granny  darting forward .  she gripped the girl   s shoulders and peered into her eyes .      welcome back     she said  and kissed her .   esk reached up and patted something hard on her head .  she lifted it down to examine it .   it was a pointed hat  slightly smaller than granny   s  but bright blue with a couple of silver stars painted on it .      a wizard hat .     she said .   cutangle stepped forward .      ah  yes     he said  and cleared his throat     you see  we thought   it seemed   anyway  when we considered it           you   re a wizard     said granny  simply .     the archchancellor changed the lore .  quite a simple ceremony  really .         there   s the staff somewhere about here     said cutangle .     i saw it fall down   oh .      he stood up with the staff in his hand  and showed it to granny .      i thought it had carvings on     he said .     this looks just like a stick .     and that was a fact .  the staff looked as menacing and potent as a piece of kindling .   esk turned the hat around in her hands  in the manner of one who  opening the proverbial brightly wrapped package  finds bath salts .      it   s very nice     she said uncertainly .      is that all you can say .     said granny .      it   s pointed  too .     somehow being a wizard didn   t feel any different from not being a wizard .   simon leaned over .      remember     he said     you   ve got to have been a wizard .  then you can start looking on the other side .  like you said .      their eyes met  and they grinned .   granny stared at cutangle .  he shrugged .      search me     he said .     what   s happened to your stutter  boy .         seems to have gone  sir     said simon brightly .     must have left it behind  somewhere .         the river was still brown and swollen but at least it resembled a river again .   it was unnaturally hot for late autumn  and across the whole of the lower part of ankh morpork the steam rose from thousands of carpets and blankets put out to dry .  the streets were filled with silt  which on the whole was an improvement   ankh morpork   s impressive civic collection of dead dogs had been washed out to sea .   the steam also rose from the flagstones of the archchancellor   s personal verandah  and from the teapot on the table .   granny lay back in an ancient cane chair and let the unseasonal warmth creep around her ankles .  she idly watched a team of city ants  who had lived under the flagstones of the university for so long that the high levels of background magic had permanently altered their genes  anthandling a damp sugar lump down from the bowl on to a tiny trolley .  another group was erecting a matchstick gantry at the edge of the table .   granny may or may not have been interested to learn that one of the ants was drum billet  who had finally decided to give life another chance .      they say     she said     that if you can find an ant on hogswatch day it will be very mild for the rest of the winter .         who says that .     said cutangle .      generally people who are wrong     said granny .     i makes a note in my almanack  see .  i checks .  most things most people believe are wrong .         like    red sky at night  the city   s alight        said cutangle .     and you can   t teach an old dog new tricks .         i don   t think that   s what old dogs are for     said granny .  the sugar lump had reached the gantry now  and a couple of ants were attaching it to a microscopic block and tackle .      i can   t understand half the things simon says     said cutangle     although some of the students get very excited about it .         i understand what esk says all right  i just don   t believe it     said granny .     except the bit about wizards needing a heart .         she said that witches need a head  too     said cutangle .     would you like a scone .  a bit damp  i   m afraid .         she told me that if magic gives people what they want  then not using magic can give them what they need     said granny  her hand hovering over the plate .      so simon tells me .  i don   t understand it myself  magic   s for using  not storing up .  go on  spoil yourself .         magic beyond magic     snorted granny .  she took the scone and spread jam on it .  after a pause she spread cream on it too .   the sugar lump crashed to the flagstones and was immediately surrounded by another team of ants  ready to harness it to a long line of red ants enslaved from the kitchen garden .   cutangle shifted uneasily in his seat  which creaked .      esmerelda     he began     i   ve been meaning to ask           no     said granny .      actually i was going to say that we think we might allow a few more girls into the university .  on an experimental basis .  once we get the plumbing sorted out     said cutangle .      that   s up to you  of course .         and  and  it seemed to me that since we seem destined to become a coeducational establishment  as it were  it seemed to me  that is           well .         if you might see your way clear to becoming  that is  whether you would accept a chair .      he sat back .  the sugar lump passed under his chair on matchstick rollers  the squeaking of the slavedriver ants just at the edge of hearing .      hmm     said granny     i don   t see why not .  i   ve always wanted one of those big wicker ones  you know  with the sort of sunshade bit on the top .  if that   s not too much trouble .         that isn   t exactly what i meant     said cutangle  adding quickly     although i   m sure that could be arranged .  no  i mean  would you come and lecture the students .  once in a while .         what on .      cutangle groped for a subject .      herbs .     he hazarded .     we   re not very good on herbs here .  and headology .  esk told me a lot about headology .  it sounds fascinating .      the sugar lump disappeared through a crack in a nearby wall with a final jerk .  cutangle nodded toward it .      they   re very heavy on the sugar     he said     but we haven   t got the heart to do anything about it .      granny frowned  and then nodded across the haze over the city to the distant glitter of the snow on the ramtops .      it   s a long way     she said .     i can   t be keeping on going backward and forward at my time of life .         we could buy you a much better broomstick     said cutangle .     one you don   t have to bump start .  and you  you could have a flat here .  and all the old clothes you can carry     he added  using the secret weapon .  he had wisely invested in some conversation with mrs .  whitlow .      mmph     said granny     silk .         black and red     said cutangle .  an image of granny in black and red silk trotted across his mind  and he bit heavily into his scone .      and maybe we can bring some students out to your cottage in the summer     cutangle went on     for extra mural studies .         who   s extra muriel .         i mean  there   s lots they can learn  i   m sure .   granny considered this .  certainly the privy needed a good seeing to before the weather got too warm  and the goat shed was ripe for the mucking out by spring .  digging over the herb bed was a chore  too .  the bedroom ceiling was a disgrace  and some of the tiles needed fixing .      practical things .     she said  thoughtfully .      absolutely     said cutangle .      mmph .  well  i   ll think about it     said granny  dimly aware that one should never go too far on a first date .      perhaps you would care to dine with me this evening and let me know .     said cutangle  his eyes agleam .      what   s to eat .         cold meat and potatoes .     mrs .  whitlow had done her work well .   there was .   esk and simon went on to develop a whole new type of magic that no one could exactly understand but which nevertheless everyone considered very worthwhile and somehow comforting .   perhaps more importantly  the ants used all the sugar lumps they could steal to build a small sugar pyramid in one of the hollow walls  in which  with great ceremony  they entombed the mummified body of a dead queen .  on the wall of one tiny hidden chamber they inscribed  in insect hieroglyphs  the true secret of longevity .   they got it absolutely right and it would probably have important implications for the universe if it hadn   t  next time the university flooded  been completely washed away .       about the author   terry pratchett lives in england  an island off the coast of

    a very respectable body which in fact represented the major law enforcement agency in the city .  the reason for this is as follows  the guild was given an annual quota which represented a socially acceptable level of thefts  muggings and assassinations  and in return saw to it in very definite and final ways that unofficial crime was not only rapidly stamped out but knifed  garrotted  dismembered and left around the city in an assortment of paper bags as well .  this was held to be a cheap and enlightened arrangement  except by those malcontents who were actually mugged or assassinated and refused to see it as their social duty  and it enabled the city   s thieves to plan a decent career structure  entrance examinations and codes of conduct similar to those adopted by the city   s other professions   which  the gap not being very wide in any case  they rapidly came to resemble .
