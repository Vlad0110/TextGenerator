publisher      the history     this is a story about memory .  and this much can be remembered        that the death of the discworld  for reasons of his own  once rescued a baby girl and took her to his home between the dimensions .  he let her grow to become sixteen because he believed that older children were easier to deal with than younger children  and this shows that you can be an immortal anthropomorphic personification and still get things  as it were  dead wrong        that he later hired an apprentice called mortimer  or mort for short .  between mort and ysabell there was an instant dislike  and everyone knows what that means in the long term .  as a substitute for the grim reaper  mort was a spectacular failure  causing problems that led to a wobbling of reality and a fight between him and death which mort lost        and that  for reasons of his own  death spared his life and sent him and ysabell back into the world .   no one knows why death started to take a practical interest in the human beings he had worked with for so long .  it was probably just curiosity .  even the most efficient ratcatcher will sooner or later take an interest in rats .  they might watch rats live and die  and record every detail of rat existence  although they may never themselves actually know what it is like to run the maze .   but if it is true that the act of observing changes the thing which is observed   it   s even more true that it changes the observer .   mort and ysabell got married .   they had a child .     this is also a story about sex and drugs and music with rocks in .   well        one out of three ain   t bad .   actually  it   s only thirty three percent  but it could be worse .        begin reading   where to finish .   a dark  stormy night .  a coach  horses gone  plunging through the rickety  useless fence and dropping  tumbling into the gorge below .  it doesn   t even strike an outcrop of rock before it hits the dried riverbed far below  and erupts into fragments .   miss butts shuffled the paperwork nervously .   here was one from the girl aged six        what we did on our holidays  what i did on my holidys i staid with grandad he has a big white hors and a garden it is al black .  we had eg and chips .        then the oil from the coach lamps ignites and there is a second explosion  out of which rolls   because there are certain conventions  even in tragedy   a burning wheel .     and another paper  a drawing done at age seven .  all in black .  miss butts sniffed .  it wasn   t as though the gel had only a black crayon .  it was a fact that the quirm college for young ladies had quite expensive crayons of all colors .     and then  after the last of the ember spits and crackles  there is silence .   and the watcher .   who turns  and says to someone in the darkness   yes .  i could have done something .   and rides away .     miss butts shuffled paper again .  she was feeling distracted and nervous  a feeling common to anyone who had much to do with the gel .  paper usually made her feel better .  it was more dependable .   then there had been the matter of   the accident .   miss butts had broken such news before .  it was an occasional hazard when you ran a large boarding school .  the parents of many of the gels were often abroad on business of one sort or another  and it was sometimes the kind of business where the chances of rich reward go hand in hand with the risks of meeting unsympathetic men .   miss butts knew how to handle these occasions .  it was painful  but the thing ran its course .  there was shock  and tears  and then  eventually  it was all over .  people had ways of dealing with it .  there was a sort of script built into the human mind .  life went on .   but the child had just sat there .  it was the politeness that scared the daylights out of miss butts .  she was not an unkind woman  despite a lifetime of being gently dried out on the stove of education  but she was conscientious and a stickler for propriety and thought she knew how this sort of thing should go and was vaguely annoyed that it wasn   t going .      er   if you would like to be alone  to have a cry       she   d prompted  in an effort to get things moving on the right track .      would that help .     susan had said .   it would have helped miss butts .   all she   d been able to manage was     i wonder if  perhaps  you fully understood what i have told you .      the child had stared at the ceiling as though trying to work out a difficult problem in algebra and then said     i expect i will .      it was as if she   d already known  and had dealt with it in some way .  miss butts had asked the teachers to watch susan carefully .  they   d said that was hard  because     there was a tentative knock on miss butts   s study door  as if it was being made by someone who   d really prefer not to be heard .   she returned to the present .      come     she said .   the door swung open .   susan always made no sound .  the teachers had all remarked upon it .  it was uncanny  they said .  she was always in front of you when you least expected it .      ah  susan     said miss butts  a tight smile scuttling across her face like a nervous tick over a worried sheep .     please sit down .         of course  miss butts .      miss butts shuffled the papers .      susan           yes  miss butts .         i   m sorry to say that it appears you have been missed in lessons again .         i don   t understand  miss butts .      the headmistress leaned forward .  she felt vaguely annoyed with herself  but   there was something frankly unlovable about the child .  academically brilliant at the things she liked doing  of course  but that was just it  she was brilliant in the same way that a diamond is brilliant  all edges and chilliness .      have you been   doing it .     she said .     you promised you were going to stop this silliness .         miss butts .         you   ve been making yourself invisible again  haven   t you .      susan blushed .  so  rather less pinkly  did miss butts .  i mean  she thought  it   s ridiculous .  it   s against all reason .  it   s   oh  no     she turned her head and shut her eyes .      yes  miss butts .     said susan  just before miss butts said     susan .      miss butts shuddered .  this was something else the teachers had mentioned .  sometimes susan answered questions just before you asked them     she steadied herself .      you   re still sitting there  are you .         of course  miss butts .      ridiculous .   it wasn   t invisibility  she told herself .  she just makes herself inconspicuous .  she   who     she concentrated .  she   d written a little memo to herself against this very eventuality  and it was pinned to the file .   she read   you are interviewing susan sto helit .  try not to forget it .      susan .     she ventured .      yes  miss butts .      if miss butts concentrated  susan was sitting in front of her .  if she made an effort  she could hear the gel   s voice .  she just had to fight against a pressing tendency to believe that she was alone .      i   m afraid miss cumber and miss greggs have complained     she managed .      i   m always in class  miss butts .         i daresay you are .  miss traitor and miss stamp say they see you all the time .     there   d been quite a staff room argument about that .     is it because you like logic and math and don   t like language and history .      miss butts hesitated .  there was no way the child could have left the room .  if she really stressed her mind  she could catch a suggestion of a voice saying    don   t know  miss butts .         susan  it is really most upsetting when        miss butts paused .  she looked around the study and then glanced at a note pinned to the papers in front of her .  she appeared to read it  looked puzzled for a moment  and then rolled it up and dropped it into the wastepaper basket .  she picked up a pen and  after staring into space for a moment  turned her attention to the school accounts .   susan waited politely for a while  and then got up and left as quietly as possible .     certain things have to happen before other things .  gods play games with the fates of men .  but first they have to get all the pieces on the board  and look all over the place for the dice .   it was raining in the small  mountainous country of llamedos .  it was always raining in llamedos .  rain was the country   s main export .  it had rain mines .   imp the bard sat under the evergreens  more out of habit than any real hope that it would keep the rain off .  water just dribbled through the spiky leaves and formed rivulets down the twigs  so that it was really a sort of rain concentrator .  occasional lumps of rain would splat onto his head .   he was eighteen  extremely talented  and  currently  not at ease with his life .   he tuned his harp  his beautiful new harp  and watched the rain  tears running down his face and mingling with the drops .   gods like people like this .   it is said that whomsoever the gods wish to destroy  they first make mad .  in fact  whomsoever the gods wish to destroy  they first hand the equivalent of a stick with a fizzing fuse and acme dynamite company written on the side .  it   s more interesting  and doesn   t take so long .     susan mooched along the disinfectant smelling corridors .  she wasn   t particularly worried about what miss butts was going to think .  she didn   t usually worry about what anyone thought .  she didn   t know why people forgot about her when she wanted them to  but afterward they seemed a bit embarrassed about raising the subject .   sometimes  some teachers had trouble seeing her .  this was fine .  she   d generally take a book into the classroom and read it peacefully  while all around her the principal exports of klatch happened to other people .     it was  undoubtedly  a beautiful harp .  very rarely a craftsman gets something so right that it is impossible to imagine an improvement .  he hadn   t bothered with ornamentation .  that would have been some kind of sacrilege .   and it was new  which was very unusual in llamedos .  most of the harps were old .  it wasn   t as if they wore out .  sometimes they needed a new frame  or a neck  or new strings   but the harp went on .  the old bards said they got better as they got older  although old men tend to say this sort of thing regardless of daily experience .   imp plucked a string .  the note hung in the air  and faded .  the harp was fresh and bright and already it sang out like a bell .  what it might be like in a hundred years    time was unimaginable .   his father had said it was rubbish  that the future was written in stones  not notes .  that had only been the start of the row .   and then he   d said things  and he   d said things  and suddenly the world was a new and unpleasant place  because things can   t be unsaid .   he   d said     you don   t know anything .  you   re just a stupid old man .  but i   m giving my life to music .  one day soon everyone will say i was the greatest musician in the world .      stupid words .  as if any bard cared for any opinion except those of other bards  who   d spent a lifetime learning how to listen to music .   but said  nevertheless .  and  if they   re said with the right passion and the gods are feeling bored  sometimes the universe will re form itself around words like that .  words have always had the power to change the world .   be careful what you wish for .  you never know who will be listening .   or what  for that matter .   because  perhaps  something could be drifting through the universes  and a few words by the wrong person at the right moment may just cause it to veer in its course     far away in the bustling metropolis of ankh morpork there was a brief crawling of sparks across an otherwise bare wall and then        there was a shop .  an old musical instrument shop .  no one remarked on its arrival .  as soon as it appeared  it had always been there .     death sat staring at nothing  chinbone resting on his hands .   albert approached very carefully .   it had continually puzzled death in his more introspective moments  and this was one of them  why his servant always walked the same path across the floor .   i mean  he thought  consider the size of the room        which went on to infinity  or as near infinity as makes no difference .  in fact it was about a mile .  that   s big for a room  whereas infinity you can hardly see .   death had got rather flustered when he   d created the house .  time and space were things to be manipulated  not obeyed .  the internal dimensions had been a little too generous .  he   d forgotten to make the outside bigger than the inside .  it was the same with the garden .  when he   d begun to take a little more interest in these things he   d realized the role people seemed to think that color played in concepts like  for example  roses .  but he   d made them black .  he liked black .  it went with anything .  it went with everything  sooner or later .   the humans he   d known   and there had been a few   had responded to the impossible size of the rooms in a strange way  by simply ignoring it .   take albert  now .  the big door had opened  albert had stepped through  carefully balancing a cup and saucer        and a moment later had been well inside the room  on the edge of the relatively small square of carpet that surrounded death   s desk .  death gave up wondering how albert covered the intervening space when it dawned on him that  to his servant  there was no intervening space        i   ve brought you some camomile tea  sir     said albert .   hmm .      sir .      sorry .  i was thinking .  what was it you said .      camomile tea .      i thought that was a kind of soap .      you can put it in soap or tea  sir     said albert .  he was worried .  he was always worried when death started to think about things .  it was the wrong job for thinking about things .  and he thought about them in the wrong way .   how very useful .  clean inside and out .   death put his chin on his hands again .      sir .     said albert  after a while .   hmm .      it   ll get cold if you leave it .      albert        yessir .      i have been wondering        sir .      what   s it all about .  seriously .  when you get right down to it .      oh .  er .  couldn   t really say  sir .      i didn   t want to do it  albert .  you know that .  now i know what she meant .  not just about the knees .      who  sir .      there was no reply .   albert looked back when he   d reached the door .  death was staring into space again .  no one could stare quite like him .     not being seen wasn   t a big problem .  it was the things that she kept seeing that were more of a worry .   there were the dreams .  they were only dreams  of course .  susan knew that modern theory said that dreams were only images thrown up while the brain was filing the day   s events .  she would have been more reassured if the day   s events had ever included flying white horses  huge dark rooms  and lots of skulls .   at least they were only dreams .  she   d seen other things .  for example  she   d never mentioned the strange woman in the dormitory the night rebecca snell put a tooth under the pillow .  susan had watched her come through the open window and stand by the bed .  she looked a bit like a milkmaid and not at all frightening  even though she had walked through the furniture .  there had been the jingle of coins .  next morning the tooth had gone and rebecca was richer by one fifty pence coin .   susan hated that sort of thing .  she knew that mentally unstable people told children about the tooth fairy  but that was no reason for one to exist .  it suggested woolly thinking .  she disliked woolly thinking  which in any case was a major misdemeanor under the regime of miss butts .   it was not  otherwise  a particularly bad one .  miss eulalie butts and her colleague miss delcross had founded the college on the astonishing idea that  since gels had nothing much to do until someone married them  they may as well occupy themselves by learning things .   there were plenty of schools in the world  but they were all run either by the various churches or by the guilds .  miss butts objected to churches on logical grounds and deplored the fact that the only guilds that considered girls worth educating were the thieves and the seamstresses .  but it was a big and dangerous world out there  and a gel could do worse than face it with a sound knowledge of geometry and astronomy under her bodice .  for miss butts sincerely believed that there were no basic differences between boys and gels .   at least  none worth talking about .   none that miss butts would talk about  anyway .   and  therefore  she believed in encouraging logical thought and a healthy inquiring mind among the nascent young women in her care  a course of action which is  as far as wisdom is concerned  on a par with going alligator hunting in a cardboard boat during the sinking season .   for example  when she lectured to the school  pointed chin trembling  on the perils to be found outside in the town  three hundred healthy inquiring minds decided that    they should be sampled at the earliest opportunity  and logical thought wondered    exactly how miss butts knew about them .  and the high  spike topped walls around the college grounds looked simple enough to anyone with a fresh mind full of trigonometry and a body honed by healthy fencing  calisthenics  and cold baths .  miss butts could make peril seem really interesting .   anyway  that was the incident of the midnight visitor .  after a while  susan considered that she must have imagined it .  that was the only logical explanation .  and susan was good at those .     everyone  they say  is looking for something .   imp was looking for somewhere to go .   the farm cart that had brought him the last stretch of the way was rumbling off across the fields .   he looked at the signpost .  one arm pointed to quirm  the other to ankh morpork .  he knew just enough to know that ankh morpork was a big city  but built on loam  and  therefore  of no interest to the druids in his family .  he had three ankh morpork dollars and some change .  it probably wasn   t very much in ankh morpork .   he didn   t know anything about quirm  except that it was on the coast .  the road to quirm didn   t look very worn  while the one to ankh morpork was heavily rutted .   it   d be sensible to go to quirm to get the feel of city life .  it   d be sensible to learn a bit about how city people thought before heading for ankh morpork  which they said was the largest city in the world .  it   d be sensible to get some kind of job in quirm and raise a bit of extra cash .  it   d be sensible to learn to walk before he started to run .   common sense told imp all these things  so he marched off firmly toward ankh morpork .     as far as looks were concerned  susan had always put people in mind of a dandelion on the point of telling the time .  the college dressed its gels in a loose navy blue woolen smock that stretched from neck to just above the ankle   practical  healthy  and as attractive as a plank .  the waistline was somewhere around knee level .  susan was beginning to fill it out  however  in accordance with the ancient rules hesitantly and erratically alluded to by miss delcross in biology and hygiene .  gels left her class with the vague feeling that they were supposed to marry a rabbit .   susan had left with the feeling that the cardboard skeleton on the hook in the corner looked like someone she   d known      it was her hair that made people stop and turn to watch her .  it was pure white  except for a black streak .  school regulations required that it be in two plaits  but it had an uncanny tendency to unravel itself and spring back into its preferred shape  like medusa   s snakes .    and then there was the birthmark  if that   s what it was .  it only showed up if she blushed  when three faint pale lines appeared up across her cheek and made it look exactly as though she   d been slapped .  on the occasions when she was angry   and she was quite often angry  at the sheer stupidity of the world   they glowed .   in theory it was  around now  literature .  susan hated literature .  she   d much prefer to read a good book .  currently she had wold   s logic and paradox open on her desk and was reading it with her chin in her hands .   she listened with half an ear to what the rest of the class was doing .   it was a poem about daffodils .   apparently the poet had liked them very much .   susan was quite stoic about this .  it was a free country .  people could like daffodils if they wanted to .  they just should not  in susan   s very definite and precise opinion  be allowed to take up more than a page to say so .   she got on with her education .  in her opinion  school kept on trying to interfere with it .   around her  the poet   s vision was taken apart with inexpert tools .     the kitchen was built on the same gargantuan lines as the rest of the house .  an army of cooks could get lost in it .  the far walls were hidden in the shadows and the stovepipe  supported at intervals by soot covered chains and bits of greasy rope  disappeared into the gloom somewhere a quarter of a mile above the floor .  at least it did to the eye of the outsider .   albert spent his time in a small tiled patch big enough to contain the dresser  the table  and the stove .  and a rocking chair .      when a man says    what   s it all about then  seriously  when you get right down to it .     he   s in a bad way     he said  rolling a cigarette .     so i don   t know what it means when he says it .  it   s one of his fancies again .      the room   s only other occupant nodded .  his mouth was full .      all that business with his daughter     said albert .     i mean   daughter .  and then he heard about apprentices .  nothing would do but he had to go and get one .  hah .  nothing but trouble  that was .  and you  too  come to think of it   you   re one of his fancies .  no offense meant     he added  aware of who he was talking to .     you worked out all right .  you do a good job .      another nod .      he always gets it wrong     said albert .     that   s the trouble .  like when he heard about hogswatchnight .  remember that .  we had to do the whole thing  the oak tree in a pot  the paper sausages  the pork dinner  him sitting there with a paper hat on saying is this jolly .  i made him a little desk ornament thing and he gave me a brick .      albert put the cigarette to his lips .  it had been expertly rolled .  only an expert could get a roll up so thin and yet so soggy .      it was a good brick  mind .  i   ve still got it somewhere .      squeak  said the death of rats .      you put your finger on it  right enough     said albert .     at least  you would have done if you had a proper one .  he always misses the point .  you see  he can   t get over things .  he can   t forget .      he sucked on the wretched homemade until his eyes watered .         what   s it all about  seriously  when you get right down to it .        said albert .     oh  dear .      he glanced up at the kitchen clock  out of a special human kind of habit .  it had never worked since albert had bought it .      he   s normally in by this time     he said .     i   d better do his tray .  can   t think what   s keeping him .        the holy man sat under a holy tree  legs crossed  hands on knees .  he kept his eyes shut in order to focus better on the infinite  and wore nothing but a loincloth in order to show his disdain of discly things .   there was a wooden bowl in front of him .   he was aware  after a while  that he was being watched .  he opened one eye .   there was an indistinct figure sitting a few feet away .  later on  he was sure that the figure had been of   someone .  he couldn   t quite remember the description  but the person must certainly have had one .  he was about   this tall  and sort of   definitely     excuse me .   the holy man opened the other eye .      yes  my son .     his brow wrinkled .     you are male  aren   t you .     he added .   you took a lot of finding .  but i am good at it .      yes .      i am told you know everything .   the holy man opened the other eye .      the secret of existence is to disdain earthly ties  shun the chimera of material worth  and seek oneness with the infinite     he said .     and keep your thieving hands off my begging bowl .      the sight of the supplicant was giving him trouble .   i   ve seen the infinite  said the stranger .  it   s nothing special .   the holy man glanced around .      don   t be daft     he said .     you can   t see the infinite .     cos it   s infinite .      i have .      all right  what did it look like .      it   s blue .   the holy man shifted uneasily .  this wasn   t how it was supposed to go .  a quick burst of the infinite and a meaningful nudge in the direction of the begging bowl was how it was supposed to go .         s black     he muttered .   not  said the stranger  when seen from the outside .  the night sky is black .  but that is just space .  infinity  however  is blue .      and i suppose you know what sound is made by one hand clapping  do you .     said the holy man nastily .   yes .  cl .  the other hand makes the ap .      aha  no  you   re wrong there     said the holy man  back on firmer ground .  he waved a skinny hand .     no sound  see .      that wasn   t a clap .  that was just a wave .      it was a clap .  i just wasn   t using both hands .  what kind of blue  anyway .      you just waved .  i don   t call that very philosophical .  duck egg .   the holy man glanced down the mountain .  several people were approaching .  they had flowers in their hair and were carrying what looked very much like a bowl of rice .   or possibly eau de nil .      look  my son     the holy man said hurriedly .     what exactly is it you want .  i haven   t got all day .      yes  you have .  take it from me .      what do you want .      why do things have to be the way they are .      well        you don   t know  do you .      not exactly .  the whole thing is meant to be a mystery  see .      the stranger stared at the holy man for some time  causing the man to feel that his head had become transparent .   then i will ask you a simpler question .  how do humans forget .      forget what .      forget anything .  everything .      it   er   it happens automatically .     the prospective acolytes had turned the bend on the mountain path .  the holy man hastily picked up his begging bowl .      let   s say this bowl is your memory     he said  waving it vaguely .     it can only hold so much  see .  new things come in  so old things must overflow        no .  i remember everything .  everything .  doorknobs .  the play of sunlight on hair .  the sound of laughter .  footsteps .  every little detail .  as if it happened only yesterday .  as if it happened only tomorrow .  everything .  do you understand .   the holy man scratched his gleaming bald head .      traditionally     he said     the ways of forgetting include joining the klatchian foreign legion  drinking the waters of some magical river  no one knows where it is  and imbibing vast amounts of alcohol .      ah  yes .      but alcohol debilitates the body and is a poison to the soul .      sounds good to me .      master .      the holy man look around irritably .  the acolytes had arrived .      just a minute  i   m talking to        he looked around .  the stranger had gone .      oh master  we have traveled for many miles over       said the acolyte .      shut up a minute  will you .      the holy man put out his hand  palm turned vertical  and waved it a few times .  he muttered under his breath .   the acolytes exchanged glances .  they hadn   t expected this .  finally  their leader found a drop of courage .      master        the holy man turned and caught him across the ear .  the sound this made was definitely a clap .      ah .  got it .     said the holy man .     now  what can i do for        he stopped as his brain caught up with his ears .      what did he mean  humans .        death walked thoughtfully across the hill to the place where a large white horse was placidly watching the view .   he said  go away .   the horse watched him warily .  it was considerably more intelligent than most horses  although this was not a difficult achievement .  it seemed aware that things weren   t right with its master .   i may be some time  said death .   and he set out .     it wasn   t raining in ankh morpork .  this had come as a big surprise to imp .   what had also come as a surprise was how fast money went .  so far he   d lost three dollars and twenty seven pence .   he   d lost it because he   d put it in a bowl in front of him while he played  in the same way that a hunter puts out decoys to get ducks .  the next time he   d looked down it had gone .   people came to ankh morpork to seek their fortune .  unfortunately  other people sought it too .   and people didn   t seem to want bards  even ones who   d won the mistletoe award and centennial harp in the big eisteddfod in llamedos .   he   d found a place in one of the main squares  tuned up  and played .  no one had taken any notice  except sometimes to push him out of the way as they hurried past and  apparently  to nick his bowl .  eventually  just when he was beginning to doubt that he   d made the right decision in coming here at all  a couple of watchmen had wandered up .      that   s a harp he   s playing  nobby     said one of them  after watching imp for a while .      lyre .         no  it   s the honest truth  i   m       the fat guard frowned and looked down .      you   ve just been waiting all your life to say that  ain   t you  nobby     he said .     i bet you was born hoping that one day someone   d say    that   s a harp    so you could say    lyre     on account of it being a pun or play on words .  well  har har .      imp stopped playing .  it was impossible to continue  in the circumstances .      it is a harp  actualllly     he said .     i won it in           ah  you   re from llamedos  right .     said the fat guard .     i can tell by your accent .  very musical people  the llamedese .         sounds like garglin    with gravel to me     said the one identified as nobby .     you got a license  mate .         llicense .     said imp .      very hot on licenses  the guild of musicians     said nobby .     they catch you playing music without a license  they take your instrument and they shove           now  now     said the other watchman     don   t go scaring the boy .         let   s just say it   s not much fun if you   re a piccolo player     said nobby .      but surelly music is as free as the air and the sky  see     said imp .      not round here it   s not .  just a word to the wise  friend     said nobby .      i never ever heard of a guilld of musicians     said imp .      it   s in tin lid alley     said nobby .     you want to be a musician  you got to join the guild .      imp had been brought up to obey the rules .  the llamedese were very law abiding .      i shallll go there directlly     he said .   the guards watched him go .      he   s wearing a nightdress     said corporal nobbs .      bardic robe  nobby     said sergeant colon .  the guards strolled onward .     very bardic  the llamedese .         how long d   you give him  sarge .      colon waved a hand in the flat rocking motion of someone hazarding an informed guess .      two  three days     he said .   they rounded the bulk of unseen university and ambled along the backs  a dusty little street that saw little traffic or passing trade and was therefore much favored by the watch as a place to lurk and have a smoke and explore the realms of the mind .      you know salmon  sarge     said nobby .      it is a fish of which i am aware  yes .         you know they sell kind of slices of it in tins           so i am given to understand  yes .         weell   how come all the tins are the same size .  salmon gets thinner at both ends .         interesting point  nobby .  i think        the watchman stopped  and stared across the street .  corporal nobbs followed his gaze .      that shop     said sergeant colon .     that shop there   was it there yesterday .      nobby looked at the peeling paint  the little grime encrusted window  the rickety door .         course     he said .     it   s always been there .  been there years .      colon crossed the street and rubbed at the grime .  there were dark shapes vaguely visible in the gloom .      yeah  right     he mumbled .     it   s just that   i mean   was it there for years yesterday .         you all right  sarge .         let   s go  nobby     said the sergeant  walking away as fast as he could .      where  sarge .         anywhere not here .      in the dark mounds of merchandise  something felt their departure .     imp had already admired the guild buildings   the majestic frontage of the assassins    guild  the splendid columns of the thieves    guild  the smoking yet still impressive hole where the alchemists    guild had been up until yesterday .  and it was therefore disappointing to find that the guild of musicians  when he eventually located it  wasn   t even a building .  it was just a couple of poky rooms above a barbershop .   he sat in the brown walled waiting room  and waited .  there was a sign on the wall opposite .  it said    for your comforte and convenience you will not smoke .     imp had never smoked in his life .  everything in llamedos was too soggy to smoke .  but he suddenly felt inclined to try .   the room   s only other occupants were a troll and a dwarf .  he was not at ease in their company .  they kept looking at him .   finally the dwarf said     are you elvish .         me .  no .         you look a bit elvish around the hair .         not ellvish at alll .  honestlly .         where you from .     said the troll .      llamedos     said imp .  he shut his eyes .  he knew what trolls and dwarfs traditionally did to people suspected of being elves .  the guild of musicians could take lessons .      what dat you got dere .     said the troll .  it had two large squares of darkish glass in front of its eyes  supported by wire frames hooked around its ears .      it   s a harp  see .         dat what you play .         yes .         you a druid  den .         no .      there was silence again as the troll marshaled its thoughts .      you look like a druid in dat nightie     it rumbled  after a while .   the dwarf on the other side of imp began to snigger .   trolls disliked druids  too .  any sapient species which spends a lot of time in a stationary  rocklike pose objects to any other species which drags it sixty miles on rollers and buries it up to its knees in a circle .  it tends to feel it has cause for disgruntlement .      everyone dresses like this in llamedos  see     said imp .     but i   m a bard .  i   m not a druid .  i hate rocks .         whoops     said the dwarf quietly .   the troll looked imp up and down  slowly and deliberately .  then it said  without any particular trace of menace     you not long in dis town .         just arrived     said imp .  i won   t even reach the door  he thought .  i   m going to be mashed into a pullp .      here is some free advice what you should know .  it is free advice i am giving you gratis for nothing .  in dis town     rock    is a word for troll .  a bad word for troll used by stupid humans .  you call a troll a rock  you got to be prepared to spend some time looking for your head .  especially if you looks a bit elvish around der eyes .  dis is free advice    cos you are a bard and maker of music  like me .         right .  thank you .  yes .     said imp  awash with relief .   he grabbed his harp and played a few notes .  that seemed to lighten the atmosphere a bit .  everyone knew elves had never been able to play music .      lias bluestone     said the troll  extending something massive with fingers on it .      imp y celyn     said imp .     nothing to do with moving rocks around at all in any way .      a smaller  more knobbly hand was thrust at imp from another direction .  his gaze traveled up its associated arm  which was the property of the dwarf .  he was small  even for a dwarf .  a large bronze horn lay across his knees .      glod glodsson     said the dwarf .     you just play the harp .         anything with strings on it     said imp .     but the harp is the queen of instruments  see .         i can blow anything     said glod .      realllly .     said imp .  he sought for some polite comment .     that must make you very popular .      the troll heaved a big leather sack off the floor .      dis is what i play     he said .  a number of large round rocks tumbled out onto the floor .  lias picked one up and flicked it with a finger .  it went bam .      music made from rocks .     said imp .     what do you callll it .         we call it ggroohauga     said lias     which means music made from rocks .      the rocks were all of different sizes  carefully tuned here and there by small nicks hacked in the stone .      may i .     said imp .      be my guest .      imp selected a small rock and flicked it with his finger .  it went bop .  a smaller one went bing .      what do you do with them .     he said .      i bang them together .         and then what .         what do you mean     and then what .            what do you do after you   ve banged them together .         i bang them together again     said lias  one of nature   s drummers .   the door to the inner room opened and a man with a pointed nose peered around it .      you lot together .     he snapped .     there was indeed a river  according to legend  one drop of which would rob a man of his memory .   many people assumed that this was the river ankh  whose waters can be drunk or even cut up and chewed .  a drink from the ankh would quite probably rob a man of his memory  or at least cause things to happen to him that he would on no account wish to recall .   in fact there was another river that would do the trick .  there was  of course  a snag .  no one knows where it is  because they   re always pretty thirsty when they find it .   death turned his attention elsewhere .        seventy five dollars .     said imp .     just to play music .         that   s twenty five dollars registration fee  thirty five dollars up front against fees  and fifteen dollars voluntary compulsory annual subscription to the pension fund     said mr .  clete  secretary of the guild .      but we haven   t got that much money .      the man gave a shrug that indicated that  although the world did indeed have many problems  this was one of them that was not his .      but maybe we shall be ablle to pay when we   ve earned some     said imp weakly .     if you could just  you know  llet us have a week or two           can   t let you play anywhere without you being members of the guild     said mr .  clete .      but we can   t be members of the guild until we   ve played     said glod .      that   s right     said mr .  clete cheerfully .     hat .  hat .  hat .      it was a strange laugh  totally mirthless and vaguely birdlike .  it was very much like its owner  who was what you would get if you extracted fossilized genetic material from something in amber and then gave it a suit .   lord vetinari had encouraged the growth of the guilds .  they were the big wheels on which the clockwork of a well regulated city ran .  a drop of oil here   a spoke inserted there  of course   and by and large it all worked .   and gave rise  in the same way that compost gives rise to worms  to mr .  clete .  he was not  by the standard definitions  a bad man  in the same way a plague bearing rat is not  from a dispassionate point of view  a bad animal .   mr .  clete worked hard for the benefit of his fellow men .  he devoted his life to it .  for there are many things in the world that need doing that people don   t want to do  and were grateful to mr .  clete for doing for them .  keeping minutes  for example .  making sure the membership roll was quite up to date .  filing .  organizing .   he   d worked hard on behalf of the thieves    guild  although he hadn   t been a thief  at least in the sense normally meant .  then there   d been a rather more senior vacancy in the fools    guild  and mr .  clete was no fool .  and finally there had been the secretaryship of the musicians .   technically  he should have been a musician .  so he bought a comb and paper .  since up until that time the guild had been run by real musicians  and  therefore  the membership roll was unrolled and hardly anyone had paid any dues lately and the organization owed several thousand dollars to chrysoprase the troll at punitive interest  mr .  clete didn   t even have to audition .   when mr .  clete had opened the first of the unkempt ledgers and looked at the disorganized mess  he had felt a deep and wonderful feeling .  since then  he   d never looked back .  he had spent a long time looking down .  and although the guild had a president and council  it also had mr .  clete  who took the minutes and made sure things ran smoothly and smiled very quietly to himself .  it is a strange but reliable fact that whenever men throw off the yoke of tyrants and set out to rule themselves there emerges  like a mushroom after rain  mr .  clete .   hat .  hat .  hat .  mr .  clete laughed at things in inverse proportion to the actual humor of the situation .      but that   s nonsense .         welcome to the wonderful world of the guild economy     said mr .  clete .     hat .  hat .  hat .         what happens if we pllay without bellonging to the guilld  then .     said imp .     do you confiscate our instruments .         to start with     said the secretary .     and then we sort of give them back to you .  hat .  hat .  hat .  incidentally   you   re not elvish  are you .           seventy five dollars is criminall     said imp  as they plodded along the evening streets .      worse than criminal     said glod .     i hear the thieves    guild just charges a percentage .         and dey give you a proper guild membership and everything     lias rumbled .     even a pension .  and dey have a day trip to quirm and a picnic every year .         music should be free     said imp .      so what we going to do now .     said lias .      anyone got any money .     said glod .      got a dollar     said lias .      got some pennies     said imp .      then we   re going to have a decent meal     said glod .     right here .      he pointed up at a sign .      gimlet   s hole food .     said lias .     gimlet .  sounds dwarfish .  vermincelli and stuff .         now he   s doing troll food too     said glod .     decided to put aside ethnic differences in the cause of making more money .  five types of coal  seven types of coke and ash  sediments to make you dribble .  you   ll like it .         dwarf bread too .     said imp .      you like dwarf bread .     said glod .      llove it     said imp .      what  proper dwarf bread .     said glod .     you sure .         yes .  it   s nice and crunchy  see .      glod shrugged .      that proves it     he said .     no one who likes dwarf bread can be elvish .      the place was almost empty .  a dwarf in an apron that came up to its armpits watched them over the top of the counter .      you do fried rat .     said glod .      best damn fried rat in the city     said gimlet .      okay .  give me four fried rats .         and some dwarf bread     said imp .      and some coke     said lias  patiently .      you mean rat heads or rat legs .         no .  four fried rats .         and some coke .         you want ketchup on those rats .         no .         you sure .         no ketchup .         and some coke .         and two hard boilled eggs     said imp .  the others gave him an odd look .      well .  i just like hard boilled eggs  see     he said .      and some coke .         and two hard boilled eggs .         and some coke .         seventy five dollars     said glod  as they sat down .     what   s three times seventy five dollars .         many dollars     said lias .      more than two hundred dollllars     said imp .      i don   t think i   ve even seen two hundred dollars     said glod .     not while i   ve been awake .         we raise money .     said lias .      we can   t raise money by being musicians     said imp .     it   s the guild law .  if they catch you they take your instrument and shove       he stopped .     let   s just say it   s not much fun for the piccollo pllayer     he added from memory .      i shouldn   t think the trombonist is very happy either     said glod  putting some pepper on his rat .      i can   t go back home now     said imp     i said i   d   i can   t go back home yet .  even if i could  i   d have to raise monolliths like my brothers .  alll they care about is stone circles .         if i go back home now     said lias     i   ll be clubbing druids .      they both  very carefully  sidled a little farther away from each other .      then we play somewhere where the guild won   t find us     said glod cheerfully .     we find a club somewhere           got a club     said lias  proudly .     got a nail in it .         i mean a nightclub     said glod .      still got a nail in it at night .         i happen to know     said glod  abandoning that line of conversation     that there   s a lot of places in the city that don   t like paying guild rates .  we could do a few gigs and raise the money with no trouble .         all three of us together .     said imp .      sure .         but we pllay dwarf music and human music and trolll music     said imp .     i   m not sure they   lll go together .  i mean  dwarfs listen to dwarf music  humans listen to human music  trollls listen to trolll music .  what do we get if we mix it alll together .  it   d be dreadfull .         we   re getting along okay     said lias  getting up and fetching the salt from the counter .      we   re musicians     said glod .     it   s not the same with real people .         yeah  right     said the troll .   lias sat down .   there was a cracking noise .   lias stood up .      oh     he said .   imp reached over .  slowly and with great care  he picked the remains of his harp off the bench .      oh     said lias  again .   a string curled back with a sad little sound .   it was like watching the death of a kitten .      i won that at the eisteddfod     said imp .      could you glue it back together .     said glod  eventually .   imp shook his head .      there   s no one left in llamedos who knows how  see .         yes  but in the street of cunning artificers           i   m real sorry .  i mean real sorry  i don   t know how it got dere .         it wasn   t your faullt .      imp tried  ineffectually  to fit a couple of pieces together .  but you couldn   t repair a musical instrument .  he remembered the old bards saying that .  they had a soul .  all instruments had a soul .  if they were broken  the soul of them escaped  flew away like a bird .  what was put together again was just a thing  a mere assemblage of wood and wire .  it would play  it might even deceive the casual listener  but   you might as well push someone over a cliff and then stitch them together and expect them to come alive .      um   maybe we could get you another one  then .     said glod .     there   s   a nice little music shop in the backs        he stopped .  of course there was a nice little music shop in the backs .  it had always been there .      in the backs     he repeated  just to make sure .     bound to get one there .  in the backs .  yes .  been there years .         not one of these     said imp .     before a craftsmen even touches the wood he has to spend two weeks sitting wrapped in a bullock hide in a cave behind a waterfallll .         why .         i don   t know .  it   s traditionall .  he has to get his mind pure of allll distractions .         there   s bound to be something else  though     said glod .     we   ll buy something .  you can   t be a musician without an instrument .         i haven   t got any money     said imp .   glod slapped him on the back .     that doesn   t matter     he said .     you   ve got friends .  we   ll help you .  least we can do .         but we all spent everything we had on this meal .  there   s no more money     said imp .      that   s a negative way of looking at it     said glod .      wellll  yes .  we haven   t got any  see .         i   ll sort out something     said glod .     i   m a dwarf .  we know about money .  knowing about money is practically my middle name .         that a long middle name .        it was almost dark when they reached the shop  which was right opposite the high walls of unseen university .  it looked like the kind of musical instrument emporium which doubles as a pawnshop  since every musician has at some time in his life to hand over his instrument if he wants to eat and sleep indoors .      you ever bought anything in here .     said lias .      no   not that i remember     said glod .      it shut     said lias .   glod hammered on the door .  after a while it opened a crack  just enough to reveal a thin slice of face belonging to an old woman .      we want to buy an instrument  ma   am     said imp .   one eye and a slice of mouth looked him up and down .      you human .         yes  ma   am .         all right  then .      the shop was lit by a couple of candles .  the old woman retired to the safety of the counter  where she watched them very carefully for any signs of murdering her in her bed .   the trio moved carefully amongst the merchandise .  it seemed that the shop had accumulated its stock from unclaimed pledges over the centuries .  musicians were often short of money  it was one definition of a musician .  there were battle horns .  there were lutes .  there were drums .      this is junk     said imp under his breath .   glod blew the dust off a crumhorn and put it to his lips  achieving a sound like the ghost of a refried bean .      i reckon there   s a dead mouse in here     he said  peering into the depths .      it was all right before you blew it     snapped the old woman .   there was an avalanche of cymbals from the other end of the shop .      sorry     lias called out .   glod opened the lid of an instrument that was entirely unfamiliar to imp .  it revealed a row of keys  glod ran his stumpy fingers over them  producing a sequence of sad  tinny notes .      what is it .     whispered imp .      a virginal     said the dwarf .      any good to us .         shouldn   t think so .      imp straightened up .  he felt that he was being watched .  the old lady was watching  but there was something else        it   s no use .  there   s nothing here     he said loudly .      hey  what was that .     said glod .      i said there   s           i heard something .         what .         there it is again .      there was a series of crashes and thumps behind them as lias liberated a double bass from a drift of old music stands and tried to blow down the sharp bit .      there was a funny sound when you spoke     said glod .     say something .      imp hesitated as people do when  after having used a language all their lives  they   ve been told to    say something .         imp .     he said .   whum whum whum .      it came from        whaa whaa whaa .   glod lifted aside a pile of ancient sheet music .  there was a musical graveyard behind it  including a skinless drum  a set of lancre bagpipes without the pipes  and a single maraca  possibly for use by a zen flamenco dancer .   and something else .   the dwarf pulled it out .  it looked  vaguely  like a guitar carved out of a piece of ancient wood by a blunt stone chisel .  although dwarfs did not  as a rule  play stringed instruments  glod knew a guitar when he saw one .  they were supposed to be shaped like a woman  but this was only the case if you thought a woman had no legs  a long neck  and too many ears .      imp .     he said .      yes .      whauauaum .  the sound had a saw edged  urgent fringe to it .   there were twelve strings  but the body of the instrument was solid wood  not at all hollow   it was more or less just a shape to hold the strings .      it resonated to your voice     said glod .      how can    .      whaum wha .   glod clamped his hand over the strings and beckoned the other two closer .      we   re right by the university here     he whispered .     magic leaks out .  it   s a well known fact .  or maybe some wizard pawned it .  don   t look a gift rat in the mouth .  can you play a guitar .      imp went pale .      you mean like   follk music .      he took the instrument .  folk music was not approved of in llamedos  and the singing of it was rigorously discouraged  it was felt that anyone espying a fair young maiden one morning in may was entitled to take whatever steps he considered appropriate without someone writing it down .  guitars were frowned upon as being  well   too easy .   imp struck a chord .  it created a sound quite unlike anything he   d heard before   there were resonances and odd echoes that seemed to run and hide among the instrumental debris and pick up additional harmonics and then bounce back again .  it made his spine itch .  but you couldn   t be even the worst musician in the world without some kind of instrument        right     said glod .  he turned to the old woman .      you don   t call this a music instrument  do you .     he demanded .     look at it  half of it   s not even there .         glod  i don   t think       imp began .  under his hand the strings trembled .   the old woman looked at the thing .      ten dollars     she said .      ten dollars .  ten dollars .     said glod .     it   s not worth two dollars .         that   s right     said the old woman .  she brightened up a bit in a nasty way  as if looking forward to a battle in which no expense would be spared .      and it   s ancient     said glod .      antique .         would you listen to that tone .  it   s ruined .         mellow .  you don   t get craftsmanship like that these days .         only because we   ve learned from experience .      imp looked at the thing again .  the strings resonated by themselves .  they had a blue tint to them and a slightly fuzzy look  as though they never quite stopped vibrating .   he lifted it close to his mouth and whispered     imp .     the strings hummed .   now he noticed the chalk mark .  it was almost faded .  and all it was  was a mark .  just a stroke of the chalk     glod was in full flow .  dwarfs were said to be keenest of financial negotiators  second only in acumen and effrontery to little old ladies .  imp tried to pay attention to what was going on .      right  then     glod was saying .     it   s a deal  yes .         a deal     said the little old lady .     and don   t go spitting on your hand before we shake  that sort of thing   s unhygienic .      glod turned to imp .     i think i handled that pretty well     he said .      good .  listen  this is a very           got twelve dollars .         what .         something of a bargain  i think .      there was a thump behind them .  lias appeared  rolling a very large drum and carrying a couple of cymbals under his arm .      i said i   d got no money .     hissed imp .      yes  but   well  everyone says they   ve got no money .  that   s sense .  you don   t want to go around saying you   ve got money .  you mean you   ve really got no money .         no .         not even twelve dollars .         no .      lias dumped the drum  the cymbals  and a pile of sheet music on the counter .      how much for everything .     he said .      fifteen dollars     said the old woman .   lias sighed and straightened up .  there was a distant look in his eyes for a moment  and then he hit himself on the jaw .  he fumbled around inside his mouth for a moment and then produced     imp stared .      here  let me have a look     said glod .  he snatched the thing from lias   s unprotesting fingers and examined it carefully .     hey .  fifty carats at least .         i   m not taking that     said the old woman .     it   s been in a troll   s mouth .         you eat eggs  don   t you .     said glod .     anyway  everyone knows troll   s teeth are pure diamond .      the old woman took the tooth and examined it by candlelight .      if i took it along to one of those jewelers in nonesuch street  they   d tell me it   s worth two hundred dollars     said glod .      well  i   m telling you it   s worth fifteen right here     said the old lady .  the diamond magically disappeared somewhere about her person .  she gave them a bright  fresh smile .      why couldn   t we just take it off her .     said glod  when they were outside .      because she   s a poor defenseless old woman     said imp .      exactly .  my point exactly .      glod looked up at lias .      you got a whole mouthful of them things .         yup .         only i owe my landlord two month   s re           don   t even fink about it     said the troll levelly .   behind them  the door slammed shut .      look  cheer up     said glod .     tomorrow i   ll find us a gig .  don   t worry .  i know everyone in this city .  three of us   that   s a band .         we haven   t even practiced together properly     said imp .      we   ll practice as we go along     said glod .     welcome to the world of professional musicianship .        susan did not know much about history .  it always seemed a particularly dull subject .  the same stupid things were done over and over again by tedious people .  what was the point .  one king was pretty much like another .   the class was learning about some revolt in which some peasants had wanted to stop being peasants and  since the nobles had won  had stopped being peasants really quickly .  had they bothered to learn to read and acquire some history books they   d have learned about the uncertain merits of things like scythes and pitchforks when used in a battle against crossbows and broadswords .   she listened halfheartedly for a while  until boredom set in  and then took out a book and let herself fade from the notice of the world .   squeak .   susan glanced sideways .   there was a tiny figure on the floor by her desk .  it looked very much like a rat skeleton in a black robe  holding a very small scythe .   susan looked back at her book .  such things did not exist .  she was quite certain about that .   squeak .   susan looked down again .  the apparition was still there .  there had been cheese on toast for supper the previous night .  in books  at least  you were supposed to expect things after a late night meal like that .      you don   t exist     she said .     you   re just a piece of cheese .      squeak .   when the creature was sure it had got her full attention  it pulled out a tiny hourglass on a silver chain and pointed at it urgently .   against all rational considerations  susan reached down and opened her hand .  the thing climbed onto it   its feet felt like pins   and looked at her expectantly .   susan lifted it up to eye level .  all right  perhaps it was a figment of her imagination .  she ought to take it seriously .      you   re not going to say something like    oh  my paws and whiskers     are you .     she said quietly .     if you do  i shall go and drop you in the privy .      the rat shook its skull .      and you   re real .      squeak .  squeaksqueaksqeak        look  i don   t understand     said susan patiently .     i don   t speak rodent .  we only do klatchian in modern languages and i only know how to say    my aunt   s camel has fallen in the mirage .     and if you are imaginary  you might try to be a bit more   lovable .      a skeleton  even a small one  is not a naturally lovable object  even if it has got an open countenance and a grin .  but the feeling   no  she realized   the memory was creeping over her from somewhere that this one was not only real but on her side .  it was an unfamilar concept .  her side had normally consisted of her .   the late rat regarded susan for a moment and then  in one movement  gripped the tiny scythe between its teeth and sprang off susan   s hand  landed on the classroom floor  and scuttled away between the desks .      it   s not even as if you   ve got paws and whiskers     said susan .     not proper ones  anyway .      the skeletal rat stepped through the wall .   susan turned back to her book and ferociously read noxeuse   s divisibility paradox  which demonstrated the impossibility of falling off a log .     they practiced that very night  in glod   s obsessively neat lodgings .  these were behind a tannery in phedre road  and probably safe from the wandering ears of the musicians    guild .  they were also freshly painted and well scrubbed .  the tiny room sparkled .  you never got cockroaches or rats or any kind of vermin in a dwarf home .  at least not while the owner could still hold a frying pan .   glod and imp sat and watched lias the troll hit his rocks .      what d   you fink .     he said  when he   d finished .      is that all you do .     said imp  after a while .      dey   re rocks     said the troll  patiently .     dat   s all you can do .  bop  bop  bop .         hmm .  can i have a go .     said glod .   he sat behind the array of stones and looked at them for a while .  then he rearranged a few of them  took a couple of hammers out of his toolbox  and tapped a stone experimentally .      now let   s see       he said .   bambam bambam .   beside imp  the guitar strings hummed .      without a shirt     said glod .      what .     said imp .      it   s just a bit of musical nonsense     said glod .     like    shave and a haircut  two pence    .         sorry .      bam bam a bambam  bambam .      shave and haircut good value for two pence     said lias .   imp looked hard at the stones .  percussion wasn   t approved of in llamedos either .  the bards said that anyone could hit a rock or a hollow log with a stick .  that wasn   t music .  besides  it was   and here they   d drop their voices   too animal .   the guitar hummed .  it seemed to pick up sounds .   imp suddenly had a nagging feeling that there was a lot you could do with percussion .      can i try .     he said .   he picked up the hammers .  there was the faintest of tones from the guitar .   forty five seconds later  he put down the hammers .  the echoes died away .      why did you hit me on the helmet at the end there .     said glod  carefully .      sorry     said imp .     i think i got carried away .  i thought you were a cymbal .         it was very   unusual     said the troll .      the music   s   in the stones     said imp .     you just have to llet it out .  there   s music in everything  if you know how to find it .         can i try dat riff .     said lias .  he took the hammers and shuffled around behind the stones again .   a bam bop a re bop a bim bam boom .      what did you do to them .     he said .     they sound   wild .         sounded good to me     said glod .     sounded a whole lot better .      imp slept that night wedged between glod   s very small bed and the bulk of lias .  after a while  he snored .   beside him  the strings hummed gently in harmony .  lulled by their almost imperceptible sound  he   d completely forgotten about the harp .     susan awoke .  something was tugging at her ear .   she opened her eyes .   squeak .      oh  nooo        she sat up in bed .  the rest of the girls were asleep .  the window was open  because the school encouraged fresh air .  it was available in large amounts for free .   the skeletal rat leapt onto the window ledge and then  when it had made sure she was watching  jumped into the night .   as susan saw it  the world offered two choices .  she could go back to bed  or she could follow the rat .   which would be a stupid thing to do .  soppy people in books did that sort of thing .  they ended up in some idiot world with goblins and talking animals .  and they were such sad  wet girls .  they always let things happen to them  without making any effort .  they just went around saying things like    my goodness me     when it was obvious that any sensible human being could soon get the place properly organized .   actually  when you thought of it like that  it was tempting   the world held too much fluffy thinking .  she always told herself that it was the job of people like susan  if there were any more like her  to sort it out .   she pulled on her dressing gown and climbed over the sill  holding on until the last moment and dropping into a flower bed .   the rat was a tiny shape scurrying across the moonlit lawn .  she followed it around to the stables  where it vanished somewhere in the shadows .   as she stood feeling slightly chilly and more than slightly an idiot  it returned  dragging an object rather bigger than itself .  the thing looked like a bundle of old rags .   the skeletal rat walked around the side of it and gave the ragged bundle a good hard kick .      all right  all right .      the bundle opened one eye  which swiveled around wildly until it focused on susan .      i warn you     said the bundle     i don   t do the n word .         i   m sorry .     said susan .   the bundle rolled over  staggered upright  and extended two scruffy wings .  the rat stopped kicking it .         m a raven  aren   t i .     it said .     one of the few birds who speak .  the first thing people say is  oh  you   re a raven  go on  say the n word   if i had a penny for every time that   s happened  i   d        squeak .      all right  all right .     the raven ruffled its feathers .     this thing here is the death of rats .  note the scythe and cowl  yes .  death of rats .  very big in the rat world .      the death of rats bowed .      tends to spend a lot of time under barns and anywhere people have put down a plate of bran laced with strychnine     said the raven .     very conscientious .      squeak .      all right .  what does it   he want with me .     said susan .     i   m not a rat .         very perspicacious of you     said the raven .     look  i didn   t ask to do this  you know .  i was asleep on my skull  next minute he had a grip on my leg .  being a raven  as i said  i   m naturally an occult bird           sorry     said susan .     i know this is all one of those dreams  so i want to make sure i understand it .  you said   you were asleep on your skull .         oh  not my personal skull     said the raven .     it   s someone else   s .         whose .      the raven   s eyes spun wildly .  it never managed to have both eyes pointing in the same direction .  susan had to resist trying to move around to bring herself into range .      how do i know .  they don   t come with a label on them     it said .     it   s just a skull .  look   i work for this wizard  right .  down in the town .  i sit on this skull all day and go    caw    at people           why .         because a raven sitting on a skull and going    caw    is as much part of your actual wizarding modus operandi as the big dribbling candles and the old stuffed alligator hanging from the ceiling .  don   t you know anything .  i should have thought anyone knows that who knows anything about anything .  why  a proper wizard might as well not even have bubbling green stuff in bottles as be without his raven sitting on a skull and going    caw           squeak .      look  you have to lead up to things with humans     said the raven wearily .  one eye focused on susan again .     he   s not one for subtleties  him .  rats don   t argue questions of a philosophical nature when they   re dead .  anyway  i   m the only person round here he knows who can talk           humans can talk     said susan .      oh  indeed     said the raven     but the key point about humans  a crucial distinction you might say  is that they   re not prone to being woken up in the middle of the night by a skeletal rat who needs an interpreter in a hurry .  anyway  humans can   t see him .         i can see him .         ah .  i think you   ve put your digit on the nub  crux  and gist of it all     said the raven .     the marrow  as you might say .         look     said susan     i   d just like you to know that i don   t believe any of this .  i don   t believe there   s a death of rats in a cowl carrying a scythe .         he   s standing in front of you .         that   s no reason to believe it .         i can see you   ve certainly had a proper education     said the raven sourly .   susan stared down at the death of rats .  there was a blue glow deep in its eye sockets .   squeak .      the thing is     said the raven     that he   s gone again .         who .         your   grandfather .         granddad lezek .  how can he be gone again .  he   s dead .         your   er   other grandfather    .     said the raven .      i haven   t got        images rose from the mud at the bottom of her mind .  something about a horse   and there was a room full of whispers .  and a bathtub that seemed to fit in somewhere .  and fields of wheat came into it  too .      this is what happens when people try to educate their children     said the raven     instead of telling them things .         i thought my other granddad was also   dead .     said susan .   squeak .      the rat says  you   ve got to come with him .  it   s very important .   the image of miss butts rose like a valkyrie in susan   s mind .  this was silliness .      oh  no     said susan .     it must be midnight already .  and we   ve got a geography exam tomorrow .      the raven opened its beak in astonishment .      you can   t be saying that     it said .      you really expect me to take instructions from a   a bony rat and a talking raven .  i   m going back .         no  you   re not     said the raven .     no one with any blood in them   d go back now .  you   d never find things out if you went back now .  you   d just get educated .         but i haven   t got time     susan wailed .      oh  time     said the raven .     time   s mainly habit .  time is not a particular feature of things for you .         how           you   ll have to find out  won   t you .      squeak .   the raven jumped up and down excitedly .      can i tell her .  can i tell her .     it squawked .  it swiveled its eyes to susan .      your grandfather     it said     is    dah dah dah dah    dea        squeak .      she   s got to know sometime     said the raven .      deaf .  my grandfather is deaf .     said susan .     you   ve got me out here in the middle of the night to talk about hearing difficulties .         i didn   t say deaf  i said your grandfather is    dah dah dah dah    d        squeak .      all right .  have it your way .      susan backed away while the two of them argued .   then she grasped the skirts of her nightdress and ran  out of the yard and across the damp lawns .  the window was still open .  she managed  by standing on the sill of the one below  to grab the ledge and heave herself up and into the dormitory .  she got into bed and pulled the blankets over her head     after a while she realized that this was an unintelligent reaction .  but she left them where they were  anyway .   she dreamed of horses and coaches and a clock without hands .        d   you think we could have handled that better .      squeak .     dah dah dah dah    squeak .      how did you expect me to put it .     your grandfather is death .     just like that .  where   s the sense of occasion .  humans like drama .      squeak  the death of rats pointed out .      rats is different .      squeak .      i reckon i ought to call it a night     said the raven .     ravens are not generally nocturnal  you know .     it scratched at its bill with a foot .     do you just do rats  or mice and hamsters and weasels and stuff like that as well .      squeak .      gerbils .  how about gerbils .      squeak .      fancy that .  i never knew that .  death of gerbils too .  amazing how you can catch up with them on those treadmills        squeak .      please yourself .        there are the people of the day  and the creatures of the night .   and it   s important to remember that the creatures of the night aren   t simply the people of the day staying up late because they think that makes them cool and interesting .  it takes a lot more than heavy mascara and a pale complexion to cross the divide .   heredity can help  of course .   the raven had grown up in the forever crumbling  ivy clad tower of art  overlooking unseen university in far ankh morpork .  ravens are naturally intelligent birds and magical leakage  which has a tendency to exaggerate things  had done the rest .   it didn   t have a name .  animals don   t normally bother with them .  the wizard who thought he owned him called him quoth  but that was only because he didn   t have a sense of humor and  like most people without a sense of humor  prided himself on the sense of humor he hadn   t  in fact  got .   the raven flew back to the wizard   s house  skimmed in through the open window  and took up his roost on the skull .      poor kid     he said .      that   s destiny for you     said the skull .      i don   t blame her for trying to be normal .  considering .         yes     said the skull .     quit while you   re a head  that   s what i say .        the owner of a grain silo in ankh morpork was having a bit of a crackdown .  the death of rats could hear the distant yapping of the terriers .  it was going to be a busy night .   it would be too hard to describe the death of rats   s thought processes  or even be certain that he had any .  he had a feeling that he shouldn   t have involved the raven  but humans set a great store by words .   rats don   t think very far ahead  except in general terms .  in general terms  he was very  very worried .  he hadn   t expected education .     susan got through the next morning without having to go nonexistent .  geography consisted of the flora of the sto plains   chief exports of the sto plains    and the fauna of the sto plains    .  once you mastered the common denominator  it was straightforward .  the gels had to color in a map .  this involved a lot of green .  lunch was dead man   s fingers and eyeball pudding  a healthy ballast for the afternoon   s occupation  which was sport .   this was the province of iron lily  who was rumored to shave and lift weights with her teeth  and whose shouts of encouragement as she thundered up and down the touchline tended toward the nature of    get some ball  you bunch of soft nellies .      miss butts and miss delcross kept their windows closed on games afternoon .  miss butts ferociously read logic and miss delcross  in her idea of a toga  practiced eurythmics in the gym .   susan surprised people by being good at sport .  some sport  anyway .  hockey  lacrosse  and rounders  certainly .  any game that involved putting a stick of some sort in her hands and asking her to swing it  definitely .  the sight of susan advancing toward goal with a calculating look made any goalie lose all faith in her protective padding and throw herself flat as the ball flashed past at waist height  making a humming noise .   it was only evidence of the general stupidity of the rest of humanity  susan considered  that although she was manifestly one of the best players in the school  she never got picked for teams .  even fat girls with spots got picked before her .  it was so infuriatingly unreasonable  and she could never understand why .   she   d explained to other girls how good she was  and demonstrated her skill  and pointed out just how stupid they were in not picking her .  for some exasperating reason it didn   t seem to have any effect .   this afternoon she went for an official walk instead .  this was an acceptable alternative  provided girls went in company .  usually they went into town and bought stale fish and chips from an unfragrant shop in three roses alley  fried food was considered unhealthy by miss butts  and  therefore  bought out of school at every opportunity .   girls had to walk in groups of three or more .  peril  in miss butts   s conjectural experience  couldn   t happen to units of more than one .   it was certainly unlikely in any case to happen to any group that contained princess jade and gloria thogsdaughter .   the school   s owners had been a bit bothered about taking a troll  but jade   s father was king of an entire mountain and it always looked good to have royalty on the roll .  and besides  miss butts had remarked to miss delcross  it   s our duty to encourage them if they show any inclination to become real people and the king is actually quite charming and assures me he can   t even remember when he last ate anyone .  jade had bad eyesight  a note excusing her from unnecessary sunshine  and knitted chain mail in handicraft class .   whereas gloria was banned from sport because of her tendency to use her ax in a threatening manner .  miss butts had suggested that an ax wasn   t a ladylike weapon  even for a dwarf  but gloria had pointed out that  on the contrary  it had been left to her by her grandmother  who had owned it all her life and polished it every saturday  even if she hadn   t used it at all that week .  there was something about the way she gripped it that made even miss butts give in .  to show willing  gloria left off her iron helmet and  while not shaving off her beard   there was no actual rule about girls not having beards a foot long   at least plaited it .  and tied in it ribbons in the school colors .   susan felt strangely at home in their company  and this had earned guarded praise from miss butts .  it was nice of her to be such chums  she said .  susan had been surprised .  it had never occurred to her that anyone actually said a word like chums .   the three of them trailed back along the beech drive by the playing field .      i   ve don   t understand sport     said gloria  watching the gaggle of panting young women stampeding across the pitch .      there   s a troll game     said jade .     it   s called aargrooha .         how   s it played .     said susan .      er   you rip off a human   s head and kick it around with special boots made of obsidian until you score a goal or it bursts .  but it   s not played anymore  of course     she added quickly .      i should think not     said susan .      no one knows how to make the boots  i expect     said gloria .      i expect if it was played now  someone like iron lily would go running up and down the touchline shouting    get some head  you soft nellies        said jade .   they walked in silence for a while .      i think     said gloria  cautiously     that she probably wouldn   t  actually .         i say  you two haven   t noticed anything   odd lately  have you .     said susan .      odd like what .     said gloria .      well  like   rats       said susan .      haven   t seen any rats in the school     said gloria .     and i   ve had a good look .         i mean   strange rats     said susan .   they were even with the stables .  these were normally the home of the two horses that pulled the school coach  and the term time residence of a few horses belonging to gels who couldn   t be parted from them .   there is a type of girl who  while incapable of cleaning her bedroom even at knife point  will fight for the privilege of being allowed to spend the day shoveling manure in a stable .  it was a magic that hadn   t rubbed off on susan .  she had nothing against horses  but couldn   t understand all the snaffles  bridles  and fetlocks business .  and she couldn   t see why they had to be measured in    hands    when there were perfectly sensible inches around to do the job .  having watched the jodhpured girls who bustled around the stables  she decided it was because they couldn   t understand complicated machines like rulers .  she   d said so  too .      all right     said susan     how about ravens .      something blew in her ear .   she spun around .   the white horse stood in the middle of the yard like a bad special effect .  he was too bright .  he glowed .  he seemed like the only real thing in a world of pale shapes .  compared to the bulbous ponies that normally occupied the loose boxes  he was a giant .   a couple of the jodhpured girls were fussing around him .  susan recognized cassandra fox and lady sara grateful  almost identical in their love of anything on four legs that went    neigh    and their disdain for anything else  their ability to apparently look at the world with their teeth  and their expertise in putting at least four vowels in the word oh .   the white horse neighed gently at susan  and began to nuzzle her hand .   you   re binky  she thought .  i know you .  i   ve ridden on you .  you   re   mine .  i think .      i say     said lady sara     who does he belong to .      susan looked around .      what .  me .     she said .     yes .  me   i suppose .         oeuwa .  he was in the loose box next to browny .  i didn   t knoeuwa you had a horse here .  you have to get permission from miss butts  you knoeuwa .         he   s a present     said susan .     from   someone    .      the hippo of recollection stirred in the muddy waters of the mind .  she wondered why she   d said that .  she hadn   t thought of her grandfather for years .  until last night .   i remember the stable  she thought .  so big you couldn   t see the walls .  and i was given a ride on you once .  someone held me so i wouldn   t fall off .  but you couldn   t fall off this horse .  not if he didn   t want you to .      oeuwa .  i didn   t know you rode .         i   used to .         there   s extra fees  you knoewa .  for keeping a horse     said lady sara .   susan said nothing .  she strongly suspected they   d be paid .      and you   ve got noeuwa tack     said lady sara .   and susan rose to it .      i don   t need any     she said .      oeuwa  bareback riding     said lady sarah .     and you steer by the ears  ya .      cassandra fox said     probably can   t afford them  out in the sticks .  and stop that dwarf looking at my pony .  she   s looking at my pony .         i   m only looking     said gloria .      you were   salivating     said cassandra .   there was a pattering across the cobbles and susan swung herself up and onto the horse   s back .   she looked down at the astonished girls  and then at the paddock beyond the stables .  there were a few jumps there  just poles balanced on barrels .   without her moving a muscle  the horse turned and trotted into the paddock and turned toward the highest jump .  there was a sensation of bunched energy  a moment of acceleration  and the jump passed underneath     binky turned and halted  prancing from one hoof to the other .   the girls were watching .  the two humans had an expression of total amazement .      should it do that .     said jade .      what   s the matter .     said susan .     have none of you seen a horse jump before .         yes .  the interesting point is       gloria began  in that slow  deliberate tone of voice people use when they don   t want the universe to shatter     is that  usually  they come down again .      susan looked .   the horse was standing on the air .   what sort of command was necessary to make a horse resume contact with the ground .  it was an instruction that the equestrian sorority had not hitherto required .   as if understanding her thoughts  the horse trotted forward and down .  for a moment the hooves dipped below the field  as if the surface were no more substantial than mist .  then binky appeared to determine where the ground level should be  and decided to stand on it .   lady sarah was the first one to find her voice .      we   ll tell miss butts on youewa     she managed .   susan was almost bewildered with unfamiliar fright  but the petty mindedness in the tones slapped her back to something approaching sanity .      oh yes .     she said .     and what will you tell her .         you made the horse jump up and       the girl stopped  aware of what she was about to say .      quite so     said susan .     i expect that seeing horses float in the air is silly  don   t you .      she slipped off the horse   s back  and gave the watchers a bright smile .      it   s against school rules  anyway     muttered lady sarah .   susan led the white horse back into the stables  rubbed him down  and put him in a spare loose box .   there was a rustling in the hayrack for a moment .  susan thought she caught a glimpse of ivory white bone .      those wretched rats     said cassandra  struggling back to reality .     i heard miss butts tell the gardener to put poison down .         shame     said gloria .   lady sarah seemed to have something boiling in her mind .      look  that horse didn   t really stand in midair  did it .     she demanded .     horses can   t do that .         then it couldn   t have done it     said susan .      hang time     said gloria .     that   s all it was .  hang time .  like in basketball .   bound to be something like that .         yes .         that   s all it was .         yes .      the human mind has a remarkable ability to heal .  so have the trollish and dwarfish minds .  susan looked at them in frank amazement .  they   d all seen a horse stand on the air .  and now they had carefully pushed it somewhere in their memories and broken off the key in the lock .      just out of interest     she said  still eyeing the hayrack     i don   t suppose any of you know where there   s a wizard in this town  do you .           i   ve found us somewhere to play .     said glod .      where .     said lias .   glod told them .      the mended drum .     said lias .     dey throw axes .         we   d be safe there .  the guild won   t play in there     said glod .      well  yah  dey lose members in dere .  dere members lose members     said lias .      we   ll get five dollars     said glod .  the troll hesitated .      i could use five dollars     he conceded .      one third of five dollars     said glod .   lias   s brow creased .      is that more or less than five dollars .     he said .      look  it   ll get us exposure     said glod .      i don   t want exposure in der drum     said lias .     exposure   s the last thing i want in der drum .  in der drum  i want something to hide behind .         all we have to do is play something     said glod .     anything .  the new landlord is dead keen on pub entertainment .         i thought they had a one arm bandit .         yes  but he got arrested .        there   s a floral clock in quirm .  it   s quite a tourist attraction .   it turns out to be not what they expect .   unimaginative municipal authorities throughout the multiverse had made floral clocks  which turn out to be a large clock mechanism buried in a civic flower bed with the face and numbers picked out in bedding plants .    but the quirm clock is simply a round flower bed  filled with twenty four different types of flower  carefully chosen for the regularity of the opening and closing of their petals     as susan ran past  the purple bindweed was opening and love in a spin was closing .  this meant that it was about half past ten .   the streets were deserted .  quirm wasn   t a night town .  people who came to quirm looking for a good time went somewhere else .  quirm was so respectable that even dogs asked permission before going to the lavatory .   at least  the streets were almost deserted .  susan fancied she could hear something following her  fast and pattering  moving and dodging across the cobbles so quickly that it was never more than a suspicion of a shape .   susan slowed down as she reached three roses alley .   somewhere in three roses near the fish shop  gloria had said .  the gels were not encouraged to know about wizards .  they did not figure in miss butts   s universe .   the alley looked alien in the darkness .  a torch burned in a bracket at one end .  it merely made the shadows darker .   and  halfway along in the gloom  there was a ladder leaning against the wall and a young woman just preparing to climb it .  there was something familiar about her .   she looked around as susan approached  and seemed quite pleased to see her .      hi     she said .     got change of a dollar  miss .         pardon .         couple of half dollars   d do .  half a dollar is the rate .  or i   ll take copper .  anything  really .         um .  sorry .  no .  i only get fifty pence a week allowance anyway .         blast .  oh  well  nothing for it .      insofar as susan could see  the girl did not appear to be the usual sort of young woman who made her living in alleys .  she had a kind of well scrubbed beefiness about her  she looked like a nurse of the sort who assist doctors whose patients occasionally get a bit confused and declare they   re a bedspread .   she looked familiar  though .   the girl took a pair of pliers from a pocket in her dress  shinned up the ladder  and climbed in through an upper window .   susan hesitated .  the girl had seemed quite businesslike about it all  but in her limited experience people who climbed ladders to get into houses at night were miscreants whom plucky gels should apprehend .  and she might at least have gone to look for a watchman  had it not been for the opening of a door farther up the alley .   two men staggered out  arm in arm  and zigzagged happily toward the main street .  susan stepped back .  no one bothered her when she didn   t want to be noticed .   the men walked through the ladder .   either the men weren   t exactly solid  and they certainly sounded solid enough  or there was something wrong with the ladder .  but the girl had climbed it        and was now climbing down again  slipping something into her pocket .      never even woke up  the little cherub     she said .      sorry .     said susan .      didn   t have   p on me     said the girl .  she swung the ladder easily up onto her shoulder .     rules are rules .  i had to take another tooth .         pardon .         it   s all audited  you see .  i   d be in real trouble if the dollars and teeth didn   t add up .  you know how it is .         i do .         still  can   t stay here talking all night .  got sixty more to do .         why should i know .  do what .  whom to .     said susan .      children  of course .  can   t disappoint them  can i .  imagine their little faces when they lift up their little pillows  bless them .      ladder .  pliers .  teeth .  money .  pillows        you don   t expect me to believe you   re the tooth fairy .     said susan suspiciously .   she touched the ladder .  it felt solid enough .      not the     said the girl .     a .  i   m surprised you don   t know that .      she   d sauntered around the corner before susan asked     why me .            cos she can tell     said a voice behind her .     takes one to know one .      she turned .  the raven was sitting in a small open window .      you   d better come in     it said .     you can meet all sorts  out in that alley .         i already have .      there was a brass plate screwed on the wall beside the door .  it said     c v cheesewaller  dm  unseen   b .  thau  b . f .      it was the first time susan had ever heard metal speak .      simple trick     said the raven  dismissively .     it senses you looking at it .  just give           c v cheesewaller  dm  unseen   b .  thau  b . f .            shut up   just give the door a push .         it   s locked .      the raven gave her a beady eyed look with its head on one side .  then it said     that stops you .  oh  well .  i   ll fetch the key .      it appeared a moment later and dropped a large metal key onto the cobbles .      isn   t the wizard in .         in  yes .  in bed .  snoring his head off .         i thought they stayed up all night .         not this one .  cup of cocoa around nine  dead to the world at five past .         i can   t just let myself into his house .         why not .  you   ve come to see me .  anyway  i   m the brains of the outfit .  he just wears the funny hat and does the hand waving .      susan turned the key .   it was warm inside .  there was the usual wizardly paraphernalia   a forge  a bench with bottles and bundles strewn over it  a bookcase with books rammed in anyhow  a stuffed alligator hanging from the ceiling  some very big candles that were just lava streams of wax  and a raven on a skull .      they get it all out of a catalog     said the raven .     believe me .  it all comes in a big box .  you think candles get dribbly like that by themselves .  that   s three days    work for a skilled candle dribbler .         you   re just making that up     said susan .     anyway  you can   t just buy a skull .         you know best i   m sure  being educated     said the raven .      what were you trying to tell me last night .         tell you .     said the raven  with a guilty look on its beak .      all that dah dah dah dah stuff .      the raven scratched its head .      he said i wasn   t to tell you .  i was just supposed to warn you about the horse .  i got carried away .  turned up  has it .         yes .         ride it .         i did .  it can   t be real .  real horses know where the ground is .         miss  there   s no horse realer than that one .         i know his name .  i   ve ridden him before .      the raven sighed  or at least made a sort of whistling noise  which is as close to a sigh as a beak can get .      ride the horse .  he   s decided you   re the one .         where to .         that   s for me not to know and you to find out .         just supposing i was stupid enough to do it   can you kind of hint about what will happen .         well   you   ve read books  i can see .  have you ever read any about children who go to magical faraway kingdoms and have adventures with goblins and so on .         yes  of course     said susan  grimly .      it   d probably be best if you thought along those lines     said the raven .   susan picked up a bundle of herbs and played with them .      i saw someone outside who said she was the tooth fairy     she said .      nah  couldn   t   ve been the tooth fairy     said the raven .     there   s at least three of them .         there   s no such person .  i mean   i didn   t know  i thought that   s just a   a story .  like the sandman or the hogfather .          ah     said the raven .     changing our tone  yes .  not so much of the emphatic declarative  yes .  a bit less of the    there   s no such thing    and a bit more of the    i didn   t know     yes .         everyone knows   i mean  it   s not logical that there   s an old man in a beard who gives everyone sausages and chitterlings on hogswatchnight  is it .         i don   t know about logic .  never learned about logic     said the raven .     living on a skull ain   t exactly logical  but that   s what i do .         and there can   t be a sandman who goes around throwing sand in children   s eyes     said susan  but in tones of uncertainty .     you   d   never get enough sand in one bag .         could be .  could be .         i   d better be going     said susan .     miss butts always checks the dorms on the stroke of midnight .         how many dormitories are there .     said the raven .      about thirty  i think .         you believe she checks them all at midnight and you don   t believe in the hogfather .         i   d better be going anyway     said susan .     um .  thank you .         lock up behind you and chuck the key through the window     said the raven .   the room was silent after she   d gone  except for the crackle as coals settled in the furnace .   then the skull said     kids today  eh .         i blame education     said the raven .      a lot of knowledge is a dangerous thing     said the skull .     a lot more dangerous than just a little .  i always used to say that  when i was alive .         when was that  exactly .         can   t remember .  i think i was pretty knowledgeable .  probably a teacher or philosopher  something of that kidney .  and now i   m on a bench with a bird crapping on my head .         very allegorical     said the raven .     no one had taught susan about the power of belief  or at least about the power of belief in a combination of high magical potential and low reality stability such as existed on the discworld .   belief makes a hollow place .  something has to roll in to fill it .   which is not to say that belief denies logic .  for example  it   s fairly obvious that the sandman needs only a small sack .   on the discworld  he doesn   t bother to take the sand out first .     it was almost midnight .   susan crept into the stables .  she was one of those people who will not leave a loose thread unpulled or a mystery unsolved .   the ponies were silent in the presence of binky .  the horse glowed in the darkness .   susan heaved a saddle down from the rack  and then thought better of it .  if she was going to fall off  a saddle wouldn   t be any help .  and reins would be about as much use as a rudder on a rock .   she opened the door to the loose box .  most horses won   t walk backward voluntarily  because what they can   t see doesn   t exist .   but binky shuffled out by himself and walked over to the mounting block  where he turned and watched her expectantly .   susan climbed onto his back .  it was like sitting on a table .      all right     she whispered .     i don   t have to believe any of this  mind you .      binky lowered his head and whinnied .  then he trotted out into the yard and headed for the field .  at the gate he broke into a canter  and turned toward the fence .   susan shut her eyes .   she felt muscles bunch under the velvet skin and then the horse was rising  over the fence  over the field .   behind it  in the turf  two fiery hoofprints burned for a second or two .   as she passed above the school she saw a light flicker in a window .  miss butts was on her rounds .   there   s going to be trouble over this  susan told herself .   and then she thought  i   m on the back of a horse a hundred feet up in the air  being taken somewhere mysterious that   s a bit like a magic land with goblins and talking animals .  there   s only so much more trouble i could get into     besides  is riding a flying horse against school rules .  i bet it   s not written down anywhere .   quirm vanished behind her  and the world opened up in a pattern of darkness and moonlight silver .  a checkerboard pattern of fields strobed by in the moonlight  with the occasional light of an isolated farm .  ragged clouds whipped past and away .   away on her left the ramtop mountains were a cold white wall .  on her right  the rim ocean carried a pathway to the moon .  there was no wind  or even a great sensation of speed   just the land flashing by  and the long slow strides of binky .   and then someone spilled gold on the night .  clouds parted in front of her and there  spread below  was ankh morpork   a city containing more peril than even miss butts could imagine .   torchlight outlined a pattern of streets into which quirm would have not only been lost  but mugged and pushed into the river as well .   binky cantered easily over the rooftops .  susan could hear the sounds of the streets  even individual voices  but there was also the great roar of the city  like some kind of insect hive .  upper windows drifted by  each one a glow of candlelight .   the horse dropped through the smoky air and landed neatly and at the trot in an alley  which was otherwise empty except for a closed door and a sign with a torch over it .   susan read     curry gardens  kitchren entlance   keep out .  ris means you .     binky seemed to be waiting for something .   susan had expected a more exotic destination .   she knew about curry .  they had curry at school  under the name of bogey and rice .  it was yellow .  there were soggy raisins and peas in it .   binky whinnied  and stamped a hoof .   a hatch in the door flew open .  susan got a brief impression of a face against the fiery atmosphere of the kitchen .      ooorrrh  nooorrrh .  binkorrr .      the hatch slammed shut again .   obviously something was meant to happen .   she stared at a menu nailed to the wall .  it was misspelled  of course  because the menu of the folkier kind of restaurant always has to have misspellings in it  so that customers can be lured into a false sense of superiority .  she couldn   t recognize the names of most of the dishes  which included     curry with vegetable  p  curry with sweat  and sore balls of pig   p  curry with sweer and sour  ball of fish   p  curry with meat   p  curry with named meat   p  extra curry  p  porn cracker  p    eat it here or   take it away    the hatch snapped open again and a large brown bag of allegedly but not really waterproof paper was dumped on the little ledge in front of it .  then the hatch slammed shut again .   susan reached out carefully .  the smell rising from the bag had a sort of thermic lance quality that warned against metal cutlery .  but tea had been a long time ago .   she realized she didn   t have any money on her .  on the other hand  no one had asked her for any .  but the world would go to wrack and ruin if people didn   t recognize their responsibilities .   she leaned forward and knocked on the door     excuse me   don   t you want anything    .      there was shouting and a crash from inside  as if half a dozen people were fighting to get under the same table .      oh .  how nice .  thank you .  thank you very much     said susan  politely .   binky walked away  slowly .  this time there was no bunched leap of muscle power   he trotted into the air carefully  as if sometime in the past he   d been scolded for spilling something .   susan tried the curry several hundred feet above the speeding landscape  and then threw it away as politely as possible .      it was very   unusual     she said .     and that   s it .  you carried me all the way up here for take away food .      the ground skimmed past faster  and it crept over her that the horse was going a lot faster now  a full gallop instead of the easy canter .  a bunching of muscle        and then the sky ahead of her erupted blue for a moment .   behind her  unseen because light was standing around red with embarrassment  asking itself what had happened  a pair of hoofprints burned in the air for a moment and then faded .     it was a landscape  hanging in space .   there was a squat little house  with a garden around it .  there were fields  and distant mountains .  susan stared at it as binky slowed .   there was no depth .  as the horse swung around for a landing  the landscape was revealed as a mere surface  a thin shaped film of   existence   imposed on nothingness .   she expected it to tear when the horse landed  but there was only a faint crunch and a scatter of gravel .   binky trotted around the house and into the stable yard  where he stood and waited .   susan got off  gingerly .  the ground felt solid enough under her feet .  she reached down and scratched at the gravel  there was more gravel underneath .   she   d heard that the tooth fairy collected teeth .  think about it logically   the only other people who collected any bits of bodies did so for very suspicious purposes  and usually to harm or control other people .  the tooth fairies must have half the children in the world under their control .  and this didn   t look like the house of that sort of person .   the hogfather apparently lived in some kind of horrible slaughterhouse in the mountains  festooned with sausages and black puddings and painted a terrible blood red .   which suggested style .  a nasty style  but at least style of a sort .  this place didn   t have style of any sort .   the soul cake tuesday duck didn   t apparently have any kind of a home .  nor did old man trouble or the sandman  as far as she knew .   she walked around the house  which wasn   t much larger than a cottage .  definitely .  whoever lived here had no taste at all .   she found the front door .  it was black  with a knocker in the shape of an omega .   susan reached for it  but the door opened by itself .   and the hall stretched away in front of her  far bigger than the outside of the house could possibly contain .  she could distantly make out a stairway wide enough for the tap dancing finale in a musical .   there was something else wrong with the perspective .  there clearly was a wall a long way off but  at the same time  it looked as though it was painted in the air a mere fifteen feet or so away .  it was as if distance was optional .   there was a large clock against one wall .  its slow tick filled the immense space .   there   s a room  she thought .  i remember the room of whispers .   doors lined the hall at wide intervals .  or short intervals  if you looked at it another way .   she tried to walk toward the nearest one  and gave up after a few wildly teetering steps .  finally she managed to reach it by taking aim and then shutting her eyes .   the door was at one and the same time about normal human size and immensely big .  there was a highly ornate frame around it  with a skull and bones motif .   she pushed the door open .   this room could have housed a small town .   a small area of carpet occupied the middle distance  no more than a hectare in size .  it took susan several minutes to reach the edge .   it was a room within a room .  there was a large  heavy looking desk on a raised dais  with a leather swivel chair behind it .  there was a large model of the discworld  on a sort of ornament made of four elephants standing on the shell of a turtle .  there were several bookshelves  the large volumes piled in the haphazard fashion of people who   re far too busy using the books ever to arrange them properly .  there was even a window  hanging in the air a few feet above the ground .   but there were no walls .  there was nothing between the edge of the carpet and the walls of the greater room except floor  and even that was far too precise a word for it .  it didn   t look like rock and it certainly wasn   t wood .  it made no sound when susan walked on it .  it was simply surface  in the purely geometrical sense .   the carpet had a skull and bones pattern .   it was also black .  everything was black  or a shade of grey .  here and there a tint suggested a very deep purple or ocean depth blue .   in the distance  toward the walls of the greater room  the metaroom or whatever it was  there was the suggestion of   something .  something was casting complicated shadows  too far away to be clearly seen .   susan got up onto the dais .   there was something odd about the things around her .  of course  there was everything odd about the things around her  but it was a huge major oddness that was simply in their nature .  she could ignore it .  but there was an oddness on a human level .  everything was just slightly wrong  as if it had been made by someone who hadn   t fully comprehended its purpose .   there was a blotter on the oversize desk but it was part of it  fused to the surface .  the drawers were just raised areas of wood  impossible to open .  whoever had made the desk had seen desks  but hadn   t understood deskishness .   there was even some sort of desk ornament .  it was just a slab of lead  with a thread hanging down one side and a shiny round metal ball on the end of the thread .  if you raised the ball it swung down and thumped into the lead  just once .   she didn   t try to sit in the chair .  there was a deep pit in the leather .  someone had spent a lot of time sitting there .   she glanced at the spines of the books .  they were in a language she couldn   t understand .   she trekked back to the distant door  went out into the hall  and tried the next door .  a suspicion was beginning to form in her mind .   the door led to another huge room  but this one was full of shelves  floor to distant  cloud hung ceiling .  every shelf was lined with hourglasses .   the sand pouring from the past to the future filled the room with a sound like surf  a noise made up of a billion small sounds .   susan walked between the shelves .  it was like being in a crowd .   her eye was caught by a movement on a nearby shelf .  in most of the hourglasses the falling sand was a solid silver line but in this one  just as she watched  the line vanished .  the last grain of sand tumbled into the bottom bulb .   the hourglass vanished  with a small    pop .      a moment later another one appeared in its place  with the faintest of    pings .     in front of her eyes  sand began to fall     and she was aware that this process was going on all over the room .  old hourglasses vanished  new ones took their place .   she knew about this  too .   she reached out and picked up a glass  bit her lip thoughtfully  and started to turn the thing upside down     squeak .   she spun around .  the death of rats was on the shelf behind her .  it raised an admonitory finger .      all right     said susan .  she put the glass back in its place .   squeak     no .  i haven   t finished looking .      susan set off for the door  with the rat skrittering across the floor after her .   the third room turned out to be        the bathroom .   susan hesitated .  you expected hourglasses in this place .  you expected the skull and bones motif .  but you didn   t expect the very large white porcelain tub  on its own raised podium like a throne  with giant brass taps and   in faded blue letters just over the thing that held the plug chain   the words  c .  h .  lavatory   son  mollymog st  ankh morpork .   you didn   t expect the rubber duck .  it was yellow .   you didn   t expect the soap .  it was suitably bone white  but looked as if it had never been used .  beside it was a bar of orange soap which certainly had been used   it was hardly more than a sliver .  it smelled a lot like the vicious stuff used at school .   the bath  though big  was a human thing .  there was brown lined crazing around the plug hole and a stain where the tap had dripped .  but almost everything else had been designed by the person who hadn   t understood deskishness  and now hadn   t understood ablutionology either .   they had created a towel rail an entire athletics team could have used for training .  the black towels on it were fused onto it and were quite hard .  whoever actually used the bathroom probably dried themselves on one white and blue  very worn towel with the initials y . m . r c i g b s a  a m .  on it .   there was even a lavatory  another fine example of c .  h .  lavatory   s porcelainic art  with an embossed frieze of green and blue flowers on the cistern .  and again  like the bath and the soap  it suggested that this room had been built by someone   and then someone else had come along afterward to add small details .  someone with a better knowledge of plumbing  for a start .  and someone else who understood  really understood  that towels should be soft and capable of drying people  and soap should be capable of bubbles .   you didn   t expect any of it until you saw it .  and then it was like seeing it again .   the bald towel dropped off the rail and skipped across the floor  until it fell away to reveal the death of rats .   squeak .      oh  all right     said susan .     where do you want me to go now .      the rat scurried to the open door and disappeared into the hall .   susan followed it to yet another door .  she turned yet another handle .   another room within a room lay beyond .  there was a tiny area of lit tiling in the darkness  containing the distant vision of a table  a few chairs  a kitchen dresser        and someone .  a hunched figure was sitting at the table .  as susan cautiously approached she heard the rattle of cutlery on a plate .   an old man was eating his supper  very noisily .  in between forkfuls  he was talking to himself with his mouth full .  it was a kind of auto bad manners .         s not my fault .   spray  i was against it from the start but  oh no  he has to go and  recover piece of ballistic sausage from table  start gettin    involved  i told him  i   s   not as if you   re not involved  stab unidentified fried object  oh no  that   s not his way  spray  jab fork at the air  once you get involved like that  i said  how   re you getting out  tell me that  make temporary egg and ketchup sandwich  but  oh no        susan walked around the patch of carpet .  the man took no notice .   the death of rats shinned up the table leg and landed on a slice of fried bread .      oh .  it   s you .      squeak .   the old man looked around .      where .  where .      susan stepped onto the carpet .  the man stood up so quickly that his chair fell over .      who the hells are you .         could you stop pointing that sharp bacon at me .         i asked you a question  young woman .         i   m susan .     this didn   t sound enough .     duchess of sto helit     she added .   the man   s wrinkled face wrinkled still further as he strove to comprehend this .  then he turned away and threw his hands up in the air .      oh  yes .     he bawled  to the room in general .     that just puts the entire tin lid on it  that does .      he waved a finger at the death of rats  who leaned backward .      you cheating little rodent .  oh  yes .  i smell a rat here .      squeak .   the shaking finger stopped suddenly .  the man spun around .      how did you manage to walk through the wall .         i   m sorry .     said susan  backing away .     i didn   t know there was one .         what d   you call this then  klatchian mist .     the man slapped the air .   the hippo of memory wallowed           albert       said susan .     right .      albert thumped his forehead with the palm of his hand .      worse and worse .  what   ve you been telling her .         he didn   t tell me anything except squeak and i don   t know what that means     said susan .     but   look  there   s no wall here  there   s just        albert wrenched open a drawer .      observe     he said sharply .     hammer  right .  nail  right .  watch .      he hammered the nail into the air about five feet up at the edge of the tiled area .  it hung there .      wall     said albert .   susan reached out gingerly and touched the nail .  it had a sticky feel  a little like static electricity .      well  it doesn   t feel like a wall to me     she managed .   squeak .   albert dropped the hammer on the table .   he wasn   t a small man  susan realized .  he was quite tall  but he walked with the kind of lopsided stoop normally associated with laboratory assistants of an igor turn of mind .      i give in     he said  wagging his finger at susan again .     i told him no good   d come of it .  he started meddlin     and next thing a mere chit of a girl   where   d you go .      susan walked over to the table while albert waved his arms in the air  trying to find her .   there was a cheeseboard on the table  and a snuffbox .  and a string of sausages .  no fresh vegetables at all .  miss butts advocated avoiding fried foods and eating plenty of vegetables for what she referred to as daily health .  she put a lot of troubles down to an absence of daily health .  albert looked like the embodiment of them all as he scuttled around the kitchen  grabbing at the air .   she sat in the chair as he danced past .   albert stopped moving  and put his hand over one eye .  then he turned  very carefully .  the one visible eye was screwed up in a frantic effort of concentration .   he squinted at the chair  his eye watering with effort .      that   s pretty good     he said  quietly     all right .  you   re here .  the rat and the horse brought you .  damn fool things .  they think it   s the right thing to do .         what right thing to do .     said susan .     and i   m not a   what you said .      albert stared at her .      the master could do that     he said at last .     it   s part of the job .  i    spect you found you could do it a long time ago  eh .  not be noticed when you didn   t want to be .      squeak  said the death of rats .      what .     said albert .   squeak .      he says to tell you     said albert wearily     that a chit of a girl means a small girl .  he thinks you may have misheard me .      susan hunched up in the chair .  albert pulled up another one and sat down .      how old are you .         sixteen .         oh  my .     albert rolled his eyes .     how long have you been sixteen .         since i was fifteen  of course .  are you stupid .         my  my  how the time does pass     said albert .     do you know why you   re here .         no   but     susan hesitated     but it   s got something to do with   it   s something like   i   m seeing things that people don   t see  and i   ve met someone who   s just a story  and i know i   ve been here before   and all these skulls and bones on things        albert   s rangy  vulturelike shape loomed over her .      would you like a cocoa .     he said .   it was a lot different from the cocoa at the school  which was like hot brown water .  albert   s cocoa had fat floating in it  if you turned the mug upside down  it would be a little while before anything fell out .      your mum and dad     said albert  when she had a chocolate mustache that was far too young for her     did they ever   explain anything to you .         miss delcross did that in biology     said susan .     she got it wrong     she added .      i mean about your grandfather     said albert .      i remember things     said susan     but i can   t remember them until i   ve seen them .  like the bathroom .  like you .         your mum and dad thought it best if you forgot     said albert .     hah .  it   s in the bone .  they was afraid it was going to happen and it has .  you   ve inherited .         oh  i know about that  too     said susan .     it   s all about mice and beans and things .      albert gave her a blank look .      look  i   ll try to put it tactful     he said .   susan gave him a polite look .      your grandfather is death     said albert .     you know .  the skeleton in the black robe .  you rode in on his horse and this is his house .  only he   s   gone away .  to think things over  or something .  what i reckon   s happening is you   re being sucked in .  it   s in the bone .  you   re old enough now .  there   s a hole and it thinks you   re the right shape .  i don   t like it any more than you do .         death     said susan  flatly .     like the hogfather and the sandman and the tooth fairy .         yes .      squeak .      you expect me to believe that  do you .     said susan  trying to summon up her most withering scorn .   albert glared back like someone who   d done all his withering a long time ago .      it   s no skin off my nose what you believe  madam     he said .      you really mean the tall figure with the scythe and everything .         yes .         look  albert     said susan  in the voice ones uses to the simple minded     even if there was a    death    like that  and frankly it   s quite ridiculous to go anthropomorphizing a simple natural function  no one can inherit anything from it .  i know about heredity .  it   s all about having red hair and things .  you get it from other people .  you don   t get it from   myths and legends .  um .      the death of rats had gravitated to the cheeseboard  where he was using his scythe to hack off a lump .  albert sat back .      i remember when you got brought here     he said .     he   d kept on asking  you see .  he was curious .  he likes kids .  sees a lot of them really  but   not to get to know  if you see what i mean .  your mum and dad didn   t want to  but they gave in and brought you all here for tea one day just to keep him quiet .  they didn   t like to do it because they thought you   d be scared and scream the place down .  but you   you didn   t scream .  you laughed .  frightened the life out of your dad  that did .  they brought you a couple more times when he asked  but then they got scared about what might happen and your dad put his foot down and that was the end of it .  he was about the only one who could argue with the master  your dad .  you   d have been about four then  i think .      susan raised her hand thoughtfully and touched the pale lines on her cheek .      the master said they were raising you according to     albert sneered     modern methods .  logic .  and thinking old stuff is silly .  i dunno   i suppose they wanted to keep you away from   ideas like this           i was given a ride on the horse     said susan  not listening to him .     i had a bath in the big bathroom .         soap all over the place     said albert .  his face contorted into something approaching a smile .     i could hear the master laughing from here .  and he made you a swing  too .  tried to  anyway .  no magic or anything .  with his actual hands .      susan sat while memories woke and yawned and unfolded in her head .      i remember about that bathroom now     she said .     it   s all coming back to me .         nah  it never went away .  it just got papered over .         he was no good at plumbing .  what does y . m . r c i g b s a  a m .  mean .         young men   s reformed cultists of the ichor god bel shamharoth association  ankh morpork     said albert .     it   s where i stay if i have to go back down for anything .  soap and suchlike .         but you   re not   a young man     said susan  unable to prevent herself .      no one argues     he snapped .  and susan thought that was probably true .  there was some kind of wiry strength in albert  as if his whole body was a knuckle .      he can make just about anything     she said  half to herself     but some things he just doesn   t understand  and one of them   s plumbing .         right .  we had to get a plumber from ankh morpork  hah  he said he   d might be able to make it a week next thursday  and you don   t say that kind of thing to the master     said albert .     i   ve never seen a bugger work so fast .  then the master just made him forget .  he can make everyone forget  except       albert stopped  and frowned .      seems i   ve got to put up with it     he said .     seems you   ve a right .  i expect you   re tired .  you can stay here .  there   s plenty of rooms .         no  i   ve got to get back .  there   ll be terrible trouble if i   m not at school in the morning .         there   s no time here except what people brings with    em .  things just happen one after the other .  binky   ll take you right back to the time you left  if you like .  but you ought to stop here a while .         you said there   s a hole and i   m being sucked in .  i don   t know what that means .         you   ll feel better after a sleep     said albert .       there was no real day or night here .  that had given albert trouble at first .  there was just the bright landscape and  above  a black sky with stars .  death had never got the hang of day and night .  when the house had human inhabitants it tended to keep a twenty six hour day .  humans  left to themselves  adopt a longer diurnal rhythm than the twenty four hour day  so they can be reset like a lot of little clocks at sunset .  humans have to put up with time  but days are a sort of personal option .   albert went to bed whenever he remembered .   now he sat up  with one candle alight  staring into space .      she remembered about the bathroom     he muttered .     and she knows about things she couldn   t have seen .  she couldn   t have been tole .  she   s got his memory .  she inherited .      squeak  said the death of rats .  he liked to sit by the fire at night .      last time he went off people stopped dyin        said albert .     but they ain   t stopped dyin    this time .  and the horse went to her .  she   s fillin    the hole .      albert glared at the darkness .  when he was agitated it showed by a sort of relentless chewing and sucking activity  as if he was trying to extract some forgotten morsel of teatime from the recesses of a tooth .  now he was making a noise like a hairdresser   s u bend .   he couldn   t remember ever having been young .  it must have happened thousands of years ago .  he was seventy nine  but time in death   s house was a reusable resource .   he was vaguely aware that childhood was a tricky business  especially toward the end .  there was all the business with pimples and bits of your body having a mind of their own .   running the executive arm of mortality was certainly an extra problem .   but the point was  the horrible  inescapable point was  that someone had to do it .   for  as has been said before  death operated in general rather than particular terms  just like a monarchy .   if you are a subject in a monarchy  you are ruled by the monarch .  all the time .  waking or sleeping .  whatever you   or they   happen to be doing .   it   s part of the general conditions of the situation .  the queen doesn   t actually have to come around to your actual house  hog the chair and the tv remote control  and issue actual commands about how one is parched and would enjoy a cup of tea .  it all takes place automatically  like gravity .  except that  unlike gravity  it needs someone at the top .  they don   t necessarily have to do a great deal .  they just have to be there .  they just have to be .      her .     said albert .   squeak .      she   ll crack soon enough     said albert .     oh  yes .  you can   t be an immortal and a mortal at the same time  it   ll tear you in half .  i almost feels sorry for her .      squeak  agreed the death of rats .      and that ain   t the worst bit     said albert .     you wait till her memory really starts working        squeak .   you listen to me     said albert .     you   d better start looking for him right away .        susan awoke  and had no idea what time it was .   there was a clock by the bedside  because death knew there should be things like bedside clocks .  it had skulls and bones and the omega sign on it  and it didn   t work .  there were no working clocks in the house  except the special one in the hall .  any others got depressed and stopped  or unwound themselves all in one go .   her room looked as though someone had moved out yesterday .  there were hairbrushes on the dressing table  and a few odds and ends of makeup .  there was even a dressing gown on the back of the door .  it had a rabbit on the pocket .  the cozy effect would have been improved if it hadn   t been a skeletal one .   she had a rummage through the drawers .  this must have been her mother   s room .  there was a lot of pink .  susan had nothing against pink in moderation  but this wasn   t it  she put on her old school dress .   the important thing  she decided  was to stay calm .  there was always a logical explanation for everything  even if you had to make it up .   sqeauff .   the death of rats landed on the dressing table  claws scrabbling for a purchase .  he removed the tiny scythe from his jaws .      i think     said susan carefully     that i would like to go home now  thank you .      the little rat nodded  and leapt .   it landed on the edge of the pink carpet and scurried away across the dark floor beyond .   when susan stepped off the carpet the rat stopped and looked around in approval .  once again  she felt she   d passed some sort of test .   she followed it out into the hall and then into the smoky cavern of the kitchen .  albert was bent over the stove .         morning     he said  out of habit rather than any acknowledgment of the time of day .     you want fried bread with your sausages .  there   s porridge to follow .      susan looked at the mess sizzling in the huge frying pan .  it wasn   t a sight to be seen on an empty stomach  although it could probably cause one .  albert could make an egg wish it had never been laid .      haven   t you got any muesli .     she said .      is that some kind of sausage .     said albert suspiciously .      it   s nuts and grains .         any fat in it .         i don   t think so .         how   re you suppose to fry it  then .         you don   t fry it .         you call that breakfast .         it doesn   t have to be fried to be breakfast     said susan .     i mean  you mentioned porridge  and you don   t fry porridge           who says .         a boiled egg  then .         hah  boiling   s no good  it don   t kill off all the germs .         boil me an egg  albert .      as the echoes bounced and died away  susan wondered where the voice had came from .   albert   s ladle tinkled on the tiles .      please .     said susan .      you did the voice     said albert .      don   t bother about the egg     said susan .  the voice had made her jaw ache .  it worried her even more than it worried albert .  after all  it was her mouth .     i want to go home .         you are home     said albert .      this place .  this isn   t my home .         yeah .  what   s the inscription on the big clock .            too late        said susan promptly .      where are the beehives .         in the orchard .         how many plates   ve we got .         seven       susan shut her mouth firmly .      see .  it   s home to part of you     said albert .      look   albert     said susan  trying sweet reason in case it worked any better this time round     maybe there is   someone   sort of   in charge of things but i   m really no one special   i mean           yeah .  how come the horse knows you .         yes  but i really am just a normal girl           normal girls didn   t get a my little binky set on their third birthday .     snapped albert .     your dad took it away .  the master was very upset about that .  he was trying .         i mean i   m an ordinary kid .         listen  ordinary kids get a xylophone .  they don   t just ask their granddad to take his shirt off .         i mean i can   t help it .  that   s not my fault .  it   s not fair .         really .  oh  why didn   t you say .     said albert sourly .     that cuts a lot of thin ice  that does .  i should just go out now  if i was you  and tell the universe that it   s not fair .  i bet it   ll say  oh  all right then  sorry you   ve been troubled  you   re let off .         that   s sarcasm .  you can   t talk to me like that .  you   re just a servant .         that   s right .  and so are you .  so i should get started  if i was you .  the rat   ll help .  he mainly does rats  but the principle   s the same .      susan sat with her mouth open .      i   m going outside     she snapped .      i ain   t stopping you .      susan stormed out through the back door  across the enormous expanses of the outer room  past the grindstone in the yard  and into the garden .      huh     she said .   if someone had told susan that death had a house  she would have called them mad or  even worse  stupid .  but if she   d had to imagine one  she   d have drawn  in sensible black crayon  some towering  battlemented  gothic mansion .  it would loom  and involve other words ending in    oom     like gloom and doom .  there would have been thousands of windows .  she   d fill odd corners of the sky with bats .  it would be impressive .   it wouldn   t be a cottage .  it wouldn   t have a rather tasteless garden .  it wouldn   t have a mat in front of the door with    welcome    on it .   susan had invincible walls of common sense .  they were beginning to melt like salt in a wet wind  and that made her angry .   there was grandfather lezek  of course  on his little farm so poor that even the sparrows had to kneel down to eat .  he   d been a nice old chap  so far as she could recall  a bit sheepish  now she came to think about it  especially when her father was around .   her mother had told susan that her own father had been     now she came to think about that  she wasn   t sure what her mother had told her .  parents were quite clever at not telling people things  even when they used a lot of words .  she   d just been left with the impression that he wasn   t around .   now it was being suggested that he was renowned for being around all the time .   it was like having a relative in trade .   a god  now   a god would be something .  lady odile flume  in the fifth form  was always boasting that her great great grandmother had once been seduced by the god blind io in the form of a vase of daisies  which apparently made her a demi hemi semi goddess .  she said her mother found it useful to get a table in restaurants .  saying you were a close relative of death probably would not have the same effect .  you probably wouldn   t even manage a seat near the kitchen .   if it was all some kind of dream  she didn   t seem at any risk of waking up .  anyway  she didn   t believe in that kind of thing .  dreams weren   t like this .   a path led from the stable yard past a vegetable garden and  descending slightly  into an orchard of black leaved trees .  glossy black apples hung from them .  off to one side were some white beehives .   and she knew she   d seen it all before .   there was an apple tree that was quite  quite different from the others .   she stood and stared at it as memory flooded back .   she remembered being just old enough to see how logically stupid the whole idea was  and he   d been standing there  anxiously waiting to see what she   d do     old certainties drained away  to be replaced by new certainties .   now she understood whose granddaughter she was .     the mended drum had traditionally gone in for  well  traditional pub games  such as dominoes  darts  and stabbing people in the back and taking all their money .  the new owner had decided to go up market .  this was the only available direction .   there had been the quizzing device  a three ton water driven monstrosity based on a recently discovered design by leonard of quirm .  it had been a bad idea .  captain carrot of the watch  who had a mind like a needle under his open  smiling face  had surreptitiously substituted a new roll of questions like  were you nere vortin   s diamond warehourse on the nite of the   th .  and  who was the third man who did the blagging at bearhugger   s distillery larst week .  and had arrested three customers before they caught on .   the owner had promised another machine any day now .  the librarian  one of the tavern   s regulars  had been collecting pennies in readiness .   there was a small stage at one end of the bar .  the owner had tried a lunchtime stripper  but only once .  at the sight of a large orang utan in the front row with a big innocent grin  a big bag of penny pieces  and a big banana the poor girl had fled .  yet another entertainment guild had blacklisted the drum .   the new owner   s name was hibiscus dunelm .  it wasn   t his fault .  he really wanted to make the drum  he said  a fun place .  for two pins he   d have put stripy umbrellas outside .   he looked down at glod .      just three of you .     he said .      yes .         when i agreed to five dollars you said you had a big band .         say hello  lias .         my word  that is a big band .     dunelm backed away .     i thought     he said     just a few numbers that everyone knows .  just to provide some ambience .         ambience     said imp  looking around the drum .  he was familiar with the word .  but  in a place like this  it was all lost and alone .  there were only three or four customers in at this early hour of the evening .  they weren   t paying any attention to the stage .   the wall behind the stage had clearly seen action .  he stared at it as lias patiently stacked up his stones .      oh  just a bit of fruit and old eggs     said glod .     people probably get a bit boisterous .  i shouldn   t worry about that .         i   m not worried about it     said imp .      i should think not .         it   s the ax marks and arrow holles i   m worried about .  gllod  we haven   t even practiced .  not properly .         you can play your guitar  can   t you .         well  yes  i suppose        he   d tried it out .  it was easy to play .  in fact  it was almost impossible to play badly .  it didn   t seem to matter how he touched the strings   they still rang out the tune he had in mind .  it was  in solid form  the kind of instrument you dream about when you first start to play   the one you can play without learning .  he remembered when he   d first picked up a harp and struck the strings  confidently expecting the kind of lambent tones the old men coaxed from them .  he   d got a discord instead .  but this was the instrument he   d dreamed of        we   ll stick to numbers everyone knows     said the dwarf .        a wizard   s staff    and    gathering rhubarb .     stuff like that .  people like songs they can snigger along to .      imp looked down at the bar .  it was filling up a bit now .  but his attention was drawn to a large orang utan  which had pulled up its chair right in front of the stage and was holding a bag of fruit .      gllod  there   s an ape watching us .         well .     said glod  unfolding a string bag .      it   s an ape .         this is ankh morpork .  that   s how things are here .     glod removed his helmet and unfolded something from inside .      why   ve you got a string bag .     said imp .      fruit   s fruit .  waste not  want not .  if they throw eggs  try to catch them .      imp slung the guitar   s strap over his shoulder .  he   d tried to tell the dwarf  but what could he say  this is too easy to play .   he hoped there was a god of musicians .   and there is .  there are many  one for almost every type of music .  almost every type .  but the only one due to watch over imp that night was reg  god of club musicians  who couldn   t pay much attention because he   d also got three other gigs to do .      we ready .     said lias  picking his hammers .   the others nodded .      let   s give    em    the wizard   s staff     then     said glod .     that always breaks the ice .         okay     said the troll .  he counted on his fingers .     one  two   one  two  many  lots .      the first apple was thrown seven seconds later .  it was caught by glod  who didn   t miss a note .  but the first banana curved viciously and grounded in his ear .      keep playing .     he hissed .   imp obeyed  ducking a fusillade of oranges .   in the front row  the ape opened his bag and produced a very large melon .      can you see any pears .     said glod  taking a breath .     i like pears .         i can see a man with a throwing ax .         does it look valuable .      an arrow vibrated in the wall by lias   s head .     it was three in the morning .  sergeant colon and corporal nobbs were reaching the conclusion that anyone who intended to invade ankh morpork probably wasn   t going to do so now .  and there was a good fire back in the watch house .      we could leave a note     said nobby  blowing on his fingers .     you know .  come back tomorrow  sort of thing .      he looked up .  a solitary horse was walking under the gate arch .  a white horse  with a somber  black clad rider .   there was no question of    halt  who goes there .     the night watch walked the streets at strange hours and had become accustomed to seeing things not generally seen by mortal men .   sergeant colon touched his helmet respectfully .         evenin     your lordship     he said .      er   good evening .      the guards watched the horse walk out of sight .      some poor bugger   s in for it  then     said sergeant colon .      he   s dedicated  you got to admit it     said nobby .     out at all hours .  always got time for people .         yeah .      the guards stared into the velvety dark .  something not quite right  thought sergeant colon .      what   s his first name .     said nobby .   they stared some more .  then sergeant colon  who still hadn   t quite been able to put his finger on it  said     what do you mean  what   s his first name .         what   s his first name .         he   s death     said the sergeant .     death .  that   s his whole name .  i mean   what do you mean .    you mean like   keith death .         well  why not .         he   s just death  isn   t he .         no  that   s just his job .  what do his friends call him .         what do you mean  friends .         all right .  please yourself .         let   s go and get a hot rum .         i think he looks like a leonard .      sergeant colon remembered the voice .  that was it .  just for a moment there        i must be getting old     he said .     for a moment there i thought he sounded like a susan .           i think they saw me     whispered susan  as the horse rounded a corner .   the death of rats poked its head out of her pocket .   squeak .      i think we   re going to need that raven     said susan .     i mean  i   think i understand you  i just don   t know what you   re saying        binky stopped outside a large house  set back a little from the road .  it was a slightly pretentious residence with more gables and mullions than it should rightly have  and this was a clue to its origins  it was the kind of house built for himself by a rich merchant when he goes respectable and needs to do something with the loot .      i   m not happy about this     said susan .     it can   t possibly work .  i   m human .  i have to go to the toilet and things like that .  i can   t just walk into people   s houses and kill them .      squeak .      all right  not kill .  but it   s not good manners  however you look at it .      a sign on the door said  tradesmen to rear entrance .      do i count as        squeak .   susan normally would never have dreamed of asking .  she   d always seen herself as a person who went through the front doors of life .   the death of rats scuttled up the path and through the door .      hang on .  i can   t        susan looked at the wood .  she could .  of course she could .  more memories crystallized in front of her eyes .  after all  it was only wood .  it   d rot in a few hundred years .  by the measure of infinity  it hardly existed at all .  on average  considered over the lifetime of the multiverse  most things didn   t .   she stepped forward .  the heavy oak door offered as much resistance as a shadow .     grieving relatives were clustered around the bed where  almost lost in the pillows  was a wrinkled old man .  at the foot of the bed  paying no attention whatsoever to the keening around it  was a large  very fat  ginger cat .   squeak .   susan looked at the hourglass .  the last few grains tumbled through the pinch .   the death of rats  with exaggerated caution  sneaked up behind the sleeping cat and kicked it hard .  the animal awoke  turned  flattened its ears in terror  and leapt off the quilt .   the death of rats sniggered .   snh  snh  snh .   one of the mourners  a pinch faced man  looked up .  he peered at the sleeper .      that   s it     he said     he   s gone .         i thought we were going to be here all day     said the woman next to him  standing up .     did you see that wretched old cat move .  animals can tell  you know .  they   ve got this sixth sense .      snh  snh  snh .      well  come on there  i know you   re here somewhere     said the corpse .  it sat up .   susan was familiar with the idea of ghosts .  but she hadn   t expected it to be like this .  she hadn   t expected the ghosts to be the living  but they were merely pale sketches in the air compared to the old man sitting up in bed .  he looked solid enough  but a blue glow outlined him .      one hundred and seven years  eh .     he cackled .     i expect i had you worried for a while there .  where are you .         er  here     said susan .      female  eh .     said the old man .     well  well  well .      he slid off the bed  spectral nightshirt flapping  and was suddenly pulled up short as though he   d reached the end of a chain .  this was more or less the case  a thin line of blue light still tethered him to his late habitation .   the death of rats jumped up and down on the pillow  making urgent slashing movements with its scythe .      oh  sorry     said susan  and sliced .  the blue line snapped with a high pitched  crystalline twang .   around them  sometimes walking through them  were the mourners .  mourning seemed to have stopped now the old man had died .  the pinch faced man was feeling under the mattress .      look at    em     said the old man nastily     poor ole granddad  sob sob  sorely missed  we won   t see his like again  where did the ole bugger leave his will .  that   s my youngest son  that is .  well  if you can call a card every hogswatchnight a son .  see his wife .  got a smile like a wave on a slop bucket .  and she ain   t the worst of    em .  relatives .  you can keep    em .  i only stayed alive out of mischief .      a couple of people were exploring under the bed .  there was a humorous porcelain clang .  the old man capered behind them  making gestures .      not a chance .     he chortled .     heh heh .  it   s in the cat basket .  i left all me money to the cat .      susan looked around .  the cat was watching them anxiously from behind the washstand .   susan felt some response was called for .      that was very   kind of you       she said .      hah .  mangy thing .  thirteen years of sleepin    and crappin    and waiting for the next meal to turn up .  never took half an hour   s exercise in his big fat life .  up until they find the will  anyway .  then he   s going to be the richest  fastest cat in the world        the voice faded .  so did its owner .      what a dreadful old man     said susan .   she looked down at the death of rats  who was trying to make faces at the cat .      what   ll happen to him .      squeak .      oh .     behind them  a former mourner tipped a drawer out onto the floor .  the cat was beginning to tremble .   susan stepped out through the wall .     clouds curled behind binky like a wake .      well  that wasn   t too bad .  i mean  no blood or anything .  and he was very old and not very nice .         that   s all right  then  is it .      the raven landed on her shoulder .      what   re you doing here .         rat death here said i could have a lift .  i   ve got an appointment .      squeak .   the death of rats poked its nose out of the saddlebag .      are we a cab service .     said susan coldly .   the rat shrugged and pushed a lifetimer into her hand .   susan read the name etched on the glass .      volf volfssonssonssonsson .  sounds a bit hublandish to me .      squeak .   the death of rats clambered up binky   s mane and took up station between the horse   s ears  tiny robe flapping in the wind .     binky cantered low over a battlefield .  it wasn   t a major war  just an intertribal scuffle .  nor were there any obvious armies   the fighters seemed to be two groups of individuals  some on horseback  who happened coincidentally to be on the same side .  everyone was dressed in the same sort of furs and exciting leatherwear  and susan was at a loss to know how they told friend from foe .  people just seemed to shout a lot and swing huge swords and battle axes at random .  on the other hand  anyone you managed to hit instantly became your foe  so it probably all came out right in the long run .  the point was that people were dying and acts of incredibly stupid heroism were being performed .   squeak .   the death of rats pointed urgently downward .      gee   down .      binky settled on a small hillock .      er   right     said susan .  she pulled the scythe out of its holster .  the blade sprang into life .   it wasn   t hard to spot the souls of the dead .  they were coming off the battlefield arm in arm  friend and hitherto foe alike  laughing and stumbling  straight toward her .   susan dismounted .  and concentrated .      er     she said     anyone here been killed and called volf .      behind her  the death of rats put its head in its paws .      er .  hello .      no one took any notice .  the warriors trooped past .  they were forming a line on the edge of the battlefield  and appeared to be waiting for something .   she didn   t have to   do   all of them .  albert had tried to explain  but a memory had unfolded anyway .  she just had to do some  determined by timing or historical importance  and that meant all the others happened  all she had to do was keep the momentum going .      you got to be more assertive     said the raven  who had alighted on a rock .     that   s the trouble with women in the professions .  not assertive enough .         why   d you want to come here .     she said .      this is a battlefield  isn   t it     said the raven patiently .     you   ve got to have ravens afterward .     its freewheeling eyes swiveled in its head .     carrion regardless  as you might say .         you mean everyone gets eaten .         part of the miracle of nature     said the raven .      that   s horrible     said susan .  black birds were already circling in the sky .      not really     said the raven .     horses for courses  you might say .      one side  if that   s what you could call it  was fleeing the field of battle with the others in pursuit .   the birds started to settle on what was  susan realized with horror  an early breakfast .  soft bits  sunny side up .      you   d better go and look for your lad     said the raven .     otherwise he   ll miss his ride .         what ride .      the eyes orbited again .      you ever learn mythology .     it said .      no .  miss butts says it   s just made up stories with little literary content .         ah .  deary me .  can   t have that  can we .  oh  well .  you   ll soon see .  must rush .     the raven leapt into the air .     i generally try to get a seat near the head .         what will i    .      and then someone started to sing .  the voice swooped out of the sky like a sudden wind .  it was a rather good mezzo soprano        hohotojo .  hotojoho .      and after it  mounted on a horse almost as fine as binky  was a woman .  very definitely .  a lot of woman .  she was as much woman as you could get in one place without getting two women .  she was dressed in chain mail  a shiny    d cup breastplate  and a helmet with horns on it .   the assembled dead cheered as the horse cantered in for a landing .  there were six other singing horsewomen plunging out of the sky behind it .      isn   t it always the same     said the raven  flapping away .     you can wait hours without seeing one and then you get seven all at once .      susan watched in astonishment as each rider picked up a dead warrior and galloped up into the sky again .  they disappeared abruptly a few hundred meters up and reappeared again almost instantly for a fresh passenger .  soon there was a busy shuttle service operating .   after a minute or two one of the women trotted her horse over to susan  and pulled a scroll of parchment out of her breastplate .      what ho .  says here volf     she said  in the brisk voice used by people on horseback when addressing mere pedestrians .     volf the lucky    .         er .  i don   t know   i mean  i don   t know which one he is     said susan helplessly .   the helmeted woman leaned forward .  there was something rather familiar about her .      are you new .         yes .  i mean  yes .         well  don   t stand there like a big girl   s blouse .  jolly well go and fetch him  there   s a good sport .      susan looked around wildly  and saw him at last .  he wasn   t very far away .  a youngish man  outlined in flickering pale blue  was visible among the fallen .   susan hurried over  scythe at the ready .  there was a blue line connecting the warrior to his former body .   squeak .  shouted the death of rats  jumping up and down and making suggestive motions .      left hand thumb up  right hand bent at the wrist  give it some wellie .     shouted the horned woman .   susan swung the scythe .  the line snapped .      what happened .     said volf .  he looked down .     that   s me down there  isn   t it .     he said .  he turned slowly .     and down there .  and over there .  and        he looked at the horned female warrior and brightened up .      by io .     he said .     it   s true .  valkyries will carry me off to the hall of blind io where there is perpetual feasting and drinking .         don   t  i mean don   t ask me     said susan .   the valkyrie reached down and hauled the warrior across her saddle .      just keep quiet  there   s a good chap     she said .  she stared thoughtfully at susan .      are you a soprano .     she said .      pardon .         can you sing at all  gel .  only we could do with another soprano .  far too many mezzo sopranos around these days .         i   m not very musical  i   m sorry .         oh  well .  just a thought .  must be going .     she threw back her head .  the mighty breastplate heaved .     hohotojo .      the horse reared  and galloped into the sky .  before it reached the clouds it shrank to a gleaming pinpoint  which winked .      what     said susan     was all that about .      there was a flurry of wings .  the raven alighted on the head of the recently departed volf .      well  these guys believe that if you die in battle  some big fat singing horned women carry you off to a sort of giant feast hall where you gobble yourself silly for the rest of eternity     said the raven .  it belched genteeley .     damn stupid idea  really .         but it just happened .         still a daft idea .     the raven looked around at the stricken battlefield  empty now except for the fallen and the flocks of his fellow ravens .     what a waste     he added .     i mean  just look at it all .  such a terrible waste .         yes .         i mean  i   m near bursting and there   s hundreds of    em untouched .  i think i   ll see if i can have a doggie bag .         they   re dead bodies .         right .         what are you eating .         it   s all right     said the raven  backing away .     there   s enough for everyone .         that   s disgusting .         i didn   t kill    em     it said .   susan gave up .      she looked a lot like iron lily     she said  as they walked back to the patient horse .     our gym mistress .  sounded like her  too .     she imagined the warbling valkyries pounding across the sky .  get some warrior  you bunch of fainting blossoms        convergent evolution     said the raven .     often happens .  i read once where apparently the common octopus has an eye almost exactly the same as the human eyeb   caw .         you were going to say something like  except for the taste  weren   t you     said susan .      negger grossed by bind     said the raven indistinctly .      sure .         leg go ogg by beak glease .      susan released her grip .      this is dreadful     she said .     this is what he used to do .  there   s no element of choice .      squeak .      but what if they don   t deserve to die .      squeak .   the death of rats contrived to indicate  quite effectively  that in that case they could apply to the universe and point out that they didn   t deserve to die .  in which case it was up to the universe to say  oh  didn   t you .  oh  well  that   s all right then  you can go on living .  it was a remarkably succinct gesture .      so   my grandfather was death  and he just let nature take its course .  when he could have done some good .  that   s stupid .      the death of rats shook its skull .      i mean  was volf on the right side .     said susan .      hard to say     said the raven .     he was a vasung .  the other side were bergunds .  apparently it all started with a bergund carrying off a vasung woman a few hundred years ago .  or it may have been the other way round .  well  the other side invaded their village .  there was a bit of a massacre .  and then the other ones went to the other village and there was another massacre .  after that  you might say  there was some residual bad feeling .         very well  then     said susan .     who   s next .      squeak .   the death of rats landed on the saddle .  it leaned down and  with some effort  hauled another hourglass out of the pack .  susan read the label .   it said  imp y celyn .   susan had a sensation of falling backward .      i know this name     she said .   squeak .      i   remember it from somewhere     said susan .     it   s important .  he   s   important          the moon hung over the desert of klatch like a huge ball of rock .   it wasn   t much of a desert to be graced by so impressive a moon .   it was just part of the belt of deserts  growing progressively hotter and dryer  that surrounded the great nef and the dehydrated ocean .  and no one would have thought much about it if people very like mr .  clete of the musicians    guild hadn   t come along and made maps and put across this part of the desert an innocent little dotted line that marked a border between klatch and hersheba .   up until that time the d   regs  a collection of cheerfully warlike nomadic tribes  had roamed the desert quite freely .  now there was a line  they were sometimes klatchian d   regs and sometimes hershebian d   regs  with all the rights due to citizens of both states  particularly the right to pay just as much tax as could be squeezed out of them and be drafted in to fight wars against people they   d never heard of .  so as a result of the dotted line klatch was now incipiently at war with hersheba and the d   regs  hersheba was at war with the d   regs and klatch  and the d   regs were at war with everyone  including one another  and having considerable fun because the d   reg word for    stranger    was the same as for    target .      the fort was one of the legacies of the dotted line .   now it was a dark rectangle on the hot silver sands .  from it came what could very accurately be called the strains of an accordion  since someone seemed to want to play a tune but kept on running into difficulties after a few bars  and starting again .   someone knocked on the door .   after a while there was a scraping on the other side and a small hatch opened .      yes  offendi .      is this the klatchian foreign legion .   the face of the little man on the other side of the door went blank .      ah     he said     you   ve got me there .  hang on a moment .     the hatch shut .  there was a whispered discussion on the other side of the door .  the hatch opened .      yes  it appears we are the   the   what was that again .  right  got it   the klatchian foreign legion .  yes .  what was it you were wanting .      i wish to join .      join .  join what .      the klatchian foreign legion .      where   s that .      there was some more whispering .      oh .  right .  sorry .  yes .  that   s us .      the doors swung open .  the visitor strode in .  a legionary with corporal   s stripes on his arm walked up to him .      you   ll have to report to       his eyes glazed a little        you know   big man  three stripes   on the tip of my tongue a moment ago        sergeant .      right     said the corporal  with relief .     what   s your name  soldier .      er        you don   t have to say  actually .  that   s what the   the        klatchian foreign legion .         what it   s all about .  people join to   to   with your mind  you know  when you can   t   things that happened        forget .      right .  i   m       the man   s face went blank .     wait a minute  would you .      he looked down at his sleeve .     corporal       he said .  he hesitated  looking worried .  then an idea struck him and he pulled at the collar of his vest and twisted his neck until he could squint  with considerable difficulty  at the label thus revealed .      corporal   medium .  does that sound right .      i don   t think so .      corporal   hand wash only .      probably not .      corporal   cotton .      it   s a possibility .      right .  well  welcome to the   er     klatchian foreign legion        right .  the pay is three dollars a week and all the sand you can eat .  i hope you like sand .      i see you can remember about sand .      believe me  you won   t ever forget sand     said the corporal bitterly .   i never do .      what did you say your name was .      the stranger remained silent .      not that it matters     said corporal cotton .     in the        klatchian foreign legion .         right   we give you a new name .  you start out afresh .      he beckoned to another man .      legionary    .         legionary   er   ugh   er   size     sir .         right .  take this   man away and get him a       he snapped his fingers irritably        you know   thing   clothes  everyone wears them   sand colored        uniform .   the corporal blinked .  for some inexplicable reason the word    bone    kept elbowing its way into the melting  flowing mess that was his consciousness .      right     he said .     er .  it   s a twenty year tour  legionary .  i hope you   re man enough for it .      i like it already  said death .        i suppose it   s legal for me to go in licensed premises .     said susan  as ankh morpork appeared on the horizon .   squeak .   the city slid under them again .  where there were wider streets and squares she could make out individual figures .  huh  she thought   if only they knew i was up here .  and  despite everything  she couldn   t help feeling superior .  all the people down there had to think about were  well  ground level things .  mundane things .  it was like looking down at ants .   she   d always known she was different .  much more aware of the world  when it was obvious that most people went through it with their eyes shut and their brains set to    simmer .     it was comforting in a way to know that she was different .  the feeling wrapped around her like an overcoat .   binky landed on a greasy jetty .  on one side the river sucked at the wooden pilings .   susan slid off the horse  unshipped the scythe  and stepped inside the mended drum .   there was a riot going on .  the patrons of the drum tended to be democratic in their approach to aggressiveness .  they liked to see that everyone got some .  so  although it was the consensus of the audience that the trio were lousy musicians  and  therefore  a suitable target  various fights had broken out because people had been hit by badly aimed missiles  or hadn   t had a fight all day  or were just trying to reach the door .   susan had no difficulty in spotting imp y celyn .  he was at the front of the stage  his face a mask of terror .  behind him was a troll  with a dwarf trying to hide behind it .   she glanced at the hourglass .  just a few more seconds     he was really rather attractive  in a dark  curly headed sort of way .  he looked a little elvish .   and familiar .   she   d felt sorry for volf  but at least he was on a battlefield .  imp was on a stage .  you didn   t expect to die on stage .   i   m standing here with a scythe and an hourglass waiting for someone to die .  he   s not much older than me and i   m not supposed to do anything about it .  that   s silly .  and i   m sure i   ve seen him   before     no one actually tried to kill musicians in the drum .  axes were thrown and crossbows fired in a good humored  easygoing way .  no one really aimed  even if they were capable of doing so .  it was more fun watching people dodge .   a big  red bearded man grinned at lias and selected a small throwing ax from his bandolier .  it was okay to throw axes at trolls .  they tended to bounce off .   susan could see it all .  it   d bounce off and hit imp .  no one   s fault  really .  worse things happened at sea .  worse things happened in ankh morpork all the time  continuously .   the man doesn   t even mean to kill him .  it   s so sloppy .  that   s not how things should go .  someone ought to do something about it .   she reached over to grab the ax handle .   squeak .      shut up .      whaaauum .   imp stood like a discus thrower as the chord filled across the noisy room .   it rang like an iron bar dropped on a library floor at midnight .   echoes bounced back from the corners of the room .  each one bore its own load of harmonies .   it was an explosion of sound in the same way that a hogswatchnight rocket explodes  each falling spark exploding again     imp   s finger caressed the strings  picking out three more chords .  the ax thrower lowered his ax .   this was music that had not only escaped but had robbed a bank on the way out .  it was music with its sleeves rolled up and its top button undone  raising its hat and grinning and stealing the silver .   it was music that went down to the feet by way of the pelvis without paying a call on mr .  brain .   the troll picked up his hammers  looked blankly at his stones  and then began to beat out a rhythm .   the dwarf took a deep breath  and extracted from the horn a deep  throbbing sound .   people drummed their fingers on the edges of the tables .  the orang was sitting with a huge rapt grin on his face  as though he   d swallowed a banana sideways .   susan looked down at the hourglass marked imp y celyn .   the top bulb was now quite empty of sand  but something blue flickered in there .   she felt tiny pinlike claws scrabble up her back and find purchase on her shoulder .   the death of rats looked down at the glass .   squeak  it said  quietly .   susan still wasn   t good on rat but she thought she knew    uh oh    when she heard it .   imp   s fingers danced over the strings  but the sound that came from them was no relative to the tones of harp or lute .  the guitar screamed like an angel who had just discovered why it was on the wrong side .  sparks glittered on the strings .   imp himself had his eyes shut and was holding the instrument close to his chest  like a soldier holding a spear at the port .  it was hard to know who was playing what .   and still the music flooded out .   the librarian   s hair was standing on end  all over his body .  the ends crackled .   it made you want to kick down walls and ascend the sky on steps of fire .  it made you want to pull all the switches and throw all the levers and stick your fingers in the electric socket of the universe to see what happened next .  it made you want to paint your bedroom wall black and cover it with posters .   now various muscles on the librarian   s body were twitching with the beat as the music earthed itself through him .   there was a small party of wizards in the corner .  they were watching the performances with their mouths open .   and the beat strode on  and crackled from mind to mind  snapping its fingers and curling its lip .   live music .  music with rocks in it  running wild       free at last .  it leapt from head to head  crackling in through the ears and heading for the hindbrain .  some were more susceptible than others   closer to the beat       it was an hour later .   the librarian knuckled and swung through the midnight drizzle  head exploding with music .   he landed on the lawns of unseen university and ran into the great hall  hands waving wildly overhead to maintain balance .   he stopped .   moonlight filtered in through the big windows  illuminated what the archchancellor always referred to as    our mighty organ     to the general embarrassment of the rest of the faculty .   rack upon rack of pipes entirely occupied one wall  looking like pillars in the gloom or possibly resembling the stalagtites of some monstrously ancient cave .  almost lost among them was the player   s pulpit  with its three giant keyboards and the hundred knobs for special sound effects .   it wasn   t often used  except for the occasional civic affair or wizards    excuse me .    but the librarian  energetically pumping the bellows and making occasional little    ooks    of excitement  felt there was a lot more that it could do .   a fully grown male orang utan may look like an amiable pile of old carpets but has a strength on him that would make a human of equivalent weight eat lots of rug .  the librarian only stopped pumping when the lever was too hot to hold and the air reservoirs were farting and whistling around the rivets .   the he swung himself up into the organist   s seat .   the whole edifice was humming softly under the enormous pent up pressure .   the librarian locked his hands together and cracked his knuckles  which is impressive when you have as many knuckles as an orang utan .   he raised his hands .   he hesitated .   he lowered his hands again and pulled out the vox humana  the vox dei  and the vox diabolica .   the moan of the organ took on a more urgent tone .   he raised his hands .   he hesitated .   he lowered his hands and pulled out all the rest of the stops  including the twelve knobs with     .     on them and the two with faded labels warning in several languages that they were on no account to be touched  ever  in any circumstances .   he raised his hands .   he raised his feet also  positioning them over some of the more perilous pedals .   he shut his eyes .   he sat for a moment in contemplative silence  a test pilot ready to slit the edge of the envelope in the starship melody .   he let the plangent memory of the music fill his head and flow down his arms and fill his fingers .   his hands dropped .        what did we do .  what did we do .     said imp .  excitement ran its barefoot races up and down his spine .   they were sitting in the tiny cramped room behind the bar .   glod took off his helmet and wiped the inside .      would you believe four beats to the bar  two four time  melody led  with the bass beat forward in the melody .         what   s all dat .     said lias .     what   s all dem words mean .         you   re a musician  ain   t you .     said glod .     what do you think you do .         i hits    em with the hammers     said lias  one of nature   s drummers .      but that bit you did       said imp     you know   in the middle   you know  bam bah bam bah bam bambah    how did you know how to do that bit .         it was just the bit dat had to go there     said lias .   imp looked at the guitar .  he   d put it on the table .  it was still playing quietly to itself  like a cat purring .      that   s not a normall instrument     he said  shaking a finger at it .     i was just standing there and it started playing alll by itself .      probably belonged to a wizard  like i said     said glod .      nah     said lias .     never knew any wizard who was musical .  music and magic don   t mix .      they looked at it .   imp never heard of an instrument that played itself before  except the legendary harp of owen mwnyy  which sang when danger threatened .  and that had been back in the days when there were dragons around .  singing harps went well with dragons .  they seemed out of place in a city with guilds and everything .   the door swung open .      that was   astonishing  boys     said hibiscus dunelm .     never heard anything like it .  can you come back tomorrow night .  here   s your five dollars .      glod counted the coins .      we did four encores     he said darkly .      i   d complain to the guild  if i was you     said hibiscus .   the trio looked at the money .  it looked very impressive to people whose last meal had been twenty four hours ago .  it wasn   t guild rate .  on the other hand  it had been a long twenty four hours .      if you come back tomorrow     said hibiscus     i   ll make it   six dollars  how about that .         oh  wow     said glod .     mustrum ridcully was jolted upright in bed  because the bed itself was being gently vibrated across the floor .   so it had happened at last .   they were out to get him .   the tradition of promotion in the university by filling dead men   s shoes  sometimes by firstly ensuring the death of the man in those shoes  had lately ceased .  this was largely because of ridcully himself  who was big and kept himself in trim and  as three late night aspirants to the archchancellorship had found  also had very good hearing .  they had been variously hung out of the window by their ankles  knocked unconscious with a shovel  and had their arm broken in two places .  besides  ridcully was known to sleep with two loaded crossbows by his bed .  he was a kind man and probably wouldn   t shoot you in both ears .   that sort of consideration encouraged a more patient type of wizard .  everyone dies sooner or later .  they could wait .   ridcully took stock and found his first impression was mistaken .  there appeared to be no murderous magic going on .  there was just sound  cramming the room to every corner .   ridcully shuffled into his slippers and went out into the corridor  where other members of the faculty were milling around and blearily asking one another what the hell was happening .  plaster rained down on them from the ceiling in a steady fog .      who   s causing that din .     shouted ridcully .  there was a mute chorus of unheard replies  and much shrug of shoulder .      well  i will find out     growled the archchancellor  and set off for the stairs with the others trailing after him .  he walked without his knees or elbows bending very much  a sure sign of a forthright man in a bad temper .     the trio said nothing all the way out of the drum .  they said nothing all the way to gimlet   s delicatessen .  they said nothing while they waited in the queue  and then all they said was     so   right   that   s one quatre rodenti with extra newts  hold the chilis  one klatchian hots with double salami and a four strata  no pitchblende .      they sat down to wait .  the guitar hummed to itself  a little four note riff .  they tried not to think about it .  they tried to think about other things .      i think i change my name     said lias  eventually .     i mean   lias .  not a good name for the music business .         what   ll you change it to .     said glod .      i thought   don   t laugh   i thought   cliff .     said lias .      cliff .         good troll name .  very stony .  very rocky .  nothing wrong with it     said cliff n   lias  defensively .      well   yes   but  i dunno  i mean   well   cliff .  can   t see anyone lasting long in this business with a name like cliff .         better than glod  anyway .         i   m sticking with glod     said glod .     and imp is sticking with imp  right .      imp looked at the guitar .  it   s not right  he thought .  i hardly touched it .  i just   and i feel so tired   i        not sure     he said  wretchedly .     not sure if imp is the right name for   this music .     his voice trailed off .  he yawned .      imp .     said glod  after a while .      hmm .     said imp .  and he   d felt someone was watching him out there .  that was daft  of course .  he couldn   t say to someone    i was on stage and i thought someone was watching me .     they   d say    really .  that   s really occult  that is           imp .     said glod     why   re you snapping your fingers like that .      imp looked down .      was i .         yes .         just thinking .  my name   it   s not right for this music  either .         what does it mean in real language .     said glod .      well  all my family are y celyns     said imp  ignoring the insult to an ancient tongue .     it means    of the hollly .     that   s all that grows in llamedos  you see .  everything else just rots .         i wasn   t goin    to say     said cliff     but imp sounds a bit like elf to me .         it just means    smalll shoot        said imp .     you know .  like a bud .         bud y celyn .     said glod .     buddy .  worse than cliff  in my opinion .         i   think it sounds right     said imp .   glod shrugged  and pulled a handful of coins out of his pocket .      we   ve still got more   n four dollars     he said .     i know what we should do with it  too .         we should put it toward guild membership     said the new cliff .   glod stared into the middle distance .      no     he said .     we haven   t got the sound right .  i mean  it was very good  very   new     he stared hard at imp cum buddy     but there   s still something missing        the dwarf gave buddy n   imp another penetrating stare .      do you know you   re shaking all over .     he said .     moving around on your seat like you got a pant full of ant .         i can   t help it     said buddy .  he wanted to sleep  but a rhythm was bouncing around inside his head .      i saw it too     said cliff .     when we was walking here  you were bouncing along .     he looked under the table .     and you is tapping your feet .         and you keep snapping your fingers     said glod .      i can   t stop thinking about the music     said buddy .     you   re right .  we need       he drummed his fingers along the table        a sound like   pang pang pang pang pang           you mean a keyboard .     said glod .      do i .         they   ve got one of those new pianofortes just over the river in the opera house     said glod .      yah  but dat sort of thing ain   t for our kind of music     said cliff .     dat sort of thing is for big fat guys in powdered wigs .         i reckon     said glod  giving buddy another lopsided stare     if we put it anywhere near im   near buddy  it   ll be for our kind of music soon enough .  so go and get it .         i heard where it cost four hundred dollars     said cliff .     no one   s got dat many teeth .         i didn   t mean buy it     said glod .     just   borrow it for a while .         dat   s stealing     said cliff .      no it   s not     said the dwarf .     we   ll let them have it back when we   ve finished with it .         oh .  dat   s all right den .      buddy wasn   t a drummer or a troll and could see the technical flaw in glod   s argument .  and  a few weeks ago  he   d have said so .  but then he   d been a good circle going boy from the valleys  who didn   t drink  didn   t swear  and played the harp at every druidic sacrifice .   now he needed that piano .  the sound had been nearly right .   he snapped his fingers in time with his thoughts .      but we ain   t got anyone to play it     said cliff .      you get the piano     said glod .     i   ll get the piano player .      and all the time they kept glancing at the guitar .     the wizards advanced in a body toward the organ .  the air around it vibrated as if superheated .      what an unholy noise .     shouted the lecturer in recent runes .      oh  i don   t know .     screamed the dean .     it   s rather catchy .      blue sparks crackled between the organ pipes .  the librarian could just be seen high in the trembling structure .      who   s pumping it .     screamed the senior wrangler .   ridcully looked around at the side .  the handle seemed to be going up and down by itself .      i   m not having this     he muttered .     not in my damn university .  it   s worse than students .      and he raised his crossbow and fired  right at the main bellows .   there was a long drawn out wail in the key of a  and then the organ exploded .   the history of the subsequent seconds was put together during a discussion in the uncommon room where the wizards went for a stiff drink  or in the bursar   s case a warm milk  shortly afterward .   the lecturer in recent runes swore that the sixty four foot gravissima organ pipe went skyward on a pillar of flame .   the chair of indefinite studies and the senior wrangler said that when they found the librarian upside down in one of the fountains in sator square  outside the university  he was going    ook ook    to himself and grinning .   the bursar said that he   d seen a dozen naked young women bouncing up and down on his bed  but the bursar occasionally said things like this anyway  especially when he   d been indoors a lot .   the dean said nothing at all .   his eyes were glazed .   sparks crackled in his hair .   he was wondering if he   d be allowed to paint his bedroom black .      the beat went on       the lifetimer of imp stood in the middle of the huge desk .  the death of rats walked around it  squeaking under his breath .   susan looked at it  too .  there was no doubt that all the sand was in the bottom bulb .  but something else had filled the top and was pouring through the pinch .  it was pale blue and coiling in frantically on itself  like excited smoke .      have you ever seen anything like it .     she said .   squeak .      nor me .      susan stood up .  the shadows around the walls  now that she   d got used to them  seemed to be of things   not exactly machinery  but not exactly furniture either .  there had been an orrery on the lawn at the college .  the distant shapes put her in mind of it  although what stars it measured in what dark courses she really couldn   t say .  they seemed to be projections of things too strange even for this strange dimension .   she   d wanted to save his life  and that was right .  she knew it .  as soon as she   d seen his name she     well  it was important .  she   d inherited some of death   s memory .  she couldn   t have met the boy  but perhaps he had .  she felt that the name and the face had established themselves so deeply in her mind now that the rest of her thoughts were forced to orbit them .   something else had saved his life first .   she held the lifetimer up to her ear again .   she found herself tapping her foot .   and realized that distant shadows were moving .   she ran across the floor  the real floor  the one outside the boundaries of the carpet .   the shadows looked more like mathematics would be if it was solid .  there were vast curves of   something .  pointers like clock hands  but longer than a tree  moved slowly through the air .   the death of rats climbed onto her shoulder .      i suppose you don   t know what   s happening .      squeak .   susan nodded .  rats  she supposed  died when they should .  they didn   t try to cheat  or return from the dead .  there were no such things as zombie rats .  rats knew when to give up .   she looked at the glass again .  the boy   and she used the term as girls will of young males several years older than them   the boy had played a chord on the guitar or whatever it was  and history had been bent .  or had skipped  or something .   something besides her didn   t want him dead .     it was two o   clock in the morning  and raining .   constable detritus  ankh morpork city watch  was guarding the opera house .  it was an approach to policing that he   d picked up from sergeant colon .  when you were all by yourself in the middle of a rainy night  go and guard something big with handy overhanging eaves .  colon had pursued this policy for years  as a result of which no major landmark had ever been stolen .    it had been an uneventful night .  about an hour earlier a sixty four foot organ pipe had dropped out of the sky .  detritus had wandered over to inspect the crater  but he wasn   t quite certain if this was criminal activity .  besides  for all he knew this was how you got organ pipes .   for the last five minutes he   d also been hearing muffled thumps and the occasional tinkling noise from inside the opera house .  he   d made a note of it .  he did not wish to appear stupid .  detritus had never been inside the opera house .  he didn   t know what sound it normally made at      a . m .   the front doors opened  and a large  oddly shaped flat box came out  hesitantly .  it advanced in a curious way   a few steps forward  a couple of steps back .  and it was also talking to itself .   detritus looked down .  he could see   he paused   at least seven legs of various sizes  only four of which had feet .   he shambled across to the box and banged on the side .      hello  hello  hello  what is all this   then .     he said  concentrating to get the sentence right .   the box stopped .   then it said     we   re a piano .      detritus gave this due consideration .  he wasn   t sure what a piano was .      a piano move about  does it .     he said .      it   s   we   ve got legs     said the piano .   detritus conceded the point .      but it are the middle of the night     he said .      even pianos have to have time off     said the piano .   detritus scratched his head .  this seemed to cover it .      well   all right     he said .   he watched the piano jerk and wobble down the marble steps and around the corner .   it carried on talking to itself      how long have we got  d   you think .         we ought to make it to the bridge .  he not clever enough to be a drummer .         but he   s a policeman .         so .         cliff .         yup .         we might get caught .         he can   t stop us .  we   re on a mission from glod .         right .      the piano tottered onward through the puddles for a little while  and then asked itself      buddy .         yup .         why did i just say dat .         say what .         about us being on a mission   you know   from glod .         weeell   the dwarf said to us  go and get the piano  and his name is glod  so           yeah .  yeah .  right   but   he could   ve stopped us  i mean  dere   s nothing special about some mission from some dwarf           maybe you were just a bit tired .         maybe dat   s it     said the piano  gratefully .      anyway  we are on a mission from glod .         yup .        glod sat in his lodgings  watching the guitar .   it had stopped playing when buddy had gone out  although if he put his ear very close to the strings  he was sure that they were still humming very gently .   now he very carefully reached out and touched the     to call the sudden snapping sound discordant would be too mild .  the sound had a snarl  it had talons .   glod sat back .  right .  right .  it was buddy   s instrument .  an instrument played by the same person over the years could become very adapted to them  although not in glod   s experience to the point of biting someone else .  buddy hadn   t had it a day  yet  but the principle maybe was the same .   there was an old dwarf legend about the famous horn of furgle  which sounded itself when danger was near and also in the presence  for some reason  of horseradish .   and there was even an ankh morpork legend  wasn   t there  about some old drum in the palace or somewhere that was supposed to bang itself if an enemy fleet was seen sailing up the ankh .  the legend had died out in recent centuries  partly because this was the age of reason and also because no enemy fleet could sail up the ankh without a gang of men with shovels going in front .   and there was a troll story about some stones that  on frosty nights     the point was that magical instruments turned up every so often .   glod reached out again .   jud adud adud duh .      all right  all right        the old music shop was right up against the university  after all  and magic did leak out despite what the wizards always said about the talking rats and walking trees just being statistical flukes .  but this didn   t feel like magic .  it felt a lot older than that .  it felt like music .   glod wondered whether he should persuade im   buddy to take it back to the shop  get a proper guitar     on the other hand  six dollars was six dollars .  at least .   something hammered on the door .      who   s that .     said glod  looking up .   the pause outside was long enough to let him guess .  he decided to help out .      cliff .     he said .      yup .  got a piano here .         bring it on in .         had to break off der legs and der lid and a few other bits but it   s basically okay .         bring it on in  then .         door   s too narrow .      buddy  coming up the stairs behind the troll  heard the crunch of woodwork .      try it again .         fit   s perfectly .      there was a piano shaped hole around the doorway .  glod was standing next to it  holding his ax .  buddy looked at the wreckage all over the landing .      what the hell are you doing .     he said .     that   s someone else   s wall .         well .  it   s someone else   s piano .         yes  but   you can   t just hack holes in the wall           what   s more important .  some wall or getting the sound right .     said glod .   buddy hesitated .  part of him thought  that   s ridiculous  it   s only music .  another part of him thought  rather more sharply  that   s ridiculous  it   s only a wall .  all of him said     oh .  since you put it like that   but what about the piano player .         i told you  i know just where to find one     said glod .   a tiny part of him was amazed  i   ve hacked a hole in my own wall .  it took me days to nail that wallpaper on properly .     albert was in the stable  with a shovel and a wheelbarrow .      go well .     he said  when susan   s shadow appeared over the half door .      er   yes   i suppose           pleased to hear it     said albert  without looking up .  the shovel thumped on the barrow .      only   something happened which probably wasn   t usual           sorry to hear that .      albert picked up the wheelbarrow and trundled it in the direction of the garden .   susan knew what she was supposed to do .  she was supposed to apologize  and then it   d turn out that crusty old albert had a heart of gold  and they   d be friends after all  and he   d help her and tell her things  and     and she   d be some stupid girl who couldn   t cope .   no .   she went back to the stable  where binky was investigating the contents of a bucket .   the quirm college for young ladies encouraged self reliance and logical thought .  her parents had sent her there for that very reason .   they   d assumed that insulating her from the fluffy edges of the world was the safest thing to do .  in the circumstances  this was like not telling people about self defense so that no one would ever attack them .     unseen university was used to eccentricity among the faculty .  after all  humans derive their notions of what it means to be a normal human being by constant reference to the humans around them  and when those humans are other wizards  the spiral can only wiggle downward .  the librarian was an orang utan  and no one thought that was at all odd .  the reader in esoteric studies spent so much time reading in what the bursar referred to as    the smallest room      that he was generally referred to as the reader in the lavatory  even on official documents .  the bursar himself in any normal society would have been considered more unglued than a used stamp in a downpour .  the dean had spent seventeen years writing a treatise on the use of the syllable    enk    in levitation spells of the early confused period .  the archchancellor  who regularly used the long gallery above the great hall for archery practice and had accidentally shot the bursar twice  thought the whole faculty was as crazy as loons  whatever a loon was .     not enough fresh air     he   d say .     too much sittin    around indoors .  rots the brain .     more often  he   d say    duck .      none of them  apart from ridcully and the librarian  were early risers .  breakfast  if it happened at all  happened around midmorning .  wizards lined the buffet  lifting the big silver lids of the tureens and wincing at every clang .  ridcully liked big  greasy breakfasts  especially if it included those slightly translucent sausages with the green flecks that you can only hope is a herb of some sort .  since it was the archchancellor   s prerogative to choose the menu  many of the more squeamish wizards had stopped eating breakfast altogether and got through the day just on lunch  tea  dinner  and supper and the occasional snack .   so there weren   t too many in the great hall this morning .  besides  it was a bit drafty .  workmen were busy somewhere up in the roof .   ridcully put down his fork .      all right  who   s doing it .     he said .     own up  that man .         doing what  archchancellor .     said the senior wrangler .      someone   s tappin    his foot .      the wizard looked along the table .  the dean was staring happily into space .      dean .     said the senior wrangler .   the dean   s left hand was held not far from his mouth .  the other was making rhythmic stroking motions somewhere in the region of his kidneys .      i don   t know what he thinks he   s doin        said ridcully .     but it looks unhygienic to me .         i think he   s playing an invisible banjo  archchancellor     said the lecturer in recent runes .      well  it   s quiet  at least     said ridcully .  he looked at the hole in the roof  which was letting unaccustomed daylight into the hall .     anyone seen the librarian .        the orang utan was busy .   he had holed up in one of the library cellars  which he currently used as a general workshop and book hospital .  there were various presses and guillotines  a bench full of tins of nasty substances where he made his own binding glue and all the other tedious cosmetics of the muse of literature .   he   d brought a book down with him .  it had taken even him several hours to find it .   the library didn   t only contain magical books  the ones which are chained to their shelves and are very dangerous .  it also contained perfectly ordinary books  printed on commonplace paper in mundane ink .  it would be a mistake to think that they weren   t also dangerous  just because reading them didn   t make fireworks go off in the sky .  reading them sometimes did the more dangerous trick of making fireworks go off in the privacy of the reader   s brain .   for example  the big volume open in front of him contained some of the collected drawings of leonard of quirm  skilled artist and certified genius  with a mind that wandered so much it came back with souvenirs .   leonard   s books were full of sketches   of kittens  of the way water flows  of the wives of influential ankh morporkian merchants whose portraits had provided his means of making a living .  but leonard had been a genius and was deeply sensitive to the wonders of the world  so the margins were full of detailed doodles of whatever was on his mind at that moment   vast waterpowered engines for bringing down city walls on the heads of the enemy  new types of siege guns for pumping flaming oil over the enemy  gunpowder rockets that showered the enemy with burning phosphorus  and other manufactures of the age of reason .   and there had been something else .  the librarian had noticed it in passing once before  and had been slightly puzzled by it .  it seemed out of place .     his hairy hand thumbed through the pages .  ah   here it was     yes .  oh  yes .      it spoke to him in the language of the beat       the archchancellor made himself comfortable at his snooker table .   he   d long ago got rid of the official desk .  a snooker table was much to be preferred .  things didn   t fall off the edge  there were a number of handy pockets to keep sweets and things in  and when he was bored he could shovel the paperwork off and set up trick shots .    he never bothered to shovel the paperwork back on afterward .  in his experience  anything really important never got written down  because by then people were too busy shouting .   he picked up his pen and started to write .   he was composing his memoirs .  he   d got as far as the title  along the ankh with bow  rod  and staff with a knob on the end .      not many people realize     he wrote     that the river ankh has a large and varied pifcine population            he flung down the pen and stormed along the corridor into the dean   s office .      what the hell   s that .     he shouted .   the dean jumped .      it   s  it   s  it   s a guitar  archchancellor     said the dean  walking hurriedly backward as ridcully approached .     i just bought it .         i can see that  i can hear that  what was it you were tryin    to do .         i was practicing  er  riffs     said the dean .  he waved a badly printed woodcut defensively in ridcully   s face .  the archchancellor grabbed it .         blert wheedown   s guitar primer        he read .        play your way to succefs in three easy lefsons and eighteen hard lefsons .     well .  i   ve nothin    against guitars  pleasant airs  a spying young maidens one morning in may and so on  but that wasn   t playin    .  that was just noise .  i mean  what was it supposed to be .         a lick based on an e pentatonic scale using the major seventh as a passing tone .     said the dean .   the archchancellor peered at the open page .      but this says lesson one  fairy footsteps     he said .      um  um  um  i was getting a bit impatient     said the dean .      you   ve never been musical  dean     said ridcully .     it   s one of your good points .  why the sudden interest   what have you got on your feet .      the dean looked down .      i thought you were a bit taller     said ridcully .     you standing on a couple of planks .         they   re just thick soles     said the dean .     just   just something the dwarfs invented  i suppose   dunno   found them in my closet   modo the gardener says he thinks they   re cr  pe .         that   s strong language for modo  but i   d say he   s right enough .         no   it   s a kind of rubbery stuff       said the dean  dismally .      erm   excuse me  archchancellor        it was the bursar  standing in the doorway .  a large red faced man was behind him  craning over his shoulder .      what is it  bursar .         erm  this gentleman has got a           it   s about your monkey     said the man .   ridcully brightened up .      oh  yes .         apparently  erm  he sto   removed some wheels from this gentleman   s carriage     said the bursar  who was on the depressive side of his mental cycle .      you sure it was the librarian .     said the archchancellor .      fat  red hair  says    ook    a lot .         that   s him .  oh  dear .  i wonder why he did that .     said ridcully .     still  you know what they say   a five hundred pound gorilla can sleep where he likes .         but a three hundred pound monkey can give me my bloody wheels back     said the man  unmoved .     if i don   t get my wheels back  there   s going to be trouble .         trouble .     said ridcully .      yeah .  and don   t think you can scare me .  wizards don   t scare me .  everyone knows there   s a rule that you mustn   t use magic against civilians .     the man thrust his face close to ridcully and raised a fist .   ridcully snapped his fingers .  there was an inrush of air  and a croak .      i   ve always thought of it more as a guideline     he said  mildly .     bursar  go and put this frog in the flower bed and when he becomes his old self give him ten dollars .  ten dollars would be all right  wouldn   t it .         croak     said the frog hastily .      good .  and now will someone tell me what   s going on .      there was a series of crashes from downstairs .      why do i think     said ridcully  to the world in general     that this isn   t going to be the answer .      the servants had been laying the tables for lunch .  this generally took some time .  since wizards took their meals seriously  and left a lot of mess  the tables were in a permanent state of being laid  cleaned  or occupied .  place settings alone took a lot of time .  each wizard required nine knives  thirteen forks  twelve spoons  and one rammer  quite apart from all the wineglasses .   wizards often turned up in ample time for the next meal .  in fact they were often there in good time to have second helpings of the previous one .   a wizard was sitting there now .      that   s recent runes  ain   t it .     said ridcully .   he had a knife in each hand .  he also had the salt  pepper  and mustard pots in front of him .  and the cake stand .  and a couple of tureen covers .  all of which he was hitting vigorously with the knives .      what   s he doing that for .     said ridcully .     and  dean  will you stop tapping your feet .         well  it   s catchy     said the dean .      it   s catching     said ridcully .   the lecturer in recent runes was frowning in concentration .  forks jangled across the woodwork .  a spoon caught a glancing blow  pinwheeled through the air  and hit the bursar on the ear .      what the hells does he think he   s doing .         that really hurt .      the wizards clustered around the lecturer in recent runes .  he paid them no attention whatsoever .  sweat poured down his beard .      he just broke the cruet     said ridcully .      it   s going to smart for hours .         ah  yes  he   s as hot as mustard     said the dean .      i   d take that with a pinch of salt     said the senior wrangler .   ridcully straightened up .  he raised a hand .      now  someone   s about to say something like    i hope the watch don   t ketchup with him     aren   t you .     he said .     or    that   s a bit of a sauce    or i bet you   re all trying to think of somethin    silly to say about pepper .  i   d just like to know what   s the difference between this faculty and a bunch of pea brained idiots .         hahaha     said the bursar nervously  still rubbing his ear .      it wasn   t a rhetorical question .     ridcully snatched the knives out of the lecturer   s hands .  the man went on beating the air for a moment and then appeared to wake up .      oh  hello  archchancellor .  is there a problem .         what were you doing .      the lecturer looked down at the table .      he was syncopating     said the dean .      i never was .      ridcully frowned .  he was a thick skinned  single minded man with the tact of a sledgehammer and about the same sense of humor  but he was not stupid .  and he knew that wizards were like weather vanes  or the canaries that miners used to detect pockets of gas .  they were by their nature tuned to an occult frequency .  if there was anything strange happening  it tended to happen to wizards first .  they turned  as it were  to face it .  or dropped off their perch .      why   s everyone suddenly so musical .     he said .     using the term in its loosest sense  of course .     he looked at the assembled wizardry .  and then down toward the floor .      you   ve all got cr  pe on your shoes .      the wizards looked at their feet with some surprise .      my word  i thought i was a bit taller     said the senior wrangler .     i put it down to the celery diet .           proper footwear for a wizard is pointy shoes or good stout boots     said ridcully .     when one   s footwear turns creepy  something   s amiss .         it   s crepe     said the dean .     it   s got a little pointy thingy over the        ridcully breathed heavily .      when your boots change by themselves       he growled .      there   s magic afoot .         haha  good one  senior wrangler     said the dean .      i want to know what   s going on     said ridcully  in a low and level voice .     and if you don   t all shut up  there will be trouble .      he reached into the pockets of his robe and  after a few false starts  produced a pocket thaumometer .  he held it up .  there was always a high level of background magic in the university  but the little needle was on the    normal    mark .  on average  anyway .  it was ticking backward and forward across it like a metronome .   ridcully held it up so they could all see .      what   s this .     he said .      four four time .     said the dean .      music ain   t magic     said ridcully .     don   t be daft .  music   s just twanging and banging and        he stopped .      has anyone got anything they should be telling me .      the wizards shuffled their blue suede feet nervously .      well     said the senior wrangler     it is a fact that last night  er  i  that is to say  some of us  happened to be passing by the mended drum           bona fide travelers     said the lecturer in recent runes .     it   s allowable for bona fide travelers to get a drink at licensed premises at any hour of day or night .  city statute  you know .         where were you traveling from  then .     ridcully demanded .      the bunch of grapes .         that   s just around the corner .         yes  but we were   tired .         all right  all right     said ridcully  in the voice of a man who knows that pulling at a thread any more will cause the whole vest to unravel .     the librarian was with you .         oh  yes .         go on .         well  there was this music           sort of twangy     said the senior wrangler .      melody led     said the dean .      it was              sort of              in a way it              kind of gets under your skin and makes you feel fizzy     said the dean .     incidentally  has anyone got any black paint .  i   ve looked everywhere .         under your skin     murmured ridcully .  he scratched his chin .     oh  dear .  one of those .  stuff leakin    into the universe again  eh .  influences coming from outside  yes .  remember what happened when mr .  hong opened his take away fish bar on the site of the old temple in dagon street .  and then there was those moving pictures .  i was against them from the start .  and those wire things on wheels .  this universe has more damn holes in it than a quirm cheese .  well  at           lancre cheese     said the senior wrangler helpfully .     that   s the one with the holes .  quirm is the one with the blue veins .      ridcully gave him a look .      actually  it didn   t feel magical     said the dean .  he sighed .  he was seventy two .  it had made him feel that he was seventeen again .  he couldn   t remember having been seventeen  it was something that must have happened to him while he was busy .  but it made him feel like he imagined it felt like when you were seventeen  which was like having a permanent red hot vest on under your skin .   he wanted to hear it again .      i think they   re going to have it again tonight     he ventured .     we could  er  go along and listen .  in order to learn more about it  in case it   s a threat to society     he added virtuously .      that   s right  dean     said the lecturer in recent runes .     it   s our civic duty .  we   re the city   s first line of supernatural defense .  supposing ghastly creatures started coming out of the air .         what about it .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      well  we   d be there .         yes .  that   s good  is it .      ridcully glared at his wizards .  two of them were surreptitiously tapping their feet .  and several of them appeared to be twitching  very gently .  the bursar twitched gently all the time  of course  but that was only his way .   like canaries  he thought .  or lightning conductors .      all right     he said reluctantly .     we   ll go .  but we won   t draw attention to ourselves .         certainly  archchancellor .         and everyone   s to buy their own drink .         oh .        corporal  possibly  cotton saluted in front of the fort   s sergeant  who was trying to shave .      it   s the new recruit  sir     he said .     he won   t obey orders .      the sergeant nodded  and then looked blankly at something in his own hand .      razor  sir     said the corporal  helpfully .     he just keeps on saying things like it   s not happening yet .         have you tried burying him up to the neck in the sand .  that usually works .         it   s a bit   um   thing   nasty to people   had it a moment ago       the corporal snapped his fingers .     thing .  cruel .  that   s it .  we don   t give people   the pit   these days .         this is the       the sergeant glanced at the palm of his left hand  where there were several lines of writing     the foreign legion .         yessir .  all right  sir .  he   s weird .  he just sits there all the time .  we call him beau nidle  sir .      the sergeant peered bemusedly at the mirror .      it   s your face  sir     said the corporal .     susan stared at herself critically .   susan   it wasn   t a good name  was it .  it wasn   t a truly bad name  it wasn   t like poor iodine in the fourth form  or nigella  a name which meant    oops  we wanted a boy .     but it was dull .  susan .  sue .  good old sue .  it was a name that made sandwiches  kept its head in difficult circumstances  and could reliably look after other people   s children .   it was a name used by no queens or goddesses anywhere .   and you couldn   t do much even with the spelling .  you could turn it into suzi  and it sounded as though you danced on tables for a living .  you could put in a z and a couple of ns and an e  but it still looked like a name with extensions built on .  it was as bad as sara  a name that cried out for a prosthetic h .   well  at least she could do something about the way she looked .   it was the robe .  it might be traditional but   she wasn   t .  the alternative was her school uniform or one of her mother   s pink creations .  the baggy dress of the quirm college for young ladies was a proud one and  in the mind of miss butts at least  proof against all the temptations of the flesh   but it lacked a certain panache as costume for the ultimate reality .  and pink was not even to be thought of .   for the first time in the history of the universe  a death wondered about what to wear .      hold on     she said  to her reflection .     here    i can create things  can   t i .      she held out her hand and thought  cup .  a cup appeared .  it had a skull and bones pattern around the rim .      ah     said susan .     i suppose a pattern of roses is out of the question .  probably not right for the ambience  i expect .      she put the cup on the dressing table and tapped it .  it went plink in a solid sort of way .      well  then     she said to her reflection     i don   t want something soppy and posey .  no silly black lace or anything worn by idiots who write poetry in their rooms and dress like vampires and are vegetarians really .      the images of clothes floated across her reflection .  it was clear that black was the only option  but she settled on something practical and without frills .  she put her head on one side critically .      well  maybe a bit of lace     she said .     and   perhaps a bit more   bodice .      she nodded at her reflection in the mirror .  certainly it was a dress that no susan would ever wear  although she suspected that there was a basic susanness about her which would permeate it after a while .      it   s a good job you   re here     she said     or i   d go totally mad .  haha .      then she went to see her grandf   death .   there was one place he had to be .     glod wandered quietly into the university library .  dwarfs respected learning  provided they didn   t have to experience it .   he tugged at the robe of a passing young wizard .      there   s a monkey runs this place  right .     he said .     big fat hairy monkey  hands a couple of octaves wide .      the wizard  a pasty faced postgraduate student  looked down at glod with the disdainful air a certain type of person always reserved for dwarfs .   it wasn   t much fun being a student in unseen university .  you had to find your pleasures where you could .  he grinned a big  wide innocent grin .      why  yes     he said .     i do believe right at this moment he   s in his workroom in the basement .  but you have to be very careful how you address him .         is that so .     said glod .      yes  you have to be sure to say     do you want a peanut  mr  monkey .        said the student wizard .  he signaled a couple of his colleagues .     that   s so  isn   t it .  he has to say mister monkey .         oh  yes indeedy     said a student .     actually  if you don   t want him to get annoyed  it   s best to be on the safe side and scratch under your arms .  that puts him at his ease .         and go ugh ugh ugh     said a third student .     he likes that .         well  thank you very much     said glod .     which way do i go .         we   ll show you     said the first student .      that   s so very kind .         don   t mention it .  only too glad to help .      the three wizards led glod down a flight of steps and into a tunnel .  light filtered down through the occasional pane of green glass set in the floor above .  every so often glod heard a snigger behind him .   the librarian was squatting down on the floor in a long  high cellar .  miscellaneous items had been scattered on the floor in front of him  there was a cart wheel  odd bits of wood and bone  and various pipes  rods  and lengths of wire that somehow suggested that  around the city  people were puzzling over broken pumps and fences with holes in them .  the librarian was chewing the end of a piece of pipe and looking intently at the heap .      that   s him     said one of the wizards  giving glod a push .   the dwarf shuffled forward .  there was another outburst of muffled giggling behind him .   he tapped the librarian on the shoulder .      excuse me           ook .         those guys just called you a monkey     said glod  jerking a thumb in the direction of the door .     i   d make them say    sorry     if i was you .      there was a creaking  metallic noise  followed very closely by a scuffling outside as the wizards trampled one another in their effort to get away .   the librarian had bent the pipe into a u shape  apparently without effort .   glod went to the door and looked out .  there was a pointy hat on the flagstones  trampled flat .      that was fun     he said .     if i   d just asked them where the librarian was  they   d have said bugger off  you dwarf .  you have to know how to deal with people in this game .      he came back and sat down beside the librarian .  the ape put a smaller bend in the pipe .      what   re you making .     said glod .      oook oook ook .         my cousin modo is the gardener here     said glod .     he says you   re a mean keyboard player .     he stared at the hands  busy in their pipe bending .  they were big .  and of course there were four of them .     he was certainly partly right     he added .   the ape picked up a length of driftwood and tasted it .      we thought you might like to play pianoforte with us at the drum tonight     said glod .     me and cliff and buddy  that is .      the librarian rolled a brown eye toward him  then picked up a piece of wood  gripped one end  and began to strum .      ook .         that   s right     said glod .     the boy with the guitar .         eeek .      the librarian did a back somersault .      oookoook ooka ooka oooka ook .         i can see you   re in the swing of it already     said glod .     susan saddled the horse and mounted up .   beyond death   s garden were fields of corn  their golden sheen the only color in the landscape .  death might not have been any good at grass  black  and apple trees  gloss black on black   but all the depth of color he hadn   t put elsewhere he   d put in the fields .  they rippled as if in the wind  except that there wasn   t any wind .   susan couldn   t imagine why he   d done it .   there was a path  though .  it led across the fields for half a mile or so  then disappeared abruptly .  it looked as though somebody walked out here occasionally and just stood  looking around .   binky followed the path and stopped at the end .  then he turned  managing not to disturb a single ear .      i don   t know how you do this     susan whispered .     but you must be able to do it  and you know where i want to go .      the horse appeared to nod .  albert had said that binky was a genuine flesh and blood horse  but maybe you could be ridden by death for hundreds of years without learning something .  he looked as though he   d been pretty bright to start with .   binky began to trot  and then canter  and then gallop .  and then the sky flickered  just once .   susan had expected more than that .  flashing stars  some sort of explosion of rainbow colors   not just a flicker .  it seemed a rather dismissive way of traveling nearly seventeen years .   the cornfields had gone  but the garden was pretty much the same .  there was the strange topiary and the pond with the skeletal fish .  there were  pushing jolly wheelbarrows and carrying tiny scythes  what might have been garden gnomes in a mortal garden but here were cheery little skeletons in black robes .  things tended not to change .   the stables were a little different  though .  binky was in them  for a start .   he whinnied quietly as susan led him into an empty stall next to himself .      i   m sure you two know each other     she said .  she   d never expected it to work  but it had to  didn   t it .  time was something that happened to other people  wasn   t it .   she slipped into the house .     no .  i cannot be bidden .  i cannot be forced .  i will only do that which i know to be right     susan crept along behind the shelves of lifetimers .  no one noticed her .  when you are watching death fight  you don   t notice shadows in the background .   they   d never told her about this .  parents never do .  your father could be death   s apprentice and your mother death   s adopted daughter  but that   s just fine detail when they become parents .  parents were never young .  they were merely waiting to become parents .   susan reached the end of the shelves .   death was standing over her father   she corrected herself  the boy who would be her father .   three red marks burn on his cheek where death has struck him .  susan raised a hand to the pale marks on her own face .   but that   s not how heredity works .   at least   the normal kind     her mother   the girl who would become her mother   was pressed against a pillar .  she had actually improved with age  susan thought .  her dress sense certainly had .  and she mentally shook herself .  fashion comments .  now .   death stood over mort  sword in one hand and mort   s own lifetimer in the other .   you don   t know how sorry this makes me  he said .      i might     said mort .   death looked up  and looked straight at susan .  his eye sockets flared blue for a moment .  susan tried to press herself into the shadows .   he looked back down at mort for a moment  and then at ysabell  and then back at susan  and then back down at mort .  and laughed .   and turned the hourglass over .   and snapped his fingers .   mort vanished  with a small    pop    of imploding air .  so did ysabell and the others .   it was  suddenly  very quiet .   death put the hourglass down  very carefully  on the table and looked at the ceiling for a while .  then he said   albert .   albert appeared from behind a pillar .   would you be so good as to make me a cup of tea  please .      yes  master .  hehe  you sorted him out right enough        thank you .   albert scurried off in the direction of the kitchen .   once again there was the closest thing there could ever be to silence in the room of lifetimers     you   d better come out .   susan did so  and stood before the ultimate reality .   death was seven feet tall .  he looked taller .  susan had vague memories of a figure carrying her on its shoulders through the huge dark rooms  but in memory it had been a human figure   bony  but human in a way she was certain of but couldn   t quite define .   this wasn   t human .  it was tall  and haughty  and terrible .  he might unbend enough to bend the rules  susan thought  but that doesn   t make him human .  this is the keeper of the gate of the world .  immortal  by definition .  the end of everything .   he is my grandfather .   will be  anyway .  is .  was .   but   there was the thing in the apple tree .  her mind kept swinging back to that .  you looked up at the figure  and thought about the tree .  it was almost impossible to keep both images in one mind .   well  well  well .  you have a lot of your mother about you  said death .  and your father .      how did you know who i am .     said susan .   i have a unique memory .      how can you remember me .  i haven   t even been conceived yet .      i did say unique .  your name is    .      susan  but        susan .  said death bitterly .  they really wanted to make sure  didn   t they .   he sat down in his chair  steepled his fingers  and looked at susan over the top of them .   she looked back  matching stare for stare .   tell me  said death  after a while  was i   will i be   am i a good grandfather .   susan bit her lip thoughtfully .      if i tell you  won   t that be a paradox .      not for us .      well   you   ve got bony knees .      death stared at her .   bony knees .         sorry .      you came here to tell me that .      you   ve gone missing back   there .  i   m having to do the duty .  albert is very worried .  i came here to   find things out .  i didn   t know my father worked for you .      he was very bad at it .      what have you done with him .      they   re safe for now .  i   m glad it   s over .  having people around was beginning to affect my judgment .  ah  albert     albert had appeared on the edge of the carpet  bearing a tea tray .   another cup  if you would be so good .   albert looked around  and totally failed to see susan .  if you could be invisible to miss butts  everyone else was easy .      if you say so  master .      so  said death  when albert had shuffled away  i have gone missing .  and you believe you have inherited the family business .  you .      i didn   t want to .  the horse and the rat just turned up .      rat .      er   i think that   s something that   s going to happen .      oh  yes  i remember .  hmm .  a human doing my job .  technically possible  of course  but why .      i think albert knows something  but he changes the subject .      albert reappeared  carrying another cup and saucer .  he plonked it down pointedly on death   s desk  with the air of one who is being put upon .      that   ll be all  will it  master .     he said .   thank you  albert .  yes .   albert left again  more slowly than normal .  he kept looking over his shoulder .      he doesn   t change  does he .     said susan .     of course  that   s the point about this place        what do you think about cats .      sorry .      cats .  do you like    em .      they   re       susan hesitated     all right .  but a cat   s just a cat .      chocolate  said death .  do you like chocolate .      i think it   s possible to have too much     said susan .   you certainly don   t take after ysabell .   susan nodded .  her mother   s favorite dish had been genocide by chocolate .   and your memory .  you have a good memory .      oh  yes .  i   remember things .  about how to be death .  about how it   s all supposed to work .  look  just then you said you remembered about the rat  and it hasn   t even happ        death stood up and strode across to the model of the discworld .   morphic resonance  he said  not looking at susan .  damn .  people don   t begin to understand it .  soul harmonics .  it   s responsible for so many things .   susan pulled out imp   s lifetimer .  blue smoke was still pouring through the pinch .      can you help me with this .     she said .   death spun around .   i should never have adopted your mother .      why did you .      death shrugged .   what   s that you   ve got there .   he took buddy   s lifetimer from her and held it up .   ah .  interesting .      do you know what it means  granddad .      i   ve not come across it before  but i suppose it   s possible .  in certain circumstances .  it means   somehow   that he has rhythm in his soul   granddad .      oh  no .  that   s can   t be right .  that   s just a figure of speech .  and what   s wrong with granddad .      grandfather i can live with .  granddad .  one step away from gramps  in my opinion .  anyway  i thought you believed in logic .  calling something a figure of speech doesn   t mean it   s not true .   death waved the hourglass vaguely .   for example  he said  many things are better than a poke in the eye with a blunt stick .  i   ve never understood the phrase .  surely a sharp stick would be even worse     death stopped .   i   m doing it again .  why should i care what the wretched phrase means .  or what you call me .  unimportant .  getting entangled with humans clouds the thinking .  take it from me .  don   t get involved .      but i am a human .      i didn   t say it was going to be easy  did i .  don   t think about it .  don   t feel .      you   re an expert  are you .     said susan hotly .   i may have allowed myself some flicker of emotion in the recent past  said death  but i can give it up any time i like .   he held up the hourglass again .   it   s an interesting fact that music  being of its nature immortal  can sometimes prolong the life of those intimately associated with it  he said .  i   ve noticed that famous composers in particular hang on for a long time .  deaf as posts  most of them  when i come calling .  i expect some god somewhere finds that very amusing .  death contrived to look disdainful .  it   s their kind of joke .    he set the glass down and twanged it with a bony digit .   it went whauuummmmeeee chida chida chida .   he has no life .  he has music .      music   s taken him over .      you could put it like that .      making his life longer .      life is extensible .  it happens all the time among humans .  not often .  usually tragically  in a theatrical kind of way .  but this isn   t another human .  this is music .      he played something  on some sort of stringed instrument like a guitar        death turned .   indeed .  well  well  well        is that important .      it is   interesting .         is it something i should know .      it is nothing important .  a piece of mythological debris .  matters will resolve themselves  you may depend upon it .      what do you mean  resolve themselves .      he will probably be dead in a matter of days .   susan stared at the lifetimer .      but that   s dreadful .      are you romantically involved with the young man .      what .  no .  i   ve only ever seen him once .      your eyes didn   t meet across a crowded room or anything of that nature .      no .  of course not .      why should you care  then .      because he matt   because he   s a human being  that   s why     said susan  surprised at herself .     i don   t see why people should be messed around like that     she added lamely .     that   s all .  oh  i don   t know .      he leaned down again until his skull was on a level with her face .   but most people are rather stupid and waste their lives .  have you not seen that .  have you not looked down from the horse at a city and thought how much it resembled an ant heap  full of blind creatures who think their mundane little world is real .  you see the lighted windows and what you want to think is that there must be many interesting stories behind them  but what you know is that really there are just dull  dull souls  mere consumers of food  who think their instincts are emotions and their tiny lives of more account than a whisper of wind .   the blue glow was bottomless .  it seemed to be sucking her own thoughts out of her mind .      no     whispered susan .     no  i   ve never thought like that .      death stood up abruptly and turned away .  you may find that it helps  he said .      but it   s all just chaos     said susan .     there   s no sense to the way people die .  there   s no justice .      hah .      you take a hand     she persisted .     you just saved my father .      i was foolish .  to change the fate of one individual is to change the world .  i remember that .  so should you .   death still hadn   t turned to face her .      i don   t see why we shouldn   t change things if it makes the world better     said susan .   hah .      are you too scared to change the world .      death turned .  the very sight of his expression made susan back away .   he advanced slowly toward her .  his voice  when it came  was a hiss .   you say that to me .  you stand there in your pretty dress and say that to me .  you .  you prattle on about changing the world .  could you find the courage to accept it .  to know what must be done and do it  whatever the cost .  is there one human anywhere in the world who knows what duty means .   his hands opened and shut convulsively .   i said you must remember   for us  time is only a place .  it   s all spread out .  there is what is  and what will be .  if you change that  you carry the responsiblity for the change .  and that is too heavy to bear .      that   s just an excuse .      susan glared at the tall figure .  then she turned and marched out of the room .   susan .   she stopped halfway across the floor  but didn   t turn around .      yes .      really   bony knees .      yes .        it was probably the first piano case that   d ever been made  and made out of a carpet at that .  cliff swung it easily onto his shoulder and picked up his sack of rocks in the other hand .      is it heavy .     said buddy .   cliff held the piano up on one hand and weighed it reflectively .      a bit     he said .  the floorboards creaked underneath him .     do you think we should   ve took all dem bits out .         it   s bound to work     said glod .     it   s like   a coach .  the more bits you take off  the faster it goes .  come on .      they set out .  buddy tried to look as inconspicuous as a human can look if he is accompanying a dwarf with a big horn  an ape  and a troll carrying a piano in a bag .      i   d like a coach     said cliff  as they headed for the drum .     big black coach with all dat liver on it .         liver .     said buddy .  he was beginning to get accustomed to the name .      shields and dat .         oh .  livery .         and dat .         what   d you get if you had a pile of gold  glod .     said buddy .  in its bag the guitar twanged gently to the sound of his voice .   glod hesitated .  he wanted to say that for a dwarf the whole point of having a pile of gold was  well  to have a pile of gold .  it didn   t have to do anything other than be just as oraceous as gold could be .      dunno     he said .     never thought i   d have a pile of gold .  what about you .         i swore i   d be the most famous musician in the world .         dat   s dangerous  dat kinda swear     said cliff .      oook .         isn   t it what every artist wants .     said buddy .      in my experience     said glod     what every true artist wants  really wants  is to be paid .         and famous     said buddy .      famous i don   t know about     said glod .     it   s hard to be famous and alive .  i just want to play music every day and hear someone say     thanks  that was great  here is some money  same time tomorrow  okay .            is that all .         it   s a lot .  i   d like people to say    we need a good horn man  get glod glodsson .            sounds a bit dull     said buddy .      i like dull .  it lasts .      they reached the side door of the drum and entered a gloomy room that smelled of rats and second hand beer .  there was a distant murmur of voices from the bar .      sounds like there   s a lot of people in     said glod .   hibiscus bustled in .     you boys ready  then .     he said .      hold on a minute     said cliff .     we ain   t discussed our pay .         i said six dollars     said hibiscus .     what d   you expect .  you aren   t guild  and the guild rate is eight dollars .         we wouldn   t ask you for eight dollars     said glod .      right .         we   ll take sixteen .         sixteen .  you can   t do that .  that   s twice guild rate .         but there   s a lot of people out there     said glod .     i bet you   re renting a lot of beer .  we don   t mind going home .         let   s talk about this     said hibiscus .  he put his arm around glod   s head and led him to a corner of the room .   buddy watched the librarian examine the piano .  he   d never seen a musician begin by trying to eat his instrument .  then the ape lifted the lid and regarded the keyboard .  he tried a few notes  apparently for taste .   glod returned  rubbing his hands .      that   s sorted him out     he said .     hah .         how much .     said cliff .      six dollars .     said glod .   there was some silence .      sorry     said buddy .     we were waiting for the     teen    .         i had to be firm     said glod .     he got down to two dollars at one point .        some religions say that the universe was started with a word  a song  a dance  a piece of music .  the listening monks of the ramtops have trained their hearing until they can tell the value of a playing card by listening to it  and have made it their task to listen intently to the subtle sounds of the universe to piece together  from the fossil echoes  the very first noises .   there was certainly  they say  a very strange noise at the beginning of everything .   but the keenest ears  the ones who win most at poker   who listen to the frozen echoes in ammonites and amber  swear they can detect some tiny sounds before that .   it sounded  they say  like someone counting  one  two  three  four .   the very best one  who listened to basalt  said he thought he could make out  very faintly  some numbers that came even earlier .   when they asked him what it was  he said     it sounds like one  two .      no one ever asked what  if there was a sound that called the universe into being  what happened to it afterward .  it   s mythology .  you   re not supposed to ask that kind of question .   on the other hand  ridcully believed that everything had come into being by chance or  in the particular case of the dean  out of spite .   senior wizards didn   t usually drink in the mended drum except when they were off duty .  they were aware that they were here tonight in some sort of ill defined official capacity  and were seated rather primly in front of their drinks .   there was a ring of empty seats around them  but it was not very big because the drum was unusually crowded .      lot of ambience in here     said ridcully  looking around .     ah  i see they do real ale again .  i   ll have a pint of turbot   s really odd  please .      the wizards watched him as he drained the mug .  ankh morpork beer has a flavor all its own  it   s something to do with the water .  some people say it   s like consomm    but they are wrong .  consomm   is cooler .   ridcully smacked his lips happily .      ah  we certainly know what goes into good beer in ankh morpork     he said .   the wizards nodded .  they certainly did .  that   s why they were drinking gin and tonic .   ridcully looked around .  normally at this time of night there was a fight going on somewhere  or at least a mild stabbing .  but there was just a buzz of conversation and everyone was watching the small stage at the far end of the room  where nothing was happening in large amounts .  there was theoretically a curtain across it  it was only an old sheet  and there was a succession of thuds and thumps from behind it .   the wizards were quite close to the stage .  wizards tend to get good seats .  ridcully thought he could make out some whispering  and see the shadows moving behind the sheet .      he said what do we call ourselves .         cliff  buddy  glod  and the librarian .  i thought he knew that .         no  we   ve got to have one name for all of us .         dey rationed  den .         something like the merry troubadours  maybe .         oook .         glod and the glodettes .         oh  yes .  how about cliff and the cliffettes .         oook ook oook ook .         no .  we need a different type of name .  like the music .         how about gold .  good dwarf name .         no .  something different from that .         silver  then .         ook .         i don   t think we should name ourselves after any kind of heavy metal  glod .         what   s so special .  we   re a band of people who play music .         names are important .         the guitar is special .  how about the band with buddy   s guitar in it .         oook .         something shorter .         er        the universe held its breath .      the band with rocks in .         i like it .  short and slightly dirty  just like me .         oook .         we ought to think up a name for the music  too .         it   s bound to occur to us sooner or later .      ridcully looked around the bar .   on the opposite side of the room was cut me own throat dibbler  ankh morpork   s most spectacularly unsuccessful businessman .  he was trying to sell someone a felonious hot dog  a sign that some recent surefire business venture had collapsed .  dibbler sold his hot sausages only when all else failed .     he gave ridcully a wave at no charge .   the next table was occupied by satchelmouth lemon  one of the musicians    guild   s recruiting officers  with a couple of associates whose apparent knowledge of music extended only to the amount of percussion available on the human skull .  his determined expression suggested that he was not there for his health  although the fact that the guild officers had a mean look about them rather hinted he was there for other people   s health  mostly in order to take it away .   ridcully brightened up .  the evening might just possibly be more interesting than he had expected .   there was another table near the stage .  he nearly didn   t notice it  and then his gaze swiveled back to it of its own accord .   there was a young woman sitting there  all by herself .  of course  it wasn   t unusual to see young women in the drum .  even unaccompanied young women .  they were generally there in order to become accompanied .   the odd thing was that  although people were jammed along the benches  she had space all around her .  she was quite attractive in a skinny way  ridcully thought .  what was the tomboy word .  gammon  or something .  she was wearing a black lace dress of the sort worn by healthy young women who want to look consumptive  and had a raven sitting on her shoulder .   she turned her head  saw ridcully looking at her  and vanished .   more or less .   he was a wizard  after all .  he felt his eyes watering as she flickered in and out of vision .   ah .  well  he   d heard the tooth fairy girls were in the city these days .  it   d be one of the night people .  they probably had a day off  just like everyone else .   a movement on the table made him look down .  the death of rats skrittered past  carrying a bowl of peanuts .   he turned back to the wizards .  the dean was still wearing his pointy hat .  there was also something slightly shiny about his face .      you look hot  dean     said ridcully .      oh  i   m lovely and cool  archchancellor  i assure you     said the dean .  something runny oozed past his nose .   the lecturer in recent runes sniffed suspiciously .      is someone cooking bacon .     he said .      take it off  dean     said ridcully .     you   ll feel a lot better .         smells more like mrs .  palm   s house of negotiable affection to me     said the senior wrangler .  they looked at him in surprise .     i just happened to walk past once     he said quickly .      runes  please take the dean   s hat off for him  will you .     said ridcully .      i assure you        the hat came off .  something long and greasy and very nearly the same pointy shape flopped forward .      dean     said ridcully eventually     what have you done to your hair .  it looks like a spike at the front and a duck   s arse  excuse my klatchian  at the back .  and it   s all shiny .         lard .  that   d be the bacon smell     said the lecturer .      that   s true     said ridcully .     but what about the floral smell .         mumblemumblemumblelavendermumble     said the dean sullenly .      pardon  dean .         i said it   s because i added lavender oil     said the dean loudly .     and some of us happen to think it   s a rather nifty hairstyle  thank you so very much .  your trouble  archchancellor  is that you don   t understand people of our age .         what   you mean seven months older than me .     said ridcully .   this time the dean hesitated .      what did i just say .     he said .      have you been taking dried frog pills  old chap .     said ridcully .      of course not  they   re for the mentally unstable .     said the dean .      ah .  there   s the trouble  then .      the curtain went up or  rather  was jerkily pulled aside .   the band with rocks in blinked in the torchlight .   no one clapped .  on the other hand  no one threw anything  either .  by drum standards  this was a hearty welcome .   ridcully saw a tall  curly headed young man clutching what looked like an undernourished guitar or possibly a banjo that had been used in a fight .  beside him was a dwarf  holding a battle horn .  at the rear was a troll  hammer in each paw  seated behind a pile of rocks .  and to one side was the librarian  standing in front of   ridcully leaned forward   what appeared to be the skeleton of a piano  balanced on some beer kegs .   the boy looked paralyzed by the attention .   he said     hello   er   ankh morpork        and  this amount of conversation apparently having exhausted him  he started to play .   it was a simple little rhythm  one that you might easily have ignored if you   d met it in the street .  it was followed by a sequence of crashing chords and then  ridcully realized  it hadn   t been followed by the chords  because the rhythm was there all the time .  which was impossible .  no guitar could be played like that .   the dwarf blew a sequence of notes on the horn .  the troll picked up the beat .  the librarian brought both hands down upon the piano keyboard  apparently at random .   ridcully had never heard such a din .   and then   and then   it wasn   t a din anymore .   it was like that nonsense about white light that the young wizards in the high energy magic building went on about .  they said that all the colors together made up white  which was bloody nonsense as far as ridcully was concerned  because everyone knew that if you mixed up all the colors you could get your hands on you got a sort of greeny brown mess which certainly wasn   t any kind of white .  but now he had a vague idea what they meant .   all this noise  this mess of music  suddenly came together and there was a new music inside it .   the dean   s quiff was quivering .   the whole crowd was moving .   ridcully realized his foot was tapping .  he stamped on it with his other foot .   then he watched the troll pick up the beat and hammer the rocks until the walls shook .  the librarian   s fingers swooped along the keyboard .  then his toes did the same .  and all the time the guitar hooted and screamed and sang out the melody .   the wizards were bouncing in their seats and twirling their fingers in the air .   ridcully leaned over to the bursar and screamed at him .      what .     shouted the bursar .      i said  they   ve all gone mad except me and you .         what .         it   s the music .         yes .  it   s great .     said the bursar  waving his skinny hands in the air .      and i   m not too certain about you .      ridcully sat down again and pulled out the thaumometer .  it was vibrating crazily  which was no help at all .  it didn   t seem to be able to decide if this was magic or not .   he nudged the bursar sharply .      this ain   t magic .  this is something else .         you   re exactly right .      ridcully had the feeling that he suddenly wasn   t speaking the right language .      i mean it   s too much .         yes .      ridcully sighed .      is it time for your dried frog pill .      smoke was coming out of the stricken piano .  the librarian   s hands were walking through the keys like casanunda in a nunnery .   ridcully looked around .  he felt all alone .   someone else hadn   t been overcome by the music .  satchelmouth had stood up .  so had his two associates .   they had drawn some knobbly clubs .  ridcully knew the guild laws .  of course  they had to be enforced .  you couldn   t run a city without them .  this certainly wasn   t licensed music   if ever there was unlicensed music  this was it .  nevertheless   he rolled up his sleeve and prepared a quick fireball  just in case .   one of the men dropped his club and clutched his foot .  the other one spun around as if something had slapped his ear .  satchelmouth   s hat dented  as if someone had just hit him on the head .   ridcully  one eye watering terribly  thought he made out the tooth fairy girl bringing the handle of a scythe down on satchelmouth   s head .   the archchancellor was quite a bright man but often had trouble in forcing his train of thought to change tracks .  he was having difficulty with the idea of a scythe  after all  grass didn   t have teeth   and then the fireball burned his fingers  and then  as he sucked frantically at them  he realized that there was something in the sound .  something extra .      oh  no     he said  as the fireball floated to the floor and set fire to the bursar   s boot     it   s alive .      he grabbed the beer mug  finished the contents hurriedly  and rammed it upside down on the tabletop .     the moon shone over the klatchian desert  in the vicinity of the dotted line .  both sides of it got exactly the same amount of moonlight  although minds like mr .  clete   s deplored this state of affairs .   the sergeant strolled across the packed sand of the parade ground .  he stopped  sat down  and produced a cheroot .  then he pulled out a match  reached down  and struck it on something sticking out of the sand  which said   good evening .      i expect you   ve had enough  eh  soldier .     said the sergeant .   enough what  sergeant .      two days in the sun  no food  no water   i expect you   re delirious with thirst and are just begging to be dug out  eh .      yes .  it is certainly very dull .      dull .      i am afraid so .      dull .  it   s not meant to be dull .  it   s the pit .  it   s meant to be a horrible physical and mental torture .  after one day of it you   re supposed to be a       the sergeant glanced surreptitiously at some writing on his wrist        a raving madman .  i   ve been watching you all day .  you haven   t even groaned .  i can   t sit in my   thing  you sit in it  there   s papers and things        office .         working with you outside like this .  i can   t bear it .      beau nidle glanced upward .  he felt it was time for a kindly gesture .   help  help .  help  help  he said .   the sergeant sagged with relief .   this assists people to forget  does it .      forget .  people forget everything when they   re given   er        the pit .      yes .  that   s it .      ah .  do you mind if i ask a question .      what .      do you mind if perhaps i have another day .   the sergeant opened his mouth to reply  and the d   regs attacked over the nearest sand dune .          music .     said the patrician .     ah .  tell me more .      he leaned back in an attitude that suggested attentive listening .  he was extremely good at listening .  he created a kind of mental suction .  people told him things just to avoid the silence .   besides  lord vetinari  the supreme ruler of ankh morpork  rather liked music .   people wondered what sort of music would appeal to such a man .  highly formalized chamber music  possibly  or thunder and lightning opera scores .   in fact the kind of music he really liked was the kind that never got played .  it ruined music  in his opinion  to torment it by involving it on dried skins  bits of dead cat  and lumps of metal hammered into wires and tubes .  it ought to stay written down  on the page  in rows of little dots and crotchets all neatly caught between lines .  only there was it pure .  it was when people started doing things with it that the rot set in .  much better to sit quietly in a room and read the sheets  with nothing between yourself and the mind of the composer but a scribble of ink .  having it played by sweaty fat men and people with hair in their ears and spit dribbling out of the end of their oboe   well  the idea made him shudder .  although not much  because he never did anything to extremes .   so        and then what happened .     he said .      an    then he started singin     yerronner     said cumbling michael  licensed beggar and informal informant .     a song about great fiery balls .      the patrician raised an eyebrow .      pardon .         somethin    like that .  couldn   t really make out the words  the reason bein     the piano exploded .         ah .  i imagine this interrupted the proceedings somewhat .         nah  the monkey went on playin    what was left     said cumbling michael .     and people got up and started cheerin    and dancin    and stampin    their feet like there was a plague of cockroaches .         and you say the men from the musicians    guild were hurt .         it was dead strange .  they were white as a sheet afterward .  at least     cumbling michael thought about the state of his own bedding     white as some sheets        the patrician glanced at his reports while the beggar talked .  it had certainly been a strange evening .  a riot at the drum   well  that was normal  although it didn   t sound exactly like a typical riot and he   d never heard of wizards dancing .  he rather felt he recognized the signs   there was only one thing that could make it worse .      tell me     he said .     what was mr .  dibbler   s reaction to all this .         what  yerronner .         a simple enough question  i should have thought .      cumbling michael found the words    but how did you know ole dibbler was there .  i never said    arranging themselves for the attention of his larynx  and then had second  third  and fourth thoughts about saying them .      he just sat and stared  yerronner .  with his mouth open .  and then he rushed right out .         i see .  oh  dear .  thank you  cumbling michael .  feel free to leave .      the beggar hesitated .      foul ole ron said as yerronner sometimes pays for information     he said .      did he .  really .  he said that  did he .  well  that is interesting .     vetinari scribbled a note in the margin of a report .     thank you .         er           don   t let me detain you .         er .  no .  gods bless yerronner     said cumbling michael  and ran for it .   when the sound of the beggar   s boots had died away the patrician strolled over to the window  stood with his hands clasped behind his back  and sighed .   there were probably city states  he reasoned  where the rulers only had to worry about the little things   barbarian invasions  the balance of payments  assassination  the local volcano erupting .  there weren   t people busily opening the door of reality and metaphorically saying     hi  come on in  pleased to see you  what a nice ax you have there  incidentally  can i make some money out of you since you   re here .      sometimes lord vetinari wondered what had happened to mr .  hong .  everyone knew  of course .  in general terms .  but not exactly what .   what a city .  in the spring  the river caught fire .  about once a month  the alchemists    guild exploded .   he walked back to his desk and made another brief note .  he was rather afraid that he was going to have to have someone killed .   then he picked up the third movement of fondel   s prelude in g major and settled back to read .     susan walked back to the alley where she   d left binky .  there were half a dozen men lying around on the cobbles  clutching parts of themselves and moaning .  susan ignored them .  anyone trying to steal death   s horse soon understood the expression    a world of hurts .     binky had a good aim .  it would be a very small  very private world .      the music was playing him  not the other way round     she said .     you could see .  i   m not sure his fingers even touched the strings .      squeak .   susan rubbed her hand .  satchelmouth had turned out to have quite a hard head .      can i kill it without killing him .      squeak .      not a hope     the raven translated .     it   s all that   s keeping him alive .         but grandda   but he said it   ll end up killing him anyway .         it   s a big wide wonderful universe all right     said the raven .   squeak .      but   look  if it   s a   a parasite  or something like that     said susan  as binky trotted skyward     what   s the good of it killing its host .      squeak .      he says you   ve got him there     said the raven .     drop me off over quirm  will you .         what does it want him for .     said susan .     it   s using him  but what for .           twenty seven dollars .     said ridcully .     twenty seven dollars to get you out .  and the sergeant kept grinning all the time .  wizards arrested .      he walked along the row of crestfallen figures .      i mean  how often does the watch get called in to the drum .     said ridcully .     i mean  what did you think you were doing .         mumblemumblemumble     said the dean  looking at the floor .      i   m sorry .         mumblemumbledancingmumble .         dancing     said ridcully levelly  walking back along the row .     that   s dancing  is it .  banging into people .  throwin    one another over yer shoulders .  twirling around all over the place .  not even trolls act like that  not that i   ve got anything against trolls mind you marvelous people marvelous people  and you   re supposed to be wizards .  people are supposed to look up to you and that   s not because you   re somersaulting over their heads  runes  don   t think i didn   t notice that little display  i was frankly disgusted .  the poor bursar has had to have a lie down .  dancing is   round in circles  don   tcherknow  maypoles and suchlike  healthy reels  perhaps a little light ballroom   not swinging people round like a dwarf with a battle ax  mind you salt of the earth dwarfs i   ve always said so  .  do i make myself clear .         mumblemumblemumbleeveryonewasdoingitmumble     said the dean  still looking at the floor .      i never thought i   d say this to any wizard over the age of eighteen  but you   re all gated until further notice .     shouted ridcully .   being confined to the campus was not much of a punishment .  the wizards usually distrusted any air that hadn   t hung around indoors for a while  and mostly lived in a kind of groove between their rooms and the dining table .  but they were feeling strange .      mumblemumbledon   tseewhymumble     mumbled the dean .   he said  much later on  on the day when the music died  that it must have been because he   d never been really young  or at least young while just being old enough to know he was young .  like most wizards  he   d begun his training while still so small that the official pointy hat came down over his ears .  and after that he   d just been  well  a wizard .   he had the feeling  once again  that he   d missed out on something somewhere .  he   d never really realized it until the last couple of days .  he didn   t know what it was .  he just wanted to do things .  he didn   t know what they were .  but he wanted to do them soon .  he wanted   he felt like a lifelong tundra dweller when he wakes up one morning with a deep urge to go water skiing .  he certainly wasn   t going to stay indoors when there was music in the air        mumblemumblemumblenotgonnastayindoorsmumble .      unaccustomed feelings surged through him .  he wanted to disobey .  disobey everything .  including the law of gravity .  he was definitely not going to fold his clothes before going to bed .  ridcully was going to say  oh  you   re a rebel  are you  what are you rebelling against  and he   d say   he   d say something pretty damn memorable  that   s what he   d do .  he was     but the archchancellor had stalked off .      mumblemumblemumble     said the dean defiantly  a rebel without a pause .     there was a knock at the door  barely audible above the din .  cliff opened it a cautious fraction .      it   s me  hibiscus .  here   s your beers .  drink    em up and get out .         how can we get out .     said glod .     every time they see us they force us to play some more .      hibiscus shrugged .     i don   t care     he said .     but you owe me a dollar for the beer and twenty five dollars for the broken furniture        cliff shut the door .      i could negotiate with him     said glod .      no  we can   t afford it     said buddy .   they looked at one another .      well  the crowd loved us     said buddy .     i think we were a big success .  er .      in the silence cliff bit the end off a beer bottle and poured the contents over his head .        what we all want to know is     said glod     what you thought you were doing out there .         oook .         and how come     said cliff  crunching up the rest of the bottle     we all knew what to play .         oook .         and also     said glod     what you were singing .         er              don   t tread on my new blue boots    .     said cliff .      oook .            good gracious miss polly    .     said glod .      er              sto helit lace    .     said cliff .      oook .         it   s a kind of very fine lace they make in the city of sto helit     said glod .   he gave buddy a lopsided look .      that bit where you said    hello  baby        he said .     why   d you do that .         er           i mean  it   s not as if they even allow small children into the drum .         i don   t know .  the words were just there     said buddy .     they were sort of part of the music           and you were   moving about in a funny way .  like you were having trouble with your trousers     said glod .     i   m no expert on humans  of course  but i saw some ladies in the audience looking at you like a dwarf looks at a girl when he knows her father   s got a big shaft and several rich seams .         yeah     said cliff .     and like when a troll is thinking  hey  will you look at der strata on dat one           you   re certain you   ve got no elvish in you  are you .     said glod .     once or twice i thought you were acting a bit   elvish .         i don   t know what   s happening .     said buddy .   the guitar whined .   they looked at it .      what we do is     said cliff     we take dat and throw it in der river .  all those in favor say    aye .     or oook  as der case may be .      there was another silence .  no one rushed to pick up the instrument .      but the thing is     said glod     the thing is   they did love us out there .      they thought about this .      it didn   t actually feel   bad     said buddy .      got to admit   i never had an audience like dat in my whole life     said cliff .      oook .         if we   re so good     said glod     why ain   t we rich .            cos you do der negotiatin        said cliff .     if we   ve got to pay for der furniture  i   m soon goin    to have to eat my dinner through a straw .         you saying i   m no good .     said glod  getting angrily to his feet .      you blow good horn .  but you ain   t no financial wizard .         hah  i   d just like to see        there was a knock on the door .   cliff sighed .     dat   ll be hibiscus again     he said .     pass me dat mirror .  i   ll try to hit one out on de other side .      buddy opened the door .  hibiscus was there  but behind a smaller man wearing a long coat and a wide  friendly grin .      ah     said the grin .     you   d be buddy  right .         er  yes .      and then the man was inside  without actually appearing to have moved  and kicking the door shut in the landlord   s face .      dibbler   s the name     the grin went on .     c . m . o . t dibbler .  i daresay you   ve heard of me .         oook .         i ain   t talking to you .  i   m talking to you other guys .         no     said buddy     i don   t think we have .      the grin appeared to widen .      i hear you boys are in a bit of trouble     said dibbler .     broken furniture and whatnot .         we   re not even going to get paid     said cliff  glaring at glod .      well now     said dibbler     it could just be that i could help you there .  i   m a businessman .  i do business .  i can see you boys are musicians .  you play music .  you don   t want to worry your heads about money stuff  right .  gets in the way of the creative processes  am i right .  how about if you leave that to me .         huh     said glod  still smarting from the insult to his financial acumen .     and what can you do .         well     said dibbler     i can get you paid for tonight  for a start .         what about the furniture .     said buddy .      oh  stuff gets busted here every night     said dibbler expansively .     hibiscus was just having you on .  i   ll square it with him .  confidentially  you want to watch out for people like him .     he leaned forward .  if his grin had been any wider  the top of his head would have fallen off .      this city  boys     he said     is a jungle .         if he can get us paid  i trust him     said glod .      as simple as dat .     said cliff .      i trust anyone who gives me money .      buddy glanced at the table .  he didn   t know why  but he had a feeling that if something was wrong  the guitar would do something   play a discord  maybe .  but it just purred gently to itself .      oh  all right .  if it means i get to keep my teef  i   m all for it     said cliff .      okay     said buddy .      great .  great .  we can make beautiful music together .  at least   you boys can  eh .      he pulled out a sheet of paper and a pencil .  in dibbler   s eyes  the lion roared .     somewhere high in the ramtops  susan rode binky over a cloud bank .      how could he talk like that .     she said     play around with people   s lives  and then talk about duty .        all the lights were on in the musicians    guild .   a gin bottle played a tattoo on the edge of a glass .  then it rattled briefly on the desk top as satchelmouth put it down .      doesn   t anyone know who the hells they are .     mr .  clete said  as satchelmouth managed to grip the glass on the second try .     someone must know who they are .         dunno about the boy     said satchelmouth .     no one   s ever seen him before .  an      an      well  you know trolls   could   ve been anyone           one of them was definitely the librarian from the university     said herbert    mr .  harpsichord    shuffle  the guild   s own librarian .      we can leave him for now     said clete .  the others nodded .  no one really wanted to attempt to beat up the librarian if there was anyone smaller available .      what about the dwarf .         ah .         someone said they thought he was glod glodsson .  lives in phedre road somewhere        clete growled .     get some of the lads over there right now .  i want the position of musicians in this city explained to them right now .  hat .  hat .  hat .        the musicians hurried through the night  the din of the mended drum behind them .      wasn   t he nice     said glod .     i mean  we haven   t just got our pay but he was so interested he gave us twenty dollars of his own money .         i tink what he said     said cliff     was dat he   d give us twenty dollars with interest .         same thing  isn   t it .  and he said he could get us more jobs .  did you read the contract .         did you .         it was very small writing     said glod .  he brightened up .     but there was a lot of it     he added .     bound to be a good contract  with that much writing on it .         the librarian ran away     said buddy cooked a lot  and ran away .         hah .  well  he   ll be sorry later on     said glod .     later on  people   ll talk to him and he   ll say  i left  you know  before they became famous .         he   ll say    ook .            anyway  that piano   s going to need some work .         yeah     said cliff .     like  i saw once where dis guy made stuff out of matches .  he could repair it .      a couple of dollars became two lamb kormas and pitchblende vindaloo at the curry gardens  along with a bottle of wine so chemical that even trolls could drink it  too .      and after this     said glod  as they sat down to wait for the food     we   ll find somewhere else to stay .         what wrong with your place .     said cliff .      it   s too drafty .  it   s got a piano shaped hole in the door .         yes  but you put it there .         so what .         won   t der landlord object .         of course he   ll object .  that   s what landlords are for .  anyway  we   re on the up and up  lads .  i can feel it in my water .         i thought you were just happy to get paid     said buddy .      right .  right .  but i   m even happier to get paid a lot .      the guitar hummed .  buddy picked it up and plucked a string .   glod dropped his knife .      that sounded like a piano .     he said .      i think it can sound like anything     said buddy .     and now it knows about pianos .         magic     said cliff .      of course magic     said glod .     that   s what i keep saying .  a strange old thing found in a dusty old shop one stormy night           it wasn   t stormy     said cliff .         it   s bound to   yes  all right  but it was raining a bit   it   s bound to be a bit special .  i bet if we was to go back now  the shop wouldn   t be there .  and that   d prove it .  everyone knows things bought from shops which aren   t there next day are dead mysterious and items of fate .  fate   s smiling on us  could be .         doing something on us     said cliff .     i hope it   s smiling .         and mr .  dibbler said he   d find us somewhere really special to play tomorrow .         good     said buddy .     we must play .         right     said cliff .     we play all right .  it   s our job .         people should hear our music .         sure .     cliff looked puzzled .     right .  of course .  dat   s what we want .  and some pay  too .         mr .  dibbler   ll help us     said glod  who was too preoccupied to notice the edge in buddy   s voice .     he must be very successful .  he   s got an office in sator square .  only very posh businesses can afford that .        a new day dawned .   it had hardly finished doing so before ridcully hurried through the dewy grass of the university gardens and hammered on the door of the high energy magic building .   generally he never went near the place .  it wasn   t that he didn   t understand what it was the young wizards in there were actually doing  but because he strongly suspected that they didn   t  too .  they seemed to positively enjoy becoming less and less certain about everything and would come in to dinner saying things like    wow  we   ve just overturned marrowleaf   s theory of thaumic imponderability .  amazing .     as if it was something to be proud of  instead of gross discourtesy .   and they were always talking about splitting the thaum  the smallest unit of magic .  the archchancellor couldn   t see the point .  so you had bits all over the place .  what good would that do .  the universe was bad enough without people poking it .   the door opened .      oh  it   s you  archchancellor .      ridcully pushed the door open farther .         morning  stibbons .  glad to see you   re up and about early .      ponder stibbons  the faculty   s youngest member  blinked at the sky .      is it morning already .     he said .   ridcully pushed his way past him and into the hem .  it was unfamiliar ground for a traditional wizard .  there wasn   t a skull or dribbly candle to be seen  this particular room looked like an alchemist   s laboratory had suffered the inevitable explosion and landed in a blacksmith   s shop .   nor did he approve of stibbons   s robe .  it was the right length but a washed out greeny grey  with pockets and toggles and a hood with a bit of rabbit fur around the edge .  there weren   t any sequins or jewels or mystic symbols anywhere .  just a blodgy stain where stibbons   s pen leaked .      you ain   t been out lately .     said ridcully .      no  sir .  er .  should i have been .  i   ve been busy working on my make it bigger device .  you know  i showed you             right  right     said ridcully  looking around .     anyone else been working in here .         well   there   s me  and tez the terrible and skazz and big mad drongo  i think        ridcully blinked .      what are they .     he said .  and then  from the depths of memory  a horrible answer suggested itself .  only a very specific species had names like that .      students .         er .  yes .     said ponder  backing away .     that   s all right  isn   t it .  i mean  this is a university        ridcully scratched his ear .  the man was right  of course .  you had to have some of the buggers around  there was no getting away from it .  personally  he avoided them wherever possible  as did the rest of the faculty  occasionally running the other way or hiding behind doors whenever they saw them .  the lecturer in recent runes had been known to lock himself in his wardrobe rather than take a tutorial .      you better fetch    em     he said .     the fact is  i seem to have lost my faculty .         for what  archchancellor .     said ponder  politely .      what .         sorry .      they looked at one another in incomprehension  two minds driving the wrong way up a narrow street and waiting for the other man to reverse first .      the faculty     said ridcully  giving up .     the dean and whatnot .  gone totally round the corner .  been up all night  playing guitars and whatnot .  the dean   s made himself a coat out of leather .         well  leather is a very practical and functional material           not the way he   s using it     said ridcully darkly      the dean stood back .  he   d borrowed a dressmaker   s dummy from mrs .  whitlow  the housekeeper .   he   d made some changes to the design that had buzzed around his brain .  for one thing  a wizard in his very soul is loath to wear any garment that doesn   t reach down at least to the ankles  so there was quite a lot of leather .  lots of room for all the studs .   he   d started with  dean .   that had hardly begun to fill the space .  after a while he   d added  born to  and left a space because he wasn   t quite sure what he   d been born to .  born to eat big dinners wouldn   t be appropriate .   after some more bemused thought he   d gone on to  live fats die yo gnu .  it wasn   t quite right  he could see  he   d turned the material over while he was making the holes for the studs and had sort of lost track of which direction he was going .   of course  it didn   t matter which direction you went  just so long as you went .  that   s what music with rocks in it was all about            and recent runes is in his room playing drums  and the rest of them have all got guitars  and what the bursar   s done to the bottom of his robe is really strange     said ridcully .     and the librarian   s wandering around the place pinchin    stuff and no one listens to a word i say .      he stared at the students .  it was a worrying sight  and not just because of the natural look of students .  here were some people who  while this damn music was making everyone tap their feet  had stayed indoors all night   working .      what are you lot doing in here .     he said .     you   what   s your name .      the student wizard pinned by ridcully   s pointing finger squirmed anxiously .      er .  um .  big mad drongo     he said  twisting the brim of his hat in his hands .      big .  mad .  drongo     said ridcully .     that   s your name  is it .  that   s what you   ve got sewn on your vest .         um .  no  archchancellor .         it is    .         adrian turnipseed  archchancellor .         so why   re you called big mad drongo  mr .  turnipseed .     said ridcully .      um   um           he once drank a whole pint of shandy     said stibbons  who had the decency to look embarrassed .   ridcully gave him a carefully blank look .  oh  well .  they   d have to do .      all right  you lot     he said .     what do you make of this .      he produced from his robe a mended drum beer tankard with a beer mat fastened over the top with a piece of string .      what have you got in there  archchancellor .     said ponder stibbons .      a piece of music  lad .         music .  but you can   t trap music like that .         i wish i was a clever bugger like you and knew every damn thing     said ridcully .     that big flask over there   you   big mad adrian   take the top off it  and be ready to slam it down again when i say .  ready with that lid  mad adrian   right .      there was a brief angry chord as ridcully pulled the beer mat off the mug and upended it quickly into the flask .  mad drongo adrian slammed the lid down  in total terror of the archchancellor .   and then they could hear it   a persistent faint beat  rebounding off the inner walls of the glass flask .   the students peered in at it .   there was something in there .  a sort of movement in the air        i trapped it in the drum last night .         that   s not possible     said ponder .     you can   t trap music .         that isn   t klatchian mist  lad .         it   s been in that mug since last night .     said ponder .      yes .         but that   s not possible .      ponder looked absolutely crestfallen .  there are some people born with the instinctive feeling that the universe is solvable .   ridcully patted him on the shoulder .      you never thought that being a wizard was going to be easy  did you .      ponder stared at the jar  and then his mouth snapped into a thin line of determination .      right .  we   re going to sort this out .  it must be something to do with the frequency .  that   s right .  tez the terrible  get the crystal ball .  skazz  fetch the roll of steel wire .  it must be the frequency .        the band with rocks in slept the night away in a single males    hostel in an alley off gleam street  a fact that would have interested the four enforcers of the musicians    guild sitting outside a piano shaped hole in phedre road .     susan strode through the rooms of death  seething gently with anger and just a touch of fear  which only made the anger worse .   how could anyone even think like that .  how could anyone be content to just be the personification of a blind force .  well  there were going to be changes     her father had tried to change things  she knew .  but only because he was  well  quite frankly  a bit soppy .   he   d been made a duke by queen keli of sto lat .  susan knew what the title was supposed to mean  it was supposed to mean    war leader .     but her father never fought anyone .  she   d never seen him with a sword .  he just spent all his time traveling from one wretched city state to another  talking to people and trying to get them to talk to other people .  he   d never killed anyone  although he might have talked a few politicians to death .  that didn   t seem to be much of a job for a war leader .  admittedly there didn   t seem to be all the little wars there used to be  but it was   well   not a proud kind of life .   she walked through the hall of lifetimers .  even those on the highest shelves rattled gently as she passed .   she   d save lives .  the good could be spared  and the bad could die young .  it would all balance up  too .  she   d show him .  as for responsibility  well   humans always made changes .  that was what being human was all about .   susan opened another door and stepped into the library .   it was a room even bigger than the hall of lifetimers .  bookcases rose like cliffs  a haze obscured the ceiling .   but of course it   d be childish  she told herself  to think that she could go in waving the scythe like a magic wand and turn the world into a better place overnight .  it might take some time .  so she should start in a small way and work up .   she held out a hand .      i   m not going to do the voice     she said .     that   s just unnecessary drama and really a bit stupid .  i just want the book of imp y celyn  thank you very much .      around her the busyness of the library went on .  millions of books quietly carried on writing themselves  causing a rustle like that of cockroaches .   she remembered sitting on a knee or  rather  sitting on a cushion on a knee  because the knee itself had been out of the question .  watching a bony finger follow the letters as they formed on the page .  she   d learned to read her own life        i   m waiting     said susan meaningfully .   she clenched her fists .   imp y celyn  she said .   the book appeared in front of her .  she just managed to catch it before it fluttered to the floor .      thank you     she said .   she flicked through the pages of his life until she came to the last one  and stared .  then she hastily went back until she found  written neatly down  his death in the drum .  it was all there   all untrue .  he hadn   t died .  the book was lying .  or   and this she knew was a far more accurate way of looking at it   the book was true and reality was lying .   what was more important was that from the moment of his death the book was writing music .  page after page had been covered with neat staves .  while susan watched  a clef drew itself in a series of careful loops .   what did it want .  why should it save his life .   and it was vitally important that she saved him instead .  she could feel the certainty like a ball bearing in her mind .  it was absolutely imperative .  she   d never met him up close  she   d not exchanged a word with him  he was just one person  but it was him she had to save .   grandfather had said she shouldn   t do that sort of thing .  what did he know about anything .  he   d never lived .     blert wheedown made guitars .  it was quiet  satisfying work .  it took him and gibbsson  the apprentice  about five days to make a decent instrument  if the wood was available and properly seasoned .  he was a conscientious man who   d devoted many years to the perfection of one type of musical instrument  on which he himself was no mean performer .   in his experience  guitarists came in three categories .  there were the ones he thought of as real musicians  who worked at the opera house or for one of the small private orchestras .  there were the folk singers  who couldn   t play but that was all right because most of them couldn   t sing either .  then there were the   hemhem   troubadours and other swarthy types  who thought a guitar was  like a red rose in the teeth  a box of chocolates  and a strategically placed pair of socks  another weapon in the battle of the sexes .  they didn   t play at all  apart from one or two chords  but they were regular customers .  when leaping out of a bedroom window just ahead of an angry husband the one thing a paramour is least concerned about leaving behind is his instrument .   blert thought he   d seen them all .   mind you  first thing this morning he   d sold some to some wizards .  that was unusual .  some of them had even bought blert   s guitar primer .   the bell rang .      yes      blert looked at the customer  and made a huge mental effort      sir .      it wasn   t just the leather jerkin .  it wasn   t just the wristbands with studs .  it wasn   t just the broadsword .  it wasn   t just the helmet with the spikes .  it was the leather and the studs and the sword and the helmet .  this customer couldn   t possibly be in categories one or two  blert decided .   the figure stood looking uncertain  hands gripping convulsively  clearly not at home in a dialogue situation .      this a guitar shop .     it said .   blert looked around at the merchandise hanging from walls and ceiling .      er  yes .     he said .      i wants one .      as for category three  he didn   t look like someone used to bothering with chocolates or roses .  or even    hello .         er       blurt grabbed one at random and held it out in front of him .     one like this .         i wants one that goes blam blam blamma blam blammmm oooiiieeee .  y   know .      blert looked down at the guitar .     i   m not sure it does that     he said .   two enormous black nailed hands took it out of his grasp .      er  you   re holding it wro           got a mirror .         er  no        one hairy hand was raised high in the air  and then plunged toward the strings .   blert never wanted to repeat the next ten seconds .  people shouldn   t be allowed to do that sort of thing to a defenseless musical instrument .  it was like raising a little pony  feeding it and grooming it properly  plaiting ribbons in its tail .  giving it a nice field with bunnies and daisies in it  and then watching the first rider take it out with spurs and a whip .   the thug played as if he were searching for something .  he didn   t find it  but as the last discords faded away his features twisted into the determined expression of one who intends to go on looking .      yer  right .  how much .     he said .   it was on sale for fifteen dollars .  but blert   s musical soul rebelled .  he snapped .      twenty five dollars     was what he snapped .      yer  right .  will this be enough  then .      a small ruby was produced from somewhere in a pocket .      i can   t change that .      blert   s musical soul was still protesting  but his business head stepped in and flexed its elbows .      but  but  but i   ll throw in my guitar primer and a strap and a couple of pleckies  yes .     he said .     it   s got pictures of where to put your fingers and everything  yes .         yer  right .      the barbarian walked out .  blert stared at the gem in his hand .   the bell rang .  he looked up .   this one wasn   t quite so bad .  there were fewer studs  and the helmet had only two spikes .   blert   s hand shut around the jewel .      don   t tell me you want a guitar .     he said .      yep .  one of them that goes whoweeeooowweeee oowwww ngngngng .      blert looked around wildly .      well  there   s this one     he said  grabbing the nearest instrument .     i don   t know about wooeeeoowweee but here   s my primer as well and a strap and some pleckies  that   ll be thirty dollars and i   ll tell you what i   ll do  i   ll throw in the space between the strings for free  okay .         yep .  er .  got a mirror .      the bell rang .   and rang .   an hour later blert leaned on the doorframe of his workshop  a manic grin on his face and his hands on his belt to stop the weight of money in his pockets pulling his trousers down .      gibbsson .         yes  boss .         you know those guitars you made .  when you were learning .         the ones you said sounded like a cat going to the toilet through a sewn up bum  boss .         did you throw them away .         no  boss .  i thought  i   ll keep them  so   s in five years    time  when i can make proper instruments  i   ll be able to take    em out and have a good laugh .      blert wiped his forehead .  several small gold coins fell out with his handkerchief .      where did you put them  out of interest .         chucked    em inna shed  boss .  along with that whaney timber you said was about as useful as a mermaid in a chorus line .         just fetch them out again  will you .  and that timber .         but you said           and bring me a saw .  and then nip out and get me  oh  a couple of gallons of black paint .  and some sequins .         sequins  boss .         you can get them up at mrs .  cosmopilite   s dress shop .  and ask her if she   s got any of those glittery ankhstones .  and some fancy material for straps .  oh   and see if she can lend us her biggest mirror        blert hitched up his trousers again .      and then go down to the docks and hire a troll and tell him to stand in the corner and if anyone else comes in and tries to play       he paused  and then remembered        pathway to paradise     i think they said it   s called   he   s to pull their head off .         shouldn   t he give them a warning .     said gibbsson .      that will be the warning .        it was an hour later .   ridcully had got bored and sent tez the terrible over to the kitchens to see about a snack .  ponder and the other two had been busying themselves around the flask  messing around with crystal balls and wire .  and now     there was a wire stretched between two nails on the bench .  it was a blur as it twanged an interesting beat .   big curved green lines hung in the air above it .      what   s that .     said ridcully .      that   s what the sound looks like     said ponder .      sound looks like     said ridcully .     well  there   s a thing .  i never saw sound looking like that .  this is what you boys use magic for  is it .  looking at sound .  hey  we   ve got some nice cheese in the kitchen  how about we go and listen to how it smells .      ponder sighed .      it   s what sound would be if your ears were eyes     he said .      really .     said ridcully  brightly .     amazing .         it looks very complicated     said ponder .     simple when you look at it from a distance and up close  very  very complex .  almost        alive     said ridcully  firmly .      er        it was the one known as skazz .  he looked about seven stone and had the most interesting haircut ridcully had ever seen  since it consisted of a shoulder length fringe of hair all round .  it was only the tip of his nose poking out which told the world which way he was facing .  if he ever developed a boil on the back of his neck  people would think he was walking the wrong way .      yes  mister skazz .     said ridcully .      er .  i read something about this once     said skazz .      remarkable .  how did you manage that .         you know the listening monks up in the ramtops .  they say that there   s a background noise to the universe .  a sort of echo of some sound .         sounds sensible to me .  the whole universe starting up  bound to make a big bang     said ridcully .      it wouldn   t have to be very loud     said ponder .     it   d just have to be everywhere  all at once .  i read that book .  old riktor the counter wrote it .  the monks are still listening to it  he said .  a sound that never fades away .         sounds like loud to me     said ridcully .     got to be loud to be heard any distance .  if the wind   s in the wrong direction  you can   t even hear the bells on the assassins    guild .         it wouldn   t have to be loud to be heard everywhere     said ponder .     the reason being  at that point everywhere was all in one place .      ridcully gave him the look people give conjurers who   ve just removed an egg from their ear .      everywhere was all in one place .         yes .         so where was everywhere else .         that was all in one place  too .         the same place .         yes .         crunched up very small .      ridcully was beginning to show certain signs .  if he had been a volcano  natives living nearby would be looking for a handy virgin .      haha  in fact you could say it was crunched up very big     said ponder  who always walked into it .     the reason being  space didn   t exist until there was a universe  so anything there was  was everywhere .         the same everywhere we had just now .         yes .         all right .  go on .         riktor said he thought that the sound came first .  one great big complicated chord .  the biggest  most complicated sound there ever was .  a sound so complex that you couldn   t play it within a universe  any more than you can open a box with the crowbar that   s inside it .  one great chord which   as it were   played everything into being .  started the music  if you like .         a sort of ta dahhh .     said ridcully .      i suppose so .         i thought the universe came into being because some god cut off some other god   s wedding tackle and made the universe out of it     said ridcully .     always seemed straightforward to me .  i mean  it   s the kind of thing you can imagine happenin    .         well           now you   re telling me someone blew a big hooter and here we are .         i don   t know about someone     said ponder .      noises don   t just make themselves  that i do know     said ridcully .  he relaxed a bit  certain in his own mind that reason had prevailed  and patted ponder on the back .      it needs some work  lad     he said .     old riktor was a bit   unsound  y   know .  he thought everything came down to numbers .         mind you     said ponder     the universe does have a rhythm .  day and night  light and dark  life and death           chicken soup and croutons     said ridcully .      well  not every metaphor bears close examination .      there was a knock on the door .  tez the terrible entered  carrying a tray .  he was followed by mrs .  whitlow  the housekeeper .   ridcully   s jaw dropped .   mrs .  whitlow curtsied .      good morning  hyour grace     she said .   her ponytail bobbed .  there was a rustle of starched petticoats .   ridcully   s jaw rose again  but only so that he could say     what have you done to your           excuse me  mrs .  whitlow     said ponder quickly     but have you served breakfast to any of the faculty this morning .         that   s right  mister stibbons     said mrs .  whitlow .  her ample and mysterious bosom shifted under its sweater .     none of the gentlemen came down  so i got trays taken up to them all .  daddio .      ridcully   s gaze continued downward .  he   d never thought of mrs .  whitlow as having legs before .  of course  in theory the woman needed something to move around on  but   well     but there were two pudgy knees protruding from the huge mushroom of skirts .  farther down there were white socks .      your hair       he began  hoarsely .      is there something wrong .     said mrs .  whitlow .      nothing  nothing     said ponder .     thank you very much .      the door closed behind her .      she was snapping her fingers as she went out  just like you said     said ponder .      wasn   t the only thing that   s snapped     said ridcully  still shuddering .      did you look at her shoes .         i think my eyes shut themselves protectively about there .         if it   s really alive     said ponder     then it   s very contagious .        this scene took place in crash   s father   s coach house  but it was an echo of a scene evolving all around the city .   crash hadn   t been christened crash .  he was the son of a rich dealer in hay and feedstuffs  but he despised his father for being dead from the neck up  totally concerned with material things  unimaginative  and also for paying him a ridiculous three dollars a week allowance .   crash   s father had left his horses in the coach house .  at the moment they were both trying to squeeze into one corner  having tried fruitlessly to kick a hole in the walls .      i reckon i nearly had it that time     said crash  as hay dust poured down from the roof and woodworm hurried off to find a better home .      it isn   t   i mean  it ain   t like the sound we heard in the drum     said jimbo critically .     it   s a bit like it  but it isn   it ain   t it .      jimbo was crash   s best friend and wished he was one of the people .      it   s good enough to start with     said crash .     so you and noddy  you two get guitars .  and scum  you   you can play the drums .         dunno how     said scum .  it was actually his name .      no one knows how to play the drums     said crash patiently .     there   s nothing to know .  you just hit them with the sticks .         yeah  but what if i sort of miss .         sit closer .  right     said crash  sitting back .     now   the important thing  the really important thing is   what   re we going to call ourselves .        cliff looked around .      well  i reckon we look at every house and i   m damned if i see der name dibbler anywhere     he growled .   buddy nodded .  most of sator square was the frontage of the university  but there was room for a few other buildings .  they were the sort that have a dozen brass plates by the door .  the sort that hinted that even wiping your feet on the doormat was going to cost you dear .      hello  boys .      they turned .  dibbler beamed at them over a tray of possibly sausages and buns .  there were a couple of sacks beside him .      sorry we   re late     said glod     but we couldn   t find your office anywhere        dibbler spread his arms wide .      this is my office     he said  equally expansively .     sator square .  thousands of square feet of space .  excellent communications .  passing trade .  try these on     he added  picking up one of the sacks and opening it .     i had to guess at sizes .      they were black  and made of cheap cotton .  one of them was xxxxl .      a vest with words on .     said buddy .         the band with rocks in        cliff read  slowly .     hey  dat   s us  isn   t it .         what do we want these for .     said glod .     we know who we are .         advertising     said dibbler .     trust me .     he put a brown cylinder in his mouth and lit the end .     wear them tonight .  have i got a gig for you .         have you .     said buddy .      that   s what i said .         no  you asked us     said glod .     how should we know .         has it got dat livery on der side .     said cliff .   dibbler started again .      it   s a big place  you   ll get a great audience .  and you   ll get       he looked at their trusting  open faces     ten dollars over guild rate  how about that .      glod   s face split into a big grin .     what  each .     he said .   dibbler gave them another appraising look .     oh   no     he said .     fair do   s .  ten dollars between you .  i mean  be serious .  you need exposure .         there   s dat word again     said cliff .     the musicians    guild   ll be right on our necks .         not this place     said dibbler .     guaranteed .         where is it  then .     said glod .      are you ready for this .      they blinked at him .  dibbler beamed  and blew a cloud of greasy smoke .      the cavern .        the beat went on     of course  there were bound to be a few mutations     gortlick and hammerjug were songwriters  and fully paid up members of the guild .  they wrote dwarf songs for all occasions .   some people say this is not hard to do so long as you can remember how to spell    gold     but this is a little bit cynical .  many dwarf songs  are on the lines of    gold  gold  gold    but it   s all in the inflection  dwarfs have thousands of words for    gold    but will use any of them in an emergency  such as when they see some gold that doesn   t belong to them .   they had a small office in tin lid alley  where they sat either side of an anvil and wrote popular songs to mine along to .      gort .         what .         what do you think of this one .      hammerjug cleared his throat .      i   m mean and turf and i   m mean and turf and i   m mean and turf and i   m mean and turf      and me an    my friends can walk towards you with our hats on backwards in a menacing way      yo .      gortlick chewed the end of his composing hammer thoughtfully .      good rhythm     he said     but the words need some work .         you mean more gold  gold  gold .         ye es .  what   re you thinking of calling it .         er   r   rat   music           why rat music .      hammerjug looked puzzled .      couldn   t really say     he said .     it was just an idea i had in my brain .      gortlick shook his head .  dwarfs were a burrowing race .  he knew what they liked .      good music   s got to have hole in it     he said .     you ain   t got nothing if you ain   t got hole .           now calm down  calm down     said dibbler .     it   s the biggest venue in ankh morpork  that   s why .  i don   t see what the problem is           the cavern .     screamed glod .     chrysoprase the troll runs it  that   s the problem .         dey say he   s a godfather in der breccia     said cliff .      now now  that   s never been proved           only    cos it   s very hard to prove things when someone   s scooped a hole in your head and buried your feet in it .         there   s no need for this prejudice just because he   s a troll       said dibbler .      i   m a troll .  so i can be prejudiced against trolls  all right .  he   s one mean mutherlode .  dey say when dey found der de bris gang none of    em had any teef           what is the cavern .     said buddy .      troll place     said cliff .     dey say           it   ll be great .  why worry .     said dibbler .      it   s a gambling joint  too .           but the guild won   t go in there     said dibbler .     not if they know what   s good for them .         and i know what   s good for me  too .     shouted glod .     i   m good at knowing that .  it   s good for me not to go into a troll dive .         they threw axes at you in the drum     said dibbler  reasonably .      yes  but only in fun .  it   s not as if they were aiming .         anyway     said cliff     only trolls and damn silly young humans go dere who think it clever to drink in troll bar .  you won   t get an audience .      dibbler tapped the side of his nose .      you play     he said .     you   ll get an audience .  that   s my job .         the doors aren   t big enough for me to go in .     snapped glod .      they   re huge doors     said dibbler .      they ain   t big enough for me    cos if you try to get me in there  you   ll have to drag the street in too  on account of me holding on to it .         no  be sensible           no .     screamed glod .     and i   m screaming for all three of us .      the guitar whined .   buddy swung it around until he could hold it  and played a couple of chords .  that seemed to calm it down .      i think it   er   likes the idea     he said .      it likes the idea     said glod  simmering down a little bit .     oh  good .  well  do you know what they do to dwarfs who go into the cavern .         we do need the money  and it   s probably not worse than what the guild   ll do to us if we play anywhere else     said buddy .     and we   ve got to play .      they stood looking at one another .      what you boys should do now     said dibbler  blowing out a smoke ring     is find somewhere nice and quiet to spend the day .  have a bit of a rest .         damn right     said cliff .     i never expected to carry dese rocks around de whole time        dibbler raised a finger .     ah     he said     i thought of that  too .  you don   t want to waste your talents lugging stuff around  that   s what i told myself .  i hired you a helper .  very cheap  only a dollar a day  i   ll take it straight out of your wages so   s you don   t have to bother about it .  meet asphalt .         who .     said buddy .         s me     said one of the sacks beside dibbler .   the sack opened up a bit and turned out not to be a sack at all  but a   a sort of crumpled   a kind of mobile heap of     buddy felt his eyes watering .  it looked like a troll  except that it was shorter than a dwarf .  it wasn   t smaller than a dwarf   what asphalt lacked in height he made up in breadth and  while on the subject  also in smell .      how come     said cliff     he   s so short .            n elphant sat on me     said asphalt  sulkily .   glod blew his nose .      only sat .      asphalt was already wearing a    band with rocks in    shirt .  it was tight across the chest but reached down to the floor .      asphalt   ll look after you     said dibbler .     there isn   t anything he doesn   t know about show business .      asphalt gave them a big grin .      you   ll be okay with me     he said .     i   ve worked with    em all  i have .  been everywhere  done it all .         we could go to der fronts     said cliff .     no one around dere when de university   s on holiday .         good .  got things to organize     said dibbler .     see you tonight .  the cavern .  seven o   clock .      he strode off .      you know the funny thing about him .     said glod .      what .         the way he was smoking that sausage .  do you think he knew .      asphalt grabbed cliff   s bag and slung it easily over his shoulder .      let   s go  boss     he said .      an elephant sat on you .     said buddy  as they crossed the square .      yup .  at the circus     said asphalt .     i used to murk    em arht .         that   s how you got like that .         nope .  din   t get like this    til elephants had sat on me t   ree  fo    times     said the small flat troll .     dunno why .  i   d be cleanin    up after    em  next minute it   d all be dark .         i   d have quit after the first time  me     said glod .      nah     said asphalt  with a contented smile .     couldn   t do that .  show business is in me soul .        ponder looked down at the thing they had hammered together .      i don   t understand it either     he said .     but   it looks as though we can trap it in a string  and it makes the string play the music again .  it   s like an iconograph for sound .      they   d put the wire inside a box  which resonated beautifully .  it played the same dozen bars  over and over again .      a box of music     said ridcully .     my word .         what i   d like to try     said ponder     is getting the musicians to play in front of a lot of strings like this .  perhaps we could trap the music .         what for .     said ridcully .     what on disc for .         well   if you could get music in boxes you wouldn   t need musicians anymore .      ridcully hesitated .  there was a lot to be said for the idea .  a world without musicians had a certain appeal .  they were a scruffy bunch  in his experience .  quite unhygienic .   he shook his head  reluctantly .      not this sort of music     he said .     we want to stop it  not make more of it .         what exactly is wrong with it .     said ponder .      it   s   well  can   t you see .     said ridcully .     it makes people act funny .  wear funny clothes .  be rude .  not do what they   re told .  i can   t do a thing with them .  it   s not right .  besides   remember mr .  hong .         it   s certainly very unusual     said ponder .     can we get some more .  for study purposes .  archchancellor .      ridcully shrugged .     we follow the dean     he said .        good grief     breathed buddy  in the huge echoing emptiness .     no wonder they call it the cavern .  it   s huge .         i feel dwarfed     said glod .   asphalt ambled to the front of the stage .      one two  one two     he said .     one .  one .  one two  one tw           three     said buddy helpfully .   asphalt stopped and looked embarrassed .      just trying the  you know  just trying the   trying out the       he muttered .     just trying   it .         we   ll never fill this     said buddy .   glod poked in a box by the side of the stage .   he said     they might .  look at these .      he unrolled a poster .  the others clustered round .      dat   s a picture of us     said cliff .     someone painted a picture of us .         looking mean     said glod .         s a good one of buddy     said asphalt .     waving his guitar like that .         why   s there all that lightning and stuff .     said buddy .      i never look dat mean even when i   m mean     said glod .         the new sounde dat   s goin    arounde        cliff read  his forehead wrinkling with the effort .         the bande with rockes        said glod .      oh  no .  it says we   re going to be here and everything     moaned glod .     we   re dead .            bee there orr bee a rectangular thyng        said cliff .     i don   t understand that .         there   s dozens of these rolls in here     said glod .     they   re posters .  you know what that means .  he   s been having them stuck up in places .  talking of which  when the musicians    guild gets hold of us           music   s free     said buddy .     it has to be free .         what .     said glod .     not in this dwarf   s town .         then it should be     said buddy .     people shouldn   t have to pay to play music .         right .  that boy   s right .  that   s just what i   ve always said .  isn   t that what i   ve always said .  that   s what i   ve said  right enough .      dibbler emerged from the shadows in the wings .  there was a troll with him who  buddy surmised  must have been chrysoprase .  he wasn   t particularly big  or even very craggy .  in fact he had a smooth and glossy look to him  like a pebble found on a beach .  there wasn   t a trace of lichen anywhere .   and he was wearing clothes .  clothes  other than uniforms or special work clothes  weren   t normally a troll thing .  mostly they wore a loincloth to keep stuff in  and that was that .  but chrysoprase had a suit on .  it looked badly tailored .  it was in fact very well tailored  but even a troll with no clothes on looks fundamentally badly tailored .   chrysoprase had been a very quick learner when he arrived in ankh morpork .  he began with an important lesson  hitting people was thuggery .  paying other people to do the hitting on your behalf was good business .      i   d like you lads to meet chrysoprase     said dibbler .     an old friend of mine .  me and him go way back .  that right  chrys .         indeed .     chrysoprase gave dibbler the warm friendly smile a shark bestows on a haddock with whom it suits it  for now  to swim in the same direction .  a certain play of silicon muscles in the corners also suggested that  one day  certain people would regret    chrys .         mr .  throat tells me youse boys is the best ting since slicing bread     he said .     youse got everyting youse need .      they nodded  mutely .  people tended not to speak to chrysoprase in case they said something that offended him .  they wouldn   t know it at the time  of course .  they   d know it later  when they were in some dark alley and a voice behind them said  mr .  chrysoprase is really upset .      youse go and rest up in your dressing room     he went on .     youse wants any food or drink  youse only got to say .      he   d got diamond rings on his fingers .  cliff couldn   t stop staring at them .   the dressing room was next to the privies and half full of beer barrels .  glod leaned on the door .      i don   t need the money     he said .     just let me get out of here with my life  that   s all i ask .         oo ownt ave oo orry       cliff began .      you   re trying to speak with your mouth shut  cliff     said buddy .      i said  you don   t have to worry  you   ve got der wrong sort of teeth     said the troll .   there was a knock on the door .  cliff slammed his hand back over his mouth .  but the knock turned out to belong to asphalt  who was carrying a tray .   there were three types of beer .  there were even smoked rat sandwiches with the crusts and tails cut off .  and there was a bowl of the finest anthracite coke with ash on it .      crunch it up good     moaned glod  as cliff took his bowl .     it may be the last chance you get           maybe no one   ll turn up and we can go home .     said cliff .   buddy ran his fingers over the strings .  the others stopped eating as the chords filled up the room .      magic     said cliff  shaking his head .      don   t you boys worry     said asphalt .     if there   re any problems  it   s the other guys who   ll get it in the teeth .      buddy stopped playing .      what other guys .            s funny thing     said the little troll .     suddenly everyone   s playing music with rocks in it .  mr .  dibbler   s signed up another band for the concert  too .  to kind of warm it up .         who .            s called insanity     said asphalt .      where are they .     said cliff .      well  put it like this   you know how your dressing room is next to the privy .        crash  behind the cavern   s raggedy curtain  tried to tune his guitar .  several things got in the way of this simple procedure .  firstly  blert had realized what his customers really wanted and  praying forgiveness from his ancestors  had spent more time gluing on bits of glittery stuff than he had on the actual functioning sections of the instrument .  to put it another way  he   d knocked in a dozen nails and tied the strings to them .  but this wasn   t too much of a problem  because crash himself had the musical talent of a blocked nostril .   he looked at jimbo  noddy  and scum .  jimbo  now the bass player  blert  giggling hysterically  had used a bigger lump of wood and some fence wire  was holding up his hand hesitantly .      what is it  jimbo .         one of my guitar strings has broke .         well  you   ve got five more  ain   t you .         yur .  but i doesn   t know how to play them  like .         you didn   t know how to play six  right .  so now you   re a bit less ignorant .      scum peered around the curtain .      crash .         yes .         there   s hundreds of people out there .  hundreds .  a lot of    em have got guitars  too .  they   re sort of waving    em in the air .      insanity listened to the roar from the other side of the curtain .  crash did not have too many brain cells  and they often had to wave to attract one another   s attention  but he had a tiny flicker of doubt that the sound that insanity had achieved  while a good sound  was the sound that he   d heard last night in the drum .  the sound made him want to scream and dance  while the other sound made him   well   made him want to scream and smash scum   s drum kit over its owner   s head  quite frankly .   noddy took a peek between the curtains .      hey  there   s a bunch of wiz   i think they   re wizards  right in the front row     he said .     i   m   pretty sure they   re wizards  but  i mean           you can tell  stupid     said crash .     they   ve got pointy hats .         there   s one with   pointy hair       said noddy .   the rest of insanity applied eyes to the gap .      looks like   a kind of unicorn spike made out of hair           what   s that he   s got on the back of his robe .     said jimbo .      it says born to rune     said crash  who was the fastest reader in the group and didn   t need to use his finger at all .      the skinny one   s wearing a flared robe     said noddy .      he must be old .         and they   ve all got guitars .  do you reckon they   ve come to see us .         bound to have     said noddy .      that   s a bodacious audience     said jimbo .      yeah  that   s right  bodacious     said scum .     er .  what   s bodacious mean .         means   means it bodes     said jimbo .      right .  it looks like it   s boding all right .      crash thrust aside his doubts .      let   s get out there     he said     and really show them what music with rocks in is about .        asphalt  cliff  and glod sat in one corner of the dressing room .  the roar of the crowd could be heard from here .      why   s he not saying anything .     asphalt whispered .      dunno     said glod .   buddy was staring at nothing  with the guitar cradled in his arms .  occasionally he   d slap the casing  very gently  in time to whatever thoughts were sluicing through his head .      he goes like that sometimes     said cliff .     just sits and looks at der air           hey  they   re shouting something out there     said glod .     listen .      the roar had a rhythm to it .      sounds like    rocks  rocks  rocks        said cliff .   the door burst open and dibbler half ran  half fell in .      you   ve got to get out there .     he shouted .     right now .         i thought the insanitary boys       glod began .      don   t even ask     said dibbler .     come on .  otherwise they   ll wreck the place .      asphalt picked up the rocks .      okay     he said .      no     said buddy .      what this .     said dibbler .     nerves .         no .  music should be free .  free as the air and the sky .      glod   s head spun around .  buddy   s voice had a faint suggestion of an echo .      sure  right  that   s what i said     said dibbler .     the guild        buddy unfolded his legs and stood up .      i expect people had to pay to get in here  didn   t they .     he said .   glod looked at the others .  no one else seemed to have noticed it .  but there was a twang on the edge of buddy   s words  a sibilance of strings .      oh  that .  of course     said dibbler .     got to cover expenses .  there   s your wages   wear and tear on the floor   heating and lighting   depreciation        the roar was louder now .  it had a certain foot stamping component .   dibbler swallowed .  he suddenly had the look of a man prepared to make the supreme sacrifice .      i could   maybe go up   maybe   a dollar     he said  each word fighting its way out of the strongroom of his soul .      if we go on stage now  i want us to do another performance     said buddy .   glod glared suspiciously at the guitar .      what .  no problem .  i can soon           free .         free .     the word got past dibbler   s teeth before they could snap shut .  he rallied magnificently .     you don   t want paying .  certainly  if        buddy didn   t move .      i mean we don   t get paid and people don   t have to pay to listen .  as many people as possible .         free .         yes .         where   s the profit in that .      an empty beer bottle vibrated off the table and smashed on the floor .  a troll appeared in the doorway  or at least part of it did .  it wouldn   t be able to get into the room without ripping the doorframe out  but it looked as though it wouldn   t think twice about doing so .      mr .  chrysoprase says  what   s happening .     it growled .      er       dibbler began .      mr .  chrysoprase don   t like being kept waiting .         i know  it           he gets sad if he   s kept waiting           all right .     shouted dibbler .     free .  and that   s cutting my own throat .  you do know that  don   t you .      buddy played a chord .  it seemed to leave little lights in the air .      let   s go     he said softly .      i know this city     dibbler mumbled  as the band with rocks in hurried toward the vibrating stage .     tell people something   s free and you   ll get thousands of them turning up        needing to eat  said a voice in his head .  it had a twang .   needing to drink .   needing to buy band with rocks in shirts     dibbler   s face  very slowly  rearranged itself into a grin .      a free festival     he said .     right .  it   s our public duty .  music should be free .  and sausages in a bun should be a dollar each  mustard extra .  maybe a dollar fifty .  and that   s cutting my own throat .        in the wings  the noise of the audience was a solid wall of sound .      there   s lots of them     said glod .     i never played for that many in my entire life .      asphalt was arranging cliff   s rocks on the stage and getting massive applause and catcalls .   glod glanced up at buddy .  he hadn   t let go of the guitar all this time .  dwarfs weren   t given to deep introspection  but glod was suddenly aware of a desire to be a long way from here  in a cave somewhere .      best of luck  you guys     said a flat little voice behind them .   jimbo was bandaging crash   s arm .      er  thanks     said cliff .     what happened to you .         they threw something at us     said crash .      what .         noddy  i think .      what could be seen of crash   s face broke into a huge and terrible smile .      we done it  though .     he said .     we done music with rocks in all right .  that bit where jimbo smashed his guitar  they loved that bit .         smashed his guitar .         yeah     said jimbo  with the pride of the artist .     on scum .      buddy had his eyes closed .  cliff thought he could see a very  very faint glow surrounding him  like a thin mist .  there were tiny points of light in it .   sometimes  buddy looked very elvish .   asphalt scurried off the stage .      okay  all done     he said .   the others looked at buddy .   he was still standing with his eyes shut  as if he was asleep on his feet .      we   ll   get on out there  then .     said glod .      yes     said cliff     we   ll get on out dere  will we .  er  buddy .      buddy   s eyes snapped open suddenly .      let   s rock     he whispered .   cliff had thought that the sound was loud before  but it hit him like a club as they trooped out of the wings .   glod picked up his horn .  cliff sat down and found his hammers .   buddy walked to the center of the stage and  to cliff   s amazement  just stood there looking down at this feet .   the cheering began to subside .   and then died away altogther .  the huge hall was filled with the hush of hundreds of people holding their breath .   buddy   s fingers moved .   he picked out three simple little chords .   and then he looked up .      hello  ankh morpork .      cliff felt the music rise up behind him and rush him forward into a tunnel of fire and sparks and excitement .  he brought his hammers down .  and it was music with rocks in .     c . m . o . t .  dibbler stood out in the street so that he didn   t have to hear the music .  he was smoking a cigar and doing calculations on the back of an overdue bill for stale buns .   lessee   okay  have it outside somewhere  so there   s no rent   maybe ten thousand people  one sausage inna bun each at a dollar fifty  no  say a dollar seventy five  mustard tenpence extra   ten thousand band with rocks in shirts at five dollars each  make that ten dollars   add stall rental for other traders  because people who like music with rocks in could probably be persuaded to buy anything     he was aware of a horse coming along the street .  he paid it no attention until a female voice said     how do i get in here .         no chance .  tickets all sold out     said dibbler  without moving his head .  even band with rocks in posters  people had been offering three dollars just for posters  and chalky the troll could knock out a hundred a     he looked up .  the horse  a magnificent white one  watched him incuriously .   dibbler looked around .     where   d she go .        there were a couple of trolls lounging just inside the entrance .   susan ignored them .  they ignored her .     in the audience  ponder stibbons looked both ways and cautiously opened a wooden box .   the stretched string inside began to vibrate .      this is all wrong .     he shouted in ridcully   s ear .     this is not according to the laws of sound .         maybe they   re not laws .     screamed ridcully .  people a foot away couldn   t hear him .     maybe they   re just guidelines .         no .  there have to be laws .      ridcully saw the dean try to climb on the stage in the excitement .  asphalt   s huge troll feet landed heavily on his fingers .      oh  i say  good shot     said the archchancellor .   a prickling sensation on the back of his neck made him look around .   although the cavern was crowded  a space seemed to have formed in the floor .  people were pressed together but  somehow  this circle was as inviolate as a wall .   in the middle of it was the girl he   d seen in the drum .  she was walking across the floor  holding her dress daintily .   ridcully   s eyes watered .   he stepped forward  concentrating .  you could do almost anything if you concentrated .  anyone could have stepped into the circle if their senses had been prepared to let them know it was there .  inside the circle the sound was slightly muted .   he tapped her on the shoulder .  she spun around  startled .      good evening     said ridcully .  he looked her up and down  and then said     i   m mustrum ridcully  archchancellor of unseen university .  i can   t help wondering who you are .         er       the girl looked panicky for a moment .     well  technically   i suppose i   m death .         technically .         yes .  but not on duty at the moment .         very glad to hear that .      there was a shriek from the stage as asphalt threw the lecturer in recent runes into the audience  which applauded .      can   t say i   ve seen that much of death     said ridcully .     but insofar as i have  he   d tended to be   well  he  to start with .  and a good deal thinner    .         he   s my grandfather .         ah .  ah .  really .  i didn   t even know he was       ridcully stopped .     well  well  well  fancy that .  your grandfather .  and you   re in the family firm .         shut up  you stupid man     said susan .     don   t you dare patronize me .  you see him .     she pointed to the stage  where buddy was in mid riff .     he   s going to die soon because   because of silliness .  and if you can   t do anything about it  go away .      ridcully glanced at the stage .  when he looked back  susan had vanished .  he made a mighty effort and thought he caught a glimpse of her a little way off  but she knew he was looking for her and he had no chance of finding her now .     asphalt got back into the dressing room first .  there is something very sad about an empty dressing room .  it   s like a discarded pair of underpants  which it resembles in a number of respects .  it   s seen a lot of activity .  it may even have witnessed excitement and a whole gamut of human passions .  and now there   s nothing much left but a faint smell .   the little troll dumped the bag of rocks on the floor and bit the top off a couple of beer bottles .   cliff entered .  he got halfway across the floor and then fell over  hitting the boards with every part of his body at once .  glod stepped over him and flopped onto a barrel .   he looked at the beer bottles .  he took off his helmet .  he poured the beer into the helmet .  then he let his head flop forward .   buddy entered and sat down in the corner  leaning against the wall .   and dibbler followed .     well  what can i say .  what can i say .     he said .      don   t ask us     said cliff from his prone position .     how should we know .         that was magnificent     said dibbler .     what   s up with the dwarf .  is he drowning .      glod reached out an arm  without looking  smashed the top off another bottle of beer and poured it over his head .      mr .  dibbler .     said cliff .      yes .         i think we want to talk .  just us  like .  der band .  if you don   t mind .      dibbler looked from one to the other .  buddy was staring at the wall .  glod was making bubbling noses .  cliff was still on the floor .      okay     he said  and then added brightly .     buddy .  the free performance   great idea .  i   ll start organizing it right away and you can do it just as soon as you get back from your tour .  right .  well  i   ll just        he turned to leave and walked into cliff   s arm  which was suddenly blocking the doorway .      tour .  what tour .      dibbler backed off a little .     oh  a few places .  quirm  pseudopolis  sto lat       he looked around at them .     didn   t you want that .         we   ll talk about dat later     said cliff .   he pushed dibbler out of the door and slammed it shut .   beer dripped off glod   s beard .      tour .  three more nights of this .         what   s the problem .     said asphalt .     it was great .  everyone was cheering .  you did two hours .  i had to keep kickin       em off the stage .  i never felt so        he stopped .      that   s it  really     said cliff .     the fing is  i go on dat stage  i sits down not knowing even what we   re goin    to do  next minute buddy plays something on his   on dat thing  next i   m goin    bam bam chcha chcha bam bam .  i don   t know what i   m playing .  it just comes in my head and down my arms .         yes     said glod .     me too .  seems to me i   m getting stuff out of that horn i never put in there .         and it ain   t like proper playing     said cliff .     that   s what i   m saying .  it   s more like being played .         you   ve been in show business a long time  right .     said glod to asphalt .      yep .  been there  done it .  seen    em all .         you ever seen an audience like that .         i   ve seen    em throw flowers and cheer at the opera house           ha .  just flowers .  some woman threw her   clothing at the stage .         dat   s right .  landed on my head .         and when miss vava voom did the feather dance down at the skunk club in brewer street the whole audience rushed the stage when she was down to the last feather           that was like this  was it .         no     the troll admitted .     i got to say it  i ain   t never seen an audience so   hungry .  not even for miss vava voom  and they were pretty damn peckish then  i can tell you .  of course  no one threw underwear onto the stage .  she used to throw it off the stage .         dere   s something else     said cliff .     dere   s four people in dis room and only three of dem   s talking .      buddy looked up .      the music   s important     he mumbled .      it ain   t music     said glod .     music don   t do this to people .  it don   t make them feel like they   ve been put through a wringer .  i was sweating so much i   m going to have to change my vest any day now .     he rubbed his nose .     also  i looked at that audience  and i thought  they paid money to get in here .  i bet it came to more than ten dollars .      asphalt held up a slip of paper .      found this ticket on the floor     he said .   glod read it .      a dollar fifty .     he said .     six hundred people at a dollar fifty each .  that   that   s four hundred dollars .         nine hundred     said buddy  in the same flat tone .     but the money isn   t important .         the money   s not important .  you keep on saying that .  what kind of musician are you .      there was still a muted roar from outside .      you want to go back to playing for half a dozen people in some cellar somewhere after this .     said buddy .     who   s the most famous horn player there ever was  glod .         brother charnel     said the dwarf promptly .     everyone knows that .  he stole the altar gold from the temple of offler and had it made into a horn and played magical music until the gods caught up with him and pulled his           right     said buddy .     but if you went out there now and asked who the most famous horn player is  would they remember some felonious monk or would they shout for glod glodsson .         they   d        glod hesitated .      right     said buddy .     think about that .  a musician has to be heard .  you can   t stop now .  we can   t stop now .      glod waved a finger at the guitar .      it   s that thing     he said .     it   s too dangerous .         i can handle it .         yes  but where   s it going to end .         it   s not how you finish that matters     said buddy .     it   s how you go .         that sounds elvish to me        the door burst open again .      er     said dibbler     boys  if you don   t come back and play something else  then we   re in the deep brown           can   t play     said glod .     i   ve run out of breath through lack of money .         i said ten dollars  didn   t i .     said dibbler .      each     said cliff .   dibbler  who hadn   t expected to get away with less than a hundred  waved his hands in the air .      gratitude  is it .     he said .     you want me to cut my own throat .         we   ll help  if you like     said cliff .      all right  all right  thirty dollars     said dibbler .     and i go without my tea .      cliff looked at glod  who was still digesting the thing about the most famous horn player in the world .      there   s a lot of dwarfs and trolls in der audience     said cliff .         cavern deep  mountain high    .     said glod .      no     said buddy .      what  then .         i   ll think of something .        the audience spilled out into the street .  the wizards gathered around the dean  snapping their fingers .      wella wella wella       sang the dean happily .      it   s gone midnight .     said the lecturer in recent runes  snapping his fingers .     and i don   t care a bit .  what shall we do now .         we could have a rumble     said the dean .      that   s true     said the chair of indefinite studies .     we did miss dinner .         we missed dinner .     said the senior wrangler .     wow .  that   s music with rocks in .  we just don   t care .         no  i meant       the dean paused .  he wasn   t quite sure  now he came to really think about it  what he had meant .     it   s a long walk back to the university     he conceded .     i suppose we could at least stop for a coffee or something .         maybe a doughnut or two     said recent runes .      and perhaps some cake     said the chair .      i could just fancy some apple pie     said the senior wrangler .      and some cake .         coffee     said the dean .     ye ess .  a coffee bar .  that   s right .         what   s a coffee bar .     said the senior wrangler .      like a chocolate bar .     said recent runes .  the missed dinner  hitherto forgotten  was beginning to loom large in everyone   s stomachs .   the dean looked down at his shiny new leather robe .  everyone had said how good it was .  they   d admired born to rune .  his hair was right  too .  he was thinking of shaving off his beard but just leaving the side bits because that felt right .  and coffee   yes   coffee was in there somewhere .  coffee was all part of it .   and there was the music .  that was in there .  that was everywhere .   but there was something else  too .  something missing .  he wasn   t sure what it was  only that he   d know it if he ever saw it .     it was very dark in the alley behind the cavern  and only the keenest sighted would have seen several figures pressed against the wall .   the occasional glint of a tarnished sequin would indicate to those who knew about such things that these were the musicians    guild   s crack enforcers  the grisham frord close harmony singers .  unlike most of the people employed by mr .  clete  they did  in fact  genuinely have some musical talent .   they   d also been in to see the band .      do wop  uh do wop  uh do wop       said the thin one .      bubububuh       said the tall one .  there   s always a tall one .      clete   s right .  if they keep pulling in audiences like that  everyone else is out of the show     said grisham .      oh yeah     said the bass man .      when they come through that door      three more knives slipped from their sheaths      well  just take your time from me .      they heard the sound of feet on stairs .  grisham nodded .      a one  a two  a one two thr        gentlemen .   they pivoted .   a dark figure stood behind them  holding a glowing scythe in its hands .   susan smiled horribly .   take it from the top .      oh  nooo     said the bass man .     asphalt unbolted the door and stepped out into the night .      hey  what was that .     he said .      what was what .     said dibbler .      i thought i heard some people running away       the troll stepped forward .  there was a ting .  he reached down and picked up something .      and whoever it was dropped this           just some item or other     said dibbler loudly .     come    long  boys .  you don   t have to go back to any flophouse tonight .  it   s the gritz for you .         that   s a troll hotel  isn   t it .     said glod suspiciously .      trollish     said dibbler  waving a hand irritably .      hey  i bin in dere once doing cabarett .     said cliff .     dey got nearly everything .  water out of taps in nearly every room .  a speaking tube so   s you can holler your meal order right down to der kitchen  and dese guys with actual shoes on who brings it right to you .  der works .         treat yourself .     said dibbler .     you boys can afford it .         and then there   s this tour  is there .     said glod sharply .     we can afford that too  can we .         oh  i shall help out with that     said dibbler expansively .     tomorrow you   ll go on to pseudopolis  that   ll take two days  then you can come back via sto lat and quirm and be back here on wednesday for the festival .  great idea  that .  giving something to the community  i   ve always been in favor of giving to the community .  it   s very good for   for   for the community .  i   ll get it all organized while you   re away  okay .  and then       he put one arm around buddy   s shoulders and another around glod   s head .     genua .  klatch .  hersheba .  chimera .  howondaland .  maybe even the counterweight continent  they   re talking about discovering it again real soon now  great opportunities for the right people .  with your music and my unerring business sense  the world is our mollusc .  now  you just go off with asphalt  the best rooms now  nothing   s too much for my boys  and get some sleep without worrying about the bill           thank you     said glod .         you can pay it in the morning .      the band with rocks in shambled away in the direction of the best hotel .   dibbler heard cliff say     what   s a mollusc .         it   s like two plates of precipitated calcium carbonate with a salty slimy fishy thing in the middle .         sounds tasty .  you don   t have to eat dat bit in der middle  do you .      when they   d gone dibbler looked at the knife he   d taken from asphalt .  it had sequins on it .   yes .  a few days with the lads out of the way was definitely a good move .   in his perch in the gutter above  the death of rats gibbered to himself .     ridcully walked slowly out of the cavern .  only a light drift of used tickets on the steps bore witness to the hours of music .   he felt like someone watching a game who didn   t know the rules .  for example  the boy had been singing   what was it .  rave in .  what the hell did that mean .  raving  yes  he could understand that  and in the dean   s case it was perfectly accurate .  rave in .  but everyone else had seemed to know what was meant .  and then there had been  as far as he could remember  a song about not stepping on someone   s shoes .  fair enough  sensible suggestion  no one wanted their feet trodden on  but why a song asking people to avoid doing so should have such an effect ridcully was at a loss to understand .   and as for the girl     ponder bustled up  clutching his box .      i   ve got nearly all of it  archchancellor .     he shouted .   ridcully glanced past him .  there was dibbler  still bearing a tray of unsold band with rocks in shirts .      yes  fine  mr .  stibbons  shutupshutupshutup      he said     jolly good  let   s get back home .         good evening  archchancellor     said dibbler .      why  hello  throat     said ridcully .     didn   t see you there .         what   s in that box .         oh  nothing  nothing at all           it   s amazing .     said ponder  full of the undirected excitement of the true discoverer and idiot .     we can trap the arragh aargh aargh .         my word  clumsy old me     said ridcully  as the young wizard clutched at his leg .     here  let me take that totally innocent device you have there        but the box had tumbled out of ponder   s arms .  it hit the street before ridcully could catch it  and the lid flew off .   the music spilled out into the night .      how did you do that .     said dibbler .     is it magic .         the music lets itself be trapped so you can hear it again and again     said ponder .     and i think you did that on purpose  sir .         you can hear it again and again .     said dibbler .     what  by just opening a box .         yes     said ponder .      no     said ridcully .      yes you can     said ponder .     i showed you  archchancellor .  don   t you remember .         no     said ridcully .      any kind of box .     said dibbler  in a voice choked with money .      oh  yes  but you have to stretch a wire inside it so the music has somewhere to live and ouch ouch ouch .         can   t think what   s come over me with these sudden muscular spasms     said ridcully     come  mr .  stibbons  let us not waste any more of mr .  dibbler   s valuable time .         oh  you   re not wasting it     said dibbler .     boxes full of music  eh .         we   ll take this one     said ridcully  snatching it up .     it   s an important magical experiment .      he frog marched ponder away  which was a little hard because the youth was bent double and wheezing .      what did you have to go   and do   that for .         mr .  stibbons  i know you to be a man who seeks to understand the universe .  here   s an important rule  never give a monkey the key to the banana plantation .  sometimes you can just see an accident waiting to   oh  no .      he let ponder go and waved vaguely up the street .      got any theories about that  young man .      something golden brown and viscous was oozing out onto the street from what was just possibly  behind the mounds of the stuff  a shop .  as the two wizards watched there was a tinkle of glass and the brown substance began to emerge from the second floor .   ridcully stamped forward and scooped up a handful  leaping back before the wall could reach him .  he sniffed at it .      is it some ghastly emanation from the dungeon dimensions .     said ponder .      shouldn   t think so .  smells like coffee     said ridcully .      coffee .         coffee flavored froth  anyway .  now  why is it i have this feeling that there   s going to be wizards in there somewhere .      a figure lurched out of the foam  dripping brown bubbles .      who goes there .     said ridcully .      ah  yes .  did anyone get the number of that oxcart .  another doughnut  if you would be so good .     said the figure brightly  and fell over into the froth .      that sounded like the bursar to me     said ridcully .     come along  lad .  it   s only bubbles .     he strode into the foam .  after a moment   s hesitation ponder realized that the honor of young wizardry was at stake  and pushed his way in behind him .   almost immediately he bumped into someone in the fog of bubbles .      er  hello .         who   s that .         it   s me  stibbons .  i   ve come to rescue you .         good .  which way is out .         er        there were some explosions somewhere in the coffee cloud and a popping noise .  ponder blinked .  the level of bubbles was sinking .   various pointy hats appeared like drowned logs in a drying lake .   ridcully waded over  coffee froth dripping from his hat .      something bloody stupid   s been going on here     he said     and i   m going to wait quite patiently until the dean owns up .         i don   t see why you should assume it was me     muttered a coffee colored column .      well  who was it  then .         the dean said the coffee ought to be frothy     said a mound of foam of a senior wranglish persuasion     and he did some simple magic and i rather think we got carried away .         ah  so it was you  dean .         yes  all right  but only by coincidence     said the dean testily .      out of here  all of you     said ridcully .     back to the university this minute .         i mean  i don   t see why you should assume it   s my fault just because sometimes it might happen to be me who        the froth had sunk a bit more  to reveal a pair of eyes under a dwarfish helmet .         scuse me     said a voice still under the bubbles     but who   s going to pay for all this .  that   s four dollars  thank you very much .         the bursar   s got the money     said ridcully quickly .      not anymore     said the senior wrangler .     he bought seventeen doughnuts .         sugar .     said ridcully .     you let him eat sugar .  you know that makes him  you know  a bit funny .  mrs .  whitlow said she   d give notice if we let him get anywhere near sugar again .     he herded the damp wizards toward the door .     it   s all right  my good man  you can trust us  we   re wizards  i shall have some money sent around in the morning .         hah  you expect me to believe that  do you .     said the dwarf .   it had been a long night .  ridcully turned and waved his hand at the wall .  there was a crackle of octarine fire and the words    iou   dolers    burned themselves into the stone .      right you are  no problem there     said the dwarf  ducking back into the froth .      i shouldn   t think mrs .  whitlow is going to worry     said the lecturer in recent runes as they squelched through the night .     i saw her and some of the maids at the  er  concert .  you know  the kitchen girls .  molly  polly and  er  dolly .  they were  er  screaming .         i didn   t think the music was that bad     said ridcully .      no  er  not in pain  er  i wouldn   t say that     said the lecturer in recent runes  beginning to go red     but  er  when the young man was waggling his hips like that           he definitely looks elvish to me     said ridcully .         er  i think she threw some of her  er  under   things onto the stage .      this silenced even ridcully  at least for a while .  every wizard was suddenly busy with his own private thoughts .      what  mrs .  whitlow .     the chair of indefinite studies began .      yes .         what  her    .         i  er  think so .      ridcully had once seen mrs .  whitlow   s washing line .  he   d been impressed .  he   d never believed there was so much pink elastic in the world .      what  really her    .     said the dean  his voice sounding as though it was coming from a long way away .      i   m  er  pretty sure .         sounds dangerous to me     said ridcully briskly .     could do someone a serious injury .  now then  you lot  back to the university right now for cold baths all round .         really her    .     said the chair of indefinite studies .  somehow  none of them felt able to leave the idea alone .      make yourself useful and find the bursar     snapped ridcully .     and i   d have you lot up in front of the university authorities first thing in the morning  if it wasn   t for the fact that you are the university authorities          foul ole ron  professional maniac and one of ankh morpork   s most industrious beggars  blinked in the gloom .  lord vetinari had excellent night vision .  and  unfortunately  a well developed sense of smell .      and then what happened .     he said  trying to keep his face turned away from the beggar .  because the fact was that although in actual size foul ole ron was a small hunched man in a huge grubby overcoat  in smell he filled the world .   in fact foul ole ron was a physical schizophrenic .  there was foul ole ron  and there was the smell of foul ole ron  which had obviously developed over the years to such an extent that it had a distinct personality .  anyone could have a smell that lingered long after they   d gone somewhere else  but the smell of foul ole ron could actually arrive somewhere several minutes before he did  in order to spread out and get comfortable before he arrived .  it had evolved into something so striking that it was no longer perceived with the nose  which shut down instantly in self defense  people could tell that foul ole ron was approaching by the way their earwax started to melt .      buggrit  buggrit  wrong side out  i told    em  buggrem        the patrician waited .  with foul ole ron you had to allow time for his wandering mind to get into the same vicinity as his tongue .         spyin    on me with magic  i told    em  bean soup  see here   and then everyone was dancing  you see  and then afterwards there were two of the wizards in the street and one of them was going on about catching the music in a box and mr .  dibbler was interested and then the coffeehouse exploded and they all went back to the university   buggrit  buggrit  buggrem  see if i don   t .         the coffeehouse exploded  did it .         frothy coffee all over the place  yerronner   bugg           yes  yes  and so on     said the patrician  waving a thin hand .     and that   s all you can tell me .         well   bug        foul ole ron caught the patrician   s eye and got a grip on himself .  even in his own highly individualized sanity he could tell when not to push his threadbare luck .  his smell wandered around the room  reading documents and examining the pictures .      they say     he said     that he drives all the women mad .     he leaned forward .  the patrician leaned back .     they say after he moved his hips like that   mrs .  whitlow threw her   wossnames   onto the stage .      the patrician raised an eyebrow .         wossnames    .         you know     foul ole ron moved his hands vaguely in the air .      a pair of pillow cases .  two sacks of flour .  some very baggy trou   oh .  i see .  my word .  were there any casualties .         dunno  yerronner .  but there   s something i do know .         yes .         uh   cumbling michael says yerronner sometimes pays for information    .         yes  i know  i can   t imagine how these rumors get about     said the patrician  getting up and opening a window .     i shall have to have something done about it .      once again  foul ole ron reminded himself that  while he was probably insane  he definitely wasn   t as mad as all that .      only i got this  yerronner     he said  pulling something out of the horrible recesses of his clothing .     it says writing on it  yerronner .      it was a poster  in glowing primary colors .  it couldn   t have been very old  but an hour or two as foul ole ron   s chest warmer had aged it considerably .  the patrician unfolded it with a pair of tweezers .      them   s the pictures of the music players     said foul ole ron helpfully .     and that   s writing .  and there   s more writing there  look .  mr .  dibbler had chalky the troll run    em off just now  but i nipped in after and threatened to breathe on everyone less   n they gives me one .         i   m sure that worked famously     said the patrician .   he lit a candle and read the poster carefully .  in the presence of foul ole ron  all candles burned with a blue edge to the flame .         free festival of music with rocks in it        he said .      that   s where you don   t have to pay to go in     said foul ole ron helpfully .     buggrem  buggrit .      lord vetinari read on .      in hide park .  next wednesday .  well  well .  a public open space  of course .  i wonder if there   ll be many people there .         lots  yerronner .  there was hundreds couldn   t get into the cavern .         and the band looks like that  do they .     said lord vetinari .     scowling like that .         sweating  most of the time i saw    em     said foul ole ron .         bee there or be a rectangular squar thynge        said the patrician .     this is some sort of occult code  do you think .         couldn   t say  yerronner     said foul ole ron .     my brain goes all slow when i   m thirsty .            they are totallye unable to bee seene .  and a longe way oute .        said lord vetinari solemnly .  he looked up .     oh  i am sorry     he said .     i   m sure i can find someone to give you a cool refreshing drink    .      foul ole ron coughed .  it had sounded like a perfectly sincere offer but  somehow  he was suddenly not at all thirsty .      don   t let me keep you  then .  thank you so very much     said lord vetinari .      er           yes .         er   nothing           very good .      when ron had buggrit  buggrit  buggrem   d down the stairs the patrician tapped his pen thoughtfully on the paper and stared at the wall .   the pen kept bouncing on the word free .   finally he rang a small bell .  a young clerk put his head around the door .      ah  drumknott     said lord vetinari .     just go and tell the head of the musicians    guild he wants a word with me  will you .         er   mr .  clete is already in the waiting room  your lordship     said the clerk .      does he by any chance have some kind of poster with him .         yes  your lordship .         and is he very angry .         this is very much the case  your lordship .  it   s about some festival .  he insists you have it stopped .         dear me .         and he demands that you see him instantly .         ah .  then leave him for  say  twenty minutes  then show him up .         yes  your lordship .  he keeps saying that he wants to know what you are doing about it .         good .  then i can ask him the same question .      the patrician sat back .  si non confectus  non reficiat .  that was the motto of the vetinaris .  everything worked if you just let it happen .   he picked up a stack of sheet music and began to listen to salami   s prelude to a nocturne on a theme by bubbla .   after a while he looked up .      don   t hesitate to leave     he snapped .  the smell slunk away .     squeak .      don   t be stupid .  all i did was frighten them off .  it   s not as though i hurt them .  what   s the good of having the power if you can   t use it .      the death of rats put his nose in his paws .  it was a lot easier  with rats .       c . m . o . t .  dibbler often did without sleep  too .  he generally had to meet chalky at night .  chalky was a large troll but tended to dry up and flake in daylight .   other trolls looked down on him because he came from a sedimentary family and was therefore a very low class troll indeed .  he didn   t mind .  he was a very amiable character .   he did odd jobs for people who needed something unusual in a hurry and without entanglements and had clinking money .  and this job was pretty odd .      just boxes .     he said .      with lids     said dibbler .     like this one i   ve made .  and a bit of wire stretched inside .      some people would have said    why .     or    what for .     but chalky didn   t make his money like that .  he picked up the box and turned it this way and that .      how many .     he said .      just ten to start with     said dibbler .     but i think there   ll be more later .  lots and lots more .         how many   s ten .     said the troll .   dibbler held up both hands  fingers extended .         ll do them for two dollar     said chalky .      you want me to cut my own throat .         two dollar .         dollar each for these and a dollar fifty for the next batch .         two dollar .         all right  all right  two dollars each .  that   s ten dollars the lot  right .         right .         and that   s cutting my own throat .      chalky tossed the box aside .  it bounced on the floor and the lid came off .   some time later a small greyish brown mongrel dog  on the prowl for anything edible  limped into the workshop and sat peering into the box for a while .   then it felt a bit of an idiot and wandered off .     ridcully hammered on the door of the high energy magic building as the city clocks were striking two .  he was supporting ponder stibbons  who was asleep on his feet .   ridcully was not a quick thinker .  but he always got there eventually .   the door opened and skazz   s hair appeared .      are you facin    me .     said ridcully .      yes  archchancellor .         let us in  then  the dew   s soaking through me boots .      ridcully looked around as he helped ponder in .      wish i knew what it was that keeps you lads working all hours     he said .     i never found magic that interesting when i was a lad .  go and fetch some coffee for mr .  stibbons here  will you .  and then get your friends .      skazz bustled off and ridcully was left alone  except for the slumbering ponder .      what is it they do .     he said .  he never really tried to find out .   skazz had been working at a long bench by one wall .   at least he recognized the little wooden disc .  there were small oblong stones ranged on it in a couple of concentric circles  and a candle lantern positioned on a swiveling arm so that it could be moved anywhere around the circumference .   it was a traveling computer for druids  a sort of portable stone circle  something they called a    kneetop .     the bursar had sent off for one once .  it had said for the priest in a hurry on the box .  he   d never been able to make it work properly and now it was used as a doorstop .  ridcully couldn   t see what they had to do with magic .  after all  it wasn   t much more than a calendar and you could get a perfectly good calendar for  p .   rather more puzzling was the huge array of glass tubes behind it .  that was where skazz had been working  there was a litter of bent glassware and jars and bits of cardboard where the student had been sitting .   the tubing seemed to be alive .   ridcully leaned forward .   it was full of ants .   they scuttled along the tubing and through complex little spirals in their thousands .  in the silence of the room  their bodies made a faint  continuous rustling .   there was a slot level with the archchancellor   s eyes .  the word    in    was written on a piece of paper that had been pasted onto the glass .   and on the bench was an oblong card which looked just the right shape to go in the slot .  it had round holes punched in it .   there were two round holes  then a whole pattern of round holes  and then a further two holes .  on it  in pencil  someone had scribbled          .      ridcully was the kind of man who   d push any lever  just to see what it did .   he put the card in the obvious slot     there was an immediate change in the rustling .  ants trailed in their thousands through the tubing .  some of them appeared to be carrying seeds     there was a small dull sound and a card dropped out of the other end of the glass maze .   it had four holes in it .   ridcully was still staring at it when ponder came up behind him  rubbing his eyes .         s our ant counter     he said .      two plus two equals four     said ridcully .     well  well  i never knew that .         it can do other sums as well .         you tellin    me ants can count .         oh  no .  not individual ants   it   s a bit hard to explain   the holes in the cards  you see  block up some tubes and let them through others and       ponder sighed     we think it might be able to do other things .         like what .     ridcully demanded .      er  that   s what we   re trying to find out           you   re trying to find out .  who built it .         skazz .         and now you   re trying to find out what it does .         well  we think it might be able to do quite complicated math .  if we can get enough bugs in it .      ants were still bustling around the enormous crystalline structure .      had a rat thingy  a gerbil or something  when i was a lad     said ridcully  giving up in the face of the incomprehendable .     spent all the time on a treadmill .  round and round  all night long .  this is a bit like that  yes .         in very broad terms     said ponder carefully .      had an ant farm  too     said ridcully  thinking faraway thoughts .     the little devils never could plow straight .     he pulled himself together .     anyway  get the rest of your chums here right now .         what for .         a bit of a tutorial     said ridcully .      aren   t we going to examine the music .         in good time     said ridcully .     but first  we   re going to talk to someone .         who .         i   m not sure     said ridcully .     we   ll know when he turns up .  or her .        glod looked at their suite .  the hotel owner had just left  after going through the    dis is der window  it really opens  dis is der pump  you get water out of it wit der handle here  dis is me waiting for some money    routine .      well  that just about does it .  that just about puts the iron helmet on it  that does     he said     we play music with rocks in all evening  and we   ve got a room that looks like this .         it   s homely     said cliff .     looks  trolls don   t have much to do with der frills of life        glod looked toward his feet .      it   s on the floor and it   s soft     he said .     silly me for thinking it was a carpet .  someone fetch me a broom .  no  someone fetch me a shovel .  then someone fetch me a broom .         it   ll do     said buddy .   he put down his guitar and stretched out on the wooden slab that was apparently one of the beds .      cliff     said glod     can i have a word .      he jerked a stubby thumb at the door .   they conferred on the landing .      it   s getting bad     said glod .      yep .         he hardly says a word now when he   s not onstage .         yep .         ever met a zombie .         i know a golem .  mr .  dorfl down in long hogmeat .         him .  he   s a genuine zombie .         yep .  got a holy word on his head  i seen it .         yuk .  really .  i buy sausages from him .         anyway   what about zombies .            you couldn   t tell from the taste  i thought he was a really good sausage maker           what was you saying about zombies .            funny how you can know someone for years and then find out they   ve got feet of clay           zombies       said cliff patiently .      what .  oh .  yes .  i mean he acts like one .     glod recalled some of the zombies in ankh morpork .     at least  like zombies are supposed to act .         yep .  i know what you mean .         and we both know why .         yep .  er .  why .         the guitar .         oh  dat .  yeah .         when we   re onstage  that thing is in charge        in the silence of the room  the guitar lay in the dark by buddy   s bed and its strings vibrated gently to the sound of the dwarf   s voice        okay  so what do we do about it .     said cliff .      it   s made of wood .  ten seconds with an ax  no more problem .         i   m not sure .  dat ain   t no ordinary instrument .         he was a nice kid when we met him .  for a human     said glod .      so what do we do .  i don   t think we could get it off him .         maybe we could get him to        the dwarf paused .  he was aware of a fuzzy echo to his voice .      that damn thing is listening to us .     he hissed .     let   s go outside .      they ended up out in the road .      can   t see how it can listen     said cliff .     an instrument   s for listening to .         the strings listen     said glod  flatly .     that is not an ordinary instrument .      cliff shrugged .     dere   s one way we could find out     he said .     early morning fog filled the streets .  around the university it was sculpted into curious forms by the slight magical background radiation .  strangely shaped things moved across the damp cobbles .   two of them were glod and cliff .      right     said the dwarf .     here we are .      he looked up at a blank wall .      i knew it .     he said .     didn   t i say .  magic .  how many times have we heard this story .  there   s a mysterious shop no one   s ever seen before  and someone goes in and buys some rusty old curio  and it turns out to           glod              some kind of talisman or a bottle full of genie  and then when there   s trouble they go back and the shop           glod    .            has mysteriously disappeared and gone back to whatever dimension it came from   yes  what is it .         you   re on der wrong side of der road .  it   s over here .      glod glared at the blank wall  and then turned and stomped across the road .      it was a mistake anyone could have made .         yep .         it doesn   t invalidate anything i said .      glod rattled the door and  to his surprise  found it was unlocked .      it   s gone two in the morning .  what kind of music shop is open at two in the morning .     glod struck a match .   the dusty graveyard of old instruments loomed around them .  it looked as though a number of prehistoric animals had been caught in a flash flood and then fossilized .      what   s dat one dat looks like a serpent .     whispered cliff .      it   s called a serpent .      glod was uneasy .  he   d spent most of his life as a musician .  he hated the sight of dead instruments  and these were dead .  they didn   t belong to anyone .  no one played them .  they were like bodies without life  people without souls .  something they had contained had gone .  every one of them represented a musician down on his luck .   there was a pool of light in a grove of bassoons .  the old lady was deeply asleep in a rocking chair  with a tangle of knitting on her lap and a shawl around her shoulders .      glod .      glod jumped .     yes .  what .         why are we here .  we know the place exists now           grab some ceiling  hooligans .      glod blinked at the crossbow bolt pricking the end of his nose  and raised his hands .  the old lady had gone from asleep to firing stance apparently without passing through any intermediate stage .      this is the best i can do     he said .     er   the door wasn   t locked  you see  and           so you thought you could rob a poor defenseless old lady .         not at all  not at all  in fact we           i belongs to the neighborhood witch scheme  i do .  one word from me and you   ll be hopping around looking for some princess with an amphibian fixation           i think dis has gone far enough     said cliff .  he reached down and his huge hand closed over the bow .  he squeezed .  bits of wood oozed between his fingers .      we   re quite harmless     he said .     we   ve come about der instrument you sold our friend last week .         are you the watch .      glod bowed .      no  ma   am .  we   re musicians .         that   s supposed to make me feel better  is it .  what instrument are you talking about .         a kind of guitar .      the old woman put her head on one side .  her eyes narrowed .      i won   t take it back  you know     she said .     it was sold fair   n square .  good working condition  too .         we just want to know where you got it from .         never got it from nowhere     said the old lady .     it   s always been here .  don   t blow that .      glod nearly dropped the flute he   d nervously picked up from the debris .         or we   ll be knee deep in rats     said the old lady .  she turned back to cliff .     it   s always been here     she repeated .      it   s got a one chalked on it     said glod .      it   s always been here     said the woman .     ever since i   ve had the shop .         who brought it in .         how should i know .  i never asks them their name .  people don   t like that .  they just gets the number .      glod looked at the flute .  there was a yellowing tag attached to it  on which the number     had been scrawled .   he stared along the shelves behind the makeshift counter .  there was a pink conch shell .  that had a number on it  too .  he moistened his lips and reached out        if you blow that  you   d just better have a sacrificial virgin and a big cauldron of breadfruit and turtle meat standing by     said the old lady .   there was a trumpet next to it .  it looked amazingly untarnished .      and this one .     he said .     it   ll make the world end and the sky fall on me if i give it a tootle  will it .         interesting you should say that     said the old lady .   glod lowered his hand  and then something else caught his eye .      good grief     he said     is that still here .  i   d forgotten about that           what   s it .     said cliff  and then looked where glod was pointing .      that .         we   ve got some money .  why not .         yeah .  it might help .  but you know what buddy said .  we   d never be able to find           it   s a big city .  if you can   t find it in ankh morpork  you can   t find it anywhere .      glod picked up half a drumstick and looked thoughtfully at a gong half buried in a pile of music stands .      i shouldn   t     said the old lady .     not if you don   t want     skeletal warriors springing out of the earth .      glod pointed .      we   ll take this .         two dollars .         hey  why should we pay anything .  it   s not as though it   s yours           pay up     said cliff  with a sigh .     don   t negotiate .      glod handed over the money with bad grace  snatched the bag the old lady gave him  and strutted out of the shop .      fascinating stock you have here     said cliff  staring at the gong .   the old lady shrugged .      my friend   s a bit annoyed because he thought you one of dose mysterious shops you hear about in folk tales     cliff went on .     you know  here today and gone tomorrow .  he was looking for you on der other side of der road  haha .         sounds daft to me     said the old lady  in a voice to discourage any further unseemly levity .   cliff glanced at the gong again  shrugged  and followed glod .   the woman waited until their footsteps had died away in the fog .   then she opened the door and peered up and down the street .  apparently satisfied by its abundance of emptiness  she went back to her counter and reached for a curious lever underneath .  her eyes glowed green for a moment .      forget my own head next     she said  and pulled .   there was a grinding of hidden machinery .   the shop vanished .  a moment later  it reappeared on the other side of the road .     buddy lay looking at the ceiling .   how did food taste .  it was hard to remember .  he   d eaten meals over the last few days  he must have done  but he couldn   t remember the taste .  he couldn   t remember much of anything  except the playing .  glod and the rest of them sounded as if they were talking through a thick gauze .   asphalt had wandered off somewhere .   he swung himself off the hard bed and padded over to the window .   the shades of ankh morpork were just visible in the grey  cheap rate light before dawn .  a breeze blew in through the open window .   when he turned around  there was a young woman standing in the middle of the floor .   she put her finger to her lips .      don   t go shouting to the little troll     she said .     he   s downstairs having some supper .  anyway  he wouldn   t be able to see me .         are you my muse .      susan frowned .      i think i know what you mean     she said .     i   ve seen pictures .  there were eight of them  led by   um   cantaloupe .  they   re supposed to inspire artists .  the ephebians believe they inspire musicians and artists  but of course they don   t exi       she paused  and made a conscientious correction .     at least  i   ve never met them .  my name   s susan .  i   m here because        her voice trailed away .      cantaloupe .     said buddy .     i   m pretty sure it wasn   t cantaloupe .         whatever .         how did you get in here .         i   m   look  sit down .  right .  well   you know how some things   like the muses  as you said   people think that some things are represented by people .      a look of temporary understanding informed buddy   s perplexed features .      like the hogfather representing the spirit of the midwinter festival .     he said .      right .  well   i   m sort of in that business     said susan .     it doesn   t exactly matter what i do .         you mean you   re not human .         oh  yes .  but i   m   doing a job .  i suppose thinking of me as a muse is probably as good as anything .  and i   m here to warn you .         a muse for music with rocks in .         not really  but listen   hey  are you all right .         don   t know .         you looked all washed out .  listen .  the music is dangerous        buddy shrugged .     oh  you mean the guild of musicians .  mr .  dibbler says not to worry about that .  we   re leaving the city for        susan stamped forward and picked up the guitar .      i mean this .      the strings moved and whined under her hand .      don   t touch that .         it   s taken you over     said susan  throwing it onto the bed .  buddy grabbed it and played a chord .      i know what you   re going to say     he said .     everyone says it .  the other two think it   s evil .  but it   s not .         it might not be evil but it   s not right .  not here  not now .         yes  but i can handle it .         you can   t handle it .  it handles you .         anyway  who are you to tell me all this .  i don   t have to take lessons from a tooth fairy .         listen  it   ll kill you .  i   m sure of it .         so i   m supposed to stop playing  then .      susan hesitated .      well  not exactly   because then           well  i don   t have to listen to mysterious occult women .  you probably don   t even exist .  so you can just fly back to your magic castle  okay .      susan was temporarily speechless .  she was reconciled to the irredeemable dumbness of most of mankind  particularly the section of it that stood upright and shaved in the mornings  but she was also affronted .  no one had ever talked to death like this .  at least  not for long .      all right     she said  reaching out and touching his arm .     but you   ll see me again  and   and you won   t like it much .  because  let me tell you  i happen to be        her expression changed .  she felt the sensation of falling backward while standing still  the room drifted past her and away into darkness  pinwheeling around buddy   s horrified face .   the darkness exploded  and there was light .   dribbly candle light .     buddy waved his hand through the empty space where susan had been .      are you still here .  where did you go .  who are you .        cliff looked around .      thought i heard something     he muttered .     here  you do know  don   t you  dat some of dose instruments weren   t just ordin           i know     said glod .     i wish i   d had a go on the rat pipe .  i   m hungry again .         i mean dey were mythi           yes .         so how come dey end up in a secondhand music shop .         ain   t you ever hocked your stones .         oh  sure     said cliff .     everyone does some time or other  you know dat .  sometimes it   s all you   ve got if you want to see another meal .         there you are  then .  you said it .  it   s something every working musician   s going to do sooner or later .         yeah  but der thing dat buddy   i mean  it   s got der number one on it           yes .      glod peered up at a street sign .         cunning artificers        he said .     here we are .  look  half the workshops are still open even at this time of night .     he shifted the sack .  something cracked inside it .     you knock that side  i   ll knock this .         yeah  all right   but i mean  number one .  even der conch shell was number fifty two .  who used to own der guitar .         don   t know     said glod  knocking on the first door     but i hope they never come back for it .           and that     said ridcully     is the rite of ashkente .  quite easily done .  you have to use a fresh egg  though .      susan blinked .   there was a circle drawn on the floor .  strange unearthly shapes surrounded it  although when she adjusted her mind set she realized that these were perfectly ordinary students .      who are you .     she said .     what   s this place .  let me go this instant .      she strode across the circle and rebounded from an invisible wall .   the students were staring at her in the manner of those who had heard of the species    female    but had never expected to get this close to one .      i demand that you let me go .     she glared at ridcully .     aren   t you the wizard i saw last night .         that   s right     said ridcully .     and this is the rite of ashkente .  it calls death into the circle and he   or as it may be  in this case  she   can   t leave until we say so .  there   s a lot of stuff in this book here spelled with funny long esses and it goes on about abjuring and conjuration but it   s all show  really .  once you   re in  you   re in .  i must say your predecessor   hah  bit of a pun there   was a lot more gracious about it .      susan glared .  the circle played tricks with her ideas of space .  it seemed most unfair .      why have you summoned me  then .     she said .      that   s better .  that   s more according to the script     said ridcully .     we are allowed to ask you questions  you see .  and you have to answer them .  truthfully .         well .         would you like to sit down .  a glass of something .         no .         just as you like .  this new music   tell us about it .         you summoned death to ask that .         i   m not sure who we   ve summoned     said ridcully .     it is really alive .         i   think so .         does it live anywhere .         it seems to have lived in one instrument but i think it   s moving around now .  can i go .         no .  can it be killed .         i don   t know .         should it be here .         what .         should it be here .     ridcully repeated patiently .     is it something that   s supposed to be happening .      susan suddenly felt important .  wizards were rumored to be wise   in fact  that   s where the word came from .   but they were asking her things .  they were listening to her .  pride sparkled in her eyes .      i   don   t think so .  it   s turned up here by some kind of accident .  this isn   t the right world for it .      ridcully looked smug .     that   s what i thought .  this isn   t right  i said .  it   s making people try and be things they aren   t .  how can we stop it .         i don   t think you can .  it   s not susceptible to magic .         right .  music   s not .  any music .  but something must be able to make it stop .  show her your box  ponder .         er   yes .  here .      he lifted the lid .  music  slightly tinny but still recognizable  drifted out into the room .      sounds like a spider trapped in a matchbox  don   t it .     said ridcully .      you can   t reproduce music like that on a piece of wire in a box     said susan .     it   s against nature .      ponder looked relieved .      that   s what i said     he said .     but it does it anyway .  it wants to .      susan stared at the box .   she began to smile .  there was no humor in it .      it   s unsettling people     said ridcully .     and   look at this .     he pulled a roll of paper out of his robe and unfolded it .     caught some lad trying to paste this onto our gates .  blooming cheek .  so i took it off him and told him to hop it  which was     ridcully looked smugly at his fingertips     quite appropriate as it turned out .  it   s going on about some festival of music with rocks in .  it   ll all end with monsters from another dimension breaking through  you can rely on that .  that   s the sort of thing that happens a lot in these parts .         excuse me     said big mad adrian  his voice cargoed with suspicion .     i don   t want to cause any trouble  right  but is this death or not .  i   ve seen pictures  and they didn   t look like her .         we did the rite stuff     said ridcully .     and this is what we got .         yes  but my father   s a herring fisherman and he doesn   t just find herring in his herring nets     said skazz .      yeah .  she could be anyone     said tez the terrible .     i thought death was taller and bonier .         she   s just some girl messing about     said skazz .   susan stared at them .      she hasn   t even got a scythe     said tez .   susan concentrated .  the scythe appeared in her hands  its blue edged blade making a noise like a finger dragged around the rim of a glass .   the students straightened up .      but i   ve always thought it was time for a change     said tez .      right .  it   s about time girls got a chance in the professions     said skazz .      don   t you dare patronize me .         that   s right     said ponder .     there   s no reason why death has to be male .  a woman could be almost as good as a man in the job .         you   re doing it very well     said ridcully .   he gave susan an encouraging smile .   she rounded on him .  i   m death  she thought   technically  anyway   and this is a fat old man who has no right to give me any kind of orders .  i   ll glare at him  and he   ll soon realize the gravity of his situation .  she glared .      young lady     said ridcully .     would you care for breakfast .        the mended drum seldom closed .  there tended to be a lull around six in the morning  but hibiscus stayed open so long as someone wanted a drink .   someone wanted a lot of drinks .  someone indistinct was standing at the bar .  sand seemed to be running out of him and  insofar as hibiscus could tell  he had a number of arrows of klatchian manufacture sticking in him .   the barman leaned forward .      have i seen you before .      i   m in here quite often  yes .  a week last wednesday  for example .      ha .  that was a bit of a do .  that   s when poor old vince got stabbed .      yes .      asking for it  calling yourself vincent the invulnerable .      yes .  inaccurate  too .      the watch are saying it was suicide .      death nodded .  going into the mended drum and calling yourself vincent the invulnerable was clearly suicide by ankh morpork standards .   this drink   s got maggots in it .   the barman squinted at it .      that   s not a maggot  sir     he said .     that   s a worm .      oh .  that   s better  is it .      it   s supposed to be there  sir .  that   s mexical  that is .  they put the worm in to show how strong it is .      strong enough to drown worms .   the barman scratched his head .  he   d never thought of it in those terms .      it   s just something people drink     he said vaguely .   death picked up the bottle and held it up to what normally would have been eye level .  the worm rotated forlornly .   what   s it like .  he said .      well  it   s a sort of        i wasn   t talking to you .        breakfast .     said susan     i mean   breakfast .         it must be coming up to that time     said the archchancellor .     it   s a long time since i last had breakfast with a charming young woman .         good grief  you   re all just as bad as each other     said susan .      very well  scratch charming     said ridcully evenly .     but the sparrows are coughin    in the trees and the sun is peepin    over the wall and i smell cookin     and having a meal with death is a chance that doesn   t happen to everyone .  you don   t play chess  do you .         extremely well     said susan  still bewildered .      thought as much .  all right  you fellows .  you can go back to prodding the universe .  will you step this way  madam .         i can   t leave the circle .         oh  you can if i invite you .  it   s all a matter of courtesy .  i don   t know if you   ve ever had the concept explained .      he reached out and took her hand .  she hesitated  then stepped across the chalk line .  there was a slight tingling feeling .   the students backed away hurriedly .      go on  get on with it     said ridcully .     this way  madam .      susan had never experienced charm before .  ridcully possessed quite a lot of it  in a twinkly eyed kind of way .   she followed him across the lawns to the great hall .   the breakfast tables had been laid out  but they were unoccupied .  the big sideboard had sprouted copper tureens like autumn fungi .  three rather young maids were waiting patiently behind the array .      we tend to help ourselves     said ridcully conversationally  lifting a cover .     waiters and so on make too much nois   this is some sort of a joke  is it .      he prodded what was under the cover and beckoned the nearest maid .      which one are you .     he said .     molly  polly  or dolly .         molly  your lordship     said the maid  dropping a curtsy and trembling slightly .     is there something wrong .         a wrong wrong wrong wrong  a do wrong wrong     said the other two maids .      what happened to the kippers .  what   s this .  looks like a beef patty in a bun     said ridcully  staring at the girls .      mrs .  whitlow gave instructions to the cook     said molly nervously .     it   s a              yay yay yay              it   s a burger .         you   re telling me     said ridcully .     and why   ve you got a beehive made of hair on your head  pray .  makes you look like a matchstick .         please sir  we           you went to see the music with rocks in concert  did you .         yes  sir .         yay  yay .         you  er  you didn   t throw anything on the stage  did you .         no  sir .         where   s mrs .  whitlow .         in bed with a cold  sir .         not at all surprised .     ridcully turned to susan .     people are playing silly burgers  i   m afraid .         i eat only muesli at breakfast     said susan .      there   s porridge     said ridcully .     we do it for the bursar because it   s not exciting .     he lifted the lid of a tureen .     yes  still here     he said .     there   s some things music with rocks in can   t change  and one of them   s porridge .  let me help you to a ladleful .      they sat on either side of the long table .      well  isn   t this nice     ridcully said .      are you laughing at me .     said susan suspiciously .      not at all .  in my experience  what you mostly get in herring nets is herring .  but  speaking as a mortal   a customer  as you might say   i   m interested to know why death is suddenly a teenage girl instead of the animate natomy we   ve come to know and   know .         natomy .         another word for skeleton .  probably derived from    anatomy .            he   s my grandfather .         ah .  yes  you said .  and that   s true  is it .         it sounds a bit silly now i come to tell someone else .      ridcully shook his head .      you should do my job for five minutes .  then tell me about silly     he said .  he took a pencil out of his pocket and cautiously lifted the top half of the bun on his plate .      there   s cheese in this     he said  accusingly .      but he   s gone off somewhere and next thing i know i   ve inherited the whole thing .  i mean  i didn   t ask for it .  why me .  having to go around with this silly scythe thing   that   s not what i wanted out of life           it   s certainly not something you get careers leaflets about     said ridcully .      exactly .         and i suppose you   re stuck with it .     said ridcully .      we don   t know where he   s gone .  albert says he   s very depressed about something but he won   t say what .         dear me .  what could depress death .         albert seems to think he might do something   silly .         oh  dear .  not too silly .  i hope .  could that be possible .  it   d be   morticide  i suppose .  or cidicide .      to susan   s amazement ridcully patted her hand .      but i   m sure we   ll all sleep safer in our beds knowing that you   re in charge     he said .      it   s all so untidy .  good people dying stupidly  bad people living to a ripe old age   it   s so disorganized .  there   s no sense to it .  there   s no justice at all .  i mean  there   s this boy           what boy .      to susan   s horror and amazement she found that she was blushing .     just some boy     she said .     he was supposed to have died quite ridiculously  and i was going to save him  and then the music saved him  and now it   s getting him into all sorts of trouble and i   ve got to save him anyway and i don   t know why .         music .     said ridcully .     does he play a sort of guitar .         yes .  how did you know .      ridcully sighed .     when you   re a wizard you get an instinct for these things .     he prodded his burger some more .     and lettuce  for some reason .  and one very  very thin slice of pickled cucumber .     he let the bread drop .      the music is alive     he said .   something that had been knocking on susan   s attention for the past ten minutes finally used its boots .      oh  my god     she said .      which one would that be .     said ridcully politely .      it   s so simple .  it strolls into traps .  it changes people .  they want to play m   i   ve got to go     said susan hurriedly .     er .  thank you for the porridge           you haven   t eaten any of it     ridcully pointed out mildly .      no  but   but i had a really good look at it .      she vanished .  after a little while ridcully leaned forward and waved his hand vaguely in the space where she had been sitting  just in case .   then he reached into his robe and pulled out the poster about the free festival .  great big things with tentacles  that was the problem .  get enough magic in one place and the fabric of the universe gave at the heel just like one of the dean   s socks which  ridcully noticed  had been in some extremely bright colors the last few days .   he waved a hand at the maids .      thank you  molly  dolly  or polly     he said .     you can clear this stuff away .         yay yay .         yes  yes  thank you .      ridcully felt rather alone .  he   d quite enjoyed talking to the girl .  she seemed to be the only person in the place who wasn   t mildly insane or totally preoccupied with something that he  ridcully  didn   t understand .   he wandered back to his study  but was distracted by the sounds of hammering coming from the dean   s chambers .  the door was ajar .   the senior wizards had quite large suites that included a study  workshop  and bedroom .  the dean was hunched over the furnace in the workshop area  with a smoked glass mask over his face and a hammer in his hand .  he was hard at work .  there were sparks .   this was much more cheering  ridcully thought .  maybe this was an end to all this music with rocks in nonsense and a return to some real magic .      everythin    all right  dean .     he said .   the dean pushed up the glass and nodded .      nearly finished  archchancellor     he said .      heard you bangin    away right down the passage     said ridcully  conversationally .      ah .  i   m working on the pockets     said the dean .   ridcully looked blank .  quite a number of the more difficult spells involved heat and hammering  but pockets was a new one .   the dean held up a pair of trousers .   they were not  strictly speaking  as trousery as normal trousers  senior wizards developed a distinctive       waist        leg shape that suggested someone who sat on a wall and required royal assistance to be put together again .  they were dark blue .      you were hammerin    them .     said ridcully .     mrs .  whitlow been heavy on the starch again .      he looked closer .      you   re rivetin    them together .      the dean beamed .      these trousers     he said     are where it   s at .         are you talkin    music with rocks in again .     said ridcully suspiciously .      i mean they   re cool .         well  better than a thick robe in this weather     ridcully conceded     but   you   re not going to put them on now  are you .         why not .     said the dean  struggling out of his robe .      wizards in trousers .  not in my university .  it   s sissy .  people   d laugh     said ridcully .      you always try and stop me doing anything i want .         there   s no need to take that tone with me           huh  you never listen to anything i say and i don   t see why i shouldn   t wear what i like .      ridcully glared around the room .      this room is a total mess .     he bellowed .     tidy it up right now .         sharn   t .         then it   s no more music with rocks in for you  young man .      ridcully slammed the door behind him .   he slammed it open again and added     and i never gave you permission to paint it black .      he slammed the door shut .   he slammed it open .      they don   t suit you  either .      the dean rushed out into the passage  waving his hammer .      say what you like     he shouted .     when history comes to name these  they certainly won   t call them archchancellors .          it was eight in the morning  a time when drinkers are trying either to forget who they are or remember where they live .  the other occupants of the mended drum were hunched over their drinks around the walls and watching an orang utan  who was playing barbarian invaders and screaming with rage every time he lost a penny .   hibiscus really wanted to shut .  on the other hand  it   d be like blowing up a gold mine .  it was all he could do to keep up the supply of clean glasses .      have you forgotten yet .     he said .   it appears i have only forgotten one thing .      what   s that .  hah  silly of me to ask really  seeing as you   ve forgotten        i have forgotten how to get drunk .   the barman looked at the rows and rows of glasses .  there were wineglasses .  there were cocktail glasses .  there were beer mugs .  there were steins in the shape of jolly fat men .  there was a bucket .      i think you   re on the right lines     he hazarded .   the stranger picked up his most recent glass and wandered over to the barbarian invaders machine .   it was made of clockwork of a complex and intricate design .  there was a suggestion of many gears and worm drives in the big mahogany cabinet under the game  the whole function of which appeared to be to make rows of rather crudely carved barbarian invaders jerk and wobble across a rectangular proscenium .  the player  by means of a system of levers and pulleys  operated a small  self loading catapult that moved below the invaders .  this shot small pellets upward .  at the same time the invaders  by means of a ratchet and pawl mechanism  dropped small metal arrows .  periodically a bell rang and an invader on horseback oscillated hesitantly across the top of the game  dropping spears .  the whole assemblage rattled and creaked continuously  partly because of all the machinery and partly because the orang utan was wrenching both handles  jumping up and down on the fire pedal  and screaming at the top of his voice .      i wouldn   t have it in the place     said the barman behind him .     but it   s popular with the customers  you see .      one customer  anyway .      well  it   s better than the fruit machine  at least .      yes .      he ate all the fruit .      there was a screech of rage from the direction of the machine .   the barman sighed .     you wouldn   t think anyone   d make so much fuss over a penny  would you .      the ape slammed a dollar coin on the counter and went away with two handfuls of change .  one penny in a slot allowed a very large lever to be pulled  miraculously  all the barbarians rose from the dead and began their wobbly invasion again .      he poured his drink into it     said the barman .     it may be my imagination  but i think they   re wobbling a bit more now .      death watched the game for a while .  it was one of the most depressing things he   d ever seen .  the things were going to get down to the bottom of the game anyway .  why shoot things at them .   why    .   he waved his glass at the assembled drinkers .   d   you .  d   you .  thing is  d   you know what it   s like  eh  having a memory so good  right  so good you even remember what hasn   t happened yet .  that   s me .  oh  yes .  right enough .  as though .  as though .  as though there   s no future   only the past that hasn   t happened yet .  and .  and .  and .  you have to do things anyway .  you know what   s going to happen and you have to do things .   he looked around at the faces .  people in the drum were used to alcoholic lectures  but not ones like this .   you see .  you shee .  you see stuff looming up like iceberg things ahead but you mustn   t do anything about it because   because   becauseitsalaw .  can   t break the law .     scotabealaw .   see this glass  right .  see it .     s like memory .  onnacounta if you put more stuff in  more stuff flows out  right .     s fact .  everyonegotta memory like this .     s what keep humans from going iss   ish   insh   mad .     cept me .  poorole me .  i remember everything .  as if it happened only tomorrow .  everything .   he looked down at his drink .   ah  he said  funny how things come back to you  isn   t it .   it was the most impressive collapse the bar had ever seen .  the tall dark stranger fell backward slowly  like a tree .  there was no sissy sagging of the knees  no cop out bouncing off a table on the way down .  he simply went from vertical to horizontal in one marvelous geometric sweep .   several people applauded as he hit the floor .  then they searched his pockets  or at least made an effort to search his pockets but couldn   t find any .  and then they threw him into the river .       in the giant black study of death one candle burned  and got no shorter .   susan leafed frantically through the books .   life wasn   t simple .  she knew that  it was the knowledge  which went with the job .  there was the simple life of living things but that was  well   simple     there were other kinds of life .  cities had life .  anthills and swarms of bees had life  a whole greater than the sum of the parts .  worlds had life .  gods had a life made up of the belief of their believers .   the universe danced toward life .  life was a remarkably common commodity .  anything sufficiently complicated seemed to get cut in for some  in the same way that anything massive enough got a generous helping of gravity .  the universe had a definite tendency toward awareness .  this suggested a certain subtle cruelty woven into the very fabric of space time .   perhaps even a music could be alive  if it was old enough .  life is a habit .   people said  i can   t get that darn tune out of my head .   not just a beat  but a heartbeat .   and anything alive wants to breed .     c . m . o . t .  dibbler liked to be up at first light  in case there was an opportunity to sell a worm to the early bird .   he had set up a desk in the corner of one of chalky   s workshops .  he was  by and large  against the idea of a permanent office .  on the positive side it made him easier to find  but on the negative side  it made him easier to find .  the success of dibbler   s commercial strategy hinged on him being able to find customers  not the other way round .   quite a large number of people seemed to have found him this morning .  many of them were holding guitars .      right     he said to asphalt  whose flat head was just visible over the top of the makeshift desk .     all understood .  it   ll take you two days to get to pseudopolis and then you report to mr .  klopstock at the bull pit .  and i   ll want receipts for everything .         yes  mr .  dibbler .         it   ll be a good idea to get away from the city for a bit .         yes  mr .  dibbler .         did i already say i wanted receipts for everything .         yes  mr .  dibbler     sighed asphalt .      off you go  then .     dibbler ignored the troll and beckoned to a group of dwarfs who   d been hanging around patiently .     okay  you lot  come over here .  so you want to be music with rocks in stars  do you .         yes  sir .         then listen here to what i say        asphalt looked at the money .  it wasn   t much to feed four people for several days .  behind him  the interview continued .      so what do you call yourselves .         er   dwarfs  mr .  dibbler     said the lead dwarf .         dwarfs    .         yes  sir .         why .         because we are  mr .  dibbler     said the lead dwarf patiently .      no  no  no .  that won   t do .  that won   t do at all .  you gotta have a name with a bit of      dibbler waved his hands in the air      with a bit of music with rocks in   uh   in .  not just    dwarfs .     you gotta be   oh  i don   t know   something more interesting .         but we   re certainly dwarfs     said one of the dwarfs .         we   re certainly dwarfs        said dibbler .     yes  that might work .  okay .  i can book you in at the bunch of grapes on thursday .  and into the free festival  of course .  since it   s free  you don   t get paid  of course .         we   ve written this song     said the head dwarf  hopefully .      good  good     said dibbler  scribbling on his notepad .      it   s called    something   s gotten into my beard .            good .         don   t you want to hear it .      dibbler looked up .      hear it .  i   d never get anything done if i went around listening to music .  off you go .  see you next wednesday .  next .  you all trolls .         dat   s right .      in this case  dibbler decided not to argue .  trolls were a lot bigger than dwarfs .      all right .  but you   ve got to spell it with a z .  trollz .  yep  looks good .  mended drum  friday .  and the free festival .  yes .         we   ve done a song           good for you .  next .         it   s us  mr .  dibbler .      dibbler looked at jimbo  noddy  crash  and scum .      you   ve got a nerve     he said .     after last night .         we got a bit carried away     said crash .     we was wondering if we could have another chance .         you did say the audience loved us     said noddy .      loathed you .  i said the audience loathed you     said dibbler .     two of you kept looking at blert wheedown   s guitar primer .         we   ve changed our name     said jimbo .     we thought  well  insanity was a bit daft  it   s not a proper name for a serious band that   s pushing back the boundaries of musical expression and is definitely going to be big one day .         thursday     nodded noddy .      so now we   re suck     said crash .   dibbler gave them a long  cool look .  bear baiting  bull harassing  dog fighting  and sheep worrying were currently banned in ankh morpork  although the patrician did permit the unrestricted hurling of rotten fruit at anyone suspected of belonging to a street theater group .  there was perhaps an opening .      all right     he said .     you can play at the festival .  after that   we   ll see .      after all  he thought  there was a possibility that they   d still be alive .     a figure climbed slowly and unsteadily out of the ankh onto a jetty by the misbegot bridge  and stood for a moment as mud dripped off him and formed a puddle under the planks .   the bridge was quite high .  there were buildings on it  lining it on both sides so that the actual roadway was quite cramped .  the bridges were quite popular as building sites  because they had a very convenient sewage system and  of course  a source of fresh water .   there was the red eye of a fire in the shadows under the bridge .  the figure staggered toward the light .   the dark shapes around it turned and squinted into the gloom  trying to fathom the nature of the visitor .        it   s a farm cart     said glod .     i know a farm cart when i see one .  even if it is painted blue .  and it   s all battered .         it   s all you can afford     said asphalt .     anyway  i put fresh straw in .         i thought we were going in der stagecoach     said cliff .      oh  mr .  dibbler says artistes of your caliber shouldn   t travel in a common public vehicle     said asphalt .     besides  he said you wouldn   t want the expense .         what do you think  buddy .     said glod .      don   t mind     said buddy vaguely .   glod and cliff shared a glance .      i bet if you were to go and see dibbler and demand something better you   d get it     said glod hopefully      it   s got wheels     said buddy .     it   ll do .      he climbed aboard and sat down in the straw .      mr .  dibbler   s had some new shirts done .     said asphalt  aware that there was not a lot of jolliness in the air .     it   s for the tour .  look  it says on the back everywhere you   re going  isn   t that nice .         yes  when the musicians    guild twist our heads round we   ll be able to see where we   ve been     said glod .   asphalt cracked his whip over the horses .  they ambled off at a pace that suggested they intended to keep it up all day  and no idiot too soft to really use a whip properly was going to change their minds .        buggrit  buggrit .  the grawney man  says i .  buggrit .  he   s a yellow gloak  so he is .  ten thousand years .  buggrit .      really .   death relaxed .   there were half a dozen people around the fire .  and they were convivial .  a bottle was circling the group .  well  actually it was half a tin  and death hadn   t quite worked out what was in it or in the rather larger tin that was bubbling on the fire of old boots and mud .   they hadn   t asked him who he was .   none of them had names  as far as he could tell .  they had   labels  like stalling ken and coffin henry and foul ole ron  which said something about what they were but nothing about what they had been .   the tin reached him .  he passed it on as tactfully as he could  and lay back peacefully .   people without names .  people who were as invisible as he was .  people for whom death was always an option .  he could stay here a while .        free music     clete growled .     free .  what sort of idiot makes music for free .  at least you put a hat down  get people to drop the odd copper in .  otherwise what   s the point .      he stared at the paperwork in front of him for so long that satchelmouth coughed politely .      i   m thinking     said mr .  clete .     that wretched vetinari .  he said it   s up to guilds to enforce guild law           i heard they   re leaving the city     said satchelmouth .     on tour .  out in the country  i heard .  it   s not our law out there .         the country     said mr .  clete .     yes .  dangerous place  the country .         right     said satchelmouth .     there   s turnips  for a start .      mr .  clete   s eye fell on the guild   s account books .  it occurred to him  not for the first time  that far too many people put their trust in iron and steel when gold made some of the best possible weapons .      is mr .  downey still head of the assassins    guild .     he said .   the other musicians looked suddenly nervous .      assassins .     said herbert    mr .  harpsichord    shuffle .     i don   t think anyone   s ever called in the assassins .  this is guild business  isn   t it .  can   t have another guild interfering .         that   s right     said satchelmouth .     what   d happen if people knew we   d used the assassins .         we   d get a lot more members     said mr .  clete in his reasonable voice     and we could probably put the subscriptions up .  hat .  hat .  hat .         now hang on a minute     said satchelmouth .     i don   t mind us seeing to people who won   t join .  that   s proper guild behavior  that is .  but assassins   well           well what .     said clete .      they assassinate people .         you want free music  do you .     said mr .  clete .      well  of course i don   t want           i don   t remember you talking like this when you jumped up and down on that street violinist   s fingers last month     said clete .      yeah  well  that wasn   t  like  assassination     said satchelmouth .     i mean  he was able to walk away .  well  crawl away .  and he could still earn a living     he added .     not one that required the use of his hands  sure  but           and that penny whistle lad .  that one that plays a chord now every time he hiccups .  hat .  hat .  hat .         yeah  but that   s not the sa           do you know wheedown the guitar maker .     said mr .  clete .   satchelmouth was unbalanced by the change in direction .      i   m told he   s been selling guitars like there was no next wednesday     said mr .  clete .     but i don   t see any increase in membership  do you .         well           once people get the idea that they can listen to music for nothing  where will it end .      he glared at the other two .      dunno  mr .  clete     said shuffle obediently .      very well .  and the patrician has been ironical at me     said clete .     i   m not having that again .  it   s the assassins this time .         i don   t think we should actually have people killed     said satchelmouth doggedly .      i don   t want to hear any more from you     said mr .  clete .     this is guild business .         yes  but it   s our guild           exactly .  so shut up .  hat .  hat .  hat .        the cart rattled between the endless cabbage fields that led to pseudopolis .      i   ve been on tour before  you know     said glod .     when i was with snori snoriscousin and his brass idiots .  every night a different bed .  you forget what day of the week it is after a while .         what day of der week is it now .     said cliff .      see .  and we   ve only been on the road   what   three hours .     said glod .      where   re we stopping tonight .     said cliff .      scrote     said asphalt .      sounds a really interesting place     said cliff .      been there before  with the circus     said asphalt .     it   s a one horse town .      buddy looked over the side of the cart  but it wasn   t worth the effort .  the rich silty sto plains were the grocery of the continent  but not an awe inspiring panorama unless you were the kind of person who gets excited about fifty three types of cabbage and eighty one types of bean .   spaced every mile or so on the checkerboard of fields was a village  and spaced rather farther apart were the towns .  they were called towns because they were bigger than the villages .  the cart passed through a couple of them .  they had two streets in the form of a cross  one tavern  one seed store  one forge  one livery stable with a name like joe   s livery stable  a couple of barns  three old men sitting outside the tavern  and three young men lounging outside joe   s swearing that one day really soon now they were going to leave town and make it big in the world outside .  real soon .  any day now .      reminds you of home  eh .     said cliff  nudging buddy .      what .  no .  llamedos is all mountains and valleys .  and rain .  and mist .  and evergreens .      buddy sighed .      you had a great house there  i expect .     said the troll .      just a shack     said buddy .     made of earth and wood .  well  mud and wood really .      he sighed again .      it   s like this on the road     said asphalt .     melancholy .  no one to talk to but each other  i   ve known people go totally ins           how long has it been now .     said cliff .      three hours and ten minutes     said glod .   buddy sighed .     they were invisible people  death realized .  he was used to invisibility .  it went with the job .  humans didn   t see him until they had no choice .   on the other hand  he was an anthropomorphic personification .  whereas foul ole ron was human  at least technically .   foul ole ron made a small living by following people until they gave him money not to .  he   d also got a dog  which added something to foul ole ron   s smell .  it was a greyish brown terrier with a torn ear and vast patches of bare skin  it begged with an old hat in its remaining teeth  and since people will generally give to animals that which they   d withhold from humans  it added considerably to the earning power of the group .   coffin henry  on the other hand  earned his money by not going anywhere .  people organizing important social occasions sent him anti invitations and little presents of money to ensure he wouldn   t turn up .  this was because  if they didn   t  henry had a habit of sidling ingratiatingly into the wedding party and inviting people to look at his remarkable collection of skin diseases .  he also had a cough which sounded almost solid .   he had a sign on which was chalked    for sum muny i wunt follo you home .  coff coff .      arnold sideways had no legs .  it was a lack that didn   t seem to figure largely among his concerns .  he would grab people by their knees and say     have you got change for a penny .     invariably profiting by the ensuing cerebral confusion .   and the one they called the duck man had a duck on his head .  no one mentioned it .  no one drew attention to it .  it seemed to be a minor feature of no consequence  like arnold   s leglessness and foul ole ron   s independent smell or henry   s volcanic spitting .  but it kept nagging at death   s otherwise peaceful mind .   he wondered how to broach the subject .   after all  he thought  he must know  mustn   t he .  it   s not like lint on your jacket or something     by common agreement they   d called death mr .  scrub .  he didn   t know why .  on the other hand  he was among people who could hold a lengthy discussion with a door .  there may have been a logical reason .   the beggars spent their day wandering invisibly around the streets  where people who didn   t see them carefully circled out of their way and threw them the occasional coin .  mr .  scrub fitted in very well .  when he asked for money  people found it hard to say no .     scrote didn   t even have a river .  it existed simply because there   s only so much land you can have before you have to have something else .   it had two streets in the form of a cross  one tavern  one seed store  one forge  a couple of barns and  in a gesture of originality  one livery stable called seth   s livery stable .   nothing moved .  even the flies were asleep .  long shadows were the only occupants of the streets .      i thought you said dis was a one horse town     said cliff  as they pulled up in the rutted  puddled area that was probably glorified by the name of town square .      it must have died     said asphalt .   glod stood up in the cart and spread his arms wide .  he yelled      hello  scrote .      the name board over the livery stable parted from its last nail and landed in the dust .      what i like about this life on the road     said glod     is the fascinating people and interesting places .         i expect it comes alive at night     said asphalt .      yes     said cliff .     yes  i can believe dat .  yes .  dis looks like der kind of town dat comes alive at night .  dis looks like der whole town should be buried at dere crossroads with a stake through it .         talking of steak       said glod .   they looked at the tavern .  the cracked and peeling sign just managed to convey the words    the jolly cabbage .         i doubt it     said asphalt .   there were people in the dimly lit tavern  sitting in sullen silence .  the travelers were served by the innkeeper  whose manner suggested that he hoped they died horribly just as soon as they left the premises .  the beer tasted as if it was happy to connive at this state of affairs .   they huddled at one table  aware of the eyes on them .      i   ve heard about places like this     whispered glod .     you go into this little town with a name like friendly or amity  and next day you   re spareribs .         not me     said cliff .     i   m too stony .         well  you   re in the rockery  then     said the dwarf .  he looked round at a row of furrowed faces and raised his mug theatrically .      cabbages doing well .     he said .     i see in the fields they   re nice and yellow .  ripe  eh .  that   s good  eh .         that   s root fly  that is     said someone in the shadows .      good  good     said glod .  he was a dwarf .  dwarfs didn   t farm .      we don   t like circuses in scrote     said another voice .  it was a slow  deep voice .      we   re not a circus     said glod brightly .     we   re musicians .         we don   t like musicians in scrote     said another voice .   there seemed to be more and more figures in the gloom .      er   what do you like in scrote .     said asphalt .      well     said the barman  now a mere outline in the gathering darkness     round about this time of year we generally have a barbecue down by the rockery .      buddy sighed .   it was the first time he   d made a sound since they   d arrived in the town .      i guess we   d better show them what we play     he said .  there was a twang in his voice .     it was sometime later .   glod looked at the door handle .  it was a door handle .  you got hold of it with your hand .  but what was supposed to happen next .      door handle .     he said  in case that would help .      y   r sposed do s   ning w   vit     said cliff  from somewhere near the floor .   buddy leaned past the dwarf and turned the handle .      a   m   zing     said glod  and stumbled forward .  he levered himself off the floor and looked around .      wh   s ths .         the tavern keeper said we could stay here for free     said buddy .      s   mess     said glod .     some   ne fetch me a brm and a scr   bing brsh this min   t .      asphalt wobbled in  carrying the luggage and with cliff   s sack of rocks in his teeth .  he dropped the lot on the floor .      well  that was astonishing  sir     he said .     the way you just went into that barn and said  and said   what was it you said .         let   s do the show right here     said buddy  lying down on a straw mattress .      amazing .  they must have been coming in from miles around .      buddy stared at the ceiling and played a few chords .      and that barbecue .     said asphalt  still radiating enthusiasm .     the sauce .         the be   f .     said glod .      der charcoal     murmured cliff happily .  there was a wide black ring around his mouth .      an   d who   davthought     said glod     that you could brew a beer i   ke that outa cauliflowers .         had a great head on it     said cliff .      i thought we were going to be in a bit of trouble there  before you played     said asphalt  shaking the beetles out of another mattress .     i don   t know how you got them dancing like that .         yes     said buddy .      and we din   t even get paid     murmured glod .  he slumped back .  shortly there were snores  given a slightly metallic edge by the reverberation in his helmet .   when the others were asleep buddy put the guitar down on the bed  quietly opened the door  and crept downstairs and into the night .   it would have been nice if there had been a full moon .  or even a crescent .  a full moon would have been better .  but there was just a half moon  which never appears in romantic or occult paintings despite the fact that it is indeed the most magical phase .   there was a smell of stale beer  dying cabbages  barbecue embers  and insufficient sanitation .   he leaned against seth   s livery stable .  it shifted slightly .   it was fine when he was onstage or  as it had been tonight  on an old barn door set on a few bricks .  everything was in bright colors .  he could feel white hot images arcing across his mind .  his body felt as though it were on fire but also  and this was the important bit  as if it was meant to be on fire .  he felt alive .   and then  afterward  he felt dead .   there was still color in the world .  he could recognize it as color  but it seemed to be wearing cliff   s smoked glasses .  sounds came as if through cotton wool .  apparently the barbecue had been good  he had glod   s word for that  but to buddy it had been texture and not much else .   a shadow moved across the space between two buildings     on the other hand  he was the best .  he knew it  not as some matter of pride or arrogance  but simply as a matter of fact .  he could feel the music flowing out of him and into the audience        this one  sir .     whispered a shadow beside the livery stable  as buddy wandered along the moonlit street .      yes .  this one first and then into the tavern for the other two .  even the big troll .  there   s a spot on the back of the neck .         but not dibbler  sir .         strangely  no .  he   s not here .         shame .  i bought a meat pie off him once .         it   s an attractive suggestion  but no one   s paying us for dibbler .      the assassins drew their knives  the blades blackened to avoid the telltale shine .      i could give you tuppence  sir  if that   d help .         it   s certainly tempting        the senior assassin pressed himself against the wall as buddy   s footsteps grew louder .   he gripped his knife at waist height .  no one who knew anything about knives ever used the famous overarm stabbing motion so beloved of illustrators .  it was amateurish and inefficient .  a professional would strike upward  the way to a man   s heart was through his stomach .   he drew his hand back and tensed     a hourglass  glowing faintly blue  was suddenly thrust in front of his eyes .   lord robert selachii .  said a voice by his ear  this is your life .   he squinted .  there was no mistaking the name engraved on the glass .  he could see every little grain of sand  pouring into the past     he turned  took one look at the hooded figure  and ran for it .  his apprentice was already a hundred yards away  and still accelerating .      sorry .  who   s that .      susan tucked the hourglass back into her robe and shook out her hair .   buddy appeared .      you .         yes .  me     said susan .   buddy took a step nearer .      are you going to fade away again .     he said .      no .  i have actually just saved your life  as a matter of fact .      buddy looked around at the otherwise empty night .      from what .      susan bent down and picked up a blackened knife .      this     she said .      i know we   ve had this conversation before  but who are you .  not my fairy godmother  are you .         i think you have to be a lot older     said susan .  she backed away .     and probably a lot nicer  too .  look  i can   t tell you any more .  you   re not even supposed to see me .  i   m not supposed to be here .  neither are you           you   re not going to tell me to stop playing again  are you .     said buddy angrily .     because i won   t .  i   m a musician .  if i don   t play  what am i then .  i might as well be dead .  do you understand .  music is my life .      he took a few steps nearer .      why   re you following me around .  asphalt said there   d be girls like you .         what on disc do you mean     girls like me    .      buddy subsided a bit  but only a little .      they follow actors and musicians around     he said     because of  you know  the glamour and everything           glamour .  some smelly cart and a tavern that smells of cabbages .      buddy held up his hands .      listen     he said urgently .     i   m doing all right .  i   m working  people are listening to me   i don   t need any more help  all right .  i   ve got enough to worry about  so please keep out of my life        there was the sound of running feet and asphalt appeared  with the other members of the band behind him .      the guitar was screaming     said asphalt .     are you all right .         you   d better ask her     muttered buddy .   all three of them looked directly at susan .      who .     said cliff .      she   s right in front of you .      glod waved a stubby hand in the air  missing susan by inches .      it was probably dat cabbage     said cliff to asphalt .   susan stepped backward quietly .      she   s right there .  but she   s going away now  can   t you see .         that   s right  that   s right     said glod  taking buddy   s arm .     she   s going away now  and good riddance  so just you come on back           now she   s getting on that horse .         yes  yes  a big black horse           it   s white  you idiot .      hoofprints burned red on the ground for a moment  and then faded .      and it   s gone now .      the band with rocks in stared into the night .      yes  i can see that  now you mention it     said cliff .     dat   s a horse dat isn   t dere  sure enough .         yes  that   s certainly what a horse that   s gone looks like     said asphalt carefully .      none of you saw her .     said buddy  as they maneuvered him gently back through the pre dawn greyness .      i heard where musicians  really good musicians  got followed around by these half naked young women called muses     said cliff .      like cantaloupe     said cliff .      we don   t call    em muses     said asphalt  grinning .     i told you  when i worked for bertie the balladeer and his troubadour rascals  we used to get any amount of young women hanging arou           amazing how legends get started  when you come to think about it     said glod .     just you come along now  my lad .         she was there     buddy protested .     she was there .         cantaloupe .     said asphalt .     you sure  cliff .         read it in a book once     said the troll .     cantaloupe .  i   m pretty sure .  something like that .         she was there     said buddy .     the raven snored gently on top of his skull  counting dead sheep .   the death of rats came through the window in an arc  bounced off a dribbly candle  and landed on all fours on the table .   the raven opened one eye .      oh  it   s you        then a claw was round its leg  and the death of rats jumped off the skull and into infinite space .     there were more cabbage fields next day  although the landscape did begin to change a bit .      hey  that   s interesting     said glod .      what is .     said cliff .      there   s a field of beans over there .      they watched it until it was out of sight .      nice of the people to give us all this food  though     said asphalt .     we shan   t be wanting for cabbages  eh .         oh  shut up     said glod .  he turned to buddy  who was sitting with his chin resting on his arms .      cheer up  we   ll be in pseudopolis in a couple of hours     he said .      good     said buddy  distantly .   glod climbed back into the front of the cart and pulled cliff toward him .      notice the way he goes all quiet .     he whispered .      yup .  do you think it   ll be   you know   done by der time we get back .         you can get anything done in ankh morpork     said glod firmly .     i must have knocked on every damn door in the street of cunning artificers .  twenty five dollars .         you   re complaining .  it ain   t your tooth dat   s paying for it .      they both turned to look at their guitarist .   he was staring out across the endless fields .      she was there     he muttered .     feathers spiraled toward the ground .      you didn   t have to go and do that     said the raven  fluttering upright .     you could simply ask .      squeak .      all right  but before would have been better .     the raven ruffled its feathers and looked around at the bright landscape under the dark sky .      this is the place then  is it .     it said .     you   re sure you   re not the death of ravens too .      squeak .      shape doesn   t mean much .  anyway  you   ve got a pointy snout .  what was it you were wanting .      the death of rats grabbed a wing and pulled .      all right  all right .      the raven glanced at a garden gnome .  it was fishing in an ornamental pond .  the fish were skeletal  but this didn   t seem to interfere with their enjoyment of life  or whatever it was they were enjoying .   it fluttered and hopped along after the rat .     cut me own throat dibbler stood back .   jimbo  crash  noddy  and scum looked at him expectantly .      what   re all the boxes for  mr .  dibbler .     said crash .      yeah     said scum .   dibbler carefully positioned the tenth box on its tripod .      you boys seen an iconograph .     he said .      oh  yes   i mean  yeah     said jimbo .     they   ve got a little demon inside them that paints pictures of things you point it at .         this is like that  only for sound     said dibbler .   jimbo squinted past the open lid .      can   t see any   i mean  can   t see no demon     he said .      that   s because there isn   t one     said dibbler .  it was worrying him  too .  he   d have been a little bit happier if there   d been a demon or some sort of magic .  something simple and understandable .  he didn   t like the idea of meddling in science .      now then   suck       he began .      the surreptitious fabric     said jimbo .      what .         the surreptitious fabric     jimbo repeated helpfully .     it   s our new name .         why have you changed it .  you haven   t been suck for twenty four hours .         yeah  but we thought the name was holding us back .         how could it be holding you back .  you aren   t moving .     dibbler glared at them and shrugged .     anyway  whatever you call yourselves   i want you to sing your best song  what am i saying  in front of these boxes .  not yet   not yet   wait a moment        dibbler retired to the farthest corner of the room and pulled his hat down over his ears .      all right  you can start     he said .   he stared in blissful deafness at the group for several minutes until a general cessation of movement suggested that whatever they had been perpetrating had been committed .   then he inspected the boxes .  the wires were vibrating gently  but there was barely any sound .   the surreptitious fabric clustered round .      is it working  mr .  dibbler .     said jimbo .   dibbler shook his head .      you boys don   t have what it takes     he said .      what does it take  mr .  dibbler .         you   ve got me there .  you   ve got something     he said  at the sight of their dejected faces     but not a lot of it  whatever it is .         er   this doesn   t mean we   re not allowed to play at the free festival  does it  mr .  dibbler .     said crash .      maybe     said dibbler  smiling benevolently .      thanks a lot  mr .  dibbler .      the surreptitious fabric wandered out into the street .      we need to get it together if we   re going to wow them at the festival     said crash .      what  you mean   like   learn to play .     said jimbo .      no .  music with rocks in just happens .  if you go around learning  you   ll never get anywhere     said crash .     no  i mean       he looked around .     better clothes  for one thing .  did you see about them leather coats  noddy .         sort of     said noddy .      what do you mean  sort of .         sort of leather .  i went down to the tannery in phedre road and they had some leather all right  but it   s a bit   whiffy           all right  we can get started on them tonight .  and how about those leopardskin trousers  scum .  you know we said leopardskin trousers   d be a great idea .      a look of transcendental worry crossed scum   s face .      i kind of got some     he said .      you either got them or you ain   t     said crash .      yeah  but they   re kind of       said scum .     look  i couldn   t find a shop that   d heard of anything like that but  er  you know that circus that was here last week .  only i had a word with the guy in the top hat and  well  it was a kind of a bargain and           scum     said crash quietly     what have you bought .         look at it this way     said scum with sweating brightness     it   s sort of leopardskin trousers and a leopardskin shirt and a leopardskin hat .         scum     said crash  his voice low with resigned menace     you   ve bought a leopard  haven   t you .         sort of leopardy  yes .         oh  good grief           but sort of a real steal for twenty dollars     said scum .     nothing important wrong with it  the man said .         why   d he get rid of it  then .     crash demanded .      it   s sort of deaf .  can   t hear the lion tamer  he said .         well  that   s no good to us .         don   t see why .  your trousers don   t have to listen .      spare a copper  young sir .      push off  granddad     said crash easily .   good luck to you .      too many beggars around these days  my father says     said crash  as they pushed past .     he says the beggars    guild ought to do something about it .         but the beggars all belong to the guild     said jimbo .      well  they shouldn   t allow so many people to join .         yes  but it   s better than being on the streets .      scum  who out of the whole group had the least amount of cerebral activity to get between him and true observation of the world  was trailing behind .  he had an uneasy feeling that he   d just walked over someone   s grave .      that one looked a bit sort of thin     he muttered .   the others weren   t paying any attention .  they were back to the usual argument .      i   m fed up with being surreptitious fabric     said jimbo .     it   s a silly name .         really  really thin     said scum .  he felt in his pocket .      yeah  i liked it best when we were the whom     said noddy .      but we were only the whom for half an hour .     said crash .       yesterday .  in between bein    the blots and lead balloon  remember .      scum located a tenpenny piece and turned back .      there   s bound to be some good name     said jimbo .     i just bet we   ll know it   s right just as soon as we see it .         oh  yeah .  well  we   ve got to come up with some name we don   t start arguing about after five minutes     said crash .     it   s not doing our career any good if people don   t know who we are .         mr .  dibbler says it definitely is     said noddy .      yes  but a rolling stone gathers no moss  my father says     said crash .      there you go  old man     said scum  back down the street .   thank you  said the grateful death .   scum hurried to catch up with the others  who were back on the subject of leopards with hearing difficulties .      where did you put it  scum .     said crash .      well  you know your sort of bedroom           how do you kill a leopard .     said noddy .      hey  here   s an idea     said crash  gloomily .     we let it choke to death on scum .        the raven inspected the hallway clock with the practiced eye of one who knows the value of good props .   it was made of some dark  age blackened wood .  there was a pendulum  which oscillated slowly .   the clock had no hands .      impressive     said the raven .     that scythe blade on the pendulum .  nice touch .  very gothic .  no one could look at that clock and not think        squeak .      all right  all right  i   m coming .     the raven fluttered across to an ornamental doorframe .  there was a skull and bones motif on it .      excellent taste     he said .   squeak .  squeak .      well  anyone can do plumbing  i expect     said the raven .     interesting fact  did you know the lavatory was actually named after sir charles lavatory .  not many people        squeak .   the death of rats pushed at the big door leading to the kitchen .  it swung open with a creak but  here again  there was something not quite right .  a listener had the sense that the creak had been added by someone who  feeling that a door like that with a door surround like that ought to creak  had inserted one .   albert was washing up at the stone sink and staring at nothing .      oh     he said  turning     it   s you .  what   s this thing .         i   m a raven     said the raven  nervously .     incidentally  one of the most intelligent birds .  most people would say it   s the mynah bird  but        squeak .   the raven ruffled its feathers .      i   m here as an interpreter     it said .      has he found him .     said albert .   the death of rat squeaked at length .      looked everywhere .  no sign     said the raven .      then he don   t want to be found     said albert .  he smeared the grease on a plate with a skull pattern on it .     i don   t like that .      squeak .      the rat says that   s not the worst thing     said the raven .     the rats says you ought to know what the granddaughter has been doing        the rat squeaked .  the raven talked .   the plate shattered on the sink .      i knew it .     albert shouted .     saving him .  she hasn   t got the faintest idea .  right .  i   m going to sort this out .  the master thinks he can slope off  eh .  not from old albert .  you two wait here .        there were already posters up in pseudopolis .  news travels fast  especially when c . m . o . t .  dibbler is paying for the horses        hello  pseudopolis .      they had to call out the city watch .  they had to organize a bucket chain from the river .  asphalt had to stand outside buddy   s dressing room with a club .  with a nail in it .     albert  in front of a scrap of mirror in his bedroom  brushed his hair furiously .  it was white .  at least  long ago it was white .  now it was the color of a tobacco addict   s index finger .      it   s my duty  that   s what it is     he muttered .     don   t know where he   d be without me .  maybe he does remember the future  but he always gets it wrong .  oh  he can go on worrying about the eternal verities  but who has to sort it out when all   s said and done   muggins  that   s who .      he glared at himself in the mirror .      right .     he said .   there was a battered shoe box under the bed .  albert pulled it out very  very carefully and took the top off .  it was half full of cotton wool  nestling in the wool  like a rare egg  was a lifetimer .   engraved on it was the name  alberto malich .   the sand inside was frozen  immobile  in midpour .  there wasn   t much left in the top bulb .   no time passed  here .   it was part of the arrangement .  he worked for death  and time didn   t pass  except when he went into the world .   there was a scrap of paper by the glass .  the figures          had been written at the top  but lower numbers trailed down the page after it .                    .   nineteen .   he must have been daft .  he   d let his life leak away by hours and minutes  and there had been a lot more of them lately .  there   d been all that business with the plumber  of course .  and shopping .  the master didn   t like to go shopping .  it was hard to get served .  and albert had taken a few holidays  because it was nice to see the sun  any sun  and feel wind and rain  the master did his best  but he could never get them right .  and decent vegetables  he couldn   t do them properly either .  they never tasted grown .   nineteen days left in the world .  but more than enough .   albert slipped the lifetimer into his pocket  put on an overcoat  and stamped back down the stairs .      you     he said  pointing to the death of rats .     you can   t sense a trace of him .  there must be something .  concentrate .      squeak .      what did he say .         he said all he can remember is something about sand .         sand     said albert .     all right .  good start .  we search all the sand .      squeak .      wherever the master is  he   ll make an impression .        cliff awoke to a swish swish sound .  the shape of glod was outlined in the light of dawn  wielding a brush .      what   re you doing  dwarf .         i got asphalt to get some paint     said glod .     these rooms are a disgrace .      cliff raised himself on his elbows and looked around .      what do you call der color on der door .         eau de nil .         nice .         thank you     said cliff .      the curtains are good  too .      the door creaked open .  asphalt came in  with a tray  and kicked the door shut behind him .      oh  sorry     he said .      i   ll paint over the mark     said glod .   asphalt put the tray down  trembling with excitement .      everyone   s talking about you guys .     he said .     and they   re saying it was about time they built a new theater anyway .  i   ve got you eggs and bacon  eggs and rat  eggs and coke  and   and   what was it   oh  yes .  the captain of the watch says if you   re still in the city at sunrise he will personally have you buried alive .  i   ve got the cart all ready by the back door .  young women have been writing things on it in lipstick .  nice curtains  by the way .      all three of them looked at buddy .      he hasn   t moved     said glod .     flopped down right after the show and out like a light .         he was certainly leaping around last night     said cliff .   buddy continued to snore gently .      when we get back     said glod     we ought to have a nice holiday somewhere .         dat   s right     said cliff .     if we get out of dis alive  i   m going to put my rock kit on my back and take a long walk  and der first time someone says to me    what are dem things on your back .     dat   s where i   m gonna settle down .      asphalt peered down into the street .      can you all eat fast .     he said .     only there   s some men in uniform out here .  with shovels .        back in ankh morpork  mr .  clete was astonished .      but we hired you .     he said .      the term is    retained     not    hired        said lord downey  head of the assassins    guild .  he looked at clete with an expression of unconcealed distaste .     unfortunately  however  we can no longer entertain your contract .         they   re musicians     said clete .     how hard can they be to kill .         my associates are somewhat reluctant to talk about it     said lord downey .     they seem to feel that the clients are protected in some way .  obviously  we will return the balance of your fee .         protected     muttered clete  as they stepped thankfully through the archway of the assassins    guild .      well  i told you what it was like in the drum when       satchelmouth began .      that   s just superstition     snapped clete .  he glanced up at a wall  where three festival posters flaunted their primary colors .      it was stupid of you to think assassins would be any good outside the city     muttered clete .      me .  i never           get them more than five miles from a decent tailor and a mirror and they go all to pieces     clete added .   he stared at the poster .      free     he muttered .     did you put it about that anyone who plays at this festival is right out of the guild .         yes  sir .  i don   t think they   re worrying  sir .  i mean  some of    em have been getting together  sir .  see  they say since there   s a lot more people want to be musicians than we   ll allow in the guild  then we should           that   s mob rule .     said clete .     banding together to force unacceptable rules on a defenseless city .         trouble is  sir     said satchelmouth     if there   s a lot of them   if they think of talking to the palace   well  you know the patrician  sir        clete nodded glumly .  any guild was powerful just so long as it self evidently spoke for its constituency .  he thought of hundreds of musicians flocking to the palace .  hundreds of non guild musicians     the patrician was a pragmatist .  he never tried to fix things that worked .  things that didn   t work  however  got broken .   the only glimmer of hope was that they   d all be too busy messing around with music to think about the bigger picture .  it had certainly worked for clete .   then he remembered that the blasted dibbler man was involved .  expecting dibbler not to think about anything concerning money was like expecting rocks not to think about gravity .        hello .  albert .      susan pushed open the kitchen door .  the huge room was empty .      albert .      she tried upstairs .  there was her own room  and there was a corridor of doors that didn   t open and possibly never could   the doors and frames had an all in one  molded together look .  presumably death had a bedroom  although proverbially death never slept .  perhaps he just lay in bed reading .   she tried the handles until she found one that turned .   death did have a bedroom .   he   d got many of the details right .  of course .  after all  he saw quite a lot of bedrooms .  in the middle of the acres of floor was a large four poster bed  although when susan gave it an experimental prod it turned out that the sheets were as solid as rock .   there was a full length mirror  and a wardrobe .  she had a look inside  just in case there was a selection of robes  but there was nothing in there except a few old shoes in the bottom .     a dressing table held a jug and basin set with a motif of skulls and omegas  and a variety of bottles and other items .   she picked them up  one by one .  after shave lotion .  pomade .  breath freshener .  a pair of silverbacked hairbrushes .   it was all rather sad .  death clearly had picked up an idea of what a gentleman should have on his dressing table  without confronting one or two fundamental questions .   eventually she found a smaller  narrower staircase .      albert .      there was a door at the top .      albert .  anyone .      it   s not actually barging in if i call out first  she told herself .  she pushed open the door .   it was a very small room .  really small .  it contained a few small sticks of bedroom furniture and a small narrow bed .  a small bookcase contained a handful of small  uninteresting looking books .  there was a piece of ancient paper on the floor which  when susan picked it up  turned out to be covered with numbers  all crossed out except the last one  which was     .   one of the books was gardening in difficult conditions .   she went back down to the study .  she   d known that there was no one in the house .  there was a dead feeling in the air .   there was the same feeling in the gardens .  death could create most things  except for plumbing .  but he couldn   t create life itself .  that had to be added  like yeast in bread .  without it  everything was beautifully neat and tidy and boring  boring  boring .   this is what it must have been like  she thought .  and then  one day  he adopted my mother .  he was curious .   she took the path through to the orchard again .   and when i was born mum and dad were so afraid that i felt at home here they brought me up to be   well   a susan .  what kind of name is that for death   s granddaughter .  a girl like that should have better cheekbones  straight hair  and a name with vs and xs in it .   and there  once again  was the thing he   d made for her .  all by himself .  working it all out from first principles     a swing .  a simple swing .     it was already burning hot in the desert between klatch and hersheba .   the air shimmied  and then there was a pop .  albert appeared on a sand dune .  there was a claybrick fort on the horizon .      the klatchian foreign legion     he muttered  as sand began its inexorable progress into his boots .   albert trudged toward it with the death of rats sitting on his shoulder .   he knocked on the door  which had a number of arrows in it .  after a while a small hatch slid back .      what do you want  offendi .     said a voice from somewhere behind it .   albert held up a card .      have you seen someone who didn   t look like this .     he demanded .   there was silence .      then let   s say  have you seen some mysterious stranger who didn   t talk about his past .     said albert .      this is the klatchian foreign legion  offendi .  people don   t talk about their past .  they join up to   to        it dawned on albert as the pause lengthened that it was up to him to get the conversation going again .      forget .         right .  forget .  yes .         so have you have had any recent recruits who were a little  shall we say  odd .         might have done     said the voice slowly .     can   t remember .      the hatchway slammed shut .   albert hammered on it again .  the hatchway opened .      yes  what is it .         are you sure you can   t remember .         remember what .      albert took a deep breath .      i demand to see your commanding officer .      the hatch shut .  the hatch opened .      sorry .  it appears that i am my commanding officer .  you   re not a d   reg or a hershebian  are you .         don   t you know .         i   m   pretty sure i must have done .  once .  you know how it is   head like   thing  you know   with holes in   you drain lettuce in it   er        there was the sound of bolts being pulled back  and a wicket door opened in the gateway .   the possible officer was a sergeant  insofar as albert was at all familiar with klatchian ranks .  he had the look about him of someone who  among the things he couldn   t remember  would include a good night   s sleep .  if he could remember to .   there were a few other klatchian soldiers inside the fort  sitting or  just barely  standing .  many were bandaged .  and there was a rather greater number of soldiers slumped or lying on the packed sand who   d never need a night   s sleep ever again .      what   s been happening here .     said albert .  his tone was so authoritative that the sergeant found himself saluting .      we were attacked by d   regs  sir     he said  swaying slightly .     hundreds of them .  they outnumbered us   er   what   s the number after nine .  got a one in it .         ten .         ten to one  sir .         i see you survived  though     said albert .      ah     said the sergeant .     yes .  er .  yes .  that   s where it all gets a bit complicated  in fact .  er .  corporal .  that   s you .  no  you just next to him .  the one with the two stripes .         me .     said a small fat soldier .      yes .  tell him what happened .         oh .  right .  er .  well  the bastards had shot us full of arrows  right .  an    it looked like it was all up with us .  then someone suggested sticking bodies up on the battlements with their spears and crossbows and everything so   s the bastards   d think we was still up to strength           it   s not an original idea  mind you     said the sergeant .     been done dozens of times .         yeah     said the corporal awkwardly .     that   s what they must   ve thought .  and then   and then   when they was galloping down the sand dunes   when they was almost on us  laughing and everything  saying stuff like    that old trick again      someone shouted fire and they did .         the dead men    .         i joined the legion to   er   you know  with your mind       the corporal began .      forget .     said albert .      that   s right .  forget .  and i   ve been getting good at it .  but i   m not going to forget my old mate nudger malik stuck full of arrows and still giving the enemy what for     said the corporal .      not for a long time .  i   m going to give it a try  mind you .      albert looked up at the battlements .  they were empty .      someone formed    em up in formation and they all marched out  afterwards     said the corporal .     and i went out to look later just now and there was just graves .  they must have dug them for one another           tell me     said albert     who is this    someone    to whom you keep referring .      the soldiers looked at one another .      we   ve just been talking about that     said the sergeant .     we   ve been trying to remember .  he was in   the pit   when it started           tall  was he .     said albert .      could have been tall  could have been tall     nodded the corporal .     he had a tall voice  certainly .     he looked puzzled at the words coming out of his own mouth .      what did he look like .         well  he had a   with   and he was about   more or less a           did he look   loud and deep .     said albert .   the corporal grinned with relief .     that   s him     he said .     private   private   beau   beau   can   t quite remember his name           i know that when he walked out of the       the sergeant began  and began to snap his fingers irritably       thing you open and shut .  made of wood .  hinges and bolts on it .  thank you .  gate .  that   s right   gate .  when he went out of the gate he said   what was it he said  corporal .         he said    every last detail     sir .      albert looked around the fort .      so he   s gone .         who .         the man you were just telling me about .         oh .  yes .  er .  have you any idea who he was  offendi .  i mean  it was amazing   talk about morale           esprit de corpse .     said albert  who could be nasty at times .     i suppose he didn   t say where he was going next .         where who was going next .     said the sergeant  wrinkling his forehead in honest inquiry .      forget i asked     said albert .   he took a last look round the little fort .  it probably didn   t matter much in the history of the world whether it survived or not  whether the dotted line on the map went one way or the other .  just like the master to tinker with things     sometimes he tries to be human  too  he thought .  and he makes a pig   s ear out of it .      carry on  sergeant     he said  and wandered back into the desert .   the legionnaires watched him disappear over the dunes  and then got on with the job of tidying up the fort .      who d   you think he was .         who .         the person you just mentioned .         did i .         did you what .      albert crested a dune .  from here the dotted line was just visible  winding treacherously across the sand .   squeak .      you and me both     said albert .   he removed an extremely grubby handkerchief from a pocket  knotted it in all four corners  and put it on his head .      right     he said  but there was a trace of uncertainty in his voice .     seems to me we   re not being logical about this .      squeak .      i mean  we could be chasing him all over the place .      squeak .      so maybe we ought to think about this .      squeak .      now   if you were on the disc  definitely feeling a bit strange  and could go absolutely anywhere  anywhere at all   where would you go .      squeak .      anywhere at all .  but somewhere where no one remembers your name .      the death of rats looked around at the endless  featureless  and above all dry desert .   squeak .      you know  i think you   re right .        it was in an apple tree .   he built me a swing  susan remembered .   she sat and stared at the thing .   it was quite complicated .  insofar as the thinking behind it could be inferred from the resulting construction  it had run like this   clearly a swing should be hung from the stoutest branch .   in fact   safety being paramount   it would be better to hang it from the two stoutest branches  one to each rope .   they had turned out to be on opposite sides of the tree .   never go back .  that was part of the logic .  always press on  step by logical step .   so   he   d removed about six feet from the middle of the tree   s trunk  thus allowing the swing to  well  swing .   the tree hadn   t died .  it was still quite healthy .   however  the lack of a major section of trunk had presented a fresh problem .  this had been overcome by the addition of two large props under the branches  a little farther out from the ropes of the swing  keeping the whole top of the tree at about the right height off the ground .   she remembered how she   d laughed  even then .  and he   d stood there  quite unable to see what was wrong .   and then she saw it all  all laid out .   that was how death worked .  he never understood exactly what he was doing .  he   d do something  and it would turn out wrong .  her mother  suddenly he had a grown woman on his hands and didn   t know what to do next .  so he did something else to make it right  which made it more wrong .  her father .  death   s apprentice .  and when that went wrong  and its potential wrongness was built right into it  he did something else to make it right .   he   d turned over the hourglass .   after that  it was all a matter of math .   and the duty .        hello   hells  glod  tell me where we are   sto lat .  yay .      it was an even bigger audience .  there   d been more time for the posters to be up  more time for the word of mouth from ankh morpork .  and  the band realized  a solid core of people had followed them from pseudopolis .   in a brief break between numbers  just before the bit where people started leaping around on the furniture  cliff leaned over to glod .      you see dat troll in der front row .     he said .     the one asphalt   s jumping on der fingers of .         the one that looks like a spoil heap .         she was in pseudopolis     said cliff  beaming .     she keeps looking at me .         go for it  lad     said glod  emptying the spit from his horn .     in like flint  eh .         you think she   s one of dem groupies asphalt told us about .         could be .      other news had traveled fast  too .  dawn saw another redecorated hotel room  a royal proclamation from queen keli that the band was to be out of the city in one hour on pain of pain  and one more rapid exit .   buddy lay in the cart as it bumped over the cobbles toward quirm .   she hadn   t been there .  he   d scanned the audience on both nights  and she hadn   t been there .  he   d even got up in the middle of the night and walked through the empty streets  in case she was looking for him .  now he wondered if she existed .  if it came to that  he was only half certain that he existed  except for the times when he was onstage .   he half listened to the conversation from the others .      asphalt .         yes  mr .  glod .         cliff and me can   t help noticing something .         yes  mr .  glod .         you   ve been carrying a heavy leather bag around  asphalt .         yes  mr .  glod .         it was a bit heavier this morning  i think .         yes  mr .  glod .         it   s got the money in it  yes .         yes  mr .  glod .         how much .         er .  mr .  dibbler said i wasn   t to worry you with money stuff     said asphalt .      we don   t mind     said cliff .      that   s right     said glod .     we want to worry .         er .     asphalt licked his lips .  there was something deliberate in cliff   s manner .     about two thousand dollars  mr .  glod .      the cart bounced on for a while .  the landscape had changed a little .  there were hills  and the farms were smaller .      two thousand dollars     said glod .     two thousand dollars .  two thousand dollars .  two thousand dollars .         why d   you keeping saying two thousand dollars .     said cliff .      i   ve never had a chance to say two thousand dollars .         just don   t like it so loud .         two thousand dollars .         ssh .     said asphalt  desperately  as glod   s shout echoed off the hills .     this is bandit country .      glod eyed the satchel .     you   re telling me     he said .      i don   t mean mr .  dibbler .         we   re on the road between sto lat and quirm     said glod patiently .     this isn   t the ramtops road .  this is civilization .  they don   t rob you on the road in civilization .     he glanced darkly at the satchel again .     they wait until you   ve got into the cities .  that   s why it   s called civilization .  hah  can you tell me the last time anyone was ever robbed on this road .         friday  i believe     said a voice from the rocks .     oh  bugg        the horses reared up and then galloped forward .  asphalt   s crack of the whip had been an almost instinctive reaction .   they didn   t slow down until they were several miles farther along the road .      just shut up about money  all right .     hissed asphalt .      i   m a professional musician     said glod .     of course i think about money .  how far is it to quirm .         a lot less now     said asphalt .     a couple of miles .      and after the next hill the city lay before them  nestling in its bay .   there was a cluster of people at the town   s gates  which were closed .  afternoon sunlight glittered off helmets .      what do you call them long sticks with axes on the end .     said asphalt .      pikes     said buddy .      there   s certainly a lot of them     said glod .      dey can   t be for us  can dey .     said cliff .     we   re only musicians .         and i can see some men in long robes and gold chains and things     said asphalt .      burghers     said glod .      you know that horseman that passed us this morning       said asphalt .     i   m thinking that maybe news travels .         yes  but we didn   t break up dat theater     said cliff .      well  you only gave them six encores     said asphalt .      we didn   t do all dat rioting in der streets .         i   m sure the men with the pointy blades will understand that .         maybe dey don   t want der hotels redecorated .  i said it was a mistake  orange curtains with yellow wallpaper .      the cart came to a halt .  a rotund man with a tricorn hat and a fur trimmed cloak scowled uncomfortably at the band .      are you the musicians known as the band with rocks in .     he said .      what seems to be the problem  officer .     said asphalt .      i am the mayor of quirm .  according to the laws of quirm  music with rocks in cannot be played in the city .  look  it says so right here        he flourished a scroll  glod caught it .      that ink looks wet to me     he said .      music with rocks in represents a public nuisance  is proven to be injurious to health and morals and causes unnatural gyrations of the body     said the man  pulling the scroll back .      you mean we can   t come into quirm .     said glod .      you can come in if you must     said the mayor .     but you   re not to play .      buddy stood up on the cart .      but we   ve got to play     he said .  the guitar swung around on its strap .  he gripped the neck and raised his strumming hand threateningly .   glod looked around in desperation .  cliff and asphalt had put their hands over their ears .      ah .     he said .     i think what we have here is an occasion for negotiation  yes .      he got down from the cart .      i expect what your worship hasn   t heard of     he said     is the music tax .         what music tax .     said asphalt and the mayor together .      oh  it   s the latest thing     said glod .     on account of the popularity of music with rocks in .  music tax  fifty pence a ticket .  must have amounted to  oh       dollars in sto lat  i reckon .  more than twice that in ankh morpork  of course .  the patrician thought it up .         really .  sounds like vetinari right enough     said the mayor .  he rubbed his chin .     did you say      dollars in sto lat .  really .  and that place is hardly any size .      a watchman with a feather in his helmet saluted nervously .      excuse me  your worship  but the note from sto lat did say           just a minute     said the mayor testily .     i   m thinking        cliff leaned down .      dis is bribery  is it .     he whispered .      this is taxation     said glod .   the watchman saluted again .      but really  sir  the guards at           captain     snapped the mayor  still staring thoughtfully at glod     this is politics .         as well .     said cliff .      and to show goodwill     said glod     it   d be a good idea if we paid the tax before the performance  don   t you think .      the mayor looked at them in astonishment  a man not certain he could get his mind around the idea of musicians with money .      your worship  the message said           two hundred and fifty dollars     said glod .      your worship           now  captain     said the mayor  apparently reaching a decision     we know that folk are a bit odd in sto lat .  it   s only music  after all .  i said i thought it was an odd note .  i can   t see the harm in music .  and these young me   people are clearly very successful     he added .  this obviously carried a lot of weight with the mayor  as it does with many people .  no one likes a poor thief .      yes     he went on     it   d be just like the lats to try that on us .  they think we   re simple just because we live out here .         yes  but the pseudopo           oh  them .  stuck up bunch .  nothing wrong with a bit of music  is there .  especially     the mayor eyed glod     when it   s for the civic good .  let    em in  captain .        susan saddled up .   she knew the place .  she   d even seen it once .  they   d put a new fence along the road now  but it was still dangerous .   she knew the time  too .   just before they called it dead man   s curve .        hello  quirm .      buddy struck a chord .  and a pose .  a faint white glow  like the glitter of cheap sequins  outlined him .      uh huh huh .      the cheering became the familiar wall of sound .   i thought we were going to get killed by people who didn   t like us  glod thought .  now i think it   s possible to be killed by people who love us     he looked around carefully .  there were guards around the walls  the captain had been no fool .  i just hope asphalt put the horse and cart outside like i asked him     he glanced at buddy  sparkling in the limelight .   a couple of encores and then down the back stairs and away  glod thought .  the big leather satchel had been chained to cliff   s leg .  anyone snatching it would find themselves towing one ton of drummer .   i don   t even know what we   re going to play  thought glod .  i never do .  i just blow and   there it is .  you can   t tell me that   s right .   buddy whirled his arm liked a discus thrower and a chord sprang away and into the ears of the audience .   glod raised the horn to his lips .  the sound that emerged was like burning black velvet in a windowless room .   before the music with rocks in spell filled his soul  he thought  i   m going to die .  that   s part of the music .  i   m going to die really soon .  i can feel it .  every day .  it   s getting closer     he glanced at buddy again .  the boy was scanning the audience  as if he was looking for someone in the screaming throng .   they played    there   s a great deal of shaking happening .     they played    give me that music with rocks in .     they played    pathway to paradise     and a hundred people in the audience swore to buy a guitar in the morning  .   they played with heart and especially with soul .   they got out after the ninth encore .  the crowd was still stamping its feet for more as they climbed through the privy window and dropped into the alley .   asphalt emptied a sack into the leather satchel .     another seven hundred dollars .     he said  helping them onto the cart .      right  and we get ten dollars each     said glod .      you tell mr .  dibbler     said asphalt  as the horses    hooves clattered toward the gates .      i will .         it doesn   t matter     said buddy .     sometimes you do it for the money  but sometimes you do it for the show .         hah .  that   ll be the day .     glod fumbled under the seat .  asphalt had stashed two crates of beer there .      there   s the festival tomorrow night     rumbled cliff .  the gate arch passed above them .  they could still hear the stamping from here .      after that we   ll have a new contract     said the dwarf .     with lots of zeroes in it .         we got zeroes now     said cliff .      yeah  but they ain   t got many numbers in front of them .  eh  buddy .      they looked around .  buddy was asleep  the guitar clutched to his chest .      out like a candle     said glod .   he turned back again .  the road stretched ahead of them  pale in the starlight .      you said you just wanted to work     said cliff .     you said you didn   t want to be famous .  how   d you like it  having to worry about all dat gold  and having girls throw deir chain mail at you .         i   d just have to put up with it .         i   d like a quarry     said the troll .      yeah .         yeah .  heart shaped .        a dark  stormy night .  a coach  horses gone  plunged through the rickety  useless fence and dropped  tumbling into the gorge below .  it didn   t even strike an outcrop of rock before it hit the dried riverbed far below  and erupted into fragments .  then the oil from the coach lamps ignited and there was a second explosion  out of which rolled   because there are certain conventions  even in tragedy   a burning wheel .   what was strange to susan was that she felt nothing .  she could think sad thoughts  because in the circumstances they had to be sad .  she knew who was in the coach .  but it had already happened .  there was nothing she could do to stop it  because if she   d stopped it  it wouldn   t have happened .  and she was here watching it happen .  so she hadn   t .  so it had .  she felt the logic of the situation dropping into place like a series of huge leaden slabs .   perhaps there was somewhere where it hadn   t happened .  perhaps the coach had skidded the other way  perhaps there had been a convenient rock  perhaps it hadn   t come this way at all  perhaps the coachman had remembered about the sudden curve .  but those possibilities could only exist if there was this one .   this wasn   t her knowledge .  it flowed in from a mind far  far older .   sometimes the only thing you could do for people was to be there .   she rode binky into the shadows by the cliff road  and waited .  after a minute or two there was a clattering of stones and a horse and rider came up an almost vertical path from the riverbed .   binky   s nostrils flared .  parapsychology has no word for the uneasy feeling you have when you   re in the presence of yourself .     susan watched death dismount and stand looking down at the riverbed  leaning on his scythe .   she thought  but he could have done something .   couldn   t he .   the figure straightened  but did not turn around .   yes .  i could have done something .      how   how did you know i was here    .      death waved a hand irritably .   i remember you .  and now understand this  your parents knew that things must happen .  everything must happen somewhere .  do you not think i spoke to them of this .  but i cannot give life .  i can only grant   extension .  changelessness .  only humans can give life .  and they wanted to be human  not immortal .  if it helps you  they died instantly .  instantly .   i   ve got to ask  susan thought .  i   ve got to say it .  or i   m not human .      i could go back and save them    .     only the faintest tremor suggested that the statement was a question .   save .  for what .  a life that has run out .  some things end .  i know this .  sometimes i have thought otherwise .  but   without duty  what am i .  there has to be a law .   he climbed into the saddle and  still without turning to face her  spurred binky out and over the gorge .     there was a haystack behind a livery stable in phedre road .  it bulged for a moment  and there was a muffled swearing .   a fraction of a second later there was a bout of coughing and another  much better  swearword inside a grain silo down near the cattle market .   very shortly after that some rotten floorboards in an old feed store in short street exploded upward  followed by a swearword that bounced off a flour sack .      idiot rodent .     bellowed albert  fingering grain out of his ear .   squeak .      i should think so .  what size do you think i am .      albert brushed hay and flour off his coat and walked over to the window .      ah     he said     let us repair to the mended drum  then .      in albert   s pocket  sand resumed its interrupted journey from future to past .     hibiscus dunelm had decided to close up for an hour .  it was a simple process .  first he and his staff collected any unbroken mugs and glasses .  this didn   t take long .  then there was a desultory search for any weapons with a high resale value  and a quick search of any pockets whose owners were unable to object on account of being drunk  dead  or both .  then the furniture was moved aside and everything else was swept out of the back door and into the broad brown bosom of the river ankh where it piled up and  by degrees  sank .   finally  hibiscus locked and bolted the big front door     it wouldn   t shut .  he looked down .  a boot was wedged in it .      we   re shut     he said .      no  you ain   t .      the door ground back  and albert was inside .      have you seen this person .     he demanded  thrusting a pasteboard oblong in front of dunelm   s eyes .   this was a gross breach of etiquette .  dunelm wasn   t in the kind of job where you survived if you told people you   d seen people .  dunelm could serve drinks all night without seeing anyone .      never seen him before in my life     he said  automatically  without even looking at the card .      you   ve got to help me     said albert     otherwise something dreadful will happen .         push off .      albert kicked the door shut behind him .      just don   t say i didn   t warn you     he said .  on his shoulder the death of rats sniffed the air suspiciously .   a moment later hibiscus was having his chin pressed firmly into the boards of one of his tables .      now  i know he   d come in here     said albert  who wasn   t even breathing heavily     because everyone does  sooner or later .  have another look .         that   s a caroc card     said hibiscus indisctinctly .     that   s death .         that   s right .  he   s the one on the white horse .  you can   t miss him .  only he wouldn   t look like that in here  i expect .         let me get this straight     said the landlord  trying desperately to wriggle out of the iron grip .     you want me to tell you if i   ve seen someone who doesn   t look like that .         he   d have been odd .  odder than most .     albert thought for a moment .     and he   d have drunk a lot  if i know him .  he always does .         this is ankh morpork  you know .         don   t be cheeky  or i   ll get angry .         you mean you   re not angry now .         i   m just impatient .  you can try for angry if you like .         there was   someone   week or so ago .  can   t remember exactly what he looked like           ah .  that   d be him .         drank me dry  complained about the barbarian invader game  got legless  and then           what .         can   t recall .  we just threw him out .         out the back door .         yes .         but that   s just river out there .         well  most people come round before they sink .      squeak  said the death of rats .      did he say anything .     said albert  too busy to pay attention .      something about remembering everything  i think .  he said   he said being drunk didn   t make him forget .  kept going on about doorknobs and   hairy sunlight .         hairy sunlight .         something like that .      and the pressure on hibiscus   s arm was suddenly released .  he waited a second or two and then  very cautiously  turned his head .   there was no one behind him .   very carefully  hibiscus bent down to look under the tables .     albert stepped out into the dawn and  after some fumbling  produced his box .  he opened it and glanced at his lifetimer  then snapped the lid shut .      all right     he said .     what next .      squeak .      what .      and someone hit him across the head .   it wasn   t a killing stroke .  timo laziman of the thieves    guild knew what happened to thieves who killed people .  the assassins    guild came and talked briefly to them   in fact  all they said was    goodbye .      all he   d wanted to do was knock the old man out so that he could rifle his pockets .   he   d not expected the sound as the body hit the ground .  it was like the tinkle of broken glass  but with unpleasant overtones that carried on echoing in timo   s ears long after they should have stopped .   something leapt from the body and whirred into his face .  two skeletal claws grabbed his ears and a bony muzzle jerked forward and hit him hard on the forehead .  he screamed and ran for it .   the death of rats dropped to the ground again and scurried back to albert .  it patted his face  kicked him frantically a few times  and then  in desperation  bit him on the nose .   then the rat grabbed albert   s collar and tried to pull him out of the gutter  but there was a warning tinkle of glass .   the eye sockets turned madly toward the drum   s closed door .  ossified whiskers bristled .   a moment later hibiscus opened the door  if only to stop the thunderous knocking .      i said we   re        someone shot between his legs  paused momentarily to bite him on the ankle  and scuttled toward the back door  nose pressed firmly to the floor .     it was called hide park not because people could  but because a hide was once a measure of land capable of being plowed by one man with three and one half oxen on a wet thursday  and the park was exactly this amount of land  and people in ankh morpork stick to tradition and often to other things as well .   and it had trees  and grass  and a lake with actual fish in it .  and  by one of those twists of civic history  it was a fairly safe place .  people seldom got mugged in hide park .  muggers like somewhere safe to sunbathe  just like everyone else .  it was  as it were  neutral territory .   and it was already filling up  even though there was nothing much to see except the workmen still hammering together a large stage by the lake .  an area behind it had been walled off with strips of cheap sacking nailed to stakes .  occasionally excited people would try to get in and would be thrown into the lake by chrysoprase   s trolls .   among the practicing musicians  crash and his group were immediately noticeable  partly because crash had his shirt off so that jimbo could paint iodine on the wounds .      i thought you were joking     he growled .      i did say it was in your bedroom     said scum .      how   m i going to play my guitar like this .     said crash .      you can   t play your guitar anyway     said noddy .      i mean  look at my hand .  look at it .      they looked at his hand .  jimbo   s mum had put a glove on it after treating the wounds  they hadn   t been very deep  because even a stupid leopard won   t hang around anyone who wants to take its trousers off .      a glove     said crash  in a terrible voice .     whoever heard of a serious musician with a glove .  how can i ever play my guitar with a glove on .         how can you ever play your guitar anyway .         i don   t know why i put up with you three     said crash .     you   re cramping my artistic development .  i   m thinking of leaving and forming my own band .         no you won   t     said jimbo     because you won   t find anyone even worse than us .  let   s face it .  we   re rubbish .      he was voicing a hitherto unspoken yet shared thought .  the other musicians around them were  it was true  quite bad .  but that   s all they were .  some of them had some minor musical talent  as for the rest  they merely couldn   t play .  they didn   t have a drummer who missed the drums and a bass guitarist with the same natural rhythm as a traffic accident .  and they   d generally settled on their name .  they might be unimaginative names  like    a big troll and some other trolls     or    dwarfs with altitude     but at least they knew who they were .      how about we   re a rubbish band .     said noddy  sticking his hands in his pockets .      we may be rubbish     snarled crash     but we   re music with rocks in rubbish .         well  well  and how   s it all going  then .     said dibbler  pushing his way through the sacking .     it won   t be long now   what   re you doing here .         we   re in the program  mr .  dibbler     said crash meekly .      how can you be in the program when i don   t know what you   re called .     said dibbler  waving a hand irritably at one of the posters .     your name up there  is it .         we   re probably where it says ande supporting bands     said noddy .      what happened to your hand .     said dibbler .      my trousers bit it     said crash  glowering at scum .     honest  mr .  dibbler  can   t you give us one more chance .         we   ll see     said dibbler  and strode away .   he was feeling too cheerful to argue much .  the sausages in a bun were selling very fast  but they were just covering minor expenses .  there were ways of making money out of music with rocks in that he   d never thought of   and c . m . o . t .  dibbler thought of money all the time .   for example  there were the shirts .  they were of cotton so cheap and thin that it was practically invisible in a good light and tended to dissolve in the wash .  he   d sold six hundred already .  at five dollars each .  all he had to do was buy them at ten for a dollar from klatchian wholesale trading and pay chalky half a dollar each to print them .   and chalky  with un troll like initiative  had even printed off his own shirts .  they said     chalkies      the scours    thyngs done .     and people were buying them  paying money to advertise chalky   s workshop .  dibbler had never dreamed that the world could work like this .  it was like watching sheep shear themselves .  whatever was causing this reversal of the laws of commercial practice he wanted in big lumps .   he   d already sold the idea to plugger the shoemaker in new cobblers  and a hundred shirts had just walked out of the shop  which was more than plugger   s merchandise usually did .  people wanted clothes just because they had writing on .   he was making money .  thousands of dollars in a day .  and a hundred music traps were lined up in front of the stage  ready to capture buddy   s voice .  if it went on at this rate  in several billion years he   d be rich beyond his wildest dreams .   long live music with rocks in .   there was only one small cloud in this silver lining .   the festival was due to start at noon .  dibbler had planned to put on a lot of the small  bad groups first   that is to say  all of them   and finish with the band .  so there was no reason to worry if they weren   t here right now .   but they weren   t here right now .  dibbler was worried .     a tiny dark figure quartered the shores of the ankh  moving so fast as to be a blur .  it zigzagged desperately back and forth  snuffling .   people didn   t see it .  but they saw the rats .  black  brown and grey  they were leaving the godowns and wharfs by the river  running over one another   s backs in a determined attempt to get as far away as possible .     a haystack heaved  and gave birth to a glod .   he rolled out onto the ground  and groaned .  fine rain was drifting over the landscape .  then he staggered upright  looked around at the rolling fields  and disappeared behind a hedge for the moment .   he trotted back a few seconds later  explored the haystack for a while until he found a part that was lumpier than normal  and kicked it repeatedly with his metal tipped boot .      ow .         c flat     said glod .     good morning  cliff .  hello  world .  i don   t think i can stand life in the fast leyline  you know   the cabbages  the bad beer  all those rats pestering you all the time        cliff crawled out .      i must have had some bad ammonium chloride last night     he said .     is der top of my head still on .         yes .         pity .      they hauled asphalt out by his boots and brought him round by pounding him repeatedly .      you   re our road manager     said glod .     you   re supposed to see no harm comes to us .         well  i   m doing that  ain   t i .     asphalt muttered .     i   m not hitting you  mr .  glod .  where   s buddy .      the three circled the haystack  prodding at bulges which turned out to be damp hay .   they found him on a small rise in the ground  not very far away .  a few holly bushes grew there  carved into curves by the wind .  he was sitting under one  guitar on his knees  rain plastering his hair to his face .   he was asleep  and soaking wet .   on his lap  the guitar played raindrops .      he   s weird     said asphalt .      no     said glod .     he   s wound up by some strange compulsion which leads him through dark pathways .         yeah .  weird .      the rain was slackening off .  cliff glanced at the sky .      sun   s high     he said .      oh  no .     said asphalt .     how long were you asleep .         same as i am awake     said cliff .      it   s almost noon .  where did i leave the horses .  has anyone seen the cart .  someone wake him up .      a few minutes later they were back on the road .      an    you know what .     said cliff .     we left so quick last night i never did know if she turned up .         what was her name .     said glod .      dunno     said the troll .      oh  that   s real love  that is     said glod .      ain   t you got any romance in your soul .     said cliff .      eyes crossed in a crowded room .     said glod .     no  not really        they were pushed aside as buddy leaned forward .      shut up     he said .  the voice was low and contained no trace whatsover of humor .      we were only joking     said glod .      don   t .      asphalt concentrated on the road  aware of the general lack of amiability .      i expect you   re looking forward to the festival  eh .     he said  after a while .   no one replied .      i expect there   ll be big crowds     he said .   there was silence  except for the clatter of the hooves and the rattle of the cart .  they were in the hills now  where the road wound alongside a gorge .  there wasn   t even a river down there  except in the wettest season .  it was a gloomy area .  asphalt felt that it was getting gloomier .      i expect you   ll really have fun     he said  eventually .      asphalt .     said glod .      yes  mr .  glod .         watch the road  will you .        the archchancellor polished his staff as he walked along .  it was a particularly good one  six feet long and quite magical .  not that he used magic very much .  in his experience  anything that couldn   t be disposed of with a couple of whacks from six feet of oak was probably immune to magic as well .      don   t you think we should have brought the senior wizards  sir .     said ponder  struggling to keep up .      i   m afraid that taking them along in their present frame of mind would only make whatever happens      ridcully sought for a useful phrase  and settled for      happen worse .  i   ve insisted they stay in college .         how about drongo and the others .     said ponder hopefully .      would they be any good in the event of a thaumaturgical dimension rip of enormous proportions .     said ridcully .     i remember poor old mr .  hong .  one minute he was dishing up an order of double cod and mushy peas  the next           kaboom .     said ponder .         kaboom .        said ridcully  forcing his way up the crowded street .     not that i heard tell .  more like    aaaaerrrrscream gristle gristle gristle crack    and a shower of fried food .  big mad adrian and his friends any good when the chips are down .         um .  probably not  archchancellor .         correct .  people shout and run about .  that never did any good .  a pocket full of decent spells and a well charged staff will get you out of trouble nine times out of ten .         nine times out of ten .         correct .         how many times have you had to rely on them  sir .         well   there was mr .  hong   that business with the thing in the bursar   s wardrobe   that dragon  you remember       ridcully   s lips moved silently as he counted on his fingers .     nine times  so far .         it worked every time  sir .         absolutely .  so there   s no need to worry .  gangway .  wizard comin    through .        the city gates were open .  glod leaned forward as the cart rumbled in .      don   t go straight to the park     he said .      but we   re late     said asphalt .      this won   t take long .  go to the street of cunning artificers first .         that   s right on the other side of the river .         it   s important .  we   ve got to pick up something .      people flocked the streets .  this wasn   t unusual  except that this time most of them were moving the same way .      and you get down in the back of the cart     said glod to buddy .     we don   t want young women trying to rip your clothes off  eh  buddy    .      he turned .  buddy had gone to sleep again .      speaking for myself       cliff began .      you   ve only got a loincloth     said glod .      well  dey could grab it  couldn   t dey .      the cart threaded its way through the streets until it turned into cunning artificers .   it was a street of tiny shops .  in this street you could have anything made  repaired  crafted  rebuilt  copied  or forged .  furnaces glowed in every doorway  smelters smoked in every backyard .  makers of intricate clockwork eggs worked alongside armourers .  carpenters worked next door to men who carved ivory into tiny shapes so delicate that they used grasshoppers    legs  cast in bronze  for saws .  at least one in every four craftsmen was making tools to be used by the other three .  shops didn   t just abut  they overlapped  if a carpenter had a big table to make  he relied on the goodwill of his neighbors to make space  so that he   d be working at one end of it while two jewelers and a potter were using the other end as a bench .  there were shops where you could drop in to be measured in the morning and pick up a complete suit of chain mail with an extra pair of pants in the afternoon .   the cart stopped outside one small shop and glod leapt down and went inside .   asphalt heard the conversation      have you done it .         here you are  mister .  right as rain .         will it play .  you know i said where you have to have spent a fortnight wrapped in a bullock hide behind a waterfall before you should touch one of these things .         listen  mister  for this kind of money it had me in the shower for five minutes with a chamois leather on me head .  don   t tell me that   s not good enough for folk music .      there was a pleasant sound  which hung in the air for a moment before being lost in the busy din of the street .      we said twenty dollars  right .         no  you said twenty dollars .  i said twenty five dollars     said a cunning voice .      just a minute  then .      glod came out  and nodded at cliff .      all right     he said .     he   s too cunning for me .  cough up .      cliff growled  but fumbled for a moment somewhere at the back of his mouth .   they heard the cunning artificer say     what the hell   s that .         a molar .  got to be worth at least           it   ll do .      glod came out again with a sack  which he tucked under the seat .      okay     he said .     head for the park .        they went in through one of the back gates .  or  at least  tried to .  two trolls barred their way .  they had the glossy marble patina of chrysoprase   s basic gang thugs .  he didn   t have henchmen .  most trolls weren   t clever enough to hench .      dis is for der bands     one said .      dat   s right     said the other one .      we are the band     said asphalt .      which one .     said the first troll .     i got a list here .         dat   s right .         we   re the band with rocks in     said glod .      hah  you ain   t them .  i   ve seen them .  dere   s a guy with this glow round him  and when he plays der guitar it goes        whauauauaummmmm eeeee gngngn .      dat   s right        the chord curled around the cart .   buddy was standing up  guitar at the ready .      oh  wow     said the first troll .     this are amazing .     he fumbled in his loincloth and produced a dog eared piece of paper .     you couldn   t write your name down  could you .  my boy clay  he won   t believe i met           yes  yes     said buddy wearily .     pass it up .         only it not for me  it for my boy clay       said the troll  jumping from one foot to the other in excitement .      how d   you spell it .         it don   t matter  he can   t read anyway .         listen     said glod  as the cart trundled into the backstage area .     someone   s already playing .  i said we        dibbler hurried up .      what kept you .     he said .     you   ll be on soon .  right after   boyz from the wood .  how did it go .  asphalt  come here .      he pulled the small troll into the shadows at the back of the stage .      you brought me some money .     he said .      about three thousand           not so loud .         i   m only whispering it  mr .  dibbler .      dibbler looked around carefully .  there was no such thing as a whisper in ankh morpork when the sum involved had the word    thousand    in it somewhere  people could hear you think that kind of money in ankh morpork .      you be sure and keep an eye on it  right .  there   s going to be more before this day   s out .  i   ll give chrysoprase his seven hundred dollars and the rest is all prof       he caught asphalt   s beady little eye and remembered himself .     of course  there   s depreciation   overheads   advertising   market research   buns   mustard   basically  i   ll be lucky if i break even .  i   m practically cutting me own throat in this deal .         yes  mr .  dibbler .      asphalt peered around the edge of the stage .      who   s that playing now  mr .  dibbler .            and you .            sorry  mr .  dibbler .         only they write it   u     said dibbler .  he relaxed a little and pulled out a cigar .     don   t ask me why .  the right kind of name for musicians ought to be something like blondie and his merry troubadours .  are they any good .         don   t you know  mr .  dibbler .         it   s not what i call music     said dibbler .     when i was a lad we had proper music with real words      summer is icumen in  lewdly sing cuckoo     that sort of thing .      asphalt looked at   u again .      well  it   s got a beat and you can dance to it     he said     but they   re not very good .  i mean  people are just watching them .  they don   t just watch when the band are playing  mr .  dibbler .         you   re right     said dibbler .  he looked at the front of the stage .  in between the candles were a row of music traps .      you   d better go and tell them to get ready .  i think this lot are running out of ideas .           um .  buddy .      he looked up from his guitar .  some of the other musicians were tuning theirs  but he   d found he never had to .  he couldn   t  anyway .  the pegs didn   t move .      what is it .         um     said glod .  he waved vaguely at cliff  who grinned sheepishly and produced the sack from behind his back .      this is   well  we thought   that is  all of us     said glod     that   well  we saw it  you see  and i know you said it couldn   t be repaired but there   s people in this city that can do just about anything so we asked around  and we knew how much it meant to you  and there   s this man in the street of cunning artificers and he said he thought he could do it and it cost cliff another tooth but here you are anyway because you   re right  we   re on top of the music business right enough and it   s because of you and we know how much this meant to you so it   s a sort of thank you present  well  go on then  give it to him .      cliff  who   d lowered his arm again as the sentence began to extend  pushed the sack toward the puzzled buddy .   asphalt poked his head through the sacking .      we guys better get on the stage     he said .     come on .      buddy put down the guitar .  he opened the sack  and began to pull at the linen wrappings inside .      it   s been tuned and everything     said cliff helpfully .   the harp gleamed in the sun as the last wrapping came off .      they can do amazing things with glue and stuff     said glod .     i mean  i know you said there wasn   t anyone left in llamedos that could repair it .  but this is ankh morpork .  we can fix nearly everything .         please .     said asphalt  as his head reappeared .     mr .  dibbler says you   ve got to come  they   ve started to throw things .         i don   t know much about strings     said glod     but i had a go .  sounds   kind of nice .         i   er   don   t know what to say     said buddy .   the chanting was like a hammer .      i   won this     said imp y celyn  sometimes known as buddy  in a small  distant world of his own .     with a song .     sioni bod da     it was .  i worked on it alll winter .  alll about   home  you know .  and going away  see .  and trees and things .  the judges were   very plllleased .  they said that in fifty years i might realllly understand music .      he pulled the harp toward him .     dibbler pushed his way through the rabble of musicians backstage until he found asphalt .      well .     he said .     where are they .         they   re just sitting around talking  mr .  dibbler .         listen     said dibbler .     you hear the crowd .  it   s music with rocks in they want .  if they don   t get it   they   d just better get it  all right .  letting the anticipation build up is all very well but   i want them onstage right now .        buddy stared at his fingers .  then he looked up  white faced  at the other bands milling around .      you   with the guitar       he said hoarsely .      me  sir .         give it to me .      every nascent group in ankh morpork was in awe of the band with rocks in .  the guitarist handed his instrument over with the expression of one passing over a holy item to be blessed .   buddy stared at it .  it was one of mr .  wheedown   s best .   he struck a chord .   the sound sounded like lead would sound if you could make guitar strings out of it .      okay  boys  what   s the problem .     said dibbler  hurrying toward them .     there   s six thousand ears out there waiting to be filled up with music and you   re still sitting around .      buddy handed the guitar back to the musician and swung his own instrument around on its strap .  he played a few notes that seemed to twinkle in the air .      but i can play this     he said .     oh  yes .         right  good  now get up there and play it     said dibbler .      someone else give me a guitar .      musicians fell over themselves to hand them to him .  he strummed frantically at a couple .  but the notes weren   t simply flat .  flat would have been an improvement .     the musicians    guild contingent had managed to secure an area close to the stage by the simple expedient of hitting any encroachers very hard .   mr .  clete scowled at the stage .      i don   t understand     he said .     it   s rubbish .  it   s all the same .  it   s just noise .  what   s so good about it .      satchelmouth  who had twice had to stop himself tapping his feet  said     we haven   t had the main band yet .  er .  are you sure you want to           we   re within our rights     said clete .  he looked around at the shouting people .     there   s a hot dog seller over there .  anyone else fancy a hot dog .  hot dog .     the guild men nodded .     hot dog .  right .  that   s three hot d        the audience cheered .  it wasn   t the way that an audience normally applauds  with it starting at one point and rippling outward  but all at once  every single mouth opening at the same time .   cliff had knuckled onto the stage .  he sat down behind his rocks and looked desperately back toward the wings .   glod trailed on  blinking in the lights .   and that seemed to be it .  the dwarf turned and said something which was lost in the noise  and then stood looking awkward while the cheers gradually subsided .   buddy came on  staggering slightly as if he   d been pushed .   up until then mr .  clete had thought the crowd were yelling .  and then he realized that it had been a mere murmur of approval compared to what was happening now .   it went on and on while the boy stood there  head bowed .      but he   s not doing anything     clete shouted into satchelmouth   s ear .     why   re they all cheering him for not doing anything .         can   t say  sir     said satchelmouth .   he looked around at the glistening  staring  hungry faces  feeling like an atheist who has wandered into holy communion .   the applause went on .  it redoubled again when buddy slowly raised his hands to the guitar .      he   s not doing anything .     screamed clete .      he   s got us bang to rights  sir     satchelmouth bellowed .     he   s not guilty of playing without belonging to the guild if he doesn   t play .      buddy looked up .   he stared at the audience so intently that clete craned to see what it was the wretched boy was staring at .   it was nothing .  there was a patch of it right in front of the stage .  people were packed tight everywhere else but there  right in front of the stage  was a little area of cleared grass .  it seemed to rivet buddy   s attention .      uh huh huh        clete rammed his hands over his ears but the force of the cheering made his head echo .   and then  very gradually  layer by layer  it died away .  it yielded to the sound of thousands of people being very quiet  which was somehow  satchelmouth thought  a lot more dangerous .     glod glanced at cliff  who made a face .   buddy was still standing  staring at the audience .   if he doesn   t play  glod thought  then we   ve had it .   he hissed at asphalt  who sidled over .      is the cart ready .         yes  mr .  glod .         you filled up the horses with oats .         just like you said  mr .  glod .         okay .      the silence was velvet .  and it had that quality of suction found in the patrician   s study and in holy places and deep canyons  engendering in people a terrible desire to shout or sing or yell their name .  it was a silence that demanded  fill me up .   somewhere in the darkness  someone coughed .     asphalt heard his name hissed from the side of the stage .  with extreme reluctance he sidled over to the darkness  where dibbler was frantically beckoning him .      you know that bag .     said dibbler .      yes  mr .  dibbler .  i put it        dibbler held up two small but very heavy sacks .      tip these in and be ready to leave in a big hurry .         yes  that   s right  mr .  dibbler  because glod said           do it now .        glod looked around .  if i throw away the horn and helmet and this chain mail shirt  he thought  i might just get out of here alive .  what   s he doing .   buddy put down the guitar and walked into the wings .  he returned before the audience had realized what was happening .  he was carrying the harp .   he stood facing the audience .   glod  who was closest to him  heard him murmur     just once .  cwm on .  just one more time .  and then i   lll do whatefer you want  see .  i   ll pay for it .      there were a few faint chords from the guitar .   buddy said     i mean it  see .      there was another chord .      just once .      buddy smiled at a empty space in the audience  and began to play .     every note was sharp as a bell and as simple as sunlight   so that in the prism of the brain it broke up and flashed into a million colors .   glod   s mouth hung open .  and then the music unfolded in his head .  it wasn   t music with rocks in  although it used the same doors .  the fall of the notes conjured up memories of the mine where he   d been born  and dwarf bread just like mum used to hammer out of her anvil  and the moment when he   d first realized that he   d fallen in love .   he remembered life in the caves under copperhead  before the city had called him  and more than anything else he wanted to be home .  he   d never realized that humans could sing hole .   cliff laid aside his hammers .  the same notes crept into his corroded ears  but in his mind they became quarries and moorlands .  he told himself  as emotion filled his head with its smoke  that right after this he was going to go back and see how his old mum was  and never leave ever again .   mr .  dibbler found his own mind spawn strange and disturbing thoughts .  they involved things you couldn   t sell and shouldn   t pay for       the lecturer in recent runes thumped the crystal ball .      the sound is a bit tinny     he said .      get out of the way  i can   t see     said the dean .   recent runes sat down again .   they stared at the little image .      this doesn   t sound like music with rocks in     said the bursar .      shut up     said the dean .  he blew his nose .   it was sad music .  but it waved the sadness like a battle flag .  it said the universe had done all it could but you were still alive .   the dean  who was as impressionable as a dollop of warm wax  wondered if he could learn to play the harmonica .     the last note faded .   there was no applause .  the audience sagged a little  as each individual came down from whatever reflective corner they   d been occupying .  one or two of them murmured things like    yeah  that   s how it is     or    you an    me both  brother .     a lot of people blew their noses  sometimes on other people .   and then reality snuck back in  as it always does .   glod heard buddy say  very quietly     thank you .      the dwarf leaned sideways and said  out of the corner of his mouth      what was that .      buddy seemed to shake himself awake .      what .  oh .  it   s called    sioni bod da .     what do you think .         it   s got   hole     said glod .     it   s definitely got hole .      cliff nodded .  when you   re a long way from the old familiar mine or mountain  when you   re lost among strangers  when you   re just a great big aching nothingness inside   only then can you really sing hole .      she   s watching us     whispered buddy .      the invisible girl .     said glod  staring at the empty grass .      yes .         ah  yes .  i can definitely not see her .  good .  and now  if you don   t play music with rocks in this time  we   re dead .      buddy picked up the guitar .  the strings trembled under his fingers .  he felt elated .  he   d been allowed to play it in front of them .  everything else was unimportant now .  whatever happened next didn   t matter .      you ain   t heard nothing yet     he said .   he stamped his foot .      one  two  one two three four        glod had time to recognize the tune before the music took him .  he   d heard it only a few seconds before .  but now it swung .     ponder peered into his box .      i think we   re trapping this  archchancellor     he said     but i don   t know what it is .      ridcully nodded  and scanned the audience .  they were listening with their mouths open .  the harp had scoured their souls  and now the guitar was hot wiring their spines .   and there was an empty patch near the stage .   ridcully put a hand over one eye and focused until the other eye watered .  then he smiled .   he turned to look at the musicians    guild and saw  to his horror  that satchelmouth was raising a crossbow .  he seemed to be doing it with reluctance  mr .  clete was prodding him .   ridcully raised a finger and appeared to scratch his nose .   even above the sound of the playing he heard the twang as the crossbow   s string broke and  to his secret delight  a yelp from mr .  clete as a loose end caught his ear .  he hadn   t even thought of that .      i   m just an old softy  that   s my trouble     ridcully said to himself .     hat .  hat .  hat .           you know  this was an extremely good idea     said the bursar  as the tiny images moved in the crystal ball .     what an excellent way to see things .  could we perhaps have a look at the opera house .         how about the skunk club in brewer street .     said the senior wrangler .      why .     said the bursar .      just a thought     said the senior wrangler quickly .     i   ve never been in there at all in any way  you understand .         we really shouldn   t be doing this     said the lecturer in recent runes .     it   s really not a proper use of a magic crystal           i can   t think of a better use of a magic crystal     said the dean     than to see people playing music with rocks in .        mr .  scrub  the duck man  coffin henry  arnold sideways  foul ole ron and foul ole ron   s smell and foul ole ron   s dog ambled around the edges of the crowd .  pickings had been particularly good .  they always were when dibbler   s hot dogs were on sale .  there were some things people wouldn   t eat even under the influence of music with rocks in .  there were some things even mustard couldn   t disguise .   arnold gathered up the scraps and put them in a basket on his trolley .  there was going to be the prince of a primal soup under the bridge tonight .   the music had poured over them .  they ignored it .  music with rocks in was the stuff of dreams  and there were no dreams under the bridge .   then they   d stopped  and listened  as new music poured out over the park and took every man and woman and thing by the hand and showed him or her or it the way home .   the beggars stood and listened  mouths open .  someone looking from face to face  if anyone did look at the invisible beggars  would have had to turn away     except from mr .  scrub .  you couldn   t turn away there .   when the band were playing music with rocks in again the beggars got back down to earth .   except for mr .  scrub .  he just stood and stared .     the last note rang out .   then  as the tsunami of applause began to roll  the band ran off the stage .   dibbler watched happily from the wings at the other side of the stage .  he   d been a bit worried for a while there  but it all seemed back on course now .   someone tugged at his sleeve .      what   re they doing  mr .  dibbler .      dibbler turned .      scum  isn   t it .     he said .      it   s crash  mr .  dibbler .         what they   re doing  scum  is not giving the audience what they want     said dibbler .     superb business practice .  wait till they   re screaming for it  and then take it away .  you wait .  by the time the crowd is stamping its feet they   ll come prancing back on again .  superb timing .  when you learn that sort of trick  scum           it   s crash  mr .  dibbler .            then maybe you   ll know how to play music with rocks in .  music with rocks in  scum              crash           isn   t just music     said dibbler  pulling some cotton wool out of his ears .     it   s lots of things .  don   t ask me how .      dibbler lit a cigar .  the din made the match flame flicker .      any minute now     he said .     you   ll see .        there was a fire that had been made of old boots and mud .  a grey shape circled it  snuffling excitedly .        get on  get on  get on .         mr .  dibbler   s not going to like this     moaned asphalt .      tough one for mr .  dibbler     said glod  as they hauled buddy into the cart .     now i want to see those hooves spark  know what i mean .         head for quirm     said buddy  as the cart jerked into motion .  he didn   t know why .  it just seemed the right destination .      not a good idea     said glod .     people   ll probably want to ask questions about that cart i pulled out of the swimming pool .         head toward quirm .         mr .  dibbler   s really not going to like this     said asphalt  as the cart swung out onto the road .        any   moment   now     said dibbler .      i expect so     said crash .     because they   re stamping their feet  i think .      there was indeed a certain thumping under the cheers .      you wait     said dibbler .     they   ll judge it just right .  no problem .  akk .         you   re supposed to put your cigar in your mouth the other way round  mr .  dibbler     said crash meekly .     the waning moon lit the landscape as the cart bounced out of the gates and along the quirm road .      how did you know i   d got the cart made ready .     said glod  as they landed after a brief flight .      i didn   t     said buddy .      but you ran out .         yes .         why .         it was   just   time .         why d   you want to go to quirm .     said cliff .      i   i can get a boat home  can   t i .     said buddy .     that   s right .  a boat home .      glod glanced at the guitar .  this felt wrong .  it couldn   t just   and then they   d just walk away     he shook his head .  what could go wrong now .      mr .  dibbler   s really not going to like this     moaned asphalt .      oh  shut up     said glod .     i don   t know what he   s got not to like .         well  for a start     said asphalt     the main thing  the thing he won   t like most  is   um   we   ve got the money        cliff reached down under the seat .  there was a dull  clinking noise  of the sort made by a lot of gold keeping nice and quiet .     the stage was trembling with the vibration of the stamping .  there was some shouting now .   dibbler turned to crash and grinned horribly .      hey  i   ve just had a great idea     he said .     a tiny shape swarmed up the road from the river .  ahead of it  the lights of the stage glowed in the dusk .     the archchancellor nudged ponder and flourished his staff .      now     he said     if there   s a sudden rip in reality and horrible screaming things come through  our job is to       he scratched his head .     what is it the dean says .  kick a righteous donkey .         some righteous ass  sir     said ponder .     he says kick some righteous ass .      ridcully peered at the empty stage .      i don   t see one     he said .     the four members of the band sat up and stared straight ahead  over the moonlit plain .   finally cliff broke the silence .      how much .         best part of five thousand dollars           five thousand dol    .      cliff clamped his huge hand over glod   s mouth .      why .     said cliff  as the dwarf squirmed .      mmf mmfmmf mmfmmfs .         i got a bit confused     said asphalt .     sorry .         we   ll never get far enough     said cliff .     you know dat .  not even if we die .         i tried to tell you all .     asphalt moaned .     maybe   maybe we could take it back .         mmf mmf mmf .         how can we do dat .         mmf mmf mmf .         glod     said cliff  in a reasonable tone of voice     i   m going to take my hand away .  and you   re not to shout .  right .         mmf .         okay .         take it back .  five thousand dol   mmf mmfmmf           i suppose some of dat is ours     said cliff  tightening his grip .      mmf .         i know i haven   t had any wages     said asphalt .      let   s get to quirm     said buddy urgently .     we can take out what   s   ours and send the rest back to him .      cliff scratched his chin with his free hand .      some of it belongs to chrysoprase     said asphalt .     mr .  dibbler borrowed some money off him to set up the festival .         we won   t get away from him     said cliff     except if we drive all der way to der rim and chuck ourselves over .  and even den  only maybe .         we could explain   couldn   t   we    .     said asphalt .   a vision of chrsyoprase   s gleaming marble head formed in their vision .      mmf .         no .         quirm  then     said buddy .   cliff   s diamond teeth glittered in the moonlight .      i thought       he said     i thought   i heard something on der road back there .  sounded like harness          the invisible beggars began to wander away from the park .  foul ole ron   s smell had stayed on for a while  because it was enjoying the music .  and mr .  scrub still hadn   t moved .      we got nearly twenty sausages     said arnold sideways .   coffin henry coughed a cough with bones in it .      buggrem .     said foul ole ron     i told    em  spying    on me with rays .      something bounded across the trodden turf toward mr .  scrub  ran up his robe  and grabbed either side of his hood with both paws .   there was the hollow sound of two skulls meeting .   mr .  scrub staggered backward .   squeak .   mr .  scrub blinked and sat down suddenly .   the beggars stared down at the little figure jumping up and down on the cobbles .  being of an invisible nature themselves  they were naturally good at seeing things unseen by other men or  in the case of foul ole ron  by any known eyeball .      that   s a rat     said the duck man .      buggrit     said foul ole ron .   the rat pranced in circles on its hind legs  squeaking loudly .  mr .  scrub blinked again .  and death stood up .   i have to go  he said .   squeak .   death strode away  stopped  and came back .  he pointed a skeletal finger at the duck man .   why  he said  are you walking around with that duck .      what duck .      ah .  sorry .        listen  how can it go wrong .     said crash  waving his hands frantically .     it   s got to work .  everyone knows that when you get your big chance because the star is ill or something  then the audience   ll go mad for you .  it happens every time  right .      jimbo  noddy  and scum peered around the curtain at the pandemonium .  they nodded uncertainly .   of course things always went well when you had your big chance .      we could do    anarchy in ankh morpork        said jimbo doubtfully .      we haven   t got that right     said noddy .      yeah  but there   s nothing new about that .         i suppose we could give it a try           excellent .     said crash .  he raised his guitar defiantly .     we can do it .  for the sake of sex and drugs and music with rocks in .      he was aware of their disbelieving stares .      you never said you   d had any drugs     said jimbo accusingly .      if it comes to that     said noddy     i don   t reckon you   ve ever had           one out of three ain   t bad .     shouted crash .      yes it is  it   s only thirty three per           shut up .        people were stamping their feet and clapping their hands derisively .   ridcully squinted along his staff .      there was the holy st .  bobby     he said .     i suppose he was a righteous ass  come to think about it .         sorry .     said ponder .      he was a donkey     said ridcully .     hundreds of years ago .  got made a bishop in the omnian church for carrying some holy man  i believe .  can   t get more righteous than that .         no   no   no   archchancellor     said ponder .     it   s just a sort of military saying .  it means   the   you know  sir   backside .         i wonder how we tell which bit that is .     said ridcully .     the creatures from the dungeon dimensions have legs and things all over the place .         i don   t know  sir     said ponder wearily .      perhaps we   d just better kick everything  to be on the safe side .        death caught up with the rat near the brass bridge .   no one had disturbed albert .  since he was in the gutter  he   d become nearly as invisible as coffin henry .   death rolled his sleeve up .  his hand moved through the fabric of albert   s coat as if it was mist .   daft old fool always took it with him  he muttered .  i can   t imagine what he thought i   d do with it     the hand came out  cupping a fragment of curved glass .  a pinch of sand glittered on it .   thirty four seconds  said death .  he handed the glass to the rat .  find something to put this in .  and don   t drop it .   he stood up  and surveyed the world .   there was the glong glong glong noise of an empty beer bottle bouncing on the stones as the death of rats trotted back out of the mended drum .   thirty four seconds of sand orbited slightly erratically inside it .   death hauled his servant to his feet .  no time was passing for albert .  his eyes were glazed  his body clock idled .  he hung from his master   s arm like a cheap suit .   death snatched the bottle from the rat and tilted it gently .  a bit of life began to flow .   where is my granddaughter .  he said .  you have to tell me .  otherwise i can   t know .   albert   s eyes clicked open .      she   s trying to save the boy  master .     he said .     she doesn   t know the meaning of the word duty        death tipped the bottle back .  albert froze in mid sentence .   but we do  don   t we  said death bitterly .  you and me .   he nodded to the death of rats .   look after him  he said .   death snapped his fingers .   nothing happened  apart from the click .   er .  this is very embarrassing .  she has some of my power .  i do seem momentarily unable to   er     the death of rats squeaked helpfully .   no .  you look after him .  i know where they   re going .  history likes cycles .   death looked at the towers of unseen university  rising over the rooftops .   and somewhere in this town is a horse i can ride .        hold on .  something   s coming       ridcully glared at the stage .     what are they .      ponder stared .      i think   they may be human  sir .      the crowd had stopped stamping its collective feet and watching in a sullen     this had better be good    silence .   crash stepped forward with a big mad glossy grin on his face .      yes  but any minute they   ll split down the middle and gharstely creatures will come out     said ridcully hopefully .   crash hefted his guitar and played a chord .      my word .     said ridcully .      sir .         that sounded exactly like a cat trying to go to the lavatory through a sewn up bum .      ponder looked aghast .     sir  you   re not telling me you ever           no  but that   s what it   d sound like  sure enough .  exactly like that .      the crowd hovered  uncertain of this new development .      hello  ankh morpork .     said crash .  he nodded at scum  who hit his drums at the second attempt .   ande supporting bands launched into its first and  in the event  last number .  three last numbers  in fact .  crash was trying for    anarchy in ankh morpork     jimbo had frozen because he couldn   t see himself in a mirror and was playing the only page he could remember from blert wheedown   s book  which was the index  and noddy had got his fingers caught in the strings .   as far as scum was concerned  tunes    names were things that happened to other people .  he was concentrating on the rhythm .  most people don   t have to .  but for scum  even clapping his hands was an exercise in concentration .  so he played in a small contented world of his own  and didn   t even notice the audience rise like a bad meal and hit the stage .     sergeant colon and corporal nobbs were on duty at the deosil gate  sharing a comradely cigarette and listening to the distant roar of the festival .      sounds like a big night     said corporal nobbs .      right enough  sarge .         sounds like some trouble .         good job we   re out of it  sarge .      a horse came clattering up the street  its rider struggling to keep on .  as it got closer they made out the contorted features of c . m . o . t .  dibbler  riding with the ease of a sack of potatoes .      did a cart just go through here .     he demanded .      which one  throat .     said sergeant colon .      what do you mean  which one .         well  there was two     said the sergeant .     one with a couple of trolls in  and one with mr .  clete just after that .  you know  the musicians    guild           oh  no .      dibbler pummeled the horse into action again and bounced off into the night .      what was that about .     said nobby .      someone probably owes him a penny     said sergeant colon  leaning on his spear .   there was the sound of another horse approaching .  the watchmen flattened themselves against the wall as it thundered past .   it was big  and white .  the rider   s black cloak streamed in the wind  as did her hair .  there was a rush of wind and then they were gone  out onto the plains .   nobby stared after it .      that was her     he said .      who .         susan death .        the light in the crystal faded to a dot and winked out .      that   s three days    worth of magic i won   t see again     the senior wrangler complained .      worth every thaum     said the chair of indefinite studies .      not as good as seeing them live  though     said the lecturer in recent runes .     there   s something about the way the sweat drips on you .         i thought it ended just as it was getting good     said the chair .     i thought        the wizards went rigid as the howl rang through the building .  it was slightly animal but also mineral  metallic  edged like a saw .   eventually the lecturer in recent runes said     of course  just because we   ve heard a spine chilling bloodcurdling scream of the sort to make your very marrow freeze in your bones doesn   t automatically mean there   s anything wrong .      the wizards looked out into the corridor .      it came from downstairs somewhere     said the chair of indefinite studies  heading for the staircase .      so why are you going upstairs .         because i   m not daft .         but it might be some terrible emanation .         you don   t say .     said the chair  still accelerating .      all right  please yourself .  that   s the students floor up there .         ah .  er        the chair came down slowly  occasionally glancing fearfully up the stairs .      look  nothing can get in     said the senior wrangler .     this place is protected by very powerful spells .         that   s right     said recent runes .      and i   m sure we   ve all been strengthening them periodically  as is our duty     said the senior wrangler .      er .  yes .  yes .  of course     said recent runes .   the sound came again .  there was a slow  pulsating rhythm in the roar .      the library  i think     said the senior wrangler .      anyone seen the librarian lately .         he always seems to be carrying something when i see him .  you don   t think he   s up to something occult  do you .         this is a magical university .         yes  but more occult is what i mean .         keep together  will you .         i am together .         for if we are united  what can possibly harm us .         well       a great big           shut up .      the dean opened the library door .  it was warm  and velvety quiet .  occasionally a book would rustle its pages or clank its chains restlessly .   a silvery light was coming from the stairway to the basement .  there was also the occasional    ook .         he doesn   t sound very upset     said the bursar .   the wizards crept down the steps .  there was no mistaking the door   the light streamed from it .   the wizards stepped into the cellar .   they stopped breathing .   it was on a raised dais in the center of the floor  with candles all around it .   it was music with rocks in .     a tall dark figure skidded around the corner into sator square and  accelerating  pounded through the gateway of unseen university .   it was seen only by modo  the dwarf gardener  as he happily wheeled his manure barrow through the twilight .  it had been a good day .  most days were  in his experience .   he hadn   t heard about the festival .  he hadn   t heard about music with rocks in .  modo didn   t hear about most things  because he wasn   t listening .  he liked compost .  next to compost he liked roses  because they were something to compost the compost for .   he was by nature a contented dwarf  who took in his short stride all the additional problems of gardening in a high magical environment  such as greenfly  whitefly  and lurching things with tentacles .  proper lawn maintenance could be a real problem when things from another dimension were allowed to slither over it .   someone pounded across it and disappeared through the doorway of the library .   modo looked at the marks and said     oh  dear .        the wizards started breathing again .      oh  my     said the lecturer in recent runes .      rave in       said the senior wrangler .      now that   s what i call music with rocks in     sighed the dean .  he stepped forward with the rapt expression of a miser in a gold mine .   the candlelight glittered off black and silver .  there was a lot of both .      oh  my     said the lecturer in recent runes .  it was like some kind of incantation .      i say  isn   t that my nose hair mirror .     said the bursar  breaking the spell .     that   s my nose hair mirror  i   m sure        except that while the black was black the silver wasn   t really silver .  it was whatever mirrors and bits of shiny tin and tinsel and wire the librarian had been able to scrounge and bend into shape           it   s got the little silver frame   why   s it on that two wheeled cart .  two wheels one after the other .  ridiculous .  it   ll fall over  depend upon it .  and where   s the horse going to go  may i ask .      the senior wrangler tapped him gently on the shoulder .      bursar .  word to the wizard  old chap .         yes .  what is it .         i think if you don   t stop talking this minute  the dean will kill you .      there were two small cart wheels  one behind the other  with a saddle in between them .  in front of the saddle was a pipe with a complicated double curve in it  so that someone sitting in the saddle would be able to get a grip .   the rest was junk .  bones and tree branches and a jackdaw   s banquet of geegaws .  a horse   s skull was strapped over the front wheel  and feathers and beads hung from every point .   it was junk  but as it stood in the flickering glow it had a dark  organic quality   not exactly life  but something dynamic and disquieting and coiled and potent that was making the dean vibrate on his feet .  it radiated something that suggested that  just by existing and looking like it did  it was breaking at least nine laws and twenty three guidelines .      is he in love .     said the bursar .      make it go .     said the dean .     it   s got to go .  it   s meant to go .         yes  but what is it .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      it   s a masterpiece     said the dean .     a triumph .         oook .         perhaps you have to push it along with your feet .     whispered the senior wrangler .   the dean shook his head in a preoccupied way .      we   re wizards  aren   t we .     he said .     i expect we could make it go .      he walked around the circle .  the draft from his studded leather robe made the candle flames waver and the shadows of the thing danced on the wall .   the senior wrangler bit his lip .     not too certain about that     he said .     looks like it   s got more than enough magic in it as it is .  is it   er   is it breathing or is that just my imagination .      the senior wrangler spun around and waved a finger at the librarian .      you built it .     he barked .   the orang utan shook his head .      oook .         what   d he say .         he said he didn   t build it  he just put it together     said the dean  without turning his head .      ook .         i   m going to sit on it     said the dean .   the other wizards felt something draining out of their souls and sudden uncertainty sloshing into its place .      i wouldn   t do that if i were you  old chap     said the senior wrangler .     you don   t know where it might take you .         don   t care     said the dean .  he still didn   t take his eyes off the thing .      i mean it   s not of this world     said the senior wrangler .      i   ve been of this world for more than seventy years     said the dean     and it is extremely boring .      he stepped into the circle and put his hand on the thing   s saddle .   it trembled .   excuse me .   the tall dark figure was suddenly there  in the doorway  and then in a few strides was in the circle .   a skeletal hand dropped onto the dean   s shoulder and propelled him gently but unstoppably aside .   thank you .   the figure vaulted into the saddle and reached out for the handlebars .  it looked down at the thing it bestrode .   some situations you had to get exactly right     a finger pointed at the dean .   i need your clothes .   the dean backed away .      what .      give me your coat .   the dean  with great reluctance  shrugged off his leather robe and handed it over .   death put it on .  that was better     now  let me see     a blue glow flickered under his fingers and spread in jagged blue lines  forming a corona at the tip of every feather and bead .      we   re in a cellar .     said the dean .     doesn   t that matter .      death gave him a look .   no .     modo straightened up  and paused to admire his rose bed  which contained the finest display of pure black roses he   d ever managed to produce .  a high magical environment could be useful  sometimes .  their scent hung on the evening air like an encouraging word .   the flower bed erupted .   modo had a brief vision of flames and something arcing into the sky before his vision was blotted out by a rain of beads  feathers  and soft black petals .   he shook his head  and ambled off to fetch his shovel .        sarge .         yes  nobby .         you know your teeth           what teeth .         the teeth like in your mouth .         oh  right .  yep .  what about    em .         how come they fit together at the back .      there was a pause while sergeant colon prodded the recesses of his mouth with his tongue .      it uh ah       he began  and untangled himself .     interesting observation  nobby .      nobby finished rolling a cigarette .      reckon we should shut the gates  sarge .         might as well .      with the exact minimum amount of effort they swung the huge gates together .  it wasn   t much of a precaution .  the keys had been lost a long time ago .  even the sign    thank you for nott invading our city    was barely readable now .      i reckon we should       colon began  and then peered down the street .      what   s that light .     he said .     and what   s making that noise .      blue light glittered on the buildings at the end of the long street .      sounds like some kind of wild animal     said corporal nobbs .   the light resolved itself into two actinic blue lances .   colon shaded his eyes .      looks like some kind of   horse or something .         it   s coming straight for the gates .      the tortured roar bounced off the houses .      nobby  i don   t think it   s gonna stop .      corporal nobbs threw himself flat against the wall .  colon  slightly more aware of the responsibilities of rank  waved his hands vaguely at the approaching light .      don   t do it .  don   t do it .      and then picked himself up out of the mud .   rose petals  feathers  and sparks fell softly around him .   in front of him  a hole in the gates sparkled blue around the edges .      that   s old oak  that is     he said vaguely .     i just hope they don   t make us pay for it out of our own money .  did you see who it was  nobby .  nobby .      nobby edged carefully along the wall .      he   he had a rose in his teeth  sarge .         yes  but would you recognize him if you saw him again .      nobby swallowed .      if i didn   t  sarge     he said     it   d have to be one hell of an identity parade .           i don   t like this  mr .  glod .  i don   t like this .         shut up and steer .         but this isn   t the kind of road you   re supposed to go fast on .         that   s all right .  you can   t see where you   re going anyway .      the cart went around a corner on two wheels .  it was starting to snow  a weak  wet snow that melted as soon as it hit the ground .      but we   re back in the hills .  that   s a drop down there .  we   ll go over the side .         you want chrsyoprase to catch us .         giddyup  yah .      buddy and cliff clung to the sides of the cart as it rocked from side to side into the darkness .      are they still behind us .     glod yelled .      can   t see anything .     shouted cliff .     if you stopped der cart  maybe we could hear something .         yeah  but suppose we heard something really up close .         giddyup hiyah .         okay  so how about if we throw der money out .         five thousand dollars .      buddy looked over the edge of the cart .  darkness with a certain gulchlike quality  a certain suggestion of depth  was a few feet from the side of the road .   the guitar twanged gently to the rhythm of the wheels .  he picked it up in one hand .  strange how it was never silent .  you couldn   t silence it even by pressing on the strings heavily with both hands  he   d tried .   there was the harp beside it .  the strings were absolutely silent .      this is daft .     shouted glod  from the front .     slow down .  you nearly had us over the side that time .      asphalt hauled on the reins .  the cart slowed  eventually  to walking pace .      that   s better        the guitar screamed .  the note was so high that it hit the ears like a needle .  the horses jerked nervously in the shafts and then shot forward again .      hold them .         i am .      glod turned around  gripping the back of the seat .      throw that thing out .      buddy gripped the guitar and stood up  moving his arm back to hurl the thing into the gorge .   he hesitated .      throw it out .      cliff got to his feet and tried to take the guitar .      no .      buddy whirled it around his head and caught the troll on the chin  knocking him backward .      no .         glod  slow down        and a white horse was overtaking them .  a hooded shape leaned over and grabbed the reins .   the cart hit a stone and was airborne for a moment before crashing back down on the road .  asphalt heard the splintering of posts as the wheels smashed into the fence  saw the traces snap  felt the cart swing around          and stop .   so much happened later that glod never did tell anyone about the sensation he had  that although the cart had definitely wedged itself uncertainly on the edge of the cliff it had also plunged on  tumbling over and over  toward the rocks     glod opened his eyes .  the image tugged at him like a bad dream .  but he   d been thrown across the cart as it skewed around  and his head was lying on the backboard .   he was looking straight into the gorge .  behind him  wood creaked .   someone was holding on to his leg .      who   s that .     he whispered  in case heavier words would send the cart over .      it   s me .  asphalt .  who   s that holding on to my foot .         me     said cliff .     what   re you holding on to  glod .         just   something my flailing hand happened to snatch at     said glod .   the cart creaked again .      it   s the gold  isn   t it .     said asphalt .     admit it .  you   re holding on to the gold .         idiot dwarf .     shouted cliff .     let it go or we   re going to die .         letting go of five thousand dollars is dying     said glod .      fool .  you can   t take it with you .      asphalt scrambled for purchase on the wood .  the cart shifted .      it   s going to be the other way around in a minute     he muttered .      so who     said cliff  as the cart sagged another inch     is holding buddy .      there was a pause while the three counted their extremities and attachments thereto .      i   er   think he might have gone over     said glod .   four chords rang out .   buddy hung from a rear wheel  feet over the drop  and jerked as the music played an eight note riff on his soul .   never age .  never die .  live forever in that one last white hot moment  when the crowd screamed .  when every note was a heartbeat .  burn across the sky .   you will never grow old .  they will never say you died .   that   s the deal .  you will be the greatest musician in the world .   live fast .  die young .   the music tugged at his soul .   buddy   s legs swung up slowly and touched the rocks of the cliff .  he braced himself  eyes shut  and pulled at the wheel .   a hand touched his shoulder .      no .      buddy   s eyes snapped open .   he turned his head and looked into susan   s face  and then up at the cart .      what    .     he said  his voice slurred with shock .   he let go with one hand and fumbled clumsily for the guitar strap  slipping it off his shoulder .  the strings howled as he gripped the guitar   s neck and flung it into the darkness .   his other hand slipped on the freezing wheel  and he dropped into the gorge .   there was a white blur .  he landed heavily on something velvety and smelling of horse sweat .   susan steadied him with her free hand as she urged binky upward through the sleet .   the horse alighted on the road  and buddy slipped off into the mud .  he raised himself on his elbows .      you .         me     said susan .   susan pulled the scythe out of its holster .  the blade sprang out  snowflakes that fell on it split gently into two halves without a pause in their descent .      let   s get your friends  shall we .        there was a friction in the air  as if the attention of the world were being focused .  death stared into the future .   oh  blast .   things were coming apart .  the librarian had done his best  but mere bone and wood couldn   t take this sort of strain .  feathers and beads whirled away and landed  smoking  in the road .  a wheel parted company from its axle and bounded away  shedding spokes  as the machine took a curve almost horizontally .   it made no real difference .  something like a soul flickered in the air where the missing pieces had been .   if you took a shining machine  and shone a light on it so that there were gleams and highlights  and then took away the machine but left the light     only the horse   s skull remained .  that and the rear wheel  which spun in forks now only flickering light  and was smoldering .   the thing whirred past dibbler  causing his horse to throw him into the ditch and bolt .   death was used to traveling fast .  in theory he was already everywhere  waiting for almost anything else .  the fastest way to travel is to be there already .   but he   d never been this fast while going this slow .  the landscape had often been a blur  but never while it was only four inches from his knee on the bends .     the cart shifted again .  now even cliff was looking down into the darkness .   something touched his shoulder .      hang on to this .  but don   t touch the blade .      buddy leaned past .      glod  if you let go of the bag i can           don   t even think about it .         there   s no pockets in a shroud  glod .         you got the wrong tailor  then .      in the end buddy grabbed a spare leg and hauled .  one at a time  clambering over one another  the band eased themselves back onto the road .  and turned to look at susan .      white horse     said asphalt .     black cloak .  scythe .  um .         you can see her too .     said buddy .      i hope we   re not going to wish we couldn   t     said cliff .   susan held up a lifetimer and peered at it critically .      i suppose it   s too late to cut some sort of deal .     said glod .      i   m just looking to see if you   re dead or not     said susan .      i think i   m alive     said glod .      hold on to that thought .      they turned at a creaking sound .  the cart slid forward and dropped into the gorge .  there was a crash as it hit an outcrop halfway toward the bottom  and then a more distant thud as it smashed into the rocks .  there was a    whoomph    and orange flames blossomed as the oil in the lamps exploded .   out of the debris  trailing flame  rolled a burning wheel .      we would have been in dat     said cliff .      you think maybe we   re better off now .     said glod .      yep     said cliff .        cos we   re not dyin    in der wreckage of a burning cart .         yes  but she looks a bit   occult .         fine by me .  i   ll take occult over deep fried any day .      behind them  buddy turned to susan .      i   think i   ve worked it out     she said .     the music   twisted up history  i think .  it   s not supposed to be in our history .  can you remember where you got it from .      buddy just stared .  when you   ve been saved from certain death by an attractive girl on a white horse  you don   t expect a shopping quiz .      a shop in ankh morpork     said cliff .      a mysterious old shop .         mysterious as anything .  there           did you go back .  was it still there .  was it in the same place .         yes     said cliff .      no     said glod .      lots of interesting merchandise that you wanted to pick up and learn more about .         yes .     said glod and cliff together .      oh     said susan .     that kind of shop .         i knew it didn   t belong here     said glod .     didn   t i say it didn   t belong here .  i said it didn   t belong here .  i said it was eldritch .         i thought that meant oblong     said asphalt .   cliff held out his hand .      it   s stopped snowing     he said .      i dropped the thing into the gorge     said buddy .     i   didn   t need it anymore .  it must have smashed .         no     said susan .     it   s not as           the clouds   now they look eldritch     said glod  looking up .      what .  oblong .     said asphalt .   they all felt it   a sensation that the walls had been removed from around the world .  the air buzzed .      what   s this now .     said asphalt  as they instinctively huddled together .      you ought to know     said glod .     i thought you   ve been everywhere and seen everything .      white light crackled in the air .   and then the air became light  white as moonlight but as strong as sunlight .  there was also a sound  like the roar of millions of voices .   it said  let me show you who i am .  i am the music .     satchelmouth lit the coach lamps .      hurry up  man .     shouted clete .     we want to catch them  you know .  hat .  hat .  hat .         i don   t see that it matters much if they get away     satchelmouth grumbled  climbing onto the coach as clete lashed the horses into motion .     i mean  they   re away .  that   s all that matters  isn   t it .         no .  you saw them .  they   re the   the soul of all this trouble     said clete .     we can   t let this sort of thing go on .      satchelmouth glanced sideways .  the thought was flooding into his mind  and not for the first time  that mr .  clete was not playing with a full orchestra  that he was one of those people who built their own hot madness out of sane and chilly parts .  satchelmouth was by no means averse to the finger foxtrot and the skull fandango  but he   d never murdered anyone  at least on purpose .  satchelmouth had been made aware that he had a soul and  though it had a few holes in it and was a little ragged around the edges  he cherished the hope that some day the god reg would find him a place in a celestial combo .  you didn   t get the best gigs if you were a murderer .  you probably had to play the viola .      how about if we leave it right now .     he said .     they won   t be back           shut up .         but there   s no point        the horses reared .  the coach rocked .  something went past in a blur and vanished in the darkness  leaving a line of blue flames that flickered for a little while and then went out .     death was aware that at some point he would have to stop .  but it was creeping up on him that in whatever dark vocabulary the ghost machine had been envisaged  the words    slow down    were as inconceivable as    drive safely .      it was not in its very nature to reduce speed in any circumstances other than the dramatically calamitous at the end of the third verse .   that was the trouble with music with rocks in .  it liked to do things its own way .   very slowly  still spinning  the front wheel rose off the ground .     absolute darkness filled the universe .   a voice spake     is that you  cliff .         yup .         okay .  is this me  glod .         yup .  sounds like you .         asphalt .            sme .         buddy .         glod .         and   er   the lady in black .         yes .         do you know where we are  miss .      there was no ground under them .  but susan didn   t feel that she was floating .  she was simply standing .  the fact that it was on nothing was a minor point .  she wasn   t falling because there was nowhere to fall to  or from .   she   d never been interested in geography .  but she had a very strong feeling that this place was not locatable on any atlas .      i don   t know where our bodies are     she said  carefully .      oh  good     said the voice of glod .     really .  i   m here  but we don   t know where my body is .  how about my money .      there was the sound of faint footsteps far away in the darkness .  they approached  slowly and deliberately .  and stopped .   a voice said  one .  one .  one  two .  one  two .   then the footsteps went back into the distance .   after a while  another voice said  one  two  three  four     and the universe came into being .   it was wrong to call it a big bang .  that would just be noise  and all that noise could create is more noise and a cosmos full of random particles .   matter exploded into being  apparently as chaos  but in fact as a chord .  the ultimate power chord .  everything  all together  streaming out in one huge rush that contained within itself  like reverse fossils  everything that it was going to be .   and  zigzagging through the expanding cloud  alive  that first wild live music .   this had shape .  it had spin .  it had rhythm .  it had a beat  and you could dance to it .   everything did .   a voice right inside susan   s head said  and i will never die .   she said  aloud     there   s a bit of you in everything that lives .      yes .  i am the heartbeat .  the back beat .   she still couldn   t see the others .  the light was streaming past her .      but he threw away the guitar .      i wanted him to live for me .      you wanted him to die for you .  in the wreckage of the cart .      what is the difference .  he would be dead anyway .  but to die in music   people will always remember the songs he never had the chance to sing .  and they will be the greatest songs of all .   live your life in a moment .   and then live forever .  don   t fade away .      send us back .      you never left .   she blinked .  they were still on the road .  the air flickered and crackled  and was full of wet snow .   she looked around into buddy   s horrified face .      we   ve got to get away        he held up a hand .  it was transparent .   cliff had almost vanished .  glod was trying to grip the handle of the money bag  but his fingers were slipping through it .  his face was full of the terror of death or  possibly  of poverty .   susan shouted     he threw you away .  that   s not fair .        a piercing blue light was heading up the road .  no cart could move that fast .  there was a roar like the scream of a camel who has just seen two bricks .   the light reached the bend  skidded  hit a rock  and leapt into space over the gorge .   there was just time for a hollow voice to say oh b        before it hit the far wall in one great  spreading circle of flame .   bones bounced and rolled down to the riverbed  and were still .     susan spun around  scythe ready to swing .  but the music was in the air .  it had no soul to aim for .   you could say to the universe this is not fair .  and the universe would say  oh  isn   t it .  sorry .   you could save people .  you could get there in the nick of time .  and something could snap its fingers and say  no  it has to be this way .  let me tell you how it has to be .  this is how the legend has to go .   she reached out and tried to take buddy   s hand .  she could feel it  but only as a coldness .      can you hear me .     she shouted  above the triumphant chords .   he nodded .      it   s   it   s like a legend .  it has to happen .  and i can   t stop it   how can i kill something like music .      she ran to the edge of the gorge .  the cart was well on fire .  they wouldn   t appear in it .  they would have been in it .      i can   t stop it .  it   s not fair .      she pounded at the air with her fists .      grandfather .        blue flames flickered fitfully on the rocks of the dry riverbed .   a small fingerbone rolled across the stones until it came up against another  slightly larger  bone .   a third bone tumbled off a rock and joined them .   in the semidarkness there was a rattling among the stones  and a handful of little white shapes bounced and tumbled between the rocks until a hand  index finger reaching for the sky  rose into the night .   then there was a series of deeper  more hollow noises as longer  larger things skipped end over end through the gloom .        i was going to make it better .     shouted susan .     what   s the good of being death if you have to obey idiot rules all the time .      bring them back .   as susan turned  a toe bone hopped across the mud and scuttled into place somewhere under death   s robe .   he strode forward  snatched the scythe from susan and  in one movement  whirled it over his head and smashed it on a rock .  the blade shattered .   he reached down and picked up a fragment .  it glittered in his fingers like a tiny star of blue ice .   it was not a request .   when the music spoke  the falling snow danced .   you can   t kill me .   death reached into his robe  and brought out the guitar .  bits of it had broken off  but this didn   t matter  the shape flickered in the air .  the strings glowed .   death took a stance that crash would have died to achieve  and raised one hand .  in his fingers the sliver glinted .  if light could have made a noise  it would have flashed ting .   he wanted to be the greatest musician in the world .  there has to be a law .  destiny runs its course .   for once  death appeared not to smile .   he brought his hand down on the strings .   there was no sound .   there was  instead  a cessation of sound  the end of a noise which susan realized she   d been hearing all along .  all the time .  all her life .  a kind of sound you never notice until it stops     the strings were still .   there are millions of chords .  there are millions of numbers .  and everyone forgets the one that is a zero .  but without the zero  numbers are just arithmetic .  without the empty chord  music is just noise .   death played the empty chord .   the beat slowed .  and began to weaken .  the universe spun on  every atom of it .  but soon the whirling would end and the dancers would look around and wonder what do next .   it   s not time for that .  play something else .   i cannot .   death nodded toward buddy .   but he can .   he threw the guitar toward buddy .  it passed right through him .   susan ran and snatched it up  held it out .      you   ve got to take it .  you   ve got to play .  you   ve got to start the music again .      she strummed frantically at the strings .  buddy winced .      please .     she shouted .     don   t fade away .      the music screamed in her head .   buddy managed to grasp the guitar  but stood looking at it as if he   d never seen it before .      what   ll happen if he doesn   t play it .     said glod .      you   ll all die in the wreckage .      and then  said death  the music will die .  and the dance will end .  the whole dance .   the ghostly dwarf gave a cough .      we   re getting paid for this number  right .     he said .   you   ll get the universe .      and free beer .      buddy held the guitar to him .  his eyes met susan   s .   he raised his hand  and played .   the single chord rang out across the gorge  and echoed back with strange harmonics .   thank you  said death .  he stepped forward and took the guitar .   he moved suddenly  and smashed the thing against a rock .  the strings parted  and something accelerated away  toward the snow and the stars .   death looked at the wreckage with some satisfaction .   now that   s music with rocks in .   he snapped his fingers .     the moon rose over ankh morpork .   the park was deserted .  the silver light flowed over the wreckage of the stage  and the mud and half consumed sausages that marked the spot where the audience had been .  here and there it glinted off broken sound traps .   after a while some of the mud sat up and spat out some more mud .      crash .  jimbo .  scum .     it said .      is that you  noddy .     said a sad shape hanging from one of the stage   s few remaining beams .   the mud pulled some more mud out of its ears .     right .  where   s scum .         i think they threw him into the lake .         is crash alive .      there was a groan from under a heap of wreckage .      pity     said noddy  with feeling .   a figure emerged out of the shadows  squelching .   crash half crawled  half fell out of the rubble .      you   fe got to admit     he mumbled  because at some stage in the performance a guitar had hit him in the teeth     that waf music wif rocks in           all right     said jimbo  slithered off his beam .     but next time  thanks all the same  i   d rather try sex    n drugs .         my dad said he   d kill me if i took drugs     said noddy .      this is your brain on drugs       said jimbo .      no  this is your brain  scum  on this lump here        oh  cheers .  thanks .         a painkiller   d be favorite right now     said jimbo  a little closer to the lake a heap of sacking slid sideways .      archchancellor .         yes  mr .  stibbons .         i think someone trod on my hat .         so what .         it   s still on my head .      ridcully sat up  easing the ache in his bones .      come on  lad     he said .     let   s go home .  i   m not sure i   m that interested in music anymore .  it   s a world of hertz .        a coach rattled along the winding mountain road .  mr .  clete was standing on the box  whipping the horses .   satchelmouth got unsteadily to his feet .  the cliff edge was so close he could see right down into the darkness .      i   ve had just about altogether too much of this by half     he shouted  and tried to snatch at the whip .      stop that .  we   ll never catch up with them .     shouted clete .      so what .  who cares .  i liked their music .      clete turned .  his expression was terrible .      traitor .      the butt end of the whip caught satchelmouth in the stomach .  he staggered back  clutched at the edge of the coach  and dropped .   his outflung arm caught hold of what felt like a thin branch in the darkness .  he swung wildly over the drop until his boots got purchase on the rock  and his other hand gripped a broken fence post .   he was just in time to see the cart rumble straight on .  the road  on the other hand  curved sharply .   satchelmouth shut his eyes and held on tight until the last scream and crackle and splinter had died away .  when he opened them  it was just in time to see a burning wheel bounce down the canyon .      blimey     he said     it was lucky there   was   some   thing        his gaze went up .  and up .   yes .  it was  wasn   t it .     mr .  clete sat up in the ruins of the cart .  it was clearly very much on fire .  he was lucky  he told himself  to have survived that .   a black robed figure walked through the flames .   mr .  clete looked at it .  he   d never believed in this sort of thing .  he never believed in anything .  but if he had believed  he would have believed in someone   bigger .   he looked down at what he   d thought was his body  and realized that he could see through it  and that it was fading away .      oh  dear     he said .     hat .  hat .  hat .      the figure grinned  and swung its tiny scythe .   snh  snh  snh .     much later on  people went down into the canyon and sorted out the remains of mr .  clete from the remains of everything else .  there wasn   t very much .   there was some suggestion that he was some musician   some musician had fled the city or something   hadn   t he .  or was that something else .  anyway  he was dead now .  wasn   t he .   no one took any notice of the other things .  stuff tended to congregate in the dry riverbed .  there was a horse   s skull  and some feathers and beads .  and a few pieces of guitar  smashed open like an eggshell .  although it would be hard to say what had flown .     susan opened her eyes .  she felt wind on her face .  there were arms on either side of her .  they were supporting her while  at the same time  grasping the reins of a white horse .   she leaned forward .  clouds were scudding by  far below .      all right     she said     and now what happens .   death was silent for a moment .   history tends to swing back into line .  they are always patching it up .  there are always some minor loose ends   i daresay some people will have some confused memories about a concert of some sort in the park .  but what of it .  they will remember things that did not happen .      but they did happen .      as well .   susan stared down at the dark landscape .  here and there were the lights of homesteads and small villages  where people were getting on with their lives without thought of what was passing by  high over their heads .  she envied them .      so     she said     just for an example  you understand   what would happen to the band .      oh  they might be anywhere .  death glanced at the back of susan   s head .  take the boy  for example .  perhaps he left the big city .  perhaps he went somewhere else .  got a job just to make ends meet .  bided his time .  did it his way .      but he was due in the drum that night .      not if he didn   t go there .      can you do that .  his life was due to end .  you said you can   t give life .      not me .  you might .      what do you mean .      life can be shared .      but he   s   gone .  it   s not as though i   m ever likely to see him again .      you know you will .      how do you know that .      you   ve always known .  you remember everything .  so do i .  but you are human and your mind rebels for your own sake .  something gets across  though .  dreams  perhaps .  premonitions .  feelings .  some shadows are so long they arrive before the light .      i don   t think i understood any of that .      well  it has been a long day .   more clouds passed underneath .      grandfather .      yes .      you   re back .      it seems so .  busy  busy  busy .      so i can stop .  i don   t think i was very good at it .      yes .      but   you   ve just broken a lot of laws        perhaps they   re sometimes only guidelines .      but my parents still died .      i couldn   t have given them more life .  i could only have given them immortality .  they didn   t think it was worth the price .      i   think i know what they mean .      you   re welcome to come and visit  of course .      thank you .      you will always have a home there .  if you want it .      really .      i shall keep your room exactly as you left it .      thank you .      a mess .      sorry .      i can hardly see the floor .  you could have tidied it up a bit .      sorry .      the lights of quirm glittered below .  binky touched down smoothly .   susan looked around at the dark school buildings .      so i   ve   also   been here all the time .     she said .   yes .  the history of the last few days has been   different .  you did quite well in your exams .      did i .  who sat them .      you did .      oh .      susan shrugged .     what grade did i get in logic .         you got an a .         oh  come on .  i always get a plus .      you should have revised more .   death swung up into the saddle .      just a minute     said susan  quickly .  she knew she had to say it .   yes .      what happened to   you know   changing the fate of one individual means changing the world .      sometimes the world needs changing .      oh .  er .  grandfather .   yes .      er   the swing       said susan .     the one down in the orchard .  i mean   it was pretty good .  a good swing .      really .      i was just too young to appreciate it .      you really liked it .      it had   style .  i shouldn   t think anyone else ever had one like it .      thank you .      but   all this doesn   t alter anything  you know .  the world is still full of stupid people .  they don   t use their brains .  they don   t seem to want to think straight .      unlike you .      at least i make an effort .  for example   if i   ve been here for the last few days  who   s in my bed now .      i think you just went out for a moonlight stroll .      oh .  that   s all right  then .      death coughed .   i suppose    .      sorry .      i know it   s ridiculous  really .      what is .      i suppose   you haven   t got a kiss for your old granddad .   susan stared at him .   the blue glow in death   s eyes gradually faded  and as the light died it sucked at her gaze so that it was dragged into the eye sockets and the darkness beyond        which went on and on  forever .  there was no word for it .  even eternity was a human idea .  giving it a name gave it a length  admittedly  a very long one .  but this darkness was what was left when eternity had given up .  it was where death lived .  alone .   she reached up and pulled his head down and kissed the top of his skull .  it was smooth and ivory white  like a billiard ball .   she turned and stared at the shadowy buildings in an attempt to hide her embarrassment .      i just hope i remembered to leave a window open .     oh  well  nothing for it .  she had to know  even if she felt angry with herself for asking .     look  the   er  the people i met   do you know if i ever see        when she turned back there was nothing there .  there were only a couple of hoofprints  fading on the cobbles .   there was no open window .  she went around to the door and climbed the stairs in the darkness .      susan .      susan felt herself fading protectively  out of habit .  she stopped it .  there was no need for that .  there had never been a need for that .   a figure stood at the end of the passage  in a circle of lamplight .      yes  miss butts .      the headmistress peered at her  as if waiting for her to do something .      are you all right  miss butts .      the teacher rallied .     do you know it   s gone midnight .  for shame .  and you   re out of bed .  and that is certainly not the school uniform .      susan looked down .  it was always hard to get every little detail right .  she was still wearing the black dress with the lace .      yes     she said     that   s right .     she gave miss butts a bright friendly smile .      well  there are school rules  you know     said miss butts  but her tone was hesitant .   susan patted her on the arm .     i think they   re probably more like guidelines  don   t you .  eulalie .      miss butts   s mouth opened and shut .  and susan realized that the woman was actually quite short .  she had a tall bearing and a tall voice and a tall manner  and was tall in every respect except height .  amazingly  she   d apparently been able to keep this a secret from people .      but i   d better be off to bed     said susan  her mind dancing on adrenaline .     and you  too .  it   s far too late to be wandering around drafty corridors at your age  don   t you think .  last day tomorrow  too .  you don   t want to look tired when the parents arrive .         er   yes .  yes .  thank you  susan .      susan gave the forlorn teacher another warm smile and headed for the dormitory  where she undressed in the dark and got between the sheets .   the room was silent except for the sound of nine girls breathing quietly and the rhythmic muffled avalanche that was princess jade asleep .   and  after a while  the sound of someone sobbing and trying not to be heard .  it went on for a long time .  there was a lot of catching up to do .   far above the world  death nodded .  you could choose immortality  or you could choose humanity .   you had to do it for yourself .     it was the last day of the term  and  therefore  chaotic .  some girls were leaving early  there was a stream of parents of various races  and there was no question of there being any teaching .  it was generally accepted all round that the rules were relaxed .   susan  gloria  and princess jade wandered down to the floral clock .  it was a quarter to daisy .   susan felt empty  but also stretched like a string .  she was surprised sparks weren   t coming from her fingertips .   gloria had bought a bag of fried fish from the shop in three roses .  the smell of hot vinegar and solid cholesterol arose from the paper  without the taint of fried rot that normally gave the shop   s produce its familiar edge .      my father says i   ve got to go home and marry some troll     said jade .     hey  if there   s any good fish bones in there  i   ll have them .         have you met him .     said susan .      no .  but my father says he   s got a great big mountain .         i wouldn   t put up with that  if i was you     said gloria  through a mouthful of fish .     this is the century of the fruitbat  after all .  i   d put my foot down right now and say no .  eh  susan .         what .     said susan  who   d been thinking of something else  then  when everything had been repeated  she said     no .  i   d see what he was like first .  perhaps he   s quite nice .  and then the mountain is a bonus .         yes .  that   s logical .  didn   t your dad send you a picture .     said gloria .      oh  yes     said jade .      well    .         um   it had some nice crevasses     said jade thoughtfully .     and a glacier that my father says is permanent even at midsummer .      gloria nodded approvingly .      he sounds a nice boy .         but i   ve always liked crag from the next valley .  father hates him .  but he   s working very hard and saving up and he   s nearly got enough for his own bridge .      gloria sighed .     sometimes it   s hard to be a woman     she said .  she nudged susan .     want some fish .         i   m not hungry  thanks .         it   s really good .  not stale old stuff like it used to be .         no  thanks .      gloria gave her another nudge .      want to go and get your own  then .     she said  leering behind her beard .      why should i do that .         oh  quite a few girls have gone down there today     said the dwarf .  she leaned closer .     it   s the new boy working down there     she said .     i   d swear he   s elvish .      something inside susan was plucked and went twang .   she stood up .      so that   s what he meant .  things that haven   t happened yet .         what .  who .     said gloria .      the shop in three roses alley .         that   s right .        the door to the wizard   s house was open .  the wizard had put a rocking chair in the doorway and was asleep in the sun .   a raven was perched on his hat .  susan stopped and glared at it .      and have you got any comment to make .         croak croak     said the raven  and ruffled its feathers .      good     said susan .   she walked on  aware that she was blushing .  behind her a voice said     hah .     she ignored it .   there was a blur of movement among the debris in the gutter .   something hidden by a fish wrapper went   snh  snh  snh .      oh yes  very funny     said susan .   she walked on .   and then broke into a run .     death smiled and pushed aside the magnifying lens and turned away from the discworld to find albert watching him .   just checking  he said .      that   s right  master     said albert .     i   ve saddled up binky .      you understand i was just checking .      right you are  master .      how are you feeling now .      fine  master .      still got your bottle .   yes  master .     it was on the shelf in albert   s bedroom .   he followed death out into the stable yard  helped him into the saddle  and passed up the scythe .   and now i must be going out  said death .      that   s the ticket  master .      so stop grinning like that .      yes  master .      death rode out  but found himself guiding the white horse down the track to the orchard .   he stopped in front of one particular tree  and stared at it for some time .  eventually he said   looks perfectly logical to me .   binky turned obediently away and trotted into the world .   the lands and cities of it lay before him .  blue light flamed along the blade of the scythe .   death felt attention on him .  he looked up at the universe  which was watching him with puzzled interest .   a voice which only he heard said  so you   re a rebel  little death .  against what .   death thought about it .  if there was a snappy answer  he couldn   t think of one .   so he ignored it  and rode toward the lives of humanity .   they needed him .     somewhere  in some other world far away from the discworld  someone tentatively picked up a musical instrument that echoed to the rhythm in their soul .   it will never die .   it   s here to stay .        because of quantum .        the question seldom addressed is where medusa had snakes .  underarm hair is an even more embarrassing problem when it keeps biting the top of the deodorant bottle .        cabbages .         cabbages .          anything that ate cabbages and didn   t mind not having any friends .        until an unfortunate ax incident  gloria had been captain of the school basketball team .  dwarfs don   t have height but they do have acceleration  and many a visiting team member got a nasty shock when gloria appeared rising vertically out of the depths .        or methane crystals .  or sea anemones .  the principle is the same .  in any case  it soon fills up with whatever is the local equivalent of fast food boxes and derelict lager cans .        according to rural legend   at least in those areas where pigs are a vital part of the household economy   the hogfather is a winter myth figure who  on hogswatchnight  gallops from house to house on a crude sledge drawn by four tusked wild boars to deliver presents of sausages  black puddings  pork scratchings  and ham to all children who have been good .  he says ho ho ho a lot .  children who have been bad get a bag full of bloody bones  it   s these little details which tell you it   s a tale for the little folk  .  there   s a song about him .  it begins  you   d better watch out     the hogfather is said to have originated in the legend of a local king who  one winter   s night  happened to be passing  or so he said  the home of three young women and heard them sobbing because they had no food to celebrate the midwinter feast .  he took pity on them and threw a packet of sausages through the window .       badly concussing one of them  but here   s no point in spoiling a good legend .        wizards did not have balls .  there was a popular song about it .  but they did hold their annual excuse me  or free for all dance  which was one of the highlights of the ankh morpork social calendar .  the librarian in particular always looked forward to it  and used an amazing amount of hair cream .        well  except for unseen university once  but that was just a student prank .        the smallest room in unseen university is in fact a broom cupboard on the fourth floor .  he really meant the privy .  the reader had a theory that all the really good books in any building   at least  all the really funny ones     gravitate to a pile in the privy but no one ever has time to read all of them  or even knows how they came to be there .  his research was causing extreme constipation and a queue outside the door every morning .     the ones with cartoons about cows and dogs .  and captions like     as soon as he saw the duck  elmer knew it was going to be a bad day .           and didn   t appear to do anything to the enemy at all .         he was a wizard .  tricks shots for a wizard aren   t the old three times round the table jobs .  his best one was once off the cushion  once off a sea gull  once off the back of the head of the bursar  who   d been walking along the corridor outside last tuesday  a bit a temporal spin there   and a tricky rebound off the ceiling .  he   d missed sinking the actual shot by a whisker  but it had been pretty tricky  even so .          and this was true .  nature can adapt to practically anything .  there were fish evolved to live in the river .  they looked like a cross between a soft shelled crab and an industrial vacuum cleaner  and tended to explode in fresh water  and what you had to use for bait was nobody   s business  but they were fish and a sportsman like ridcully never cared about what the quarry tasted like .        the senior wrangler had a theory that long food   beans  celery  and rhubarb   made you taller  because of the famous doctrine of signatures .  it certainly made him lighter .        and  of course  one that misfires .  deafness doesn   t prevent composers hearing the music .  it prevents them hearing the distractions .        it wasn   t the taste .  plenty of hot dogs taste bad .  but dibbler had now actually managed to produce sausages that didn   t taste of anything .  it was weird .  no matter how much mustard  ketchup  and pickle people put on them  they still didn   t taste of anything .  not even the midnight dogs they sell to drunks in helsinki can quite manage that .        troll beer is ammonium sulfide dissolved in alcohol and tastes like drinking fermented batteries .        not with very good results  however .  stibbons spent weeks grinding lenses and blowing glassware and had finally produced a device which showed the tremendous number of tiny animals there were in one drop of water from the river ankh .   the archchancellor had taken a look and then remarked that anything in which that much life could exist had to be healthy .        all right   all dwarf songs .  except the one about hiho .        troll gambling is even simpler than australian gambling .  one of the most popular games is one up  which consists of throwing a coin in the air and betting on whether it will come down again .        rats had featured largely in the history of ankh morpork .  shortly before the patrician came to power there was a terrible plague of rats .  the city council countered it by offering twenty pence for every rat tail .  this did  for a week or two  reduce the number of rats   and then people were suddenly queing up with tails  the city treasury was being drained  and no one seemed to be doing much work .  and there still seemed to be a lot of rats around .  lord vetinari had listened carefully while the problem was explained  and had solved the thing with one memorable phrase which said a lot about him  about the folly of bounty offers  and about the natural instinct of ankh morporkians in any situation involving money     tax the rat farms .           from the old wys ars  lit  one who  at bottom  is very smart .        or  at least  onto the river .        a very grammatical half an hour  however .        old shoes always turn up in the bottom of every wardrobe .  if a mermaid had a wardrobe  old shoes would turn up in the bottom of it .        although  strictly speaking  humans feel it all the time .           pluggers  they   ve got soles  feel the nales .        he   d still got the nugget somewhere .       about the author   terry
