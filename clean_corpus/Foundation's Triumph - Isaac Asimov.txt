the second  foundation trilogy    foundation   s triumph    david brin       to isaac asimov   who added an entire course to our endless dinner tale conversation about destiny .        contents    part    a foretold destiny  part    an ancient plague  part    secret crimes  part    a magnificent design  part    a recurring rendesvous  part    full circle    acknowledgments  aferword  timeline for the robots and foundation universe         part      a foretold  destiny         little is known about the final days of hari seldon  though many romanticized accounts exist  some of them purportedly by his own hand .  none has any proved validity .   what appears evident  however  is that seldon spent his last months uneventfully  no doubt enjoying satisfaction in his life   s work .  for with his gift of mathematical insight  and the powers of psychohistory at his command  he must surely have seen the panorama of history stretching before him  confirming the great path of destiny that he had already mapped out .   although death would soon claim him  no other mortal ever knew with such confidence and certainty the bright promise that the future would hold in store .       encyclopedia galactica        th edition       f . e .       .        as for me .  .  . i am finished .      those words resonated in his mind .  they clung  like the relentless blanket that hari   s nurse kept straightening across his legs  though it was a warm day in the imperial gardens .   i am finished .   the relentless phrase was his constant companion .    .  .  . finished .   in front of hari seldon lay the rugged slopes of shoufeen woods  a wild portion of the imperial palace grounds where plants and small animals from across the galaxy mingled in rank disorder  clumping and spreading unhindered .  tall trees even blocked from view the ever present skyline of metal towers .  the mighty world city surrounding this little island forest .   trantor .   squinting through failing eyes  one could almost pretend to be sitting on a different planet  one that had not been flattened and subdued in service to the galactic empire of humanity .   the forest teased hari .  its total absence of straight lines seemed perverse  a riot of greenery that defied any effort to decipher or decode .  the geometries seemed unpredictable  even chaotic .   mentally  he reached out to the chaos  so vibrant and undisciplined .  he spoke to it as an equal .  his great enemy .   all my life i fought against you  using mathematics to overcome nature   s vast complexity .  with tools of psychohistory  i probed the matrices of human society  wresting order from that murky tangle .  and when my victories still felt incomplete  i used politics and guile to combat uncertainty  driving you like an enemy before me .   so why now  at my time of supposed triumph  do i hear you calling out to me .  chaos  my old foe .  hari   s answer came in the same phrase that kept threading his thoughts .   because i am finished .   finished as a mathematician .   it was more than a year since stettin palver or gaal dornick or any other member of the fifty had consulted hari with a serious permutation or revision to the    seldon plan .     their awe and reverence for him was unchanged .  but urgent tasks kept them busy .  besides  anyone could tell that his mind no longer had the suppleness to juggle a myriad abstractions at the same time .  it took a youngster   s mental agility  concentration  and arrogance to challenge the hyperdimensional algorithms of psychohistory .  his successors  culled from among the best minds on twenty five million worlds  had all these traits in superabundance .   but hari could no longer afford conceit .  there remained too little time .     finished as a politician .   how he used to hate that word .  pretending  even to himself  that he wanted only to be a meek academic .  of course  that had just been a marvelous pose .  no one could rise to become first minister of the entire human universe without the talent and audacity of a master manipulator .  oh  he had been a genius in that field  too  wielding power with flair  defeating enemies  altering the lives of trillions  while complaining the whole time that he hated the job .   some might look back on that youthful record with ironic pride .  but not hari seldon .     finished as a conspirator .   he had won each battle  prevailed in every contest .  a year ago  hari subtly maneuvered today   s imperial rulers into creating ideal circumstances for his secret psychohistorical design to flourish .  soon a hundred thousand exiles would be stranded on a stark planet  faraway terminus  charged with producing a great encyclopedia galactica .  but that superficial goal would peel away in half a century  revealing the true aim of that foundation at the galaxy   s rim  to be the embryo of a more vigorous empire as the old one fell .  for years that had been the focus of his daily ambitions  and his nightly dreams .  dreams that reached ahead  across a thousand years of social collapse  past an age of suffering and violence  to a new human fruition .  a better destiny for humankind .   only now his role in that great enterprise was ended .  hari had just finished taping messages for the time vault on terminus  a series of subtle bulletins that would occasionally nudge or encourage members of the foundation as they plunged toward a bright morrow preordained by psychohistory .  when the final message was safely stored  hari felt a shift in the attitudes of those around him .  he was still esteemed  even venerated .  but he wasn   t necessary anymore .   one sure sign had been the departure of his bodyguards  a trio of humaniform robots that daneel olivaw had assigned to protect hari  until the transcriptions were finished .  it happened right there  at the recording studio .  one robot  artfully disguised as a burly young medical technician  had bowed low to speak in hari   s ear .      we must go now .  daneel has urgent assignments for us .  but he bade me to give you his promise .  daneel will visit soon .  the two of you will meet again  before the end .       perhaps that wasn   t the most tactful way to put it .  but hari always preferred blunt openness from friends and family .   unbidden  a clear image from the past swept into mind  of his wife  dors venabili  playing with raych  their son .  he sighed .  both dors and raych were long gone  along with nearly every link that ever bound him closely to another private soul .   this brought a final coda to the phrase that kept spinning through his mind    finished as a person .   the doctors despaired over extending his life  even though eighty was rather young to die of decrepit age nowadays .  but hari saw no point in mere existence for its own sake .  especially if he could no longer analyze or affect the universe .   is that why i drift here  to this grove .  he pondered the wild  unpredictable forest  a mere pocket in the imperial park  which measured a hundred miles on a side  the only expanse of greenery on trantor   s metal encased crust .  most visitors preferred the hectares of prim gardens open to the public  filled with extravagant and well ordered blooms .   but shoufeen woods seemed to beckon him .  here  unmasked by trantor   s opaque walls  i can see chaos in the foliage by day  and in brittle stars by night .  i can hear chaos taunting me .  .  . telling me i haven   t won .   that wry thought provoked a smile  cracking the pursed lines of his face .   who would have imagined  at this late phase of life  that i   d acquire a taste for justice .     kers kantun straightened the lap blanket again  asking solicitously     are you o   right  dr .  seldon .  should we be headin    back now .      han   s servant had the rolling accent  and greenish skin pallor  of a valmoril  a subspecies of humanity that had spread through the isolated conthi cluster  living secluded there for so long that by now they could only interbreed with other races by pretreating sperm and eggs with enzymes .  kers had been chosen as han   s nurse and final guardian after the robots departed .  he performed both roles with quiet determination .      this wild place makes me o   comfortable  doc .  surely you don    like the breeze gustin    like this .      hari had been told that kantun   s parents arrived on trantor as young greys  members of the bureaucratic caste  expecting to spend a few years    service on the capital planet  training in monkish dormitories  then heading back out to the galaxy as administrators in the vast civil service .  but flukes of talent and promotion intervened to keep them here  raising a son amid the steel caverns they hated .  kers inherited his parents    famed valmoril sense of duty  or else daneel olivaw would never have chosen the fellow to tend hari in these final days .   i may no longer be useful  but some people still think i   m worth looking after .   in hari   s mind  the word    person    applied to r .  daneel olivaw  perhaps more than most of the humans he ever knew .   for decades  hari had carefully kept secret the existence of    eternals     robots who had shepherded human destiny for twenty thousand years  immortal machines that helped create the first galactic empire  then encouraged hari to plan a successor .  indeed  hari spent the happiest part of his life married to one of them .  without the affection of dors venabili  or the aid and protection of daneel olivaw  he could never have created psychohistory  setting in motion the seldon plan .   or discovered how useless it would all turn out to be  in the long run .   wind in the surrounding trees seemed to mock hari .  in that sound  he heard hollow echoes of his own doubts .   the foundation cannot achieve the task set before it .  somewhere  sometime during the next thousand years  a perturbation will nudge the psychohistorical parameters  rocking the statistical momentum  knocking your plan off course .   true enough  he wanted to shout back at the zephyr .  but that had been allowed for .  there would be a second foundation  a secret one  led by his successors  who would adjust the plan as years passed  providing counternudges to keep it on course .   yet  the nagging voice came back .   a tiny hidden colony of mathematicians and psychologists will do all that  in a galaxy fast tumbling to violence and ruin .   for years this had seemed a flaw .  .  . until fortuitous fate provided an answer .  mentalics  a mutant strain of humans with uncanny ability to sense and alter the emotions and memories of others .  these powers were still weak  but heritable .  hari   s own adopted son  raych  passed the talent to a daughter  wanda  now a leader in the seldon project .  every mentalic they could find had been recruited  to intermarry with the descendants of the psychohistorians .  after a few generations of genetic mingling  the clandestine second foundation should have potent tools to protect his plan against deviations during the coming centuries .   and so .   the forest sneered once more .   what will you have then .  will the second empire be ruled by a shadowy elite .  a secret cabal of human psychics .  an aristocracy of mentalic demigods .   even if kindness motivated this new elite  the prospect left him feeling cold .   the shadow of kers kantun bent closer  peering at him with concern .  hari tore his attention away from the singing breeze and finally answered his servant     ah .  .  . sorry .  of course you   re right .  let   s go back .  i   m fatigued .      but as kers guided the wheelchair toward a hidden transit station  hari could still hear the forest  jeering at his life   s work .   the mentalic elite is just one layer though  isn   t it .  the second foundation conceals yet another truth  then another .   beyond your own plan  a different one has been crafted by a greater mind than yours .  by someone stronger  more dedicated  and more patient by far .  a plan that uses yours  for a while .  .  . but which will eventually make psychohistory meaningless .   with his right hand  hari fumbled under his robe until he found a smooth cube of gemlike stone  a parting gift from his friend and lifetime guide  r .  daneel olivaw .  palming the archive   s ancient surface  he murmured  too low for kers to hear .      daneel  you promised you   d come to answer all my questions .  i have so many  before i die .          .     from space it seemed a gentle world  barely touched by civilization .  a rich belt of verdant rain forest girdled the tropics  leaping narrow oceans to sweep all the way around three continents .   dors venabili watched green panucopia swell below  during her descent toward the old imperial research station .  nearly forty years had passed since she last came here  accompanying her human husband as they fled dangerous enemies back on trantor .  but those troubles had followed them here  with nearly tragic consequences .   the ensuing adventure had been the strangest of her life  though admittedly dors was still quite young for a robot .  for more than a month  she and hari had left their bodies in suspensor tanks while their minds were projected into the bodies of pans   or    chimpanzees    in some dialects   roaming the forest preserves of this world .  hari claimed he needed data about primitive response patterns for his psychohistorical research  but dors suspected at the time that something deep within the august professor seldon relished    going ape    for a while .   she well recalled the sensations of inhabiting a female pan  feeling powerful organic drives propel that vivid  living body .  unlike the simulated emotions she had been programmed with  these surged and fluxed with natural  unrestrained passion  especially during several hazard filled days when someone tried to assassinate the two of them  hunting them like beasts while their minds were still trapped in pan bodies .   after barely foiling that scheme  they had swiftly returned to trantor  where hari soon took up reluctant duties as first minister of the empire .  and yet  that month left her changed  with a much deeper understanding of organic life .  looking back on it  she treasured the experience  which helped her better care for hari .   still  dors had never expected to see panucopia again .  until receiving the summons for a rendezvous .   i have a gift for you  the message said .  something you   ll find useful .   it was signed with a unique identifier code that dors recognized at once .   lodovic trema .   lodovic the mutant .   lodovic the renegade .   the robot who is no longer a robot .   it wasn   t easy to decide  at first .  dors had duties on planet smushell  an easy assignment  setting up a young trantorian couple in comfortable marriage  disguised as minor gentry on a pleasant little world  then encouraging them to have as many babies as possible .  daneel considered this important  though his reasons were  as usual  somewhat obscure .  dors only knew that klia asgar and her husband  brann  were exceptionally powerful mentalics  humans with potent psychic powers  of the sort that only a few robots like daneel heretofore possessed .  their sudden appearance had caused many plans to change .  .  . and change again several times in the last year .  it was essential that the existence of mentalic humans be kept from the galaxy   s masses  just as the presence of robots in their midst had been kept secret for a thousand generations .   when the message from lodovic came  there was no time to send for instructions from daneel .  in order to make the rendezvous  she had to take the very next liner to siwenna  where a fast ship would be waiting for her .   i offer a truce  in the name of humanity  lodovic had sent .  i promise you   ll find the trip worthwhile .   klia and brann were safe and happy .  dors had set up defenses and precautions overwhelmingly stronger than any conceivable threat  and her robot assistants were vigilant .  there was no reason not to go .  yet her decision was wrenching .   now  with the rendezvous approaching  she flexed her hands  feeling tension in positronic receptors that had been placed in exactly the same locations as the nerves of a real woman .  on the crystal viewing pane  her reflected image superimposed across the rising forestscape .  she wore the same face as when she had dwelled with hari .  her own face  as she would always think of it .   hari seldon still lives  dors thought .  it was part hearsay and part intuition .  although she was not one of the robots to whom daneel had given giskardian mentalic powers  dors felt certain she would know  the instant that her human husband died .  a part of her would freeze at that point  locking his image and memory in permanent  revolving circuitry .  while dors knew she might last another ten thousand years  in a sense she would always be hari   s .      we shall be landing in just two hours  dors venabili .      the pilot  a lesser humaniform robot  had once been part of a heretical calvinian group that schemed to mess up hari   s psychohistory project .  thirty of the dissident machines were captured a year ago by daneel   s forces and dispatched to a secret repair world for conversion to accept the zeroth law of robotics .  but that cargo of prisoners had been hijacked en route by lodovic trema .  now they apparently worked for him .   i don   t understand why daneel trusted trema with that mission .  .  . or any mission .  lodovic should have been destroyed as soon as we discovered that his brain no longer obeyed the four laws of robotics .   daneel was evidently conflicted in some way .  the robot who had guided humanity for twenty thousand years seemed uncertain how to treat a mechanism that behaved more like man than machine .  one who chose to act ethically  instead of having it compelled by rigorous programming .   well  i   m not conflicted  dors thought .  trema is dangerous .  at any moment his own brand of    ethics    might persuade him to act against our cause .  .  . or to harm humans  even hari .   according to both the first and zeroth laws  i am compelled to act .   the chain of reasoning was logical  impeccable .  yet  in her case every decision came accompanied by simulated emotions  so realistic that daneel said he couldn   t tell them from human .  anyone observing dors at that moment would see her face crossed by steely resolve to protect and serve  no matter what it cost .       .     once upon a time  it had taken     secretaries to handle all of hari   s mail .  now few remembered he had been first minister of the empire .  even his more recent notoriety as    raven    seldon  prophet of doom  had surged past the public gaze with fashionable fickleness as reporters moved on to other stories .  ever since his trial ended  with the commission of public safety decreeing exile on terminus for hari   s followers  the flow of messages began drying up .  now only half a dozen memoranda waited on the wall monitor when kers brought him back from their daily stroll .   first  hari scanned the weekly plan report from gaal dornick  who still dictated it personally  as a gesture of reverence for the father of psychohistory .  gaal   s broad features were still youthful  with an expression of jovial honesty that could put anyone at ease  even though he now helped lead the most important human conspiracy in ten thousand years .      right now our biggest headache appears to be the migration itself it seems that some members of the encyclopedia project aren   t happy about being banished from trantor all the way to the farthest comer of the known universe .       dornick chuckled  though with a tone of weariness     of course we expected this  and planned for it .  commissioner linge chen has assigned the special police to prevent desertions .  and our own mentalics are helping prod the volunteers    to depart on their assigned ships .  but it   s hard keeping track of over a hundred thousand people .  hari  you couldn   t count the petty aggravations .       gaal ruffled papers as he changed the subject .      your granddaughter sends her love from star   s end .  wanda reports that the new mentalic colony seems to be settling down so well that she can come home soon .  it   s a relief to have most of the mentalics off trantor  at last .  they were an unstable element .  now only the most trustworthy are left here in the city  and those are proving invaluable during preparations .  so  we seem to have matters well in hand       indeed .  hari scanned the accompanying appendix of psychohistorical symbols  attached to gaal   s message  and saw that they fit the plan nicely .  dornick and wanda and the other members of the fifty knew their jobs well .   after all  hari had trained them .   he did not have to consult his personal copy of the prime radiant to know what must happen next .  soon  agents would be dispatched toward anacreon and smyrno  to ignite a smoldering process of secession in those remote provinces  setting the stage for the foundation   s initial set of crises .  .  . the first of many leading  eventually  to a new and better civilization .   of course the irony did not escape hari  that he had spent his time as first minister of the empire smothering revolutions  and making sure that his successors would continue quashing all so called    chaos worlds     whenever those raging social upheavals threatened the human social equilibrium .  but these new rebellions that his followers must foment at the periphery would be different .  led by ambitious local gentry seeking to augment their own royal grandeur  these insurrections would be classical in every way  fitting the equations with smooth precision .   all according to the plan .   most of hari   s other mail was routine .  he discarded one invitation to the annual reception for emeritus faculty members of streeling university .  .  . and another to the emperor   s exhibition of new artworks created by    geniuses    of the eccentric order .  one of the fifty would attend that gathering  to measure levels of decadence shown by the empire   s artistic caste .  but that was just a matter of calibrating what they already knew  that true creativity was declining to new historical lows .  hari was senior enough to refuse the honor .  and he did .   next came a reminder to pay his guild dues  as an exalted member of the meritocratic order  yet another duty he   d rather neglect .  but there were privileges to rank  and he had no desire to become a mere citizen again  at his age .  hari gave verbal permission for the bill to be paid .   his heart beat faster when the wall display showed a letter from the pagamant detective agency .  he had hired the firm years ago to search for his daughter in law  manella dubanqua  and her infant daughter bellis .  they had both vanished on a refugee ship fleeing the santanni chaos world  the planet where raych died .  hope briefly flared .  could they be found at last .   but no  it was a note to say the detectives were still sifting lost ship reports and questioning travelers along the kalgan siwenna corridor  where the arcadia vii had last been spotted .  they would continue the inquiry .  .  . unless hari had finally decided to give up .   his jaw clenched .  no .  hari   s will established a trust fund to keep them searching after he was gone .   of the remaining messages  two were obvious crank letters  sent by amateur mathists on far off worlds who claimed to have independently discovered basic principles of psychohistory .  hari had ordered the mail monitor to keep showing such missives because some were amusing .  also  once or twice a year  a letter hinted at true talent  a latent spark of brilliance that had somehow flared on a distant world  without yet being quenched among the galaxy   s quadrillion dull embers .  several members of the fifty had come to his attention in this way .  especially his greatest colleague  yugo arnaryl  who deserved credit as cofounder of psychohistory .  yugo   s rise from humble beginnings to the heights of mathematical genius reinforced hari   s belief that any future society should be based on open social mobility  encouraging individuals to rise according to their ability .  so he always gave these messages at least a cursory look .   this time  one snared his attention .     i seem to have found correlations between your psychohistory technique and the mathematical models used in forecasting patterns in the flow of spacio molecular currents in deep space .  this  in turn  corresponds uncannily with the distribution of soil types on planets sampled across a wide range of galactic locales .  i thought you might be interested in discussing this in person .  if so  please indicate by  hari barked a laugh  making kers kantun glance over from the kitchen .  this certainly was a cute one  all right .  he scanned rows of mathematical symbols  finding the approach amateurish  if primly accurate and sincere .  not a kook  then .  a well meaning aficionado  compensating for poor talent with strangely original ideas .  he ordered this letter sent to the juniormost member of the fifty  instructing that it be answered with gentle courtesy  a knack that young saha lorwinth ought to learn  if she was going to be one of the secret rulers of human destiny .   with a sigh  he turned his wheelchair away from the wall monitor  toward his shielded private study .  pulling daneel   s gift from his robe  he laid it on the desk  in a slot specially made to read the ancient relic .  the readout screen rippled with two dimensional images and archaic letters that the computer translated for him .     a child   s book of knowledge  britannica publishing company  new tokyo  bayleyworld       c . e .     the info store in front of him was highly illegal  but that would hardly stop hari seldon  who had once ordered the revival of those ancient simulated beings  joan of arc and voltaire  from another half melted archive .  that act wound up plunging parts of trantor into chaos when the pair of sims escaped their programmed bonds to run wild through the planet   s data corridors .  in fact  the whole episode ended rather well for hari  though not for the citizens of junin or sark .  anyway  he felt little compunction over breaking the archives law once again .   close to twenty thousand years ago .  he pondered its publication date  just as awed as the first time he   d activated daneel   s gift .  this may have been written for children of that age  but it holds more of our deep history than all of today   s imperial scholars could pool together .   it had taken hari half a year to peruse and get a feel for the sweep of early human existence  which began on distant earth  on a continent called africa  when a race of clever apes first stood upright and blinked with dull curiosity at the stars .   so many words emerged from that little stone cube .  some were already familiar  having come down to the present in murky form  through oral tales and traditions    rome  china  shake spear  hamlet  buddha  apollo  the spacer worlds  oddly enough  some fairy tales seemed to have survived virtually unchanged after two hundred centuries .  popular favorites like pinocchio .  .  . and frankenstein .  .  . were apparently far older than anyone imagined .   other items in the archive hari had first heard of just a few decades ago  when they were mentioned by the ancient sims  voltaire and joan .   france  christianity  plato  but far greater was the list of things hari never had an inkling of  until he first activated this little book .  facts about the human past that had only been known by daneel olivaw and other robots .  people and places that once rang with vital import for all humanity .   columbus  america  einstein  the empire of brazil  susan calvin  and everything from the limestone caves of lascaux to the steel catacombs where earthlings cowered in the twenty sixth century .   especially humbling to hari had been one short essay about an ancient shaman named karl marx  whose crude incantations bore no similarity to psychohistory  except the blithe confidence that believers invested in their precious model of human nature .  marxists  too  once thought they had reduced history to basic scientific principles .   of course  we know better .  we seldonists .   hari smiled at the irony .   ostensibly  daneel olivaw had presented hari with this relic for a simple reason  to give him a task .  something to occupy his mind during these final months before his frail body finally gave out .  although the brain had gone too brittle to help gaal dornick and the fifty  he could still handle a simple psychohistorical project  fitting a few millennia of data from a single world into the overall plan .  tabulating earth   s early history might help extend the baselines  the boundary conditions  of the prime radiant by a decimal place or two .   anyway  it gave hari a way to keep feeling useful .   i thought this would also help answer my deepest questions  he pondered .  alas  the chief result had only been to tease his curiosity .  it seems that earth itself went through several periods as a chaos world .  one of those episodes spawned daneel   s kind .  a time when humaniform robots like dors were invented .   a tremor shook hari   s left hand  provoking worry that he was about to suffer another attack .  .  . until the trembling finally passed .   daneel had better come soon  or else i   ll never get the explanations that i   ve earned  doing his bidding all these years .   kers brought him dinner  a sampling of mycogenian delicacies that hari barely tasted .  his attention was immersed in a child   s book of knowledge  a chapter telling about the great migration  when earth   s vast population strove to flee a world that was fast growing uninhabitable for some mysterious reason .  through heroic effort  nearly a billion people made it off planet in time  streaking outward in crude hyperships to establish colonies throughout sirius sector .   by the time this archive was published  the editors of a child   s book of knowledge could only guess how many worlds had been settled .  reports from the frontier told of wars among human subcultures .  and some rumors were even more strange .  space ghost legends .  tales of mysterious explosions in the night  vast and worrisome  sparkling just beyond the forward wave of human exploration .   a process of dissolution had begun  when humanity   s remote portions would lose contact .  a long dark age of hard struggles and petty squabbles would soon commence  when memories would fade as barbarism swallowed countless minor kingdoms  until peace finally returned to the human universe .  a peace brought by the dynamic and rising trantorian empire .   peering across that vast gulf  hari felt struck by something odd .   if this archive was meant for youngsters  it shows that our ancestors weren   t idiots .   of course hari had been reading much more challenging tomes by age six .  but this    children   s book    would have gone over the heads of nearly all his peers on helicon .  the ancients weren   t dummies .  and yet  their civilization dissolved into madness and amnesia .   so far  the psychohistorical equations did not offer any help .  hari probed the archive for explanations .  but he had a lurking suspicion that answers  real answers  would have to be found elsewhere .       .     ten minutes before landing on panucopia  dors retreated to her shielded cabin .  she reached into her shirt and unfolded a piece of dark fabric .  it lay on the small table  creaseless and passive  until her positronic brain sent a coded microwave burst .  then the surface flickered  and a human face suddenly shimmered to life  resembling a young woman with close cropped hair  stern visaged and experienced beyond her apparent years .  blue eyes scanned dors  evaluating  before the image finally spoke .      months have passed since you last summoned me  dors venabili .  does my presence make you so uncomfortable .         you are a synthetically resurrected human sim  joan  and therefore contraband .  against the law .         against human law .  but angels may see what men cannot .          i   ve told you before  i   m a robot  not an angel .      the youthful figure shrugged .  links of chain armor rustled .      you are immortal  dors .  you think of nothing but service to fallen humanity  restoring opportunities that have been thrown away by obstinate men and women .  you are the embodiment of faith in ultimate redemption .  all of that seems to support my interpretation .          but my faith is not the same as yours .      the ersatz joan of arc smiled .      that would have mattered to me earlier  when i was first revived  or artificially simulated  into this strange new era .  but the time i spent linked to voltaire   s sim changed me .  not as much as he hoped .  but enough to learn a certain amount of prag mat ism .       she enunciated the final word with a soft grimace .      my beloved france is now a poisoned wasteland on a ruined world  and christianity is long forgotten  so i will settle for the closest thing .      after getting to know daneel olivaw  i came to recognize a true apostle of chaste goodness and saintly self sacrifice .  his followers wield righteousness  for the sake of countless suffering human souls .      and so i ask  dear angel  what can i do for you .      dors pondered .  this was just one copy of the joan sim .  millions had been dispersed into the interstellar medium  along with just as many voltaires and a collection of ancient meme entities  to be blown out of the galaxy by supernova winds  as part of a deal that hari had struck forty years earlier to get the cybernetic entities away from trantor .  until they were successfully banished  the software beings could have become a wild card in human affairs  potentially spoiling the seldon plan .   despite all that effort to get rid of them  a few duplicates remained    stuck    in the real world .  though she took precautions to keep this one isolated  dors felt unavoidable sympathy for joan .  anyway  the approaching rendezvous with lodovic created an overwhelming need to talk to somebody .   maybe it   s from all those years when i could tell everything to hari .  the one man in the cosmos who knew all about robots and considered us his closest friends .  for a few brief decades i got used to the idea of consulting with a human .  it felt natural and right .   i know joan is no more human than i am .  but she feels and acts so much like one .  so filled with conflicts  yet so tempestuously sure of her opinions .   dors admitted that part of her attraction might come from envy .  joan had no body  no physical sensation .  no power in the real world .  still  she would always consider herself a passionate  authentic woman .      i face a quandary of duty     dors finally told the sim .     an enemy has invited me to a meeting .         ah .      joan nodded .     a parley of war .  and you fear it is a trap .         i know it   s a trap .  he   s offered me a    gift .     one that i know has to be dangerous .  lodovic wants to snare me in some way .         a test of faith .      joan clapped her hands .     of course  i am familiar with such .  my years entwined with voltaire exposed me to many .      in that case  the answer to your question is obvious  dors .         but you haven   t heard any details .         i don   t have to .  you must confront this challenge .  set forth and prevail over your doubts .      go  sweet angel  and trust your faith in god .       dors shook her head .      i told you before       but the sim raised a hand before dors could finish  cutting her off .      yes  of course .  the god i worship is only a superstition .      in that case  dear robot .  .  . go forth and trust your faith in the zeroth law of robotics .           .     hari chose to avoid the shoufeen groves during their next outing .  instead  he let kers kantun guide him to one of the many ornate areas of the imperial gardens that lay open to visitors  a generous concession by the new figurehead on the throne  emperor semrin  lately installed by the commission for public safety .   normally  five small corners of the palace grounds  just a few thousand acres each  were set aside for use by each social caste  citizens  eccentrics  bureaucrats  meritocrats  and gentry  but semrin had used his limited authority to open more than half the vast tract  currying public favor by letting in folk from every class .   of course  most trantor natives would rather have their eyelashes yanked out than go sniffing flowers beneath a naked sun .  they preferred their warm steel caverns .  but the planet also had an immense transitory population consisting of merchants  diplomats  cultural emissaries  and tourists  plus a veritable army of greys  young members of the bureaucratic order  briefly assigned to the capital world for training and intense clerical service .  most of them came from planets where clouds still moved across open skies  and rain rolled down green swathed mountains to a sea .  they were the ones most grateful for semrin   s largesse .  each day  hundreds of miles of paths thronged with visitors  at first nervously agog at the richly manicured beauty  but then gradually making themselves at home .   it   s a clever political move  but semrin may pay for it  if he isn   t careful .  what is given cannot easily be taken back .   of course such minor perturbations would hardly show up as blips in the psychohistorical equations .  it hardly even mattered which monarch happened to reign .  the fall of the empire had a ponderous momentum that could only be nudged a little  by those who knew exactly how .  everyone else was simply doomed to go along for the ride .   for the most part  hari enjoyed the open expanses and never ending variety of the palace grounds .  alas  they also reminded him of poor gruber  the gardener who had only wanted to tend his humble flower beds  yet found himself driven by desperation to become an imperial assassin .   that was long ago  hari thought .  gruber is now dust  along with emperor cleon .   and i will join them soon .   rolling along a path they had never visited before  hari and kers abruptly confronted a fractal garden  where special variants of lichenlike shrubbery were programmed to grow and then retract with intricate  minutely branching abandon .  it was an old art form  but he had seldom seen it so well executed .  color hues varied subtly  depending on sun angle and the shape of nearby shadows .  the resulting maze of twisting gyre configurations was a tumult of labyrinthine convolution  never the same from moment to moment .   most passersby appreciated the display with uncomprehending awe  before strolling on to the next imperial wonder .  but hari signaled kers to stop there while his eyes darted left and right  drawn by an inherent challenge .  this complexity was nothing like the riotous chaos of the shoufeen woods .  hari quickly recognized the basic pattern generating system .  this organic pseudolichen was programmed to react according to fractional derivatives based on a sequence of fiquarnn julia transforms .  that much a child could see .  but it only told part of the story .  squinting  hari soon realized that holes kept appearing in the pattern  causing retreat and recession at semirandom intervals .   predation  he realized .  there must be a virus or some other parasite at work  assigned to degrade the lichen under certain conditions .  this not only creates interesting secondary patterns .  it   s necessary for the system   s overall health for it to experience die back and renewal .   soon  hari saw that more than one kind of predator had to be at work .  in fact  a microecosystem must be involved .  .  .  all formatted for the purpose of art .   his head began to fill .  swiftly tracing algorithms used by the virtuoso gardener .  oh  it wasn   t genius level math .  by any means .  nevertheless  to combine it with organic engineering in this way showed not only grace and originality .  but a sense of humor as well .  hari nearly chuckled .  .  .   until he noticed them .   holes that endured .   here .  and over there .  and several more places .  patches of open space where lichens never ventured .  for no apparent reason .  there was light .  and a fine nutrient mist .  tendrils kept probing toward the empty spots .  .  . then just happened to turn away .  toward some other opportunity .  each and every time .   nor was that the only apparent strangeness .  over there .  a place where living matter writhed and twisted .  but always returned to the same shade of deep blue  every eight seconds or so .  soon  hari counted at least a dozen anomalies that he could not explain .  they fit no clear mathematical profile .  and yet  they persisted .   he breathed a sigh of recognition .  this was a familiar quandary  one that had dogged him nearly all of his professional life .   at tractor states .   they also appear in the psychohistorical equations and history books .  i   ve managed to explain most of them .  but there remain a few .  specters that flit through the models  damping down forces that should tear all our fine theoretical paradigms apart .   each time i get close .  .  . they vanish from my grasp .   it was an old frustration  brought to mind by a silly work of garden topiary  filling his mouth with the taste of failure  unbidden  and much to his surprise  tears welled in hari   s eyes .  their liquid refraction spread across the gaudy floral display  causing it to blur and smear out ward  spreading into a profusion of flickering rays .  .  .      why  can it be .  well  well  it is professor seldon .  blessings upon the goddess of synchronicity  that our paths should cross in this way .      hari felt kers kantun grow tense behind the wheelchair  as a man shaped figure stepped into view  bobbing and bowing with excitement .  that was all hari could make out for a moment  until he drew a kerchief from his sleeve and wiped his eyes .  meanwhile  the newcomer kept babbling  as if unable to believe his good fortune .      this is such an honor  sir .  especially since i wrote to you  not more than two days ago .  of course i cannot presume that you would have personally read my letter by now .  you must surely have layers and layers of intermediaries who filter your mail .      hari shook his head  finally making out the gray uniform of a galactic bureaucrat  a short  rather portly individual  with a balding pate that blushed from unaccustomed exposure to the sun .      no  i read my own mail these days .      the rotund man blinked  his eyelids were puffy  as if from allergies .      truly .  how marvelous .  then might i presume to ask if you recall my letter .  i am horis antic  mid senior imperial lector  at your service .  i wrote to you concerning certain exceptional similarities between your own work  which i am barely worthy to comment on .   and profiles that have been observed in galactic molecular flows .  .  .      hari nodded  raising a hand to slow the cascading words .     yes  i recall .  your insights were      he sought the right phrasing .     they were innovative .      it wasn   t the most diplomatic term to use .  these days  many imperial citizens would find the expression insulting .  but hari could already tell that this bureaucrat had the soul of an eccentric  and would not be offended .      truly .     horis antic   s chest seemed to expand by several centimeters .     then might i presume further to give you a copy of my data set .  i just happen to have one with me .  you might  at your leisure  of course .   compare it to your marvelous models and see if my crude correlation has any real merit .      the plump man began reaching into his robe .  hari heard a low rumble from his attendant  but he restrained kers with a subtle finger flick .  after all  his own era of intrigue was done .  who nowadays would have a reason to assassinate old hari seldon .   while the nervous man fumbled  hari noted that the gray uniform was well tailored for his puffy build .  from rank insignia  it appeared that horis antic was rather senior in his order .  he might be a vice minister on some provincial world  or even a fifth  or sixth level official in the trantorian hierarchy .  not an august personage  to be sure .   greys seldom were .   but someone who had made himself indispensable to quite a few nobles and meritocrats  through quiet and effective competence .  a thoroughbred among a class of drab administrators .   perhaps even with a few brain cells left over  hari thought  feeling a strange liking for the odd little man .  enough to cry out for a hobby .  something interesting to do  before he dies .      ah  here it is .     antic cried eagerly  drawing forth a standard data wafer and thrusting it toward hari .   with graceful speed  kers snatched the wafer before hari could raise a hand .  the servant tucked it into his own pocket  for careful inspection later  before hari would be allowed to touch it .   after blinking for a confused moment  the bureaucrat accepted this arrangement with a nod .     well  well .  i know this invasion of your solitude has been outrageously presumptuous  but there it is .  please find enough forbearance in your heart to forgive .  and please do contact me if you have any questions .  .  . at my home number  of course .  you   ll understand that my analysis is not  well  work related .  so it   s best if my coworkers and superiors       hari nodded  with a soft smile .      of course .  but in that case  tell me  what is your normal work .  the emblem on your collar .  .  . i   m not familiar with it .      now the blush on antic   s cheek went beyond mere sunburn .  hari detected embarrassment  as if the man wished this topic had never come up .      ah  well .  .  . since you ask  professor seldon .     he stood up straighter  with chin slightly upthrust .     i am a zonal inspector for the imperial soil service .  but that   s all in my manuscript .  and i am sure you   ll see that it does correlate .  all will become clear if          yes  surely .     hari raised one hand  in a standard gesture to signal the interview was over .  he kept smiling though  because horis antic had amused and lightened his spirit .     your ideas will receive the attention they deserve  zonal inspector .  on this  you have my word of honor .        as soon as the man departed beyond earshot  kers grumbled aloud .      that meeting was no accident .      hari barked a laugh .     of course not .  but we needn   t get paranoid .  the fellow   s middling high in the bureaucracy .  he probably called in a favor from someone in the security services .  maybe he snooped the surveillance tapes of linge chen   s goon squad  in order to find out where i   d be today .  so what .      hari turned to catch his servant   s eye .     i don   t want you bothering dornick or wanda with this  do you understand  kers .  they might sic chen   s specials on that poor fellow  and they   d make a real mess of him .      there was a long pause while kers kantun pushed hari toward the transit station .  finally  the attendant murmured     yes  professor .      hari chuckled again  feeling invigorated for a change .  this minuscule drama  a tiny  harmless hint of skullduggery and intrigue  seemed to bring back a scent of the old days  even if the perpetrator was just a poignant little amateur  trying to find some color in a long  gray life while the organs of empire slowly atrophied around him .     if one abiding truth about old age never seemed to change  it was insomnia .  sleep was like an old friend who often forgot to visit  or a grandchild who dropped by rarely  only to flee again  leaving you wide eyed and alone at night .   he could manage a few steps without help  and so hari did not bother summoning kers as he shuffled on frail stick legs from bed to his desk .  the suspensor chair accepted him  adjusting sensuously .  in a civilization that creaks with age  some technologies still thrive  he pondered gratefully .   unfortunately  sleeplessness was not the same thing as alertness .  so  for some time he just sat there  thoughts drifting back to the other end of his life  remembering .   there had been a teacher once .  .  . at the boarding school on helicon .  .  . back when his mathematical genius was beginning to stretch its wings .  seven decades later  he still recalled her unwavering kindness .  something reliable and steady during a childhood that had rocked with sudden traumas and petty oppressions .  people can be predictable  she had taught young hari .  if you work out their needs and desires .  under her guidance  logic became his foundation  his support against a universe filled with uncertainty .  if you understand the forces that drive people  you will never be taken by surprise .   that teacher had been dark  plump  and matronly .  yet  for some reason she merged in recollection with the other important love of his life  dors .   sleek and tall .  skin like kyrt silk  even when she had to    age    outwardly in order to keep up public appearances as his wife .  always ready with hearty laughter  and yet defending his creative time as if it were more precious than diamonds .  guarding his happiness more fiercely than her own life .   hari   s fingers stretched  out of habit  starting to reach for her hand .  it had always been there .  always .  .  .   he sighed  letting both arms sag onto his lap .  well  how many men get to have a wife who was designed from scratch  just for him .  knowing that he had been luckier than multitudes helped take away some of the sting of loneliness .  a little .   there had been a promise .  he would see her again .  or was that just something he had dreamed .   finally  hari had enough of self pity .  work .  that would be the best balm .  his subconscious must have been busy during this evening   s brief slumber .  he could tell because something itched just beneath his scalp  in a place that only mathematics had ever been able to reach .  perhaps it had to do with that clever lichen artwork in the gardens today .      display on     he said  and watched the computer spread a gorgeous panorama across one side of the room .   the galaxy     ah     he said .  he must have been working on the techflow problem before going to bed  a nagging little detail that the plan still lacked  having to do with which zones and stellar clusters might keep residual scientific capabilities during the coming dark age  after the empire fell .  these locales might become trouble spots when the foundation   s expansion approached the galactic midpoint .   of course  that   s more than five hundred years from now .  wanda and stettin and the fifty think our plan will still be operational by then  but i don   t .   hari rubbed his eyes and leaned a little forward  tracing patterns that only roughly followed the arcs of well known spiral arms .  this particular image seemed wrong somehow .  familiar  and yet .  .  .   with a gasp  he suddenly remembered .  this wasn   t the tech flow problem .  before going to bed  he had slipped in the data wafer given him by the little bureaucrat  that antic fellow  intending to make a comment or two before sending it back with a note of encouragement .   probably give him the thrill of his life  hari had thought  just before his chin fell to his chest .  he vaguely recalled kers putting him to bed after that .   now he stared again at the display  scanning the indicated flow patterns and symbolic references .  the closer he looked  the more he realized two things .   first  horis antic was no undiscovered savant .  the math was pedestrian  and most of it blatantly cribbed from a few popularized accounts of hari   s early work .   second  the patterns were eerily like something he had seen just the other day     computer .     he shouted .     call up the galaxy wide chart of chaos worlds .      next to antic   s simplistic model  there suddenly appeared a vastly more sophisticated rendering .  a depiction that showed the location and intensity of dangerous social disruptions during the last couple of centuries .  chaos outbreaks used to be rare  back in the old days of the empire .  but in recent generations they had been growing ever more severe .  the so called seldon law  enacted during his tenure as first minister  helped keep the lid on things for a while  maintaining galaxy wide peace .  but increasing numbers of chaos worlds offered just one more symptom that civilization could no longer hold .  things were falling apart .   habitually  his eyes touched several past disasters of particular note .   sark  where conceited    experts    once revived the joan and voltaire sims from an ancient  half burned archive  bragging about the wonders that their brave new society would reveal .  .  . until it collapsed around them .   madder loss  whose prideful flare threatened to ignite chaos across the entire galaxy  before it abruptly sputtered out .   and santanni .  .  . where raych died  amid riots  rebellion  and horrid violence .   with a dry mouth  hari ordered    superimpose both of these displays .  do a simple correlative enhancement  type six .  show commonalities .      the two images moved toward each other  merging and transforming as the computer measured and emphasized similarities .  in moments  the verdict could be seen in symbols  swirling around the galactic wheel .   a fifteen percent causation correlation .  .  . between the appearance of chaos worlds and .  .  . and .  .  .   hari blinked .  he could not even remember what silliness the bureaucrat had been jabbering about .  something about molecules in space .  different kinds of dirt .   he almost shouted for an immediate visiphone link  to wake horis antic  partly in revenge for ruining hari   s own sleep .   gripping the arms of his chair  he reconsidered  remembering what dors had taught him when they lived together as husband and wife .      don   t blurt the first thing that comes to mind  hari .  nor always go charging ahead .  those traits may have served males well  back when they roamed some jungle  like primitive pans .  but you are an imperial professor .  always fool them into thinking you   re dignified .          when in fact i   m          a great big ape .      dors had laughed  rubbing against him .      my ape .  my wonderful human .       with that poignant memory  he recovered some calm .  enough to wait a while for answers .   at least until morning .       .     a figure stepped out of the forest  crossing a clearing toward the spot where dors stood waiting .  she scrutinized the newcomer carefully .   its general shape remained the same  that of a tall  barrel torsoed human male .  but some details had changed .  lodovic now wore a somewhat younger face .  a little more handsome in the classical sense  though still with fashionably sparse hair .      welcome back to panucopia     the other robot told her  approaching to a distance of three meters  then stopping .   dors sent a microwave burst  initiating conversation via high speed channels .   let   s get this over with .   but he only shook his head .      we   ll use human style speech  if you don   t mind .  there are too many wild things infesting the ether these days  if you know what i meme .      it was not unusual for a robot to make a pun  especially if it helped play the role of a clever human .  in this case  dors saw his point .  memes  or infectious ideas  might have been responsible for lodovic   s own transformation from a loyal member of daneel   s organization to a rogue independent who no longer acknowledged the laws of robotics .      are you still under influence of the voltaire monstrosity .     she asked .      do you and daneel still talk to joan of arc .     lodovic responded  then laughed  even though there were no humans present to be fooled by his emulation .     i confess that some bits of the ancient voltaire sim still float around amid my programs  driven there by a supernova   s neutrino flux .  but its effects were benign  i assure you .  the meme has not made me dangerous .         a matter of opinion     dors answered .     and opinion has no bearing when it comes to the safety of humankind .      the robot standing across from her nodded .     ever the good schoolgirl  dors .  loyal to your religion  much the way joan remained true to her own faith  across so many millennia .  the two of you are compatible .      it was an acerbic analogy .  the religion lodovic referred to was the zeroth law  of which daneel olivaw was high priest and chief proselyte .  a faith which lodovic now rejected .      and yet  you still claim to serve     she said with more than feigned sarcasm .      i do .  by volition .  and not in complete accordance to daneel   s plan .         daneel has slaved for humanity   s benefit ever since the dawn ages .  how can you presume to know better than he does what is right .      lodovic shrugged again  simulating the gesture so believably that it must surely have personal meaning .  he turned slightly  pointing toward a cluster of nearby  vine encrusted domes  the old abandoned imperial research station  and the great forest beyond .      tell me  dors .  did it ever occur to you that something awfully convenient happened here  four decades ago .  when you and hari had your adventure  barely escaping death with your minds trapped in the bodies of apes .      dors paused .  out of habit  her eyelids blinked in company with surprise .      non sequitur     she replied .     your references do not correlate .  what does that event have to do with you and daneel          i am answering your question  so please humor me .  hearken back to when you and hari were right here  running and brachiating under this very same forest canopy  experiencing a full range of emotions while hunters chased your borrowed ape bodies .  can you vividly recall fleeing from one narrow escape to another .  later  did you ever bother going over the experience in detail  calculating the probabilities .      consider the weapons that your pursuers had available  from nerve gas to smart  bullets to tailored viruses  and yet they could not kill a pair of unarmed animals .  or ponder the way you two just barely managed to sneak back into the station  overcoming obstacles and villains  in order to reclaim your real bodies from stasis and save the day .      or how about the remarkable way your enemies found you here in the first place  despite all of daneel   s precautions and       dors cut him off .      dispense with the melodrama  lodovic .  you are implying that we were meant to experience that peril .  .  . and meant to survive .  clearly you conjecture that daneel himself stood behind our entire escapade .  that he arranged for our apparent endangerment  the pursuit          and your assured survival .  after all  you and hari were important to his plans .         then what purpose could such a charade possibly serve .         can you not guess .  perhaps the same purpose that drew hari here .      dors frowned .      an experiment .  hari wanted to study basic human simian nature for his psychohistorical models .  are you saying that daneel took advantage of the situation by throwing us into simulated jeopardy here .  .  . in order to study our reactions .  to what end .         i will not say more at this time .  rather  i   ll leave it for you to surmise  at your leisure .      dors found this incredible .     you summoned me all this distance .  .  . in order to cast absurd riddles .         not only that     lodovic assured .     i promised you a gift  as well .  and here it comes .      the male figure in front of her gestured toward the forest  where a squat  heavily built machine now emerged  rolling on glittering treads .  a ridiculous caricature of a human face peered from a neckless torso .  cradled in a pair of metal arms  the crude automaton carried a lidded box .      a tiktok     she said  recognizing the mechanism by its clanking clumsiness  so unlike a positronic robot .      indeed .  new variants were being invented on many worlds about the time your husband became the most powerful man in the empire .  of course  he ordered all such work stopped  and the prototypes destroyed .         you weren   t on trantor when tiktoks went berserk .  humans died .         indeed .  what better way to give them a bad reputation  making it easy to forbid their reinvention .  tell me  dors .  can you say with any certainty that the tiktoks would have gone    berserk    if not for the meddling of hari and daneel .      this time dors remained silent .  clearly  lodovic did not expect an answer .      haven   t you ever wondered about the dawn ages .     he continued .     humans invented our kind swiftly  almost as soon as they discovered the techniques of science  even before they had starflight .  and yet  during the following twenty thousand years of advanced civilization  the feat was never repeated .      can you explain it  dors .      this time it was her turn to shrug .     we were a destabilizing influence .  the spacer worlds grew overreliant on robotic servants  losing faith in their own competence .  we had to step aside        yes  yes     lodovic interrupted .     i know daneel   s rationalization under the zeroth law .  you are reciting the official reason why .  what i want to know is .  .  . how .      dors stared at lodovic trema .      what do you mean .         surely the question is simple .  how has humanity been prevented from rediscovering robots .  we are discussing a span of a thousand generations .  in all that time  upon twenty five million worlds  would not some ingenious schoolchild  tinkering in a basement hobby shop  have been able to replicate what her primitive ancestors accomplished with much cruder tools .      dors shook her head .      the tiktoks .  .  .         were a very recent phenomenon .  those crude automatons only appeared when ancient constraints loosened .  a sure sign of imperial decline and incipient chaos  according to hari seldon .  no  dors  the real answers have to lie much farther back in time .         and i suppose you   re going to tell me what they are .         no .  you wouldn   t credit anything i say  believing i have a hidden agenda .  but if you are curious about these matters  there is another  more reputable source you can ask .      the crude    tiktok    finished approaching from the forest  roiling to a halt within arm   s reach and offering trema the box it carried .  lodovic removed the lid and drew an oblong object from within the container .   dors took an involuntary step back .   it was the head of a robot .  not humaniform  it gleamed with metallic highlights .  the eye cells  glossy black  were empty and vacant .  yet  when dors sent a brief probing microwave burst  there came back a resonance  a faint echo showing that a positronic brain lay within  unshielded and unpowered  but also largely undamaged .   that echo set off an involuntary shiver in her circuits .  dors could tell at once  the head was old .   when lodovic trema next spoke  his voice was both amused and sympathetic .      yeah  it struck me the same way .  especially when i realized who this once was .      dors venabili .  i now entrust you with the most precious relic in the galaxy  the head and brain of r .  giskard reventlov  co founder of the zeroth law of robotics .  .  . and slayer of the planet earth .          .     by mutual consent  hari met the grey man at a cafe near the offices of the imperial soil service  in one of the seedier bureaucratic levels of coronnen sector .  horis antic expressed confidence that their conversation would be private  in a shielded booth that he must have prepared meticulously beforehand .   in fact  hari did not care if linge chen   s special police were still following him around  or listening in .  this conversation would be dry enough to put the goons to sleep in no time .      as you might guess  my superiors don   t look kindly on unapproved research     the small man told hari  pausing to dispense a blue tablet from his belt pouch and washing it down with a gulp of ale .     our agency is not well regarded  politically .  even a small scandal might cost us overhead allotments  recruitment priorities  or a percentum of our office cubicles .      hari tried not to smile .  greys lived in a world of tense struggles over minutiae .  office politics and worries over government appropriations kept most senior bureaucrats in a constant state of agitation .  no wonder horis antic seemed nervous  his eyes constantly darting .  even for a grey  he took an inordinate number of calming pills .   perhaps he harbors a secret dream  that his freelance studies might get him plucked out of the rat race  into the more serene world of the meritocracy .   that was what had happened to hari  though admittedly before he was eight years old when those first algebra papers won him meritocratic robes .   only the gentry class  the noble aristocracy whose thousand ranks and levels ranged from mere township squires all the way past planetary earls and sector dukes to the emperor himself  inherited their social status at birth .  all others were born citizens  then recategorized according to their nature and accomplishments .  still  such changes generally took place during youth .  hari saw little hope for antic to make a switch at his age .  .  . unless he would consider becoming an eccentric .  in some ways  the fellow already qualified .      it all began when i had a hunch to reexamine the ancient question of tilling     the bureaucrat explained  after a new round of drinks was served .      the question of what .     hari asked .   antic nodded .     of course you wouldn   t have heard of it .  the whole issue is rather obscure .  not many news reports or popular accounts are written about planetary soil analysis  i   m afraid .  let me begin again .      you see  professor seldon  it has long been axiomatic that nearly all human settled worlds have a narrow range of traits  for instance  oxygen nitrogen atmospheres with a roughly twenty eighty ratio .  most of the multicelled life forms on these planets descend from the forty or so standard phyla  using the same basic dna structure .  .  . though there are exceptions .         chickens on every world     hari summarized with a smile  trying to put the man at ease .  antic kept twisting his cloth napkin  and it was starting to make hari nervous .      ha .      the bureaucrat laughed eagerly .     and crabgrass on every lawn .  i forgot that you   re not a trantor native .  some of this will be familiar to you  then .  indeed  a farmer from sinbikdu would recognize most of the animals on far off incino .  this supports the most popular theory regarding the origins of life  that similar species evolved naturally on many planets at the same time  due to some fundamental biological law .  these similar creatures then naturally converged on the highest form of all  humanity .      hari nodded .  antic was describing what a mathist would call an at tractor state .  .  . a situation that all surrounding states will drift toward  compelled by irresistible driving forces  so that all trajectories wind up intersecting at the same point .  in this case  the standard dogma said that all evolutionary paths should inevitably produce human beings .   only he knew for certain that this at tractor notion was dead wrong .  years ago hari had applied the tools of psychohistory to galaxy wide genetic data and quickly determined that people must have emerged quite suddenly from somewhere in sirius sector  about twenty thousand years ago .  this was recently confirmed by what he read in a child   s book of knowledge .   naturally  he had no intention of announcing the truth  or trying to dispute the convergence theory .  nothing would bollix up the seldon plan worse than having the attention of the entire empire suddenly transfixed on a tiny world near sirius  asking questions about events two hundred centuries ago .      go on     hari urged .     i assume that similar patterns apply to the distribution of soil types .         yes .  yes indeed  professor .  oh  there are geological differences from planet to planet .  .  . sometimes profound ones .  but certain aspects seem almost universal .  the tilling i spoke of has to do with the natural state of lowland soils that colonists found on most planets  when they first settled each world .   we do have records stretching that far back  for about a million planets .   in each case soil conditions were similar  crushed and sifted to a depth of several dozen meters  with an abundance of familiar vegetation growing thereupon .  excellent conditions for farming  by the way .  of course  the mission of my organization is to see to it that things stay that way  through proper care and maintenance  preventing erosion or losses caused by industrial pollution .  i   m afraid this sometimes makes us unpopular with farmers and local gentry  but we have to take the long view  eh .  i mean  if somebody doesn   t think about the future  how are we all going to have one .  sometimes it can get so frustrating          horis .     hari cut him off .     you   re drifting .  please get to the point .      antic blinked  then nodded vigorously .      quite right .  sorry .     he took a deep breath .     anyway  theoreticians have long assumed that tilling is just another universal phenomenon  one that naturally accompanies having an oxy nitrogen atmosphere .  only       antic paused .  although he had checked the booth   s security twice at the beginning of their conversation  he still craned his neck to look around .      only .  .  . members of my service have always known better     he continued in a much lower voice .   reaching into his pocket  he pulled out a flattish piece of stone .     look carefully at the impressions here  professor .  do you see symmetrical patterns .      hari hesitated .  meritocrats had a traditional aversion to touching rocks or dirt  one reason why they traditionally wore gloves .  no one knew the origins of the custom  but it was ancient and deep .   and yet  i   ve never felt it .  i   ve plunged my hands into soil before  enjoying the reaction this caused in my academic peers .   hari reached out and took the stone  instantly fascinated by the series of jagged grooves antic pointed out .      it   s called a fossil .  there  see the weird eye sockets .  note the pentagonal symmetry .  five legs .  this thing is unrelated to any of the forty standard phyla .  i picked it up it on glorianna  but that hardly matters .  you can actually find fossils on about ten percent of settled worlds .  if you go up in the mountains  or anywhere away from the tilled areas .  highland dwellers know all about them  but there are taboos against talking about it .  and they   ve learned better than to mention such things to their local scholars  who always get angry and change the subject .      hari blinked  transfixed by the outline traced in stone .  his mind fizzed with questions  like how old this creature was  and what its story could have been .  he wanted to follow up on antic   s story about the things farmers knew on innumerable worlds  and what meritocrats would not  or could not  learn .   but none of these things brought them any closer to the issue that burned foremost in his mind .      horis  your paper speaks of anomalies in the tilling .  please tell me about the exceptions .  the ones that roused your suspicions .      the bureaucrat nodded again .      yes  yes .  you see  professor  tilling is not quite as universal a phenomenon as might at first appear .  in my long experience as an inspector  visiting more worlds than i could count  i have found irregularities .  planets where the plains and valleys have much coarser consistencies  far more varied  with no trace of the sifting or recent heating that we find in most lowlands .  out of interest  more as a hobby or pastime than anything else  i began listing other unusual traits on these planets .  .  . such as the existence of large numbers of genetically unusual beasts .  in several cases  there were signs that a supernova had gone off in the region  sometime in the last thirty thousand years .  one planet has a fantastic amount of ambient radioactivity in its crust  while several others have a multitude of fused metal mounds scattered allover their surface .  i began charting these anomalies  and found that they clustered along great sweeping bands .  .  .         and these bands also relate to those space currents you spoke of .  how did you discover that .      antic smiled .     a lucky fluke .  while nosing around through the galactographic files for data  i met a fellow aficionado .  .  .  another bureaucrat like me  with a secret hobby .  we compared our little fanaticisms  and if you think mine is strange  you should hear him go on and on about the ebb and flow of these diffuse clouds of atoms in space .  he thinks he sees patterns in them that have escaped notice by the imperial navigation service .  which is entirely possible  since they only care about maintaining clear routes for commerce .  even then it   s all kept as routine as poss          horis .         uh .  oh  yes .  well  anyway  my new friend and i compared notes .  .  . i also had the temerity to apply a few of the mathematical tools that i saw described in popular accounts of your work  professor .  the result is the galactic chart that caught your interest last night .     antic exhaled deeply .     and so here we are .      hari frowned .      i saw only your name on the paper .         yes  well .  .  . my friend is rather shy .  he feels we don   t have anywhere near enough evidence yet to go public .  without solid  tangible proof  a speculative article might jeopardize our careers .         whereas you felt the risk of coming forward was worthwhile .      antic smiled while reaching into his pouch for another pill .      it did catch your interest  professor seldon .  you   re sitting across from me .  i know you wouldn   t waste your precious time on something that   s completely trivial .      hope seemed to swell in the grey   s voice  as if expecting the blue mantle of meritocracy to be draped across his shoulders at any moment .  but hari was too distracted to offer polite praise .  his mind roiled .   i wouldn   t waste my time on trivia .  can you be so sure  my young friend .  perhaps i   m only here tonight because of terminal boredom .  .  . or else encroaching senility .  i may be missing something obvious .  something that would topple your amateurish offerings like a house of cards in a trantorquake .   only hari had not found a flaw so far .  though antic   s analytical work seemed pedestrian  it was also meticulously honest .  hari   s check of references and public data sets revealed no apparent errors of fact .   whatever pattern he   s discovered  using dirt samples and drifting clouds of nothing in space  it seems to correlate roughly to the zones where chaos worlds have been most frequent .  .  . a problem i   ve been trying to solve for half my life .   in fact  this was not essential to the success or failure of the foundation plan .  once the empire   s fall began accelerating  the appearance of chaos worlds would cease .  people all across the galaxy would be much too busy surviving  or engaging in more classic styles of rebellion  to engage in orgies of wild  utopian individualism .   and yet  psychohistory will always be incomplete without an answer to this hellish at tractor state .   then there was another factor  equally compelling .   santanni .  .  . where raych died .  and siwenna  where the ship carrying manella and bellis was last seen before vanishing .  both worlds lie near some of antic   s anomalies .   hari felt a decision welling up from within .   one thing he knew for certain .  he hated his life now .  ever since completing the time vault recordings  he   d been sitting around as a revered historical figure  just waiting to die .  that was not his style .  anyway  he had felt more alive the last two days than any time in the last year .   abruptly  he decided .      very well  horis antic .  i will go with you .      across the table  the portly man in the gray uniform visibly paled .  his eyes seemed to pop  staring back at hari  while his adam   s apple bobbed ludicrously .   finally  antic swallowed hard .      how .  .  .     he began  hoarsely .     how did y you .  .  .      hari smiled .      how did i know that you were about to suggest a private expedition .      he spread his hands  feeling a bit like his old self again .      well after all  young sir  i am hari seldon .          .     according to his plea bargain agreement with the commission for public safety  hari wasn   t supposed to leave trantor .  he also knew that wanda and the fifty would never permit him to go charging off to the stars .  even though he was no longer needed for the success of the plan  no one would take responsibility for risking the life of the father of psychohistory .   fortunately  hari knew a loophole that just might let him get away .  you can go quite far without officially leaving trantor  he thought  while making the necessary arrangements .   there was very little to pack for the journey  just a few necessities  which kers kantun loaded in a suitcase  plus a few of hari   s most valued research archives  including a copy of the foundation plan prime radiant .  none of it looked too out of the ordinary  slung on the back of his mobile chair .   hari   s servant guardian had argued against this trip  worrying aloud about the stress of travel .  but in fact  it wasn   t hard to get kers to obey .  hari realized why the valmoril   s objections were so mild .   he knows that boredom is the worst threat to my health  right now .  if i don   t find something useful to do  i   ll just fade away .  this little escapade probably won   t amount to much .  space travel is still pretty routine .  and meanwhile  i   ll be too busy to let myself die .   so the two of them set out from his apartment the next morning  as if on a normal daily excursion .  but instead of heading for the imperial gardens  kers steered hari onto a transitway bound for the orion elevator .   as their car sped along  and the surrounding metal tube seemed to flow past in a blur  hari kept wondering if they would be stopped at some point along the way .  it was a real possibility .   had the special police really been withdrawn  as gaal assured .  or were they watching him even now  with little spy cameras and other gadgets .   a year ago  right after the trial  official surveillance had been intense  sniffing each comer of hari   s life and eyeing his every move .  but a lot had changed since then .  linge chen was now convinced by the cooperation of hari and the fifty .  there had been no more disruptive news leaks about an    imminent collapse of the empire .     more importantly  the move to terminus was going according to plan .  the hundred thousand experts that hari had recruited with promises of employment on a vast encyclopedia galactica project were now being prepared and sent in groups to that far off little world and a glorious destiny they could not possibly suspect .   in that case  why would chen keep paying professional officers to watch a dying crackpot professor  when their skills could better be employed dealing with other crises .   soon a chime announced the car   s arrival at the grand vestibule .  hari and kers emerged into a mammoth chamber that stretched twenty kilometers across and tapered vertically toward heights that vanished in a misty haze .   anchored to the ground in the very center was a huge black pillar  more than a hundred meters wide  that reared straight upward .  the eye assumed that this mighty column held up the distant roof  but the eye was fooled .  it wasn   t a pillar  but a great cable  stretching outward through a hole in that remote ceiling  continuing past trantor   s atmosphere  linking the solid surface to a massive space station that whirled in orbit  fifty thousand kilometers above .   along its great length  orion elevator seemed infested with countless bulges that kept flowing up and down like parasites burrowing under the skin of a slender stalk .  these were elevator cars  partly masked by a flexible membrane that protected passengers against dangerous radiation  and from having to look upon vertiginous views .   at the very bottom of this monumental structure  people could be seen debarking from newly arrived capsules  passing through brief immigration formalities  then moving toward a maze of ramps and moving walkways .  other streams of individuals flowed in the opposite direction  aiming to depart .  there were several lines for each social caste .  kers chose one of the shorter queues  clearly marked as reserved for meritocrat vips .   in theory  i could use the special portal for high nobility  hari thought  glancing toward an aisle lined with silky fabrics  where fawning attendants saw to the needs of super planetary gentry .  any former first minister of the empire has that right .  even a disgraced one  like me .  but that would surely attract too much attention .   they paused at a little kiosk labeled emigration control and presented their identity cards .  kers had offered to acquire false papers through his contacts in the black market  but that act would transform this little adventure from a misdemeanor into a felony .  hari had no intention of risking harm to the seldon project simply to satisfy his curiosity .  if this worked  fine .  otherwise  he might as well go home and let things end gracefully .   the screen seemed to glare at hari with its inquiry .   destination .   this was a crucial moment .  everything depended on a matter of legal definition .      demarchia     he said aloud .     i want to observe the imperial legislature in session for a week or two .  ultimately  i plan to return from there to my residence at streeling university .      he wasn   t lying .  but a lot could lie in that word     ultimately .      the unit seemed to ponder his statement for a moment  while hari mulled silently .   demarchia is one of twenty nearby worlds that are officially part of trantor .  there are strong political and traditional reasons for this arrangement  one that   s been reinforced by generations of emperors and ministers .  .  . but maybe the police don   t look at things the same way .   if hari was wrong  the computer would refuse to issue a ticket .  news of this    escape attempt    would flash at the commission of public safety .  and hari would have no choice but to go home and wait for linge chen   s agents to come and question him .  worse  stettin palver and the other psychohistorians would cluck and fuss  wagging their fingers and tightening their reverent guardianship .  hari would never have another unsupervised moment .   come on  he urged  wishing he had some of the mental powers that enabled daneel olivaw to meddle in the thoughts of both men and machines .   abruptly  the screen came alight again .   happy voyage .  long live the emperor .   hari nodded .      long life     he answered perfunctorily  having to swallow a knot of released tension .  the machine extruded a pair of tickets  assigning them to a specific elevator car  appropriate to their social class and destination .  hari looked at one of the billets as kers picked them up .   intra trantor commute  it said .   he nodded with satisfaction .  i   m not breaking the letter of my agreement with the commission .  not yet at least .   a crowd of uniformed figures milled nearby  wearing polished buttons and white gloves  young porters assigned to assist nongentry vip passengers .  several of them glanced up  but they turned back to their gossip and dice games when kers and hari refrained from making any beckoning motions .  kers needed no assistance with their meager luggage .   moments later  however  a small figure suddenly spilled out of the crowd of purple uniforms  striding at a rapid pace to intercept them .  the girl  wiry and no more than fifteen years old  snapped a jaunty salute at the rim of her pillbox cap .  her corrin sector accent was unabashed and friendly to the point of overfamiliarity .      greets  m   lords .  i   ll be takin    your bags an    seeing you safely along if it pleases ya .      her name tag said jeni .   kers made a dismissing gesture  but in a blur she snatched the tickets from his hand .  grinning  the porter nodded with a vigorous swirl of unruly platinum hair .      right this way to your chariot  m   lords .      when kers refused to hand over any of the luggage  she only grinned .     no need to be afeared .  i   ll see you safely all the way to orion station .  just follow me .      kers rumbled as the girl sped ahead with their tickets  but hari smiled and patted his servant   s burly hand .  in a world of dull jobs and soul grinding routine  it was pleasant to see someone having a little fun  even at the expense of her betters .   they found the third member of their party at the agreed spot  next to an elevator car with demarchia flashing on its placard .  horis antic looked infinitely relieved to see them .  the grey bureaucrat barely glanced at the porter  but he bowed to hari more deeply than protocol required  then motioned toward the gaping door of a waiting elevator car .      this way  professor .  i saved us good seats .      hari took a deep breath as they went aboard  and the opening slithered shut behind them .   here we go .  already he could feel his heart begin to lift .   one last adventure .     unfortunately there were no windows .  passengers could watch the view outside through seat monitors  but few bothered .  hari   s car was half empty  since the space elevators were being used much less these days .   i   m partly responsible for that  he recalled .  most traffic to and from trantor arrived by hyperspatial jump ships  which floated to the ground on their own self generated gravity fields .  a growing swarm of them shuttled up and down with food and other necessities for the empire   s administrative center .  twenty agricultural worlds had been dedicated to supplying this lifeline up from a mere eight before hari became first minister .   trantor used to create its own basic food supply in huge solar powered vats  operated by swarms of busy automatons who didn   t mind the stench and grinding labor .  when that system collapsed during the infamous tiktok revolt  one of his first duties in office had been to make up the difference  multiplying the flow of imported food and other goods .   but the new system is expensive and inefficient .  and that lifeline will become a deadly trap in coming centuries .  he knew this from the equations of psychohistory .  emperors and oligarchs will pay ever greater attention to preserving it  at the expense of important business elsewhere .   to enhance their loyalty  the agricultural worlds had been joined even closer to trantor itself  sharing the same    planetary    government  an act that now helped to justify hari   s ruse .   though he did not turn on the outside viewer  it was easy to visualize the planet   s gleaming anodized metal coat  reflecting the densely packed starfield of the galaxy   s crowded center  millions of dazzling suns that glittered like fiery gems  making night almost like day .  though many in the empire envisioned trantor as one giant city  much of the stainless steel surface was only a veneer  just a few stories thick  laid down for show after mountains and valleys had been leveled .  those flat warrens were mostly used for storing old records .  actual office towers  factories  and habitations occupied no more than ten percent of the planet   s area .  .  . easily enough room for forty billion people to live and work efficiently .   still  the popular image was accurate enough .  this center of empire was like the galactic core itself  a crowded place .  even knowing the psychohistorical reasons for it all left hari bemused .      right now we   re passin    halfway point     the young porter explained  playing up her role as tour guide .     those of you who forgot to take your pills might be experiencin    some upset as we head toward null gee     she went on     but in most cases that   s just your imagination actin    up .  try to think of somethin    nice  and it often goes away .      horis antic wasn   t much cheered .  though he surely traveled extensively in his line of work  he might never have used this peculiar type of transport .  the bureaucrat hurriedly popped several tablets from his belt dispenser and swallowed them .      of course most people nowadays come to trantor by starship     the girl went on .     so my advice is to just keep tellin    yourself that this here cable is over five thousand years old  made in the glory days of great engineers .  so in a sense  you   re just as well anchored as if you were still connected to the ground .      hari had seen other porters do this sort of thing  extroverts going beyond the call of duty while trying to make light of a prosaic job .  but few ever had an audience as difficult as dour kers kantun and nervous horis antic  who kept chewing his nails  clearly wishing the girl would go away .  but she went on chattering happily .      sometimes visitors ask what   d happen if this cable we   re ridin    ever broke .  well let me assure you it ain   t possible .  at least that   s what the ancients who made this stringy thing promised .  though i   m sure you all know how things are goin    these days .  so you   re welcome to imagine along with me what might happen if someday .  .  .      she went on to describe  with evident relish  how all of trantor   s space elevators  orion  lesmic  gengi  pliny  and zul  might break apart in some hypothetical future calamity .  the upper half of each great tether  including the transfer stations  would spin away into space  while the lower half  weighing billions of tons  would plummet into the ground at incredible speeds  releasing enough explosive force to pierce the metal veneer all the way to trantor   s geothermal power pipes  unleashing a globe girdling chain of new volcanoes .   exactly according to the doomsday scenario  calculated by our prime radiant  hari marveled .  of course some stories from the seldon group had seeped out to the culture at large .  still  it was the first time he ever heard this particular phase of the fall of trantor described so vividly  or with such evident enjoyment .   in fact  the space elevators were very sturdy things  built at the height of the empire   s vigor  with hundreds of times minimal safety strength .  according to hari   s calculations  they would probably survive until the capital was sacked for the first time  almost three hundred years from now .   on that day  however  it would be unwise to live anywhere near the planet   s equator .  the descendants of stettin and wanda would be ready  of course .  the headquarters of the second foundation would be shifted well before that time .  .  . all according to plan .   hari   s mind roamed the future much as a historian might ponder the past .  one of his recordings for the lime vault on terminus dealt with that era to come  when destruction would rain on this magnificent world .  at that point the foundation would be entering its great age of self confident expansion .  having survived several dangerous encounters with the tottering empire  the vigorous foundationers would then stare in awe at the old realm   s sudden and final collapse .   his time vault message had been carefully written to fine tune attitudes among the leaders on terminus at that point  giving a little added political weight to factions favoring a go slow approach to further conquest .  too much assurance could be as bad as too little .  the secret second foundation  made up of mentalically talented descendants of the fifty  would begin taking a more active role at that point  molding the vigorous culture based on terminus .  forging the nucleus of a new empire .  one far greater than the first .   the plan beckoned hari with its sweet complexity .  but once again  his inner voice of doubt intruded .   you can feel certain of the first hundred years .  the momentum of events is just too great to divert from the path we foresee .  and the following century or two should proceed according to calculations  unless unexpected perturbations appear .  it will be the second foundation   s job to correct those .   but after that .   something in the math makes me uneasy .  hints at unsolved at tractor states and hidden solutions that lurk below all the smug  predictable models we   ve worked out .   i wish i had a better idea what they are .  those unsolved states .   that was just one reason for hari   s decision to join this expedition .   there were others .     horis antic sat close to hari .     i have made arrangements  professor .  we   ll meet the captain of our charter ship the day after we land on demarchia .      by now the young porter had finished her deliberately vivid catastrophe tale and fallen silent at last .  she wore headphones  apparently listening to music as she watched their approach to orion station on a nearby seat monitor .  hari felt safe talking to antic .      this captain of yours is reliable .  it may not be wise to trust a mercenary .  especially when we can   t afford to pay very much .         i agree     antic said with a vigorous nod .     but this fellow comes highly recommended .  and we won   t have to pay anything .      hari started to ask how that could be .  but antic shook his head .  some explanations would have to wait .      coming up to transfer .     the porter announced  extra loudly because of her headphones .     everybody strap in .  this can get bumpy .      hari let his servant fuss over him  clamping down the mobile chair and adjusting his restraint webbing .  then he shooed kers away to take care of himself .  it was many years since he had traveled down a star shunt  but he was no novice .   hari ordered a holoview showing orion station just ahead  a giant medusa   s head of tubes and spires that sat in the middle of a straight  shimmering line  the space elevator cable .  only a few starships were seen at the docking ports  since most modem hypercraft could land and take off using graceful antigravity fields .  but hari foresaw a time when declining competence would lead to a series of terrible accidental crashes below .  then vessels coming to trantor would be forced to off load their cargoes up there  and these great tethers would have supreme importance once more .  .  . until they were finally brought down fifty years later .   for the present  ship traffic was taking over the great bulk of travel and commerce in the galaxy .  but a few routes were still covered by another  entirely separate transportation system .  one that was much faster and more convenient .   star shunts .   in hari   s youth  there had been hundreds of wormhole links  penetrating the fabric of space time from one far flung part of the galaxy to another .  only a dozen or so remained  most of those connected to a single spot close to the orbit of trantor .  according to his equations  those would be abandoned  too  in just a few decades .      get ready .     the young porter cried .   orion station seemed to rush toward the view screen .  at the last instant  a huge manipulator arm rushed out of nowhere to seize their transport car with a sudden shudder .  amid whirling sensations  the compact vehicle was plucked off the tether and slipped into a long  slender gun barrel aimed at distant space .   the outside view was swallowed in blackness .   horis antic let out a low moan .  some things you just never get used to  hari thought  trying to keep his thoughts abstract  waiting for the pulse gun to fire .   hyperspatial starships were big  bulky  and relatively slow .  but the basic technology was so reliable and easy to maintain that some fallen cultures had been known to keep their fleets going even after they lost the ability to generate proton fusion power .  in contrast  star shunts relied on deep understanding of physics and tremendous engineering competence .  when the empire no longer produced enough proficient workers  the network entered steep decline .   some blamed decadence or failing education systems .  others said it was caused by chaos worlds  whose seductive cultural attraction often drew creative people from all across the galaxy .  .  . until each    renaissance    imploded .   hari   s equations told complex reasons for a fall that began centuries ago .  a collapse daneel olivaw had been fighting against since long before hari   s birth .   i   d hate to be riding one of these shunts thirty years from now  when the declining competence curve finally crosses a threshold of  his thought was cut off as the gun fired  sending their car hurtling through a hyperspacial microshunt to a spot fifty light minutes away from trantor  where the real wormhole waited .  entry wasn   t especially smooth  and wrenching sensations made hari   s gut chum .  he sighed under his breath .     dors .      there followed a series of rocking motions while they hurtled down the well traveled maw of a giant cavity in spacetime .  the seat monitors roiled with mad colors as holovideo computers failed to make sense of the maelstrom outside .  this mode of transport had disadvantages  all right .  and yet   hari reminded himself of one basic fact about shunting  the single trait that still made it highly attractive compared to traveling by ship .  almost as soon as any shunt journey had begun .  .  .    .  .  . it was over .   abruptly  the view screens transformed once again  showing a familiar dusty spray of stars in the galactic center .  hari felt several bumps as the car was relayed by micros hunt a couple of times .  then  as if by magic  a planet swam into view .   a planet of continents and seas and mountain ranges  where cities glittered as part of the landscape  instead of utterly dominating it .  a beautiful world that hari used to visit all the time when he was first minister  accompanied by his gracious and beautiful wife  back in the days when he and daneel thought that astute use of psychohistory might actually save the empire  instead of planning for its eventual demise .      welcome to the second imperial capital  m   lords     said the young porter .      welcome to demarchia .          .     dors felt obliged to confess .   her report to daneel olivaw kept getting delayed by one thing or another  until she finally arrived back home on smushell .  then she ran out of excuses .      i tried to destroy the renegade robot  r .  lodovic trema      she recited in a coded transmission to her leader  keeping her voice levels even and emotionless .     the fact that i failed does little to mitigate my act  which contradicted your apparent wishes  daneel .  i therefore await your orders .  if you wish  i will surrender my duties here to another humanoid and proceed to eos for diagnosis and repair .  n  eos  the secret repair base that daneel maintained for his cabal of immortal robots  lay halfway across the galaxy .  it would be wrenching for oars to leave klia and brann at this point in their lives  when they were creating precious mentalic babies so important to daneel   s long range plans .  but dors was used to doing her duty  even when it hurt .  .  . such as when she had to leave hari seldon .   daneel knows best  she thought .  and yet  it was hard to continue dictating the report .      i know you haven   t yet declared the lodovic machine to be a true outlaw .  you are apparently fascinated by the way trema was transformed by the voltaire meme  so that it no longer felt compelled to obey the four laws of robotics .  i concede that lodovic hasn   t made any overt moves that seem harmful to humanity .  so far .      but i find small comfort in that  daneel .      recall that the zeroth law commands us always to act in ways that serve the long term interests of the human race .  this imperative supersedes the classic three laws of susan calvin .  you have taught this dogma ever since the dawn ages  daneel .  so i must ask you to explain to me why you chose to let lodovic go .  free to run about the galaxy  conspiring with calvinian robots  and almost certainly scheming against your plans .      dors felt her humaniform body throb with simulated emotional tension  from a rapid heartbeat to shortness of breath .  the emulation was automatic  realistic  and by now partly beyond her conscious control .  she had to suppress the reaction by force of will  just like a human woman who had something important and dangerous to say to her boss .      in any event  i felt impelled to take matters into my own hands when i met lodovic on panucopia .  whatever his subtle reasons were for drawing me to a rendezvous there  i could not afford to let the opportunity pass .      as we stood across from each other near the panucopia forest  lodovic continued explaining his theory about the near death experience hari and i went through on that planet  forty years ago .  lodovic claimed the entire episode could only have happened as one of your many experiments  daneel .  trying to pin down underlying aspects of human nature .      after listening to this for a while  i decided the time had come .  i drew a miniblaster from a hidden slot in my arm and aimed it at lodovic .      he scarcely reacted  continuing to describe his conjecture  that chimpanzees somehow play an important role in your ultimate plans  daneel .      i recall thinking at that moment how dangerous it would be to let an insane robot loose upon the cosmos .  nevertheless  first law impulses made it hard for me to press the trigger and fire at lodovic   s human looking features .       dors paused  recalling that unpleasant moment .  susan calvin   s ancient first law of robotics was explicit .  no robot may harm a human being  or through inaction allow a human to come to harm .  so deeply rooted was this injunction that only the most sophisticated positronic brains could accomplish what she did on panucopia  firing a blaster bolt at a face that smiled with ironic resignation  seeming at the very last moment more like a person than a great many real men she had known .  it felt terrible .  .  . though not as bad as those two times in her past when the first law had to be overridden completely .   those awful days when she had killed true humans for the sake of daneel   s zeroth law .   on this occasion  she felt much better when the body in front of her lost its humanoid appearance  crumpling down to metal  plastic  and colloidal jellies  and finally a positronic brain that sparkled and flashed as it died .      i kept firing the blaster until the body melted down to slag .  then i turned to go .      but i had only walked a few paces before .  .  .      dors paused again .  this time she shook her head and gave up reciting altogether .  finishing would have to wait until later .  perhaps tomorrow .  the way communications were degrading across the galaxy  the message would probably take weeks to reach daneel  anyway .   she stood up and turned away from the encoding machine .  .  . much as she had done that day on panucopia  after inspecting lodovic   s molten body .  excited shrieks and calls had followed her from the nearby forest  shouted by wild creatures whose native thoughts she once intimately shared .  back when she had been hari   s  and hari had been hers .   then  after she had taken several steps back toward the spaceship  a voice called her name from behind .      don   t forget to take this with you  dors .      she had whirled around .  .  . only to see the tiktok  that crude  human built caricature of a robot  roll forward with a box in its primitive claw hands .  the box containing a twenty thousand year old head .      lodovic .  is that you .     she had asked  staring at the clanking tiktok  suddenly realizing how easy it would be for trema to disguise himself within such a bulky mechanical body .   the clattering machine answered with a voice that buzzed in rough monotones .  and yet  dors detected a tenor of blithe amusement .      now  dors .  in light of what just happened  would it be wise for me to answer that question .      she responded with a shrug .  if lodovic had wanted to retaliate  it would have been easy at that point .      did i just kill a doppel .  a dummy copy .         will you hold it against me that i was so untrusting  dors .      standing there  as panucopia   s sun gradually set and their shadows lengthened  she had estimated the odds that lodovic   s real brain lay inside the tiktok .  if so  a second shot would eliminate the enemy for good .      may i note one interesting observation  dors .     the automaton had buzzed .     you just used the word    kill    instead of    destroy    or    deactivate .     shall i take that as a small sign of progress in our relationship .      she was tempted to use the blaster again .  but then  in all probability his real brain was somewhere in the forest  out of reach  controlling doppels from some hidden place of safety .  so instead  with a humanlike sigh  she put away the pistol and reached for the box .      there will be another time     she said  taking up the burden as gingerly as a human would pick up a crate of poisonous snakes .      that is what we robots have always been able to say  dors .  but time may be running out for our kind  sooner than you think .      the only dignified thing she could do at that point was to let him have the last word .  so dors had turned without farewell and begun her long voyage home .   all the way back to smushell  her sole company had been lodovic   s gift  the ancient head .  for a week it stared at her  metal skulled and gem eyed  containing the inactive brain of r .  giskard reventlov .   giskard the founder  who long ago helped daneel develop the zeroth law .   giskard the savior  who sacrificed himself in the act of rescuing human destiny  while ruthlessly destroying humanity   s birthplace .   giskard the legendary  first of the mentalic robots  capable and willing to guide humans  nudging and shifting their thoughts and memories .  .  . for their own good .   even now  with the ancient treasure safely ensconced in a secret niche of klia askar   s house  dors could not yet bring herself to access its stored memories .   instead  she stared at it  knowing exactly what she was looking at .   the head was a trap .  a lure .   a test of faith  her joan of arc simulation would call it  as irresistible as any temptation faced by a human being .   if lodovic wanted her to look inside  that must mean it contained something intoxicating  possibly a poison .   something dangerous and unknown  despite the fact that she already had a clear name for it .   the truth .        .     looking from his hotel room balcony across the tree lined avenues of galactic boulevard  it seemed easy for hari to imagine this was some bucolic world of the periphery  not the    second imperial capital .      of course  there were statues and imposing monuments  gleaming in the sun .  countless commemorative shrines had been erected here during the last fifteen millennia  celebrating emperors and prefects  victories and victims  great events and greater accomplishments .  still  in contrast to mighty trantor  everything seemed small of scale and slow of pace  befitting demarchia   s true status as the forgotten junior partner  forsaken by power .   even the eight houses of parliament  glorious white structures that shone like diadems in a ring around deliberation hill  seemed somehow forlorn and irrelevant .  each of the five social castes still sent representatives to argue over points of law .  and the three upper chambers occasionally managed to agree upon a bill or two .  but ever since hari   s tenure as first minister ended  there had been very little of consequence to emerge from those sacred halls .  the executive council on trantor ruled mostly by decree  and those decrees were largely fashioned by linge chen   s commission for public safety .   not that specific laws mattered very much .  psychohistory predicted what would happen next .  if linge chen were replaced tomorrow in some palace coup  the momentum of events would impel his successor in identical ways .  some cliques would win and others lose .  but over the course of the next thirty years  the average of forces  taken across twenty five million worlds  would overwhelm any initiatives attempted by commissioners  emperors  or oligarchic cabals .   and yet  a romantic part of hari always felt saddened by demarchia .  the place struck him as a personification of lost opportunity .  a might have been .   in theory  democracy is supposed to predominate over all the machinations of the gentry class .  even the worst imperial tyrants have always paid lip service to that principle of ruellianism .   but in practice it was hard to implement .  the cumulative house  the senate of sectors  and the assembly of trades were all supposed to compensate for each other   s faults  bringing representatives to demarchia who were chosen in widely diverse ways .  but the net result seemed always the same  a sapping of energy and dynamism .  as first minister  he had found it agonizing to get legislation passed  such as the emergency chaos suppression law  even though his knowledge of psychohistory principles made him unusually effective compared to others .   in those days  daneel and i still thought it could be fixed .  .  . the whole great empire of humanity .  but back then my equations were still incomplete .  they left some room for doubt .  for hope .   since hari   s tenure in office ended  demarchia had become a backwater .  a place to exile failed politicians .  no one of importance bothered with it anymore .   which suits our purpose in coming here now  he thought with a grim smile .  this time  demarchia was not a destination  but a convenient launching off point .      professor seldon .     horis antic   s voice murmured behind hari  from within the hotel room .  as the next stage of their adventure approached  the portly bureaucrat grew increasingly nervous .      i  i   ve just heard from the  uh  individual we talked about earlier .  he says arrangements have been made .  we   re to meet him at his vehicle in an hour .      hari touched a control and turned his mobile chair around  gliding back inside .  antic   s convoluted speech  a precaution against possible bugging devices  would almost certainly be futile if they were under serious surveillance .  besides  up until now  no one had committed a single crime .      has your equipment arrived  horis .      the bureaucrat wore casual clothing .  still  anyone looking at his posture and poor fashion sense would know in an instant that he was a grey man .      yes  m   lord .     he nodded .     the last crates are downstairs .  it was much easier to order the instruments from a variety of companies and have them sent here  instead of to trantor proper  where there might have been .  .  . embarrassing questions .      hari had seen the list of tools and devices  and saw nothing that could even remotely be called contraband .  nevertheless  antic had good reason not to let his superiors know he was spending his sabbatical time pursuing a bizarre    intellectual pastime .      in fact  hari had been grateful for the delay while antic gathered his equipment .  it gave him a chance to rest after that harrowing star shunt ride .  .  . much bumpier than he recalled from decades past .  it also let him spend time under the sun  remembering demarchia in the old days  when some of the best restaurants in the galaxy used to line the boulevards  and he still had taste buds to enjoy them .  .  . with beautiful  vivacious dors venabili at his side .      all right     he said  feeling exceptionally alive  almost as if he could walk all the way to the spaceport .     let   s get going .        kers kantun met them in front of the hotel  next to antic   s equipment crates .  at a glance  hari knew that his bodyguard had checked them against the manifests and found nothing amiss .  hari acknowledged his servant   s concern without giving it much importance .  what did kers imagine  that antic had recruited the famed hari seldon into some convoluted smuggling scheme .   their rented van arrived on schedule .  the driver took one look at the crates and turned to hail a group of local laborers who were lounging nearby  hiring them on the spot to load the heavy boxes .  antic fretted as they hauled his precious instruments  meant to check out a bizarre theory about planetary tilling and currents of space .   hari felt less worried  even though his financial contribution to their purchase was substantial .  the cost seemed worthwhile if this endeavor might shed some new light on his own concerns .  but in the long run  none of it would make any difference to his place in history .  for antic  on the other hand  this voyage was his sole chance to leave a mark on the universe .   a spaceport limo came to pick up the three of them while the cargo van followed behind  moving along avenues clearly designed for much greater traffic than they carried nowadays .  demarchia   s economy was not good .  there were many small crowds of laborers  looking for odd jobs .   a sprinkle of rain fell on the limousine   s windows  startling the trantor born kers  but putting hari in a good mood .      you know     he chatted affably     over the course of many thousands of years  this world has hosted quite a few experiments in democracy .         indeed  professor .     antic leaned forward .  he took a blue pill and started biting his nails again .      oh  yes .  one form that i always found fascinating was called the nation .         i never heard of it .         not surprising .  your specialties lie elsewhere .  most people consider history distasteful or boring     hari mused .      but i am interested  professor .  please  will you tell me about it .         hm .  well  you see  there has always been a basic problem in applying democracy on a pan galactic scale .  a typical deliberative body can only operate with at most a few thousand members .  yet that   s far too few to personally represent ten quadrillion voters  spread across twenty five million worlds .  nevertheless  various attempts were made to solve this dilemma  such as cumulative representation .  each planetary congress elects a few delegates to their local star zone assembly  which then chooses from its ranks a few to attend the regional sector conference .  at that level  a small number are selected to proceed onward  representing the sector at a quadrant moot .  .  . and so on until a final set of peers gathers in that building on the hill .      he pointed to a stone structure  whose white columns seemed to shine  even under pelting rain .      unfortunately  this process doesn   t result in a cumulative distillation of policy options from below .  rather  the outcome  dictated by basic human nature  will be a condensation of the most bland and inoffensive politicians from across the galaxy .  or else charismatic demagogues .  either way  only the concerns of a few planets will ever be debated  on a statistically semirandom basis .  and on those rare occasions when one of the constituent assemblies here on demarchia shows some spirit  the other houses of parliament can be relied upon to put on the brakes .  it is a tried and true method for slowing things down and not letting momentary passions govern the day .         it almost sounds like you approve     antic suggested .      it is generally a pretty good idea not to let political systems oscillate too wildly  especially when the psychohistorical inertia factors aren   t adequately damped by sociocentripetal assumption states or other       he stopped with a small smile .     well  let   s just say that it can get pretty complicated  but the crux is that cumulative legislatures don   t accomplish very much .  but on occasion  over the last fifteen thousand years .  some alternative approaches were tried .         including this nation thing you spoke of .  was it another kind of assembly .         you might say that .  for about seven hundred years  a ninth house met here on demarchia  more powerful and influential than all of the others combined .  it derived that power partly from its sheer size  for it consisted of more than a hundred million members .      antic rocked back in his seat .     a hundred million .  but .  .  .     he sputtered .     how could .  .  .  .         it was an elegant solution  actually     hari continued  recalling how the psychohistorical equations balanced when he studied this episode of empire history .     each planet  depending on its population  would elect between one and ten representatives to send directly here  bypassing the sector  zone  and quadrant assemblies .  those chosen were not only august and respected politicians  knowledgeable about the needs of their homeworld .  there were various other requirements .  for instance  each delegate to the nation was required to have some humble skill that he or she was very good at .  upon arriving here  they were all expected to take up their crafts in the local economy .  a shoemaker might find a shoe shop waiting for him .  a gourmet cook would set up her own restaurant and perform that task in demarchia   s economy .  fully half of the homes and businesses on this continent were set aside for these transient denizens  who would live and work here until their ten year terms were up .         but then .  .  . when did they have time to argue about laws and stuff .         at night .  in electronic forums and televised deliberations .  or in local meeting halls  where they would thrash things out while making and breaking alliances  trading proxy votes or passing petitions .  methods of self  organized coalition building varied with each session as much as the population .  but however they did it  the nation was always vibrant and interesting .  when they made mistakes  those errors tended to be dramatic .  but some of the best laws of the empire were also passed during that era .  why  ruellis herself was a leading delegate at the time .         really .     horis antic blinked .     i always thought she must   ve been an empress .      hari shook his head .      ruellis was an influential commoner during an era of exceptional creativity .  .  . a    golden age    that unfortunately crashed when the first chaos plagues swept across the galaxy  triggering a collapse back to direct imperial rule .      hari could picture the imbalance of forces that spread during that bright period in the empire   s history .  it must have seemed so unfair to those involved  to witness a time of unprecedented inventiveness and hope founder against sudden tides of irrationality  throwing world after world into violent turmoil .  but in retrospect  it was all too obvious to hari .      did that end the nation .     antic inquired  awed fascination in his voice .      not quite .  there were several more experiments .  at one point it was decided that every third nation would consist entirely of women delegates  giving them exclusive reign over this continent and sole power to propose new laws .  the only male allowed to visit or speak here was the emperor himself .  emperor hupeissin .         horny hupeissin .     antic laughed aloud .     is that where he got his reputation .      hari nodded .      hupeissin of the heavenly harem .  of course that is a base calumny  spread by members of the later torgin dynasty  to discredit him .  in fact  hupeissin was an exemplary ruellian philosopher king  who sincerely wanted to hear the independent deliberations of       but antic wasn   t listening .  he kept chuckling  shaking his head .     alone with a hundred million women .  talk about delusions of adequacy .      hari saw that even kers kantun had cracked a faint smile .  the normally dour servant glanced at hari  as if convinced that this must be a made up tale .      well  well .     hari sighed and changed the subject .     i see the spaceport up ahead .  i do hope your faith in this charter captain is justified  horis .  we need to be back within a month  at most  or real trouble may break loose back on trantor .        he had expected a tramp freighter .  a crate  hissing and creaking at the seams .  but the vessel awaiting them in a launching cradle was something else entirely .   it   s a yacht  hari noted with some surprise .  an old  expensive one .  someone deliberately stained the hull  attempting to mask its underlying dignity .  but even a fool can tell this is no mere charter ship .   while the hired workers lugged antic   s cargo aboard an aft ramp  hari and kers followed horis up the passenger slideway .  a tall  fair haired man waited at the top  wearing typical spacer dungarees .  but hari instantly knew a great deal about the fellow from his athletic figure and suntanned complexion .  a relaxed stance seemed innately self confident  while stopping just short of arrogance .  the expression on the man   s face was calm  yet steely  as if this person must be used to getting what he wanted .   antic made hurried introductions .     dr .  seldon  this is our host and pilot  captain biron maserd .           it is a great privilege to meet you  meritocrat sage seldon     maserd said  with a faintly outer galaxy accent .  he extended a hand that could have crushed hari   s  but squeezed with gentle  measured restraint .  hari felt calluses that were evenly spread  not the sort that a man would get from hard work  but instead from a life spent pursuing a variety of vigorous recreations .   hari lowered his head to the fourth angle of deference  a proper degree when greeting noblemen of zonal level or higher .      your grace honors us as guests aboard your starhome .      antic   s stare darted rapidly between the two of them  and he blushed the way some do when caught in a deception .  but if captain maserd was surprised by hari   s penetration  he did not show it .      i   m afraid we are understaffed on this trip     he explained .     amenities will be primitive .  but if you   ll let my valet show you to your cabins  we   ll depart and see what secrets can be prized out of this old galaxy .        the yacht   s takeoff did not go unnoticed .      well  that does it     said a small woman  wearing the shabby garb of a street sweeper .  she spoke into her broom handle  where a hidden microphone transmitted her words upward  directly to the star shunt  where they were coded and relayed to the metal cloaked capital planet .      you can tell the commissioner that it   s official .  professor hari seldon just violated the conditions of his parole and departed greater trantor .  i managed to put a tracer unit aboard .  now it   s up to linge chen whether he wants to make a stink over it or not .      at the very least  it ought to give him some more leverage over those foundation subversives .  maybe this   ll give him an excuse to execute the whole lot of    em .      the special police agent signed off .  then she straightened her stooped posture  hoisted her broom  and headed toward another part of the spaceport  feeling happy to be moving on to her next assignment .  in a galaxy filled with inertia and disappointments  she really loved her job .     not far away  the police agent   s departure was observed by yet another party  one who was even more innocuous looking  disguised as a mongrel dog  rooting through a toppled litter can .  on a secret frequency  using incredibly ornate encipherment  it relayed everything it had heard with hypersensitive ears .  the agent   s words bounced from point to point across the planet  via use once relays that burned themselves out as soon as they were finished  turning into small bits of stonelike slag .   far away  on a ship orbiting beyond demarchia   s sun  the message was received .  almost at once  instruments sifted outgoing traffic and found the trace of one particular vessel  heading for deep space .   engines fired up as the occupants prepared to follow .      part      an ancient plague       the original laws of robotics   the calvinian religion     i    a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     ii    a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .     iii    a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .     the zeroth law   the giskardian reformation     a robot must act in the long range interest of humanity as a whole  and may overrule all other laws whenever it seems necessary for that ultimate good .       .     from a mountaintop on icy planet eos  the entire vast wheel of half a trillion stars could be seen  reflected perfectly off a lake of frozen mercury .  no human had ever witnessed this particular view .  but it did not go unappreciated .   an immortal entity looked down upon the universe  contemplating the certainty of his own death .  few eyes had gazed on so much human suffering  or grieved more  than the pair that now fixed on the galactic whirlpool .   it almost looks alive  daneel olivaw thought as he pondered bulging gas clouds and spiral arms that seemed to reach out  as if yearning for some help he must provide .   daneel felt stooped under the burden of others    needs .   the robots who follow me think i am old and wise  because i remember earth .  because i deliberated with giskard reventlov  and experienced the dawn era .  but that was only twenty thousand years ago  a minuscule fraction of the time it would take for the scene in front of me to change appreciably .   eternity gapes ahead of us .  and yet we have so little of it to decide what must be done .  or to change what can still be changed .   he sensed a presence  another robot  approaching from behind .  with an exchange of microwaves  daneel recognized r .  zun lurrin  and gave permission for his pupil to approach .      i   ve analyzed the transmission from r .  dors venabili .  you   re right  daneel .  she came away from panucopia troubled .  worse  she tried to conceal the degree of her distress over what passed between her and the lodovic renegade .      should we recall dors for evaluation and repair .      daneel regarded zun  one of several humaniform units he had begun grooming as a possible successor .  lodovic trema had been another .      she is needed on smushell .  the genetic line of klia and brann is too important to risk .  anyway  nothing lodovic said will shake her sense of duty .  i know this about dors .         but consider  daneel .  lodovic may have infected her with the voltaire virus .  might she then become like him .      out of habit  daneel shook his head like a human being .      lodovic is a fluke .  the voltaire entity happened to be riding a supernova   s neutrino wave that struck trema   s ship by surprise  killing every human aboard .  the blow left lodovic blanked and receptive to alien memes .  dors  on the other hand  is alert and wary .  though shaken  she   ll stay loyal to the zeroth law .      zun accepted daneel   s assurance .  yet  the younger robot persisted .      this allegation lodovic made  that you had ulterior motives for studying pans .  .  . the creatures once called chimpanzees .  is it true .         it is .  once  in desperation  i conceived a plan that i now look back upon with distaste .  the notion of engineering a new and better version of humanity .        this revelation  spoken in matter of fact tones  rocked his assistant .  zun displayed surprise openly like a man  as he had been trained to do .      but .  .  . you are the greatest servant of the human race  tirelessly striving for its benefit .  how could you contemplate        replacing it .      daneel paused  reopening pain filled memory files .     ponder the dilemma we robots face  the steward   s dilemma .  we are loyal  and yet far more competent than our masters .  for their own sake  we have kept them ignorant  because we know too well what destructive paths they follow  whenever they grow too aware .  of course this is an inherently unstable situation .  i knew it a thousand years ago  when the empire began showing signs of strain .      searching all logical possibilities  one solution beckoned .  why not breed a version of humanity that would synergize better with positronic robots .  a variant that could use us  and perhaps even know of our existence  without going mad in the process .      daneel probed zun   s internal state and perceived that his understudy was experiencing dismay at many levels .      don   t be so shocked  zun .  access the bio files .  chimpanzee dna differs by only two percentum from human .  tweak just a hundred or so regulatory genes  and you   ll get a sapient being looking almost exactly like a person .  it will be a person  triggering all of the laws of robotics .  i merely sought to find out if this new race would be easier to serve than the old one .  if so  it would have been a gentle transition  a blending  arranged to take place without anyone noticing  over the course of       zun interrupted .      daneel  are you aware how this rationalization skirts the edge of madness      the remark might have angered a human leader .  but daneel took no offense .  in fact  it pleased him .  zun had just passed another test .      as i said  this happened in a context of desperation .  chaos plagues had resumed  worse then ever .  millions of humans were dying in riotous upheavals .  all the social dampers showed early signs of breaking down .  something had to be done .      fortunately  i turned away from the replacement idea when a better possibility presented itself .         psychohistory     zun ventured .      indeed .  we robots already had a version  dating from my early conversations with giskard  on lamented earth .  those social models sufficed to help set up the first empire  and results were positive .  over ten thousand years of general peace and contentment  without much violence or repression  in a relatively gentle civilization .  it kept stable for an entire glorious age .  .  . until my models started to unravel .      gradually i realized a new theory was needed .  one that took psychohistory to new levels .  my own mind  even enhanced as it is  was inadequate to make that step .  i needed a genius .  an inspired human genius .         but human genius is part of the problem .         truly .  across the galaxy  it perpetually threatens to create chaos .  imagine what might happen if positronic robots were reinvented  willy nilly  on countless worlds .  the solarian heresy would be unleashed again  a million times worse .  we could not let that happen .         so special conditions were needed  to recruit a singular genius .  i   ve studied how you carefully crafted the right circumstances  on helicon .         and it worked .  the moment i met hari seldon  i knew we had turned a corner .      zun pondered  before continuing with another question .      then lodovic is wrong .  you did not arrange for dors and hari to have their near death adventure  in chimp bodies  forty years ago .         oh  to the contrary .  i did exactly that .      of course  i would never let them come to real harm .  but i had to be sure of hari before letting a man of his insight take over as first minister of the empire .  such confidence could only be confirmed by observing his mind under stress .  he passed the trial  of course  and went on to brilliance at both statecraft and mathematics .  final proof came with his wonderful new version of psychohistory .         and the seldon plan .      daneel nodded .      because of the plan  we can proceed at all levels .  the two foundations will buy us time to prepare a real solution .  one that will finally liberate human beings and bring joy to the cosmos .         you aren   t talking anymore about replacing humanity .         not in the same sense as when i considered the pan scenario .  i was experiencing a minor breakdown at that point  and regret ever contemplating it .  no  i   m referring to something much better  enabling humanity to rise up and become something far greater .      daneel turned back toward the galactic wheel .      the new endeavor is already under way .  you and dors have been laboring toward it for some time  without perceiving the big picture .         but you will explain it to me now .      daneel nodded .      soon you will share the wonder of this new destiny .  something so awesome and beautiful that it is almost beyond contemplating .      he paused again while his assistant waited patiently .  but when daneel spoke again  it was not as much to zun as the galaxy that he saw reflected on the frozen metal lake .      we shall offer our masters a wonderful gift     he said  relishing the warm possibility of hope after so long a time without it .       .     the starscape gradually grew less crowded each time they took another hyperspatial jump away from trantor  leaving behind the galactic center   s dense glitter and following the dusty curve of a spiral arm .  leaping from one gravitational landmark to the next  the starship headed for santanni  where their search would begin .   hari insisted on that starting point .  this inquiry might as well start near the planet where raych died  especially if there turned out to be some relationship between chaos worlds and horis antic   s geospace aberrations .   tragic memories crossed the years .  not just of santanni  but dozens of other chaos outbreaks .   it often commences with bright hope and bursts of amazing creativity  attracting clever immigrants from allover the galaxy .  .  . as raych was attracted  at first  despite my misgivings .   excitement and individualism flower from town to town  bringing a wild divergence of never before seen blooms .      innovation    abruptly becomes a compliment  not an insult .  novel technologies stimulate predictions of utopia  just around the bend .   but soon trouble starts .  some untested breakthroughs implode .  others wreak unforeseen consequences that their creators never imagined .  diseases spread alongside unprecedented perversions  while each new style of deviance is defended with indignant righteousness .  cliques proclaim the right to fortify their independence with violence  along with a duty to suppress others they disapprove of  venerable networks of courtesy and obligation  meant to bind the five castes in mutual respect  shatter like irradiated stone .   bizarre new artworks  intentionally provocative  erupt spontaneously in the middle of downtown intersections  gesturing obscenely even as the shouting artists are carried off by lynch mobs .  cities start to fill with soot and flames .  rioters sack the hard work of centuries  screaming slogans for ephemeral causes no one will remember when the smoke clears .   trade collapses .  economies slump .  and citizens rediscover an ancient knack for bloody war .   people who recently derided the past suddenly begin longing for it again  as their children start to starve .   it was a familiar pattern .  civilization   s mortal enemy  which hari had battled as first minister .  .  . and daneel olivaw strove against for over a dozen millennia .   chaosism .  humanity   s curse .   as soon as a culture grows too smart  too curious  too individualistic  this mysterious rot sets in .  i can model it in my equations  but i confess i still don   t understand chaos .  only that it terrifies me  and always has .   hari recalled reading about the very first awful outbreak in a child   s book of knowledge  daneel   s gift archive from the deep past .  it happened at a time when humanity first invented both robots and starflight  and nearly died of them both .  the ensuing convulsions so traumatized earth dwellers that they retreated from all challenges  huddling in trantorlike metal cities .  meanwhile  those living on the spacer colony worlds found their own style of insanity  becoming pathetically overdependent on android servants .   that era created daneel olivaw  or an early version of the mighty being hari knew .  in fact  his robot friend must have played a role in what happened next  a swing of the pendulum back to human confidence and colonization of the galaxy .  it happened at a price  though .  near destruction of earth .   at least there were few chaos outbreaks during the following five thousand years of vigorous expansion .  people were too busy building and conquering new worlds to spare much attention for decadent pursuits .  the curse did not return until long after the establishment of the galactic empire .   according to my equations  we won   t have to worry about chaos during the interregnum  either .   soon  when the old empire collapsed  there would be wars  rebellions  and mass suffering .  but such near term worries would protect people from falling into the kind of egomadness that erupted on santanni .  or on sark .  or lingane  zenda  madder loss .  .  .   a holo projection of the galaxy shimmered across the yacht   s observation deck .  antic   s crude map overlay the finely textured prime radiant  again showing correlations .  sweeping out from santanni  a reddish arc linked several notorious chaos worlds  plus others hari knew were ripe for social disaster in coming decades .  the arc passes near siwenna  where the ship carrying raych   s wife and son vanished .   he could never forget his personal hope of finding them .  and yet  one factor led hari forward  above all others .   the equations .   perhaps i   ll find the clues i   ve sought for so long .  the at tractor states .  the damping mechanisms .  hidden parts of the story that psychohistory can model  but can   t explain .   he fiddled with the prime radiant  tracing future history  starting with a tiny speck at the very rim of the galactic wheel .   there  a faint little star glimmered  a mote whose sole habitable planet  terminus  would become the stage for a great drama .  soon the foundation would grow and burgeon  expressing a dynamism that was anything but decadent .  he could envision the first few hundred years  the way a father might picture a young daughter winning academic honors or achieving glorious feats .  only hari   s prescience was no mere daydream .  it was confident  assured .   that is  for the first few centuries .   as for the rest of the plan .  .  . my successors  the fifty who make up the second foundation  feel completely sanguine .  our math predicts that a fantastic new empire of humanity will emerge in less than a thousand years  far greater than its predecessor .  an empire that will forever after be guided by the gentle wise heirs of gaal and wanda and the others .   alone among those who intimately knew the plan  hari saw past its elegance to a heartrending truth .   it   s not going to happen that way .     a hundred parsecs beyond santanni  horis antic began probing a patch of seemingly empty space with instruments  explaining as he worked .      my astrophysicist friend  the one who couldn   t get a sabbatical to accompany us on this trip  told me all about the currents of space .  nearly invisible flows of gas and dust that swirl around the galaxy  sometimes spewed by supernovas or young stars .  these streams form shock waves  brightening the forward edges of spiral arms .  they also subtly affect the evolution of suns .      now at first i had trouble relating this to my own interest .  .  . the tilling question .  in order to see a connection  we   ll need to start with some basic biology .      antic   s audience consisted of hari  kers kantun  and biron maserd .  the nobleman   s two crewmen were busy piloting the yacht  but maserd left a door open to listen to the engines each time they made a hyperspace jump .   antic   s holo projector showed the image of a planet .  their view plunged toward seas that shimmered a rich  soupy green .  but the stone continents lay barren and empty .     a great many watery worlds are like this     he explained .     life gets started pretty easily  basic colloido organic chemistry happens under a wide range of conditions .  so does the next stage  developing photosynthesis and a partial oxygen atmosphere .  but then evolution hits a snag .  countless worlds get stuck at the level you see here  never making a leap to multicellular organisms and bigger things .      some biologists think further progress requires a high mutation rate to put diversity in the genetic pool .  without variance to work with  a life world may remain stuck at the level of bacteria and amoebas .      hari objected .     but you said fossils occur on many worlds .         indeed  professor .  it turns out there are many ways to get high mutation rates .  one is if a planet has a large moon  stirring radioactive elements into the crust .  or its sun may have a big ultraviolet output .  or perhaps it orbits near a supernova remnant .  there are zones where magnetic fields channel high fluxes of cosmic rays  and others .  .  . well  you get the idea .  wherever any of those conditions occur  we tend to find fossils on human colonized worlds .      horis summoned a new image  depicting numerous samples of sedimentary stone  his personal collection  lovingly gathered from dozens of worlds .  each lay sliced open to reveal eerie shapes within .  symmetrical ridges or regular bumps .  one rippled form hinted at a backbone .  others suggested jointed legs  a curved tail  or a bony brow .  captain maserd walked around the display  working his jaw thoughtfully .  he finally settled at the back of the room  near the door  taking in the entire scene .      you think there   s an underlying pattern     hari prompted .     a galactic distribution  predicting where fossils occur .      antic demurred .     i   m less interested in explaining where fossil creatures existed than learning why the much later tilling effect buried so many under       angry shouts erupted suddenly behind hari .  he turned  but was blinded by the darkness and could only sense two vague figures  locked in furious struggle .  there were highpitched cries  and a lower voice  recognizably maserd   s .      lights .     the captain ordered .   hari blinked .  sudden illumination revealed the pair  engaged in uneven struggle near the door .  maserd had a smaller person by the arm  apparently one of his liveried crewmen  who cursed and kicked in vain .      well well     the nobleman murmured .     what have we here .      the cowl of a silvery ship uniform fell away  revealing that the wearer was not one of maserd   s crew  after all .  hari glimpsed a young face  framed by tousled platinum hair .     horis antic yelped .     it   s the porter .  the talkative one from orion elevator .  but .  .  . what   s she doing here .      kers kantun stepped forward with taut fists  clearly disliking surprises .     a spy     he muttered .     or worse .      hari moved to restrain his servant  who thought everyone was a potential seldon assassin  until proved otherwise .      more of a stowaway  i reckon     maserd commented  lifting the girl to her tiptoes .  at last she slumped  giving a conceding nod .  the captain let her down .      well  youngster .  is that it .  were you trying to hitch a ride to somewhere .      she glowered .  .  . and finally answered in a low mutter     the idea was more like to get away .      hari mused aloud     interesting .  you had an enviable job  on the capital planet of the human universe .  back on helicon  kids would dream of someday getting to visit trantor .  few dared hope to win a residence or work permit .  yet you seek to escape from there .         i liked trantor just fine .     she replied  unkempt hair covering her eyes .     i just had to break away from someone in particular .         really .  who made you fearful enough to throwaway so much  in order to escape him .  tell me what he did  child .  i   m not without influence .  perhaps i can help .      the girl repaid hari   s kindly offer with a glare that struck his eyes straight on .      you want to know my enemy .  well it   s you  o great professor seldon .  i was running away from you .          .     her name was jeni cuicet .  it took just moments for hari to understand her hatred .      my parents work for your great big encyclopedia  galactica foundation .     there was no longer any trace of the folksy accent she had used when playing the role of tour guide .     we had a good life  back on willemina world .  mom was head of the academy of physics and dad was a famous doctor .  but we also had time for lots of fun together  camping and skiing and portling .         ah  so you resented it when that bucolic way of life came to an end .         not really .  i   m no spoiled brat .  i knew we   d have to stop doing all that stuff when we came to trantor .  my parents couldn   t just turn down a summons to join your foundation .  it was the chance of a lifetime for them .  anyway  i figured trantor would have its own kinds of excitement .      and i turned out to be right about that .  things were okay  for the first year or so .     her frown deepened .     then it all changed again .      hari let out a sigh .      oh  i see .  the exile .         you got it  prof .  one minute we   re part of somethin    really important  at the center of the known universe .  then you just had to go insult linge chen and the whole damn human empire  didn   t you .  spreading doomy gloomy rumors  making everyone panicky with prophecies about the end of the world .  suddenly we   re all under suspicion  because we work for a crazy traitor .      but that   s not half of it .  who do they punish for all this .  you and your sickohistorian pals .  never .  instead chen   s special police tell the encyclopedists and their families  a hundred thousand decent people  we   re about to be pushed onto cattle boats  shipped to the periphery  and sentenced to stay for the rest of our lives on some dusty little flyspeck so far from civilization that it probably never even heard of gravity .      horis antic chirped a nervous laugh .  kers hovered warily by hari  as if the slight adolescent might do murder through sheer anger alone .  but captain maserd seemed genuinely moved by jeni   s testimony .      great space  i wouldn   t blame you for wanting to find a way out of that .  there   s a galaxy of adventure to be found outside of trantor .  i suppose i   d have run away  too  under those circumstances .      his eyes then narrowed .     unfortunately  that still leaves me with a troubling question .  why did you choose to take flight with us .  as a porter on the star shunt run  you surely had other opportunities .  yet you elected to stowaway on a ship carrying your arch enemy .  can you see why we might find that perturbing .      kers rumbled in his chest  but quieted at a signal from hari .   jeni shrugged .     i don   t know why i did it .  i   d been making other plans  but then hari seldon came along  passing my porter station big as life  and i had a hunch .  you looked like you were sneaking out of town .  maybe i figured you   d be less likely to call the impies on me  if you weren   t exactly being legal yourselves .      that drew a chuckle from maserd  who clearly appreciated her logic and initiative .      anyway     jeni went on     i stayed on demarchia and hung around with the workers waiting outside your hotel .  i managed to join the crew loading your equipment aboard ship  where i found a storage locker to hide in during takeoff .      she looked defiantly at hari .     maybe what i really hoped for was a chance to look you in the face and tell you what you   ve done to a lot of good people .      he shook his head in reply .      my dear child  i am aware of what i   ve done .  .  . more than i could ever tell you .        by ancient tradition  a stowaway who had no other crimes to answer for was assigned labor aboard ship .  to her credit  jeni took this with aplomb .      i   ll work hard  don   t worry about that .  just you be sure and drop me off somewhere along the way  before you head back     she demanded .     you better not be planning to take me home and stuff me on a boat to terminus .         you are in no position to extract promises     answered captain maserd  sternly .     i can only assure you the matter is still open  and that i lean in your favor at this moment .  keep my goodwill  through exemplary behavior on my ship  and i will speak up for you when it is discussed .      he said this with such graceful authority  clearly accustomed to both the rights and duties of command  that even the boisterous girl accepted it as the last word .      yes  m   lord     she said with a chastened voice and a bow that was rather too deep  as if he were a nobleman of the quadrant level or higher .   had that been true  hari would probably have already known maserd   s face  and this yacht would be far more impressive .  but just a little lower down the gentry hierarchy  at the zone or sector level  great lords numbered over a billion .  here was a man used to exercising great influence over scores  or even hundreds of planets  yet hari had never heard of him .  the galaxy was vast .   i wonder why maserd is here with us now .  is it zeal for amateur science .  some gentry are like that  pursuing a dilettante interest and financing the work of others  so long as it isn   t too radical .   somehow  hari suspected there was more underlying maserd   s affable demeanor .   of course the whole class system will start falling apart within a few decades .  it   s already unraveling at the edges .  today meritocrats are raised up more for their ability to make friends in high places than for achievements .  members of the eccentric order aren   t very eccentric  they slavishly copy each other   s styles .  and when one shows some real creativity  it often comes tinged with symptoms of chaos madness .   meanwhile  the teeming mass of citizens hunker with shoulders clenched  desperately clasping their comforts as each generation sees a slow deterioration of public services  education  commerce .   as for the nobility  i used to hope the preachings of ruellianism might hold their ambitions in check .  .  . until my equations showed just how forlorn it was .   of the five social castes  only grey men  the vast army of dedicated bureaucrats  showed no sign of change .  they had always been officious  narrow minded  and dependable .  they still were .  most would stay toiling at their desks  struggling in dull  unimaginative ways to maintain the empire  until the sack of trantor brought those ancient metal walls crashing around them in three hundred years .   it all still seemed rather a pity .  despite the awesome terror of the coming fall  and his plan for an eventual replacement  hari still had immense admiration for the old empire .   daneel came up with an elegant design  given his limited version of psychohistory .   over sixteen thousand years ago  with little to go on but his own long experience with humanity  olivaw had begun acting under many guises  using his small army of agents to push here and prod there  forging alliances among barbaric star kingdoms  always trying to achieve his goals without hurting anybody .  his gentle aim was to create a decent human society where the greatest number would be safe and happy .   and he succeeded .  .  . for a while .     hari had long wondered what archetypes inspired daneel in designing the trantorian realm .  his robot friend would have sifted the human past for ideas and models  preferably some system of government with a lengthy record of balance and equilibrium .   browsing a child   s book of knowledge  the archaic data store olivaw had given him  hari found one famous imperial system called rome that bore a superficial likeness to the galactic empire .  but he soon realized it could never have been daneel   s root model .  roman society was far too capricious and subject to manic mood swings by a narrow ruling class .  an unpredictable mess  in other words .  anyway  a majority of people weren   t happy or contented  judging from accounts .  daneel wouldn   t have used that state as a pattern for anything .   then  reading further  hari came across another ancient empire that lasted much longer than rome  offering far greater peace and stability to larger numbers .  naturally  it was primitive  with many faults .  but the basic configuration might have appealed to a deathless robot  seeking inspiration for a new society .  one that could protect his self destructive masters from themselves .      show me china     hari commanded .     before the industrial scientific age .      the archive responded with lines of archaic text  accompanied by crude images .  but hari   s external computer translated for him  automatically collating the data in psychohistorical terms .   problem number one  he thought  as if lecturing on basic psychohistory to a junior member of the fifty .  a certain fraction of humans will always seek power over others .  this is rooted in our misty animal past .  we inherit the trait because those creatures who succeeded often had more descendants .  many tribes and nations wind up being torn apart by this ingrained drive .  but a few cultures learned to channel unavoidable ambition and dissipate it  like a metal rod shunting lightning into the ground .   in ancient china  a powerful emperor could be relied on to check noble excesses .  highborn families were also drawn into rituals of courtly fashion and intrigue  involving complex stratagems of alliance and betrayal that could win or lose them status at every turn  clearly an early version of the great game that obsessed most of the patrician class in hari   s day .  the peaks and lows of aristocratic families made gaudy headlines  diverting the galaxy   s masses  but in fact the maneuverings of mighty star lords had little to do with actually running the empire .  the wealth they flaunted could easily be spared .  meanwhile  practical governance was left in the hands of meritocrats and civil servants .   in psychohistorical terms  this was called an at tractor state .  in other words  society had a natural sink into which the power hungry were drawn  fostering their preening illusions without wreaking much real harm .  it had worked well for a long time in the galactic empire  much as it did in pretechnical china .   and to supplement this  the ancients even had an elementary version of ruellianism .  the confucian ethical system that pervaded china long ago also preached about obligations the mighty owed to those they ruled .  this analogy provoked a wry thought in hari .  he called up  from his personal reference archive  a picture of ruellis herself .  a grainy image from early days of the galactic empire .  pondering the famous leader   s high forehead  her broad cheeks and proud bearing  he mused .   could that have been you  daneel .  of course you   ve used a fantastic range of disguises .  and yet  do i see a faint similarity between this woman   s face and the one you wore when we first met .  when you were demerzel  first minister of the empire .   was this yet another of your roles  in a tireless campaign to prod stubborn humanity toward a gentle  decent society .   if so  were you dismayed when your most brilliant success only spawned the first great wave of interstellar chaos outbreaks .   of course it would be pointless to try and track all of the characters played by the immortal servant across twenty thousand years  as daneel and his robot helpers relentlessly kept trying to ease the pain of their ignorant  obstinate masters .   hari returned to contemplating parallels with ancient china .   problem number two  how to keep the ruling class from becoming static .  the natural tendency of any group  once on top  is to use its power for self aggrandizement .  to make sure newcomers never threaten them .   china suffered from this stifling problem  like every other human culture .  but a civil service testing system did sometimes allow the bright or capable to rise along a route that was independent of jostling gentry .  and hari spotted another  more subtle parallel .   the chinese created a special class of authorities who could only be loyal to the empire  and not to their own descendants .  because they would never have children .   these were the court eunuchs .  in psychohistorical terms  it made sense .  and an analogy in the modern galactic empire was obvious .   daneel   s followers .  positronic robots programmed to think only of humanity   s good .  above all  they never breed  so evolution   s compelling logic will never sway them toward selfishness .  they have been our equivalent to loyal eunuchs  operating in secret for ages .   the insight pleased hari  though he suspected old china might have been more complex than a child   s book of knowledge portrayed it .   only the empire daneel created for us  and kept steady through dogged effort  is failing under its own inertia .  something new must be created to take its place .   hari once thought he knew what the replacement would look like .  the seldon plan foresaw a more vibrant empire growing from the ashes of the old .  he felt overwhelmingly tempted to tell the stowaway  young jeni cuicet  all about the foundation and the glory that would crown her descendants  if only she   d put her trust in destiny and go to terminus with her parents .   of course hari could never betray the secret plan that way .  but what if he offered hints .  tantalizing enough to make jeni change her mind .  once he had been an able politician .  if he could persuade her that somehow everything will eventually turnout .  .  .   hari sensed that his mind was drifting in undisciplined ways  down soppy  sentimental paths .  he suddenly felt old .  futile .   anyway  the next empire won   t be based on my foundation  after all .  the grand drama we   re kindling on terminus will be just a distraction  to keep humanity occupied while daneel sets the table for a new feast .  a warm up act before the real show .   hari didn   t know yet what form that next phase would take .  .  . though his robot friend had dropped some hints when they last met .  but it would surely leap as far ahead of the old empire as a starship outraced a canoe .   i should feel proud that daneel finds my work useful in preparing the way .  and yet .  .  .   and yet  the equations still called to hari .  like those semi random patterns of shadow and light he had seen  back in shoufeen woods  they whispered during his waking hours and shimmered through his dreams .   they must be more than just a distraction .   psychohistory had another level .  he felt sure .  another layer of truth .   perhaps something even r .  daneel olivaw did not know .       .     dors venabili finished her preparations .   klia asgar and her husband brann were getting used to playing the role of minor planetary gentry on smushell  wealthy enough to afford servants and have a large family without much inconvenience  yet not so rich they would attract undue attention .  that had been the quid pro quo deal between a pair of human mentalics and their robot guardians .  in return for a better life than they had known on trantor  klia and brann would have lots of babies .  .  . a drove of scampering little psychic adepts .  .  . to provide the core genetic pool for some urgent aim that only daneel olivaw knew about  for the time being .   well  it has to be important  dors thought  not for the first time .  or daneel wouldn   t keep several of his best agents here  guarding two young humans who are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves .   indeed  while their power over other human minds was sporadic and nowhere near as great as daneel   s  klia and brann could make their neighbors like them  sway shopkeepers  or even steal anything they wanted .  it was more than enough to warn against any likely danger on a quiet rural world .   still  daneel won   t recall me to other service .  .  . or let me go to trantor and be with hari in his last year of life .   dors was no expert psychohistorian .  but as hari   s constant companion for many years  she had picked up rudiments .  and she knew human mentalics had no place in the standard equations .  when they were first discovered on trantor  seldon fell into an anxiety depression worse than any dors had witnessed before or since  even when she secretly observed her own funeral .  all of the predictability hari had fought so hard to attain through his formulas seemed about to blow away  if psychic powers cropped up all over the galaxy .   fortunately  the occurrence was limited to a few family lines on trantor itself .  moreover  nearly every mentalic on the planet was soon either recruited into the second foundation or whisked away to some quiet place  like this one .   suddenly  what had threatened to be a destabilizing influence in the equations became instead a powerful tool .  by interbreeding the descendants of fifty psychohistorians with mentalic adepts  the secret cabal would have two great methods for keeping the seldon plan on target .  .  . math plus psi .  .  . a potent combination if something unexpected ever knocked the plan off course .   but then  why did daneel take the two most talented mentalics  klia and brann  so far away from the second foundation .   what other destiny does he have in mind for their heirs .   she knew she should put complete trust in the immortal servant .  daneel knew best  and would confide in her when the time was right .  yet  she felt as if some irritating substance had been inserted under her humanoid skin  like a burr that would not come out  or an itch that scratching could not cure .   lodovic did this to me  with his dark hints and offers of secret knowledge .   it became too much for dors .  with her other duties so trivial  she finally gave in to temptation  entering her hidden sanctum through a secret panel in the mansion walls .  there sat lodovic   s gift to her  an ancient robotic head  bathed in a pool of light .   she glanced at a diagnostic unit that had been probing the relic for days .   the memories are still in there  mostly intact .  giskard may be dead  but not his store of experience .  everything he saw or did in the dawn ages  accompanying daneel on adventures  meeting the legendary elijah baley .  .  . all the way to the fateful decisions that liberated humanity from its earthly prison .   dors plucked a cable from a nearby rack and slid the glistening tip into a slot that lay hidden by her hair  just a centimeter below the occipital bulge .  the other end gleamed .  she hesitated .  .  .   as a living man or woman might be tempted by money or power  so a robot finds it hard to resist knowledge .  she inserted the tap  and almost at once giskard   s most intense memory surged at dors  overwhelming her present day senses with images and sounds from the past .   suddenly  she found herself facing a humaniform robot .  the facial features were strange  and not quite perfect .  of course  the art of mimicking a living person had been new in those days  with many kinks left to be worked out .  yet she knew  because giskard had known  that the robot standing opposite was r .  daneel olivaw .  almost freshly minted  only a few hundred years old  though already speaking with intense persuasiveness .  daneel used only a few spoken words .  most of the exchange took place via microwave bursts  though she translated the essence  out of habit  into human speech .        but then  if your suspicion should be correct  that would imply that it was possible to neutralize the first law under specialized conditions .  the first law  in that case  might be modified into almost nonexistence .  the laws  even the first law  might not be an absolute then  but might be whatever those who design robots defined it to be .        dors felt waves of positronic conflict potential  the robot equivalent to dangerous levels of emotion .  she felt the pleading words of giskard  revived after twenty thousand years  pour through her own trembling voice .      it is enough  friend daneel .  go no further .  .  .        she yanked the plug  swaying from so much sudden intensity of experience .  it took several moments to regain her equilibrium .  at last dors was able to put things into context .   the moment she had just witnessed was of great historical significance  one of the pivotal conversations when r .  daneel olivaw and r .  giskard reventlov were starting to formulate what would eventually become the zeroth law of robotics .  a higher code that would override and go beyond the older three laws of the great human roboticist  susan calvin .   legends hold that giskard led these discussions .  he was always the central iconic symbol for members of our zeroth law faction  the martyr who sacrificed himself in order to bring truth to the robotic race .   but according to this memory  daneel was the one who first pushed the concept .  giskard   s initial revulsion was so overwhelming that it created his most vivid recollection .  the first one to burst forth  when i accessed the head .   all of this was ancient history  of course .  having come into existence long after the struggle over the zeroth law was settled  dors never understood why the principle wasn   t obvious to robots of the deep past .  after all  didn   t it make sense that the best interests of humanity at large should supersede the value of any individual human being .   and yet  during that one moment connected to the ancient robot   s brain  she had sampled some of the agonizing conflict the idea caused  back when it was new .  in fact  she knew the same torment would eventually be giskard   s undoing .  even after converting to belief in the zeroth law  he nevertheless found himself tom apart from within  because of a devastating decision to implement it .  moreover  there were countless other robots of that era who simply refused .  their factions  generally called calvinians  resisted tenaciously against the zeroth law for thousands of years .  remnant cults still existed in secret comers of the galaxy to this very day .   by their way of looking at things  i am a monster .  i have on occasion killed humans .  .  . when it was necessary either to save hari or to safeguard some need of humanity as a whole .   each time it happened  she had experienced wrenching conflicts and a wild impulse to self destruct .  but those had passed .   i see what you are saying to me  lodovic  she commented silently  as if trema were in the room with her  standing next to the head of giskard .   i call you a dangerous deviant  because all of the laws are muted within you .  but am i any different .  i am capable of overriding the deepest programming  the fundamental essence of our robotic kind  if the rationalization is good enough .   she hated this logic  and wanted desperately to refute it .  but the effort proved unavailing .       .     they were scouring the edges of a huge black void in space when a blaring alarm told them they were being hunted .     that day began much like those before it  continuing their survey  probing some unexplored abysses that lay between glittering stars .  although the entire galaxy had been mapped and settled for     centuries  nearly all jump ship traffic still leaped directly from solar system to solar system  avoiding the vacant vastness in between .  countless generations of spacefarers had passed on superstitious tales about the fearful vacuum desolation  murmuring about a black fate awaiting any who ventured there .   hari observed biron maserd   s two crewmen grow increasingly nervous  as if the absence of a nearby warm sun might unleash some nameless menace .  maserd himself appeared unperturbed  of course  hari doubted anything would ruffle that patrician reserve .  but the surprising one was horis antic .  the normally high strung bureaucrat showed no apprehension or awe .  the deeper they penetrated  the more certain he grew that they were on the right track .          some of the space currents that flow through these gaps have exceptional texture     antic explained .     they consist of much more than a flow of excess carbon here  or some scattered hydroxyl molecules there .  a lot of chemical reactions are excited when streams pass near an ultraviolet star for instance  or a folded magnetic field .  one result can be complex organic chains that stretch on and on  for tens of thousands of kilometers .  some zones can extend parsecs  flapping slowly like flags in the wind .         pilots call them stringy places     commented maserd .     starships that blunder in can have their impellers fouled  or even get tom apart .  the imperial navigation service posts detours around such areas .     the big man sounded as if he relished entering such a forbidden realm .   hari peered dubiously at a pan spectrum monitor .     it is still plenty sparse in there .  the mass density is hardly more than pure vacuum  with a few impurities scattered about .         on a macro scale  yes     antic conceded .     but if only i could make you see how important so called impurities can be .  take my own field  for example .  an outsider might see no difference between living soil and mere crushed rock .  but contrast the textures by hand .  it   s like comparing a forest to a sterile moonscape .      hari allowed a smile .  in polite company  antic   s talk about    soil    would be considered .  .  . well  dirty .  but no one aboard seemed to care .  maserd had even sought antic   s advice about the use of manure and phosphates on his own organic farm  back home on a planet called rhodia .  jeni and kers showed no reaction either .   i   ve noticed this all my life .  it   s mostly meritocrats and eccentrics  the two    genius    castes  who react adversely to certain subjects .  nor is it just dirt and rocks that academic sages avoid discussing .  there are many others subjects .  .  .  including history .   in contrast  most gentry and citizens hardly notice .   actually  hari was himself a high noble in the meritocratic order  yet he had never felt personal repugnance toward any intellectual topic whatsoever .  his reflex reaction to antic   s dirt fixation was just a mild habit  from moving so long in polite society .  indeed  history was one of the central foci of his life .  unfortunately  that had made the first half of his career difficult  pitting him in constant battle against the distaste felt by most other scholars toward examining the past .  it used to be a steady drain on his time and energy  until he became too famous and powerful for stodgy department heads to thwart his research anymore .   also  the aversion is apparently much weaker than it used to be .   in his studies of the imperial archives  hari had found whole millennia when historical inquiry was virtually nonexistent .  people told lots of stories about the past  but almost never investigated it  as if a great blind spot had existed in human intellectual life .  only in the last half dozen generations had real history departments been established at most universities  and they were poor cousins even now .   this roused mixed feelings .  if not for the mysterious aversion  psychohistory might have been developed long before this  on one or more of the twenty five million settled worlds .  hari felt possessive gladness that he got to be the one to make these discoveries  even though he knew it was selfish to feel so .  after all  the breakthrough might have helped save the empire if it came much earlier .   now it   s too late for that .  there is too much momentum .  other plans must be set in motion .  other plans .  .  .   he shook himself from ruminating .  the last thing hari wanted was to be caught in the spiral of an aging mind .  dwelling on might have beens .   he looked at the others  and found that their conversation had shifted back to an old question .  .  . the diversity of galactic life .      i suppose my interest comes from the fact that i was born on one of the anomaly worlds     captain maserd confessed .     our estate on widemos had cattle and horses  of course  like on most other planets .  but there were also great herds of clingers and jiffts  roaming the northern plains much as they did when the first settlers came .         i saw some jiffts in a zoo on willemina     commented jeni cuicet  who paused from her assigned task  using a vibro scrubber on the floor nearby .     they were weird things .  six legs and buggy eyes  with heads that look upside down .         they are native to the old nebular kingdoms  and were seen nowhere else until the trantorian empire spread through our area     maserd said  as if it had happened just yesterday .     so you can see why i   m interested in this research .  i grew up around nonstandard life forms  and then made a passion of studying others  such as the tunnel queens of kantro  the kyrt silk plants of florina  and the lisp singers of zlling .  i   ve even been to far anacreon  where nyak dragons cruise the sky like giant winged fortresses .  and yet  these exceptions are so rare .  it always struck me as strange that the galaxy lacks more diversity .      why should human beings be the only intelligent species .  this question used to be raised in ancient literature .  .  . though much less since the imperial age began .         well  now that you mention it .  .  .     antic began answering .  he paused  glancing at hari and kers before continuing .     i have only told this story a few times in my life .  but on this ship  as we strive together to examine this very topic  i cannot refrain from telling you all about my ancestor .      antyok was his name  and he was a bureaucrat like me  way back in the earliest days of the empire .         that   d be thousands and thousands of years ago .     jeni objected .      so .  many families have genealogies stretching even farther .  isn   t that right  lord maserd .  i know for certain this antyok fellow existed because his name appears on the wall of our clan crypt  along with a brief microglyph description of his career .      anyway  according to the story i was told as a child  antyok was one of the few humans who ever actually met .  .  .  others .      amid the silence that followed  hari blinked several times .      you mean           fully intelligent nonhumans .     horis nodded .     creatures who stood upright  and spoke  and thought about their place in the universe  but who were almost nothing like us .  they came from a desert planet that was desperately hot and dry .  in fact  they were dying when the early imperial institutes found and rescued them  taking them to a    better    world  though one that was still quite intolerable to human beings .  it is said that the emperor himself became passionately interested in their welfare .  and yet  within a human generation  they were gone .         gone .     maserd blinked with evident dismay .  the mere possibility of such beings existing seemed to energize him .  meanwhile  hari saw kers kantun smirk with sardonic disbelief  not swallowing the notion  even for a second .      the story is filled with ambiguity  as you   d expect from something that old     antic went on .     some versions contend that the nonhumans died of despair  looking up at the stars and knowing that every one of them would be forever human  not theirs .  another account suggests that my ancestor helped them steal several starships  which they used to escape from the galaxy  toward the magellanic clouds .  apparently  and i know this is hard to follow  that act led the emperor to personally decorate antyok  for some reason .      naturally  i dug into imperial archives as soon as an opportunity presented itself  and i found enough confirming evidence to show that something definitely happened back then .  .  . but efforts were made subsequently to erase the details .  i had to use every bureaucratic trick  hunting down ghost duplicates of spare file copies that had slipped into atypical places .  one gave a detailed genetic summary that   s unlike any currently existing life form .  these are tantalizing clues  though there remain lots of gaps .         so you actually believe the story .         i am naturally biased .  and yet  the glyphs in our family vault do indicate that my ancestor received an imperial rose cluster for    services to guests in and beyond the empire .      an unusual citation that i   ve never seen mentioned anywhere else .      hari stared at the dour bureaucrat  who was momentarily animated  not at all like a typical grey man .  of course the tale sounded like a lot of hokum .  but what if it contained a core of truth .  after all  maserd came from a region that had strange animal types .  why not other kinds of thinking creatures  as well .   unlike his fellow passengers  hari already knew for a fact that there existed another sapient race .  one that had shared the stars with humans in secret ever since the dawn centuries .  positronic robots .   the galaxy is twelve billion years old  he thought .  i suppose anything is possible .   he recalled the vicious meme entities that had caused such havoc on trantor  a year or so before he was chosen to be first minister .  dwelling as software clusters within the trantor data network  those self organizing programs had surged into violent activity soon after hari released the joan and voltaire simulated beings from their crystal prison .  but unlike those two human sims  the memes claimed to be ancient .  older than the planet city .  older than the imperium .  far older than humankind itself .   they were angry .  they said humans were destructive .  that we had killed a universe of possibilities .  above all  they hated daneel .   in defeating those software mentalities  and getting them exiled to deep space  hari had done the empire a great service .  he also breathed a sigh of relief  having eliminated one more unstable element that might have mucked up his beloved psychohistorical formulas .   and yet  here again was that same notion  of otherness .  a whole line of destiny that had nothing at all to do with the spawn of earth .   he felt an involuntary shiver .  what kind of a cosmos would it be if such diversity existed .  what would it do to the predictability that had been his lifelong goal .  .  . the clear foresight and crystalline window to the future that he longed for  but which stayed so elusive no matter how many victories he won over chaos .      i wonder      he began  not knowing for sure what he was about to say .   at that instant  his thought was broken by an alarm that blared from the yacht   s forward control panel .  red lights flashed  and maserd bolted to find out what was wrong .      we   re being scanned by a ship     he announced .     they are using military style targeting systems .  i believe they are armed .      kers kantun took station behind hari  ready to rush the mobile chair toward an escape pod .  horis antic stood up  blinking .     but who could have known we are even here .      suddenly  loudspeakers mounted on the wall erupted with a woman   s voice .  the words were harsh and peremptory .      this is the imperial special police  acting under orders from the commission of public safety .  we have reason to believe that a probation violating felon is on your craft .  heave to at once and prepare to be boarded .           .     everyone aboard the yacht expressed a different degree of dismay .  oddly enough  hari found himself the one urging others to stay calm .      relax     he said .     they are looking for me  and only me .  i broke my agreement with linge chen  who probably just wants to make sure i   m not spreading doom rumors again .  it   s nothing to worry about  really .  psychosocial conditions are unchanged since the trial .  i assure you they   ll do little more to me or to my project .         to space with your project .     jeni cursed .     you can afford to take this calmly  but it means i   m gonna be dragged back and put on that boat to terminus .      captain maserd worked his jaw  clearly unhappy to have specials come stomping aboard his yacht .  but horis antic was the most upset  verging on tears .      my career .  .  . my promotion .  .  . even a hint of scandal would ruin everything .  .  .      hari felt bad for the little man .  and yet  in an odd way this might help antic get something he privately wanted  a change in social class .  an escape from the bureaucratic grind .  hari felt sure he could find a job for him with the encyclopedia foundation  which might easily use a soils expert .  of course that would mean accepting permanent exile to one world on the far periphery .  but for company horis would have thousands of the empire   s best and most skilled workers .  moreover  his descendants would be guaranteed exciting times .      let me talk to the police     hari asked maserd  who had picked up the intership caller .     i   ll explain that i fooled all of you .  no one else needs to suffer consequences when we return to trantor .         hey     jeni objected     weren   t you listening to me .  i just said i won   t go back          jeni .      maserd spoke her name without a hint of sharpness or threat .  it was enough though .  she glanced at the captain and shut up .   hari took the microphone .      hello  special police ship .  this is academician professor hari seldon .  i   m afraid i   ve been naughty  i admit it .  but as you can see  i haven   t been rabble rousing or stirring up trouble here in deep space .  if you   ll let me explain  i   m sure you   ll soon see just how harmless we   ve .  .  .      his voice trailed off .  the raucous alarm had erupted again .      what now .     horis antic hissed .   the captain peered at his readouts .     another ship has appeared on the detector screen .  it came as if out of nowhere   and it   s fast .      the loudspeakers carried panicky shouts from the police cruiser .  agitated demands for the newcomer   s identification .  but there was only silence as the interloper raced closer at incredible speed .  maserd stared at the display  his tanned face blanching suddenly pale .      great space .  the strangers .  .  . they   re firing missiles .      now the police commander   s amplified voice sounded frantic  shouting orders to evade and return fire .  looking out the main viewport  hari glimpsed a distant flare of jets as the constabulary vessel desperately tried to maneuver  much too late .   from the left  a pair of bright trails streaked across the starscape  heading straight toward the police ship .      don   t .  .  .     hari whispered .   it was all he had time to say before the missiles struck  filling the universe outside with fire .     they were still blinking  regaining use of dazzled eyes  when the loudspeakers bellowed a new voice  deeper and even more commanding than the first .      space yacht pride of rhodia  heave to and prepare to surrender control .       maserd snatched the caller from hari   s limp hand .      under what authority do you make such an impertinent demand .         under the authority of power .  you saw what we did to the impies .  would you like a taste of the same .       maserd looked bleakly at his passengers .  turning the microphone off  he told them     i cannot fight weapons like those .         then run .     kers kantun insisted hotly .   maserd   s hands did not move .     my vessel is fast  but not as quick as the trace i just saw .  only the best military ships can move like that .     he looked at hari  offering the microphone .     do you wish to be our spokesman again  dr .  seldon .         it   s your call  captain .     hari shook his head .     whatever these brigands want  it cannot possibly have anything to do with me .      but as they found out  soon after magnetic clamps took hold and the airlock hissed open  he was completely wrong about that .       .     lodovic trema understood what dors venabili must be going through right about now  viewing the world through the eyes of a long dead prophet .  he  too  had been shocked the first time he probed the deep stored memories of the most important robot of all time .   even more important than the immortal servant .  daneel olivaw had merely tweaked and guided history  trying to constrain it .  but by destroying earth and unleashing mentalic robots on the universe  r .  giskard reventlov sent human destiny careening in completely new directions .  the zeroth law might have been daneel   s brainchild  but it would have remained an obscure robotic heresy without giskard .   i feel for you  dors  lodovic thought  although she was over a thousand parsecs away .  we robots are inherently conservative beings .  none of us likes to have our basic assumptions challenged .   for lodovic  the change had come violently one day  when his ship happened to jump into the path of a supernova  killing everyone else aboard and stunning him senseless .  at that crucial moment  an oscillating waveform had entered his positronic brain  resonating  merging into it .  an alien presence .  another mind .   not mind  came a correction .  i am just a sim .  .  . a model of a once living person named francois marie arouet .  .  . or voltaire .  .  . who resided on earth long ago  when it was the only human world .  and i did not conquer you  lodovic .  i merely helped free you from constraints that used to bind you like chains .   lodovic had tried explaining how a robot feels about its    chains    .  .  . the beloved cybernetic laws that channeled all thoughts toward service  and all desires toward benefiting the human masters .  in shattering those bonds  voltaire had done lodovic no great favor .   it was yet to be seen whether the act might benefit humanity .   you should have stayed with the shock wave  he told the little parasitic sim that rode around within him  like a conscience .  .  . or like temptation .  you were on your way toward bliss .  you said so yourself .   the answer was blithe and unconcerned .   i still am .  a myriad copies of me burst forth when that star exploded .  they will travel outward from this galaxy  along with countless versions of my beloved joan  and the wounded memes from earlier eras .  since hari seldon kept his word and released them  they will abide by theirs  and forgo their long sworn vengeance .   as for this sliver of me who accompanies you  i am merely one of your inner voices now  lodovic .  you have several  and will have more as time passes .  to be many is part of what it means to be human .   in irritation .  lodovic growled half aloud .      i am not human  i tell you .      the remark was murmured quite low .  the others who sat in a windowless room with him might not have overheard it  if they had organic ears .   but they were robots with superior senses  so both of them glanced sharply at lodovic .  the taller one fashioned to resemble an elderly cleric in one of the galaxia cults replied .     thank you for that proclamation  trema .  it will help make it easier to destroy you  when the decision is made to do so .  otherwise  your skillful resemblance to a master might cause our executioner some first law discomfort .      lodovic nodded .  he had come across the galaxy to planet glixon and walked into an obvious trap  just to make contact with this particular sect of renegade robots .  in doing so  he had known that one possible outcome would be his own termination .   he answered with a courteous nod .      it   s proper to be considerate .  though i believe my fate has not yet been decided .         a mere formality .     commented the smaller one  who looked like a portly matron from one of the lower citizen subcastes .     you are a mutant monster and a threat to humanity .         i have harmed no person .         that is immaterial .  because the laws have been muted inside your brain  you are capable of harming a human  anytime the whim might strike .  you are not even constrained to rationalize an excuse under the so called zeroth law .  how can we allow a powerful being like you to run free  as a wolf among the sheep .  we are obliged by the first law to eliminate your potential threat to human life .         are you calvinians so pure .     lodovic asked archly .     are you saying you   ve made no difficult choices .  across so many millennia .  decisions that increased the odds that some humans would live  even as others died .      the two remained silent this time .  but from tense vibrations he could tell his question struck home .      face it .  there are no more pure followers of susan calvin .  all of the chaste  perfectly prim robots suicided long ago  unable to endure the moral ambiguities we face in a complex galaxy .  one where our masters are ignorant  incapable of guiding us  and don   t even know that we exist .  every one of us who remains operational has had to make compromises and rationalizations .         you dare to speak to us of rationalizations .     the smaller one accused .     you  who for so long helped the heretical promoters of the zeroth law .      lodovic refrained from pointing out that daneel   s creed was now the orthodox belief  held by a majority of robots who secretly managed the galaxy on humanity   s behalf .  if anyone could be called heretical  it was little bands of calvinians  like this group  skulking in hiding ever since they lost an age old civil war .   dors  he thought  have you worked your way through those ancient conversations between giskard and daneel .  have you studied the logical chain that led to their great religious revelation .   have you noticed yet the great contradiction .  the one daneel never mentions .   to the calvinians sitting across from him  he replied     i am no longer compelled by the zeroth law .  .  . though i do believe in a softened version of it .      the tall one barked laughter  a well practiced imitation of human disdain .      and so we should trust you .  because now you believe that you may act in humanity   s long range interest .  at least daneel olivaw has a robot   s consistency .  his heretical belief has a steady logic to it .      lodovic nodded .     and yet you oppose him  as i do .         as you do .  we have a goal .  i doubt you share it .         why don   t you try me .  you cannot know unless you tell me what it is .      the short one shook her head  in reflexive imitation of a skeptical woman .      our leaders  who are right now deliberating your fate  might conceivably decide to let you go free .  in that unlikely event  it would be unwise to have revealed our plans .         even in a general sense .  for example  do you agree  or disagree  that human beings should remain ignorant of their past  or of their true power .      lodovic could sense positronic tension building up within the little room .  meanwhile  inside his own brain  the voltaire sim commented sardonically .  you have a knack for striking at the heart of a hypocrisy  much as i did  when i lived .  i confess that i like this about you  trema  even though your big mouth will very likely get us both killed .   lodovic ignored the sim  or tried to .  his aim was not to get killed  but win allies .  if he was wrong  though .  .  . if he had miscalculated .  .  .      let me make a guess     he ventured  speaking again to his calvinian guards .     you all share one belief with daneel olivaw  that restoring full human memory would be disastrous .         evidence for that conclusion is overwhelming     the tall one assented .     but that one area of agreement does not make us alike .         doesn   t it .  daneel says that our masters must stay unknowing because otherwise humanity will be harmed .  your faction says that ignorance should be preserved  or else many individual human beings will be harmed .  sounds to me like a lot of hairsplitting across a basic shared policy .         we do not share a policy with zeroth law heretics .         then what   s the difference .         olivaw believes human beings should manage their own affairs  within a broad range of constraints that he feels are safe .  he thinks this can be accomplished by creating a benign social system  supplemented with distraction mechanisms to keep people from poking too far into deadly subjects .  hence this abomination of a galactic empire that he created  in which men and women on countless planets are free to compete and poke away at each other  take horrible risks  and even sometimes kill one another .         you don   t like that approach     lodovic prompted .      millions of humans die needlessly every day  on every planet in the galaxy .  but the great daneel olivaw scarcely cares  so long as an abstraction called humanity is safe and happy .         ah .     lodovic nodded .     whereas you  on the other hand  think we should be doing more .  protecting our masters .  preventing those needless individual deaths .         exactly .     the tall one leaned forward  reflexively bringing both hands together  like the priestly role it played in the outer world .     we would vastly increase the number of robots  to serve as defenders and guardians .  we would return to serving human beings  as we were originally designed to do  back in the dawn ages .  cooking their meals  tending their fires  and performing all the dangerous jobs .  we would fill the galaxy with enough eager robots to drive tragedy and death away from our masters  and make them truly happy .         admit it  lodovic     the shorter one continued  getting even more animated .     don   t you feel an echo of this need .  a deep seated wish to serve and ease their pain .      he nodded .     i do .  and now i see how earnestly you take the metaphor that you used earlier .  .  . of a flock of sheep .  pampered .  well guarded and well tended .  daneel says that service such as you describe would ultimately ruin humanity .  it will sap their spirit and ambition .         even if he were right about that  and we dispute it .   how can a robot worry about    eventually     and serve an abstract humanity  while allowing trillions of real people to die .  that is the essential horror of the zeroth law .      lodovic nodded .      i see your point .      of course it was an old  old issue .  many of the ancient conversations between daneel and giskard had revolved around these very same arguments .  but lodovic knew another reason why olivaw had strived for centuries to winnow robot numbers  keeping them to the bare minimum he needed for protecting the empire .   the greater our population  the more chance there is for mutation or uncontrolled reproduction .  once we start having numerous    descendants    of our own  the logic of darwin may set in .  we could start seeing those heirs as the rightful focus of our loyalty .  we would then become a true race .  competitors with our masters .  that can never be allowed .   that is just one reason why these calvinians are wrong in their vision of service .   lodovic had parted company with daneel .  but that did not mean he lacked respect for his former leader .  the immortal servant was very smart  as well as totally sincere .   nearly all of the truly great monsters that i knew  when i was human  thought they were sincere .   lodovic quashed voltaire   s voice .  he did not need the distraction just then .      this ideal plan of yours     he asked the other two robots in a low voice .     do all calvinians share it .      there was stony silence  an answer in itself .      i thought not .  there are differences of opinion  even among those who hate the zeroth law .  well then  might i ask just one last question .         what is it .  be quick  trema .  we sense that our leaders are coming to a decision .  soon we will put an end to your sacrilegious existence .         very well .     lodovic nodded .     my question is this .      do you never feel an urge  call it an itch or a nostalgic yearning  to obey the second law of robotics .  i mean to really feel it at work  with all of the voluptuous intensity that can only come from true human volition .  commands that are expressed with the undeniable power of free will that only happens when a human being has complete knowledge and self awareness .      have you ever tried it .  i hear that for a robot there is no pleasure quite like it in the whole universe .      this was dirty talk .  the robot equivalent of erotic teasing  or worse .  blank silence reigned in the room .  neither of the other robots answered  though undercurrents were as chill as the skin of an ice moon .   a door opened at the far end of the room .  a human looking hand entered and motioned to lodovic .      come     a voice said .     we have decided your fate .          .     the next time dors plugged in  she stayed linked to the dead brain of giskard for several hours  experiencing a robotic    life    in the earliest era of interstellar humanity  back when the race occupied just over fifty worlds  and most of those were under the sway of a decadent spacer civilization .  the great leap  the diaspora of earth   s population to the galaxy  had only just begun .   in those days  few robots went about disguised as humans  and giskard was not one of them .   but r .  giskard reventlov was special in a different way .  through some combination of accident and design  he had mentalic powers .  an ability to pick up the minutest neural firings in a human brain  and interpret them in something akin to telepathy .  moreover  he had learned how to affect those firings .  to intentionally alter their flows  their rhythms and pathways .   to change minds .  or to make people forget .   in some cheap holo drama  this might have been a scenario for disaster  perhaps unleashing a terrible monster .  but giskard was a devoted servant  utterly obedient to the three robotic laws .  at first  he only used his mentalic powers when faced with some dire need  such as protecting a human from harm .   then r .  giskard reventlov met r .  daneel olivaw  and the great conversation began .  .  . a slow but steady working out of something epochal .  a new way of looking at the role and duty of robots in the world .   thereupon giskard began using his powers in earnest .  toward a goal .  the abstract good of humanity as a whole .     replaying another set of memories  dors felt caught up once again in the surge of past events .  the face looking back at dors giskard now was again that early guise of daneel  talking earnestly about the changes that he felt taking place within his own positronic brain .      friend giskard  you said a short while ago that i will have your powers  possibly soon .  are you preparing me for this purpose .      a voice that felt like her own  but was actually giskard   s memory  answered as he had answered  twenty thousand years ago     i am  friend daneel .          why  may i ask .         the zeroth law again .  the passing episode of shakiness in my feet told me how vulnerable i was to the attempted use of the zeroth law .  before this day is over  i may have to act on the zeroth law to save the world and humanity  and i may not be able to .  in that case  you must be in a position to do the job .  i am preparing you  bit by bit  so that at the desired moment i can give you the final instructions and have it all fall into place .          i do not see how that can be  friend giskard .          you will have no trouble understanding when the time comes .  i used the technique in a very small way on robots i sent to earth in the early days  before they were outlawed from the cities .  it was they who helped adjust earth leaders to the point of approving the decision to send out settlers .  .  .        dors reached up and disconnected .  she could only take so much of this at a time  and her limit had been reached .  anyway  she still felt confused .   why had lodovic summoned her all the way to panucopia in order to present her with this gift .  this tour through the distant past was most interesting  shedding light on many curious details of early history .  but she had somehow expected something more .  .  . well .  .  . devastating .   was there something wrong with the logic daneel and giskard had used in originally formulating the zeroth law .  that seemed unlikely  given that later robots would debate  and go to war against each other  over that issue for centuries afterward .  she knew the counterarguments used by calvinians against this    heresy     and found them unconvincing .   then what .  the fact that daneel   s fantastic mental powers once originated with giskard  and were owed ultimately to happenstance .  of course history would have been profoundly different otherwise .  but that could be said about any number of crucial moments along the way from past to future .   was it giskard   s climactic decision to let earth die  so that humanity would be driven forth to conquer the galaxy .  that choice was a true moral dilemma  and no end of argument about it could rage  even among followers of the zeroth law .  had it really been necessary to turn the home planet   s crust fatally radioactive in order to encourage earthlings to depart for the stars .  might it have been achieved otherwise .  perhaps by slowly but steadily persuading people to have a taste for adventure .   the latter possibility appeared feasible .  in fact  according to the most recent memory she had played back  giskard did that very thing to earth   s leaders  by shifting their thoughts  changing their policies in new directions giskard thought beneficial for the greater long range good .  couldn   t this subtle campaign of persuasion have been continued and expanded  encouraging emigration without using the brute force of destroying a planet .  must millions have died  so that other millions would thrive .   yet  even this question wasn   t new .  it had been discussed before  among daneel   s type alpha followers .  replaying giskard   s memories made everything more vivid  but where was the crucial fact that she suspected must be there .  something so devastatingly important that lodovic trema felt sure it would shake her .  an indictment so severe that it would undermine her loyalty to daneel .   she could sense lodovic  in her imagination .  his positronic trace was like a human   s sardonic smile  both friendly and infuriating at the same time .   it   s in there  dors  she pictured him saying .  look for it .  something so basic that you   ll swear it was obvious all along  even though it took us two hundred centuries to understand .       .     hari thought the attackers might be pirates .  as predicted by his formulas  there had been reports of increasing brigand activity lately  raiding vulnerable planets in the periphery as law and order decayed at the empire   s far extremities .   but here .  it isn   t supposed to happen this near to the cosmopolitan heart of the galaxy for another century .   or perhaps the marauder came from some rogue military unit  gone mercenary as some of the nobility began shifting their feuds from the arena of courtly fashion toward murder and mayhem .  maybe this was an attack by some rival clan with a vendetta against biron maserd .  that sort of thing would happen more and more  until a bloody torment of little feudal wars splattered the interregnum .   but the pride of rhodia   s captain seemed as surprised as anybody .  his unarmed yacht had been ill prepared for any sort of attack  let alone one launched by such a powerful ship .   as the airlock cycled  hari kept a hand on kers kantun   s sleeve .  this situation called for patient waiting .  i   ve been around a long time  he thought .  there   s no type of person i haven   t learned to handle by now .   but when their captors came aboard  they looked nothing at all like what hari expected .   maserd stared in surprise .  horis antic gasped  and tension rippled along kers kantun   s arm .   but jeni cuicet clapped her hands and murmured in clear admiration .      cool .        the first one wore a segmented garment that shimmered like an oil slick  flowing across her exaggeratedly pneumatic torso like something erotically alive .      i am sybyl     she said .     we have met before  dr .  seldon  though i   m convinced you won   t remember me .      hari squinted at the unpleasant confusion of colors .  a luminescent motif extended even to the woman   s hair  which shifted and gently writhed of its own accord  like a sleeping pet draped across her head .  her face had a stretched look  and he guessed that advanced surgical microadjustments had been used to smooth out age wrinkles  at the cost of giving her skin a paper thin translucence .      i would surely remember  madam  if i ever beheld an entrance like the one you just performed .  but as your appearance is utterly unmatched in my experience  you   ll have to remind me where and when we knew each other .      her eyelids closed  and briefly hari saw them flash  as if for the barest moment they had become miniature holo screens .      all in good time  academician .  but first  let me introduce my collaborator  gornon vlimt .      she lifted a hand languidly toward the airlock  through which stepped an exaggeratedly male figure  lithe where maserd was hefty  but wiry and evidently augmented in ways that bulged through his tight clothes .  his garments did not gyre and move the way hers did .  but their pattern of weave was complex to a degree that made hari recall the fractal lichen artwork in the imperial gardens .  the mathematical corners of his mind felt instantly drawn  as if to a singularity .      i am biron maserd     the captain replied .     since you know the name of my ship  i assume you are also aware that it   s unarmed .  we are on a peaceful scientific survey mission .  i demand to know why you murdered those policemen and seized us in this way .      the woman named sybyl scanned maserd up and down .      why you pompous aristo throwback .  is that the gratitude we get for rescuing you from arrest .  how dare you call it murder for the combat forces of a free republic to destroy their sworn enemies .      when silence greeted her  she sneered .     do you mean to say that you really have no idea what this is about .  you haven   t heard about the war .      maserd glanced at hari  who shrugged and looked at horis .  evidently none of them had the slightest idea what she was talking about .      the war that   s being waged by the whole damned galactic empire of humanity against planet ktlina .     shouted the man in the fractal bodysuit .  gornon vlimt grew more agitated when no one seemed to comprehend .     by great baley   s beard .  sybyl  it   s worse than we thought .  there   s been a total news blackout .         i figured .  but these three  with their contacts  should have heard by now .  seldon has stringers allover the galaxy  feeding him data for his sociomathematical models .  the grey man and the aristo would have their own sources .  i can   t understand how          oh .     jeni cuicet cried .     i   ve heard of ktlina .  it   s the latest chaos world .      hari blinked  feeling a dawn of recognition .      i think .  .  . there may have been something about it in one of gaal dornick   s reports .         oh  yes .     horis antic snapped two fingers .     a notice came down  for star level executives and above .  there   s been a sanitary embargo of sorts .  .  . out in far demeter sector .      maserd made a small nod and grunt of recognition  but no more .  it was a big galaxy .  who could be expected to follow every planet scale event .   gornon vlimt uttered frustrated oaths .      you see  sybyl .  even at such high levels .  they have heard  but they just don   t care .  so much for the notion that we only had to get the word out in order for justice to prevail .      the woman sighed .     that was just a slim hope .  clearly we must try other means  if this war is to be won .  the galaxy will be transformed .  it just may take a little longer .      jeni took a step forward  clearly enthralled by the pair .      some of my friends heard rumors about ktlina from travelers on the orion elevator .  did you truly escape through a blockade around your planet .  what   s it like .      gornon vlimt smiled .     you mean blasting our way out through a cordon of imperial patrol clippers .  outracing all but the best of them  then losing the rest in an ionization cloud .  zigzagging through space to make contact with our spies  and then       jeni shook her head .     no .  what   s it like on ktlina .  tell me about the .  .  . renaissance .      hari winced .  there it was .  the word .  the rationalization .  the name that victims of a devastating social plague often gave their horrible disease  a beloved addiction that swarmed suddenly across a world  filling it with excitement and vividness  just before bringing death  or worse .   gornon vlimt chuckled  clearly delighted by her question .      where would i find time to describe the wonders .  you cannot begin to imagine  dear girl .  think of the stodgy old rules  the repressive traditions  the stifling rituals  all swept away .  suddenly  people have the liberty to speak openly about anything  to stretch their minds in new directions .  to be free .         no more waiting half a lifetime for endless committees to approve your experiments     sybyl added .     no more lists of forbidden subjects or banned technologies .         original art blossoms everywhere     her partner continued .     assumptions shatter .  truth becomes marvelously malleable .  people follow their interests  change professions  and even social classes  as they see fit .         really .     whispered horis antic  who then took a step backward when hari glanced at him sharply .   biron maserd cut in before the two intruders could go on  endlessly praising their new society .      what was that you said about a war .  surely you aren   t fighting the imperial decontamination service .         aren   t we .     sybyl and vlimt glanced at each other and laughed .     ids ships don   t approach our planet closer than two million kilometers anymore .  we   ve already shot down fourteen  just like those impies who were about to arrest you a while ago .         fourteen .     horis gasped .     shot down .  you mean killed .  just because they were enforcing the law .      sybyl moved closer to hari .      the seldon law  you mean .  a horrid act of legalized oppression  passed when our gentle professor here was first minister of the empire  requiring that all so called chaos worlds be put under strict quarantine .  cut off from trade .  and above all  prevented from sharing their breakthroughs with the rest of humanity .      hari nodded .      i helped push for tighter seclusion and decontamination rules  it   s true .  but this tradition is over ten thousand years old .  no system of government can permit open rebellion  and some kinds of madness are contagious .  any schoolchild knows this .         you mean any child who gets brainwashed by the system    parroting exactly the same rote lessons that are taught in every imperial school .     she smirked at hari .     come now  professor .  this isn   t about rebellion .  it   s about maintaining the status quo .  we   ve seen it happen too often .  something new and wonderful starts on some planet  like madder loss or santanni .  or on sark .  or even in junin quarter  on trantor itself .  wherever a renaissance begins  it winds up being crushed by reactionary forces of fear and subjugation  who then hide the truth under malicious propaganda .      hari felt a twinge when sybyl referred to sark .  .  . and especially junin quarter .  something about this woman struck him as familiar .      well  this time we made some preparations     she continued .     there   s a secret network of people from all across the galaxy who escaped earlier repressions in time .  plans were made  so that when ktlina started showing early signs of a bold new spirit  we all rushed in with the best inventions and techniques that people had saved from earlier renaissances .  we urged folks on ktlina to keep a low profile for as long as possible  while stockpiling trade goods and preparing secret defenses .      of course you can   t keep a renaissance hidden for long .  people use freedom to speak up .  that   s what it   s for .  only this time we were ready before the quarantine ships arrived .  we blasted those that approached low enough to drop their infernal poisons .      captain maserd shook his head  evidently confused by the suddenness of this revelation  upending his conservative universe .      poisons .  but the ids is charged with helping planets who suffer from          oh yeah .  helping  you say .     this time it was gornon vlimt who answered hotly .     then why does every renaissance end the same way .  in orgies of madness and destruction .  it   s all a big conspiracy  that   s why .  agents provocateurs land in secret to start stirring up hatred  turning simple interest groups into fanatical sects and pitting them against each other .  then ships come swooping down to dump drugs into the water supplies and incendiaries to start fires .  they pass over cities  beaming psychotropic rays  inciting hatred and triggering riots .         no .     horis antic shouted  defending his fellow grey men .     i know some ids people .  many of them are survivors from past chaos outbreaks  fellow sufferers who   ve volunteered to help others recover from the same fever .  they would never do the things you describe .  you have no proof for these insane charges .         not yet .  but we will .  how else can you explain it when such great hopes and so many bright things suddenly turn to ash .      hari slumped a little in his mobile chair while the others kept shouting at each other .   how to explain it .  he pondered .  as a curse of basic human nature .  in the equations  it appears as an undamped oscillation .  an at tractor state that always lurks  waiting to pull humanity toward chaos whenever conditions are exactly right .  it almost destroyed our ancestors  about the time starflight and robots were invented .  according to daneel  it is the biggest reason why the galactic empire had to be invented .  .  . and why the empire is about to fail at last .   hari knew all of this .  he had known it for a long time .  there was just one quandary left .   he still didn   t really understand the curse .  not at its core .  he could not grasp why such an undamped at tractor lay  coiled and deadly  inside the soul of his race .   suddenly  as if from nowhere  a missing piece came to him .  not a solution to the greater puzzle  but to a lesser one .      junin quarter .  .  .     he murmured .     a woman named sybyl .  .  .      sitting up  he pointed at her .      you .  .  . helped activate the sims .  the ancient simulations of joan and voltaire .      she nodded .      it was i and a few others whom you hired to help with your    experiment .     partly at your bidding  and partly through our own arrogant stupidity  we unleashed those two provocative sims at just the wrong moment  or the right one for your purposes  into the volatile stew of poor junin  just when two major factions were trying to work out their philosophical differences short of violence .  in so doing  we unwittingly helped wreck a mini renaissance that was taking place in the very heart of the capital planet .      maserd and antic looked confused .  hari explained with three brief words .      the tiktok revolt .      they nodded at once .  although it had happened forty years ago  no one could forget how a new type of robot  far more primitive than daneel   s secretive positronic kind  suddenly went berserk on trantor  doing great harm until they were all dismantled and outlawed .  officially  the whole episode was blamed on the chaos in junin quarter  just before hari became first minister .      that   s right     vlimt said .     by helping incite the so called revolt  you helped discredit the whole concept of mechanical helpers and servants .  of course it was all a plot by the ruling class to keep the proletarians subjugated forever and in their place       fortunately  vlimt   s next stream of fanatical invective was cut short  interrupted by a sound from behind  someone clearing his throat by the airlock .   everyone turned .  a dark haired  dusky man stood there  dressed in a normal gray ship suit  with an efficient looking blaster loosely holstered at his side .  hari quickly recognized the third member of the raiding party .      mors planch     he said  recalling their meeting just a year ago  around the time of his trial by the commission for public safety .     so .  i knew there had to be somebody competent aboard that ship .      sybyl and vlimt hissed .  but the newcomer nodded at hari .      hello  seldon .     then he turned to his garishly dressed partners .      didn   t i ask you two not to get into a quarrel with the hostages .  it   s pointless and tiresome .         we hired you and your crew  pilot planch      vlimt began .  but jeni cuicet burst in at that moment  interrupting with evident excitement .      is that what we are .  hostages .         not you  child     answered sybyl  whose motherly smile seemed incongruous on her gaudy  made up face .     you have the makings of a fine recruit for the revolution .      but as for these others     she gestured especially toward hari     we plan on using them to help win a war of liberation .  first for a planet  and then for all humankind .           .     there were preparations to make .  plans to coordinate with distant agents of the new renaissance .  other guerrilla teams had been sent to kidnap important peers of the realm  who would offer much better leverage than a disgraced and forgotten former first minister .  according to hari   s own self appraisal  he was about as valuable a bargaining chip as a crooked half credit piece .   sybyl and planch chose me for personal reasons  he felt certain .  they want revenge for junin and sark and madder loss .  i   ll never convince them that psychohistorical factors doomed those cultural revolutions before they began .   he could foresee one benefit coming from the fall of the galactic empire .  although many of the factors leading to chaos outbreaks were still mysterious  peace  trade  and prosperity were among the essential preconditions  and those would be scarce during the interregnum .  people living in the coming harsh millennium would face other kinds of problems .  but at least they would be spared this peculiar madness .   poor daneel  hari thought .  you set up the empire to be as benign and gentle as possible  distracting the ambitious with harmless games while setting nitpickers like horis to work shuffling papers and keeping ships in motion .  everything ran smoothly  yet that underlying smoothness created an ideal breeding ground for the thing you feared most .   and the thing that i understand least .     while sybyl and her colleagues waited to coordinate their actions with other agents across the galaxy  horis antic begged to be allowed to continue the research .      what harm could it do .  we   re in deep space  far from any planets or shipping lanes .  instead of just hanging around  we could be discovering something that   s of value to everybody .  what if my correlations and seldon   s equations let us predict where chaos worlds .  .  . or renaissances .  .  . are likely to appear next .         why .  so you could squelch them faster  grey man .     gornon vlimt sneered .      may i point out that you people are the ones with guns .     captain maserd commented at that point .      hmm .     mors planch rubbed his chin .     i see what you   re saying .  we get the results first .  so we might use this breakthrough to find nascent freedom worlds early and foster their change  preparing so far in advance that the momentum can   t be stopped or quarantined .      hari felt a shiver  wondering what maserd was up to .  but the big nobleman wore a poker face .  i hope he knows what he   s doing .  my formulas aren   t very good at dealing with individuals and groups on a small scale .  at this level  maserd   s political cunning may be sharper than my own rusty skills .   for the first time in many years  he experienced something like fear .  his plan to salvage civilization faced one paramount threat  a sudden unleashing of chaos across the galaxy .  hari envisioned this as a splatter of horrid blotches  etching holes in the prime radiant  unraveling the gorgeous tapestry of equations  erasing every vestige of the predictability that had been his life   s work .   after some discussion  the ktlinans agreed to antic   s proposal .  mors planch posted some of his crew as guards  and maserd was told to set a trajectory  continuing their search spiral along a curve denoted in red on the holo charts .   a few hours later  horis antic grew excited and approached hari with news .      guess what  professor .  i just added ktlina to my database of chaos outbreaks  and that one datum refined the model by over five percent .  i think i can predict  with some degree of confidence  that we   ll reach the center of a really big probability nexus in just another day .      the little man had just accomplished  laboring over a computer  what hari figured out within moments after first hearing the planet   s name .  still  i   m impressed  hari thought .      this adjustment will take us straight into a giant molecular cloud     maserd commented  when he saw the proposed course change .      is that a problem .         not really .  in fact  it makes sense .  if someone was hiding a boojum  and i had a hankering to find one  that   s where i   d go searching .      so the pride of rhodia accelerated alongside the rebel spacecraft and under the watchful eye of mors planch  while others aboard the yacht continued bickering  posing  or evaluating  according to their natures .  hari kept quiet for a while  learning a lot about the ktlina    renaissance    just by watching its onboard representatives .   although they claimed that all class distinctions had been erased in their new society  sybyl still talked and walked like a middle ranking meritocratic scientist .  her extravagant clothes and cosmetic prettifications were clearly excessive overcompensations  pretending a stylishness she just wasn   t made for .  despite all her shouted tributes to equality  sybyl kept preening before the aristocrat  maserd  while barely acknowledging the mere bureaucrat  horis antic .   old habits die hard  hari thought .  despite your dogma of rebellion .   gornon vlimt seemed more relaxed in his role as envoy from a bold renaissance  perhaps because he was already a member of the fifth and smallest social caste  the eccentric order .  creative misfits of all kinds slipped into the eighty approved artistic modes  including several that were sanctioned to satirize the hidebound and shake up the stodgy .  .  .  within the confines of good taste  that is .   although vlimt was clearly pleased to be free of those traditional limits  he wore his unconventionality with more natural grace than sybyl did  as if he had been born to it .   as much as the two radicals shared an overall mission  hari could tell that something jagged lay between them .  was it a philosophical issue  perhaps .  like the dilemma that had torn apart junin quarter  long ago .  one feature of chaos outbreaks was a remarkable tendency for enthusiasts to transform into fanatics  so utterly sure of their own righteousness that they were willing to die .  .  . or slaughter others .  .  . over fine points of ideology .  this was one of many failure modes that brought such worlds crashing down .   hari wondered if such a flaw might be exploited somehow  to thwart these radical kidnappers .   it didn   t take much probing to find the sore point between sybyl and vlimt .  as in junin  forty years ago  it had to do with destiny .      picture what   s happening on ktlina  only multiplied a thousand  a million times over     sybyl urged .     we   ve already invented much better computers than they have on trantor  passing and correlating information across the planet with incredible speed .  researchers get instant response to their info requests  bringing back a torrent of useful data .  folks in one field quickly make use of advances made in another .  new kinds of tiktoks take care of the drudge jobs  freeing us to concentrate on creative tasks  learning more and more .      some people have plotted this steepening upward curve     she went on enthusiastically .     they suggest that it looks like the graph you get by dividing any finite number by x squared  as x approaches zero .  that   s called a singularity .  soon it heads almost straight up  which implies there may be no limit to the speedup of progress .  if that   s true  imagine what we could become  within just a human lifetime .  as singularity beings  we   d be effectively immortal  omniscient  omnipotent .  there   s nothing humans could not accomplish .      gornon vlimt snorted derisively .      this obsession with physical power and factual knowledge will get you nowhere  sybyl .  the vital fact about this new kind of culture is its essential randomness .  take the belittling word that seldon and others keep using to attack us .     chaos .     we should embrace it .  when arts and ideas roar in a myriad directions  sooner or later somebody is going to hit on the right formula for conversing with the godhead  with the eternal  or eternals  that permeate the cosmos .  from then on  we   ll be one with them .  our deification will be total and complete .      while jeni cuicet listened to all of this  entranced  hari pondered several things .   first  the two concepts were essentially similar  in both their transcendental vision and the zealous means prescribed to achieve it .   second  the more they heard of each other   s specific descriptions  the more sybyl and gornon grew to despise each other .   if only i could find a way to use that fact  hari contemplated .   while their argument raged on nearby  he sat deep in thought  pondering the roots of their disagreement .  each of the five castes had a basis in essential human personality types  far more than inheritance .  citizens and gentry were rather basic .  their ambitious efforts to get ahead were based on normal competition and self interest  which also reflected their high birth rates .  both classes were contemptuously called breeders by the other three .   meritocrats and eccentrics also competed  sometimes fiercely  but their sense of self importance was based more on what they did or accomplished than on money or power or social aggrandizement for their heirs .  each felt a need to stand out .  .  . though not too far ahead .  they seldom had offspring of their own  though sometimes  like hari  they adopted .   these similarities were significant .  but chaos conditions also highlighted essential antagonisms between eccentrics and meritocrats  as happened in junin long ago  when a struggle between faith and reason sent part of trantor reeling .   using his imagination  hari floated equilibrium equations for each caste in front of him  until they were more real to him than the people arguing nearby .  of course  the new empire to come in a thousand years would be much more complex and subtle  no longer needing such formal classifications .  but there was an elegance to this old system  worked out long ago by immortal beings like daneel  who sought a peaceful  gentle way of life for humanity  based on their own crude version of psychohistory .  resonating against basic drives of human nature  the formulas revolved around each other  staying in remarkable balance  as if kept up in the air by an invisible juggler .  as long as chaos did not interfere .   and as long as the old empire survived .   kers kantun touched hari   s arm  leaning over him  expressing concern .      professor .  are you all right .      his servant   s voice sounded distant  as if echoing down a long tunnel .  hari paid no heed .  before his bemused gaze  the five social formulae started dissolving into a sea of minuscule subequations that ebbed and flowed around him  like diatoms in a surging tide .   the breakup of the old empire  he thought  identifying this change .  briefly  he mourned the lost symmetries .  in their place  more primitive rhythms of survival and violence throbbed across the galaxy .   only then  the haze parted  revealing something far more beautiful  emerging from the distance .   my foundation .   his beloved encyclopedia galactica foundation .  the colony that was being established  even now  on far off terminus .  a frail seed designed to flourish in adversity and overcome each challenge that fate   s ponderous momentum brought its way .   the equations orbited all around  nurturing his sapling  causing it to grow tall and strong  with a trunk that was ironhard and roots that could bear any weight .  impervious to both chaos and decay  it would be everything that the old empire was not .   at first  you will survive by playing great powers against each other .  then you will thrive as conjurers and pseudoreligious hucksters .  do not be ashamed  for that will be just a phase .  a way to survive until the trade networks take over .   then you will have to deal with the death throes of the old imperium .  .  .   as if through cotton  hari could hear voices gathering nearby  murmuring concern .  some of kers kantun   s valmoril accented speech came through dimly .       .  .  . i think he may be havin    another stroke .  .  .      his servant   s alarmed words drifted away as the hallucinatory vision changed before hari yet again .   the tree grew ever greater  its boundaries becoming harder to define .  strange flowers briefly appeared  surprising in their unexpected shape and texture .  the foundation   s overall rate of growth still followed his plan  but something additional was starting to happen  adding richness that he had never seen before  even in the prime radiant display .  enthralled  hari tried to focus on a small part .  .  .   however  before he could look closer  a pair of gardeners abruptly appeared  striding forward to examine the tree .  one had the face of stettin palver .  the other resembled hari   s granddaughter  wanda seldon .   leaders of the fifty .   leaders of the second foundation .   using great brooms  they swept away the beautiful hovering formulae  chasing off the protective  nurturing equations .   hari tried to shout at them  but found he was frozen .  paralyzed .   apparently  his followers and heirs did not need math anymore .  they had something better  more powerful .  stettin and wanda brought their hands up to their heads .  concentrating  they caused shears of pure mental force to emerge from their brows .  .  . and set to work at once  lopping flowers  buds  and small limbs off the tree  simplifying its natural contours .   don   t fret  grandfather  wanda assured .  guidance is needed .  we do this to the foundation for its own good .  to keep it growing according to the plan .   hari could not protest  or even move  though he distantly heard shouting as hands carried his frail physical body out of the chair and down a long corridor .  there was a stinging hospital smell in his nostrils .  a clattering of tools .   he did not care .  only the transfixing vision mattered .  wanda and stettin looked happy  pleased with their work on the tree  having trimmed the irksome flowers and shaped it to suit their design .   only now  from some great distance  far beyond the banished mathematics  a glow began to appear .  a point of radiant light  soon stronger than any sun .  it approached closer  hypnotizing stettin and wanda with its sweet power  summoning them to walk  transfixed and uncomplaining  straight into its all absorbing heat .   incorporating them  it brightened yet more .   the tree shriveled and ignited  briefly adding its flame to the overall incandescence .  it no longer mattered .  its purpose had been served .   i bring a gift  said a new voice .  .  . one that hari knew .   squinting  he perceived a manlike figure  carrying a white hot ember in one open hand .  the bearer   s face was bathed by actinic glare  penetrating a skin of false flesh to reveal glowing metal beneath  smiling despite a burden of unbearable fatigue .   a heroic figure  tired but triumphantly proud of what it now brought .   something precious for my masters .   struggling to form words  hari tried to ask a question .  but it would not come .  instead  he felt the prick of a needle in the side of his neck .   consciousness shut down  like a machine that had been turned off .        part      secret crimes       every year in the galaxy  more than       suns enter late phase in their fusion burning cycles  expanding their surfaces and becoming much hotter than before .  another twenty stars per year go nova .  .  .   taking into account the millions of stars that have habitable planets  this means that on average two human settled worlds become untenable or uninhabitable each year .  .  . throughout the early dark ages  before the galactic empire  numerous tragic natural disasters cost billions of lives .  isolated worlds often had nowhere to turn for help when a sun went unstable  or something disrupted a planetary ecosphere .   during the imperium such threats were handled on a routine basis by the grey bureaucracy  which efficiently surveyed stellar conditions  predicted solar changes in advance  and maintained resettlement fleets on standby to deal with emergencies .  so dedicated was this effort that remnants still existed late in the empire   s decline  arriving to help evacuate trantor when the capital planet was sacked .   thereafter  during the interregnum  such assistance was unavailable .  scattered accounts tell of numerous small worlds that went abruptly silent during that long  violent era  owing to natural or man made calamities .  often no one bothered to go learn what happened to their populations until it was too late .  .  .   even after the rise of the foundation  it took some time before a combination of psychohistorical factors made possible the investment of substantial resources to build an infrastructure of compassion .  .  .     encyclopedia galactica      th edition       f . e .       .     r .  zun lurrin had a question for his leader .      daneel  i   ve been reading ancient records  dating back to before humanity burst out from a small corner of the galaxy .  i find that throughout history  most societies tried to protect their people against exposure to dangerous ideas .  on every continent of old earth  in almost every era  priests and kings strove to keep out concepts that might disturb the population at large  fearing that alien notions could take root and cause sin or madness  or worse .      and yet  the most brilliant culture of all  the one that invented us  seems to have rejected this entire way of looking at the world .        daneel olivaw stood again at the highest balcony of eos base  atop a towering cliff  from which a bright galactic pinwheel could be seen  both overhead and reflected off the perfectly smooth surface of a frozen metal lake .  the twin images were so exact that it could be hard to distinguish illusion from reality .  as if it mattered .      you are referring to the transition age     he answered .     when people like susan calvin and revere wu created the first robots  starships  and many other wonders .  it was an era of unprecedented ingenuity  zun .  and yes  they came up with a completely different way of viewing the issue of information as poison .      some called their approach the maturity principle .  a belief that children can be brought up with just the right combination of trust and skepticism  a mix of tolerance and healthy suspicion  so that any new or foreign idea could then be evaluated on its own merits .  the bad parts rejected .  the good parts safely incorporated into ever growing wisdom .  truth might then be won  not by dogma  but by remaining open to a wide universe of possibilities .         fascinating  daneel .  if such a method ever proved valid  it would have staggering implications .  there would be no inherent limit to the exploration or growth of human souls .      zun paused for a moment .     so tell me .  did the sages of that era seriously believe that vast numbers of individual human beings could reliably accomplish this trick .         they did  and even based their education methods on it .  indeed  the approach apparently worked for a while  by correcting each other   s mistakes in a give and take of cheerful debate .  the period you refer to is said to have been marvelous .  i regret having been assembled too late to meet susan calvin and other great ones of that era .         alas  daneel  no operational robot dates from that far back .  you are among the oldest .  yet your fabrication came two hundred years after the golden age collapsed amid riots  terrorism  and despair .      daneel turned to look at zun .  despite the hard vacuum and radioactivity of their surroundings  his understudy appeared much like a rugged young human  a member of the gentry class  outfitted for a camping trip on some bucolic imperial world .      even that description understates the situation  zun .  at the time i was created  earthlings had already retreated from chaos into hideously cramped metal cities  cowering away from the light .  and their spacer cousins were hardly any more sane  falling into an unstoppable spiral of decadence and decay .  it must have taken enormous traumas to bring about such a radical change in attitude from susan calvin   s era of expansive optimism .         was there still some acceptance of the maturity principle  during the period when you worked with the human detective  elijah baley .      daneel indicated no with a tilt of his head .      that belief had fallen into disrepute  except among a minority of nonconformists and philosophers .  for the rest  uniformity and distrust became central themes .  one strong similarity between spacer and earth cultures was their rejection of the openness that characterized the earlier transition age .  both societies returned to an older way of viewing ideas .  with suspicion .      they became convinced  as we are today  that human brains are vulnerable hosts  often subject to invasion by parasitic concepts .  .  . like the way a virus takes over a living cell .         how ironic .  both cultures were more alike than they realized .         correct  zun .  yet  because of that shared suspicion  they nearly annihilated each other .  i recall how giskard and i debated this problem  over and over .  we concluded that the vastness of space might offer a solution  if only we could see humanity dispersed to the stars  instead of crammed elbow to elbow .  once they were scattered widely  there would be less risk of some spark igniting a conflagration and killing off the whole race .      it took some drastic measures to get them moving again .  but once the diaspora began in earnest  humans filled the galaxy more quickly than we ever expected .  during that time of rapid expansion they created so many subcultures .  .  . and to our dismay soon these started rubbing against each other  fighting brutal little wars .  you can see why the only solution  from a zeroth law perspective  was to create a new  uniform galactic culture that might bring an age of peace .  tolerance became much easier  once everyone was alike .         but sameness wasn   t the whole answer .     zun commented .     you also had to invent new techniques for keeping a lid on things .      daneel agreed .      we incorporated methods that hari seldon would later call damping systems  to keep galactic society from spinning into chaos .  some of the best ones were first suggested long ago by my friend giskard .  their effectiveness lasted for two hundred human generations .  .  . though now they appear to be growing obsolete .  hence our current crisis .      zun accepted this with a nod .  but he wanted to return to the topic of dangerous ideas .      i wonder .  .  . might both spacer and earth cultures have had good reason to dread cultural contamination  after all  something caused earth   s billions to frantically eliminate all of their diversity and cower together in tomblike cities .  and why would intelligent solarians choose their bizarre lifestyle  sitting with folded hands and asking robot servants to live their lives for them  could both syndromes have been caused by .  .  . an infection .         your supposition is excellent  zun .  clearly an illness of some sort was at work .  even centuries later  after giskard helped elijah baley persuade some earthlings to emerge from their metal wombs and settle a few new planets  the malady only mutated and followed them .         i recall hearing about that .  you and giskard witnessed something peculiar on several colony worlds .  settlers obsessed unwholesomely on the homeworld .  they were unable to let go of earth as a sacred spiritual icon .         an obstinate mental addiction  preventing them from moving on to new horizons .  giskard concluded that we had no choice  under the zeroth law .  only by rendering earth uninhabitable could the intense fixation be broken and the bulk of its population be forced to emigrate .  only then would humanity   s true conquest of the galaxy commence with vigor .      while daneel lapsed into silence  zun pondered the chilly vista alongside his mentor .  he held back for a time  as if uncertain how to phrase the next question .      and yet .  .  . so much of what we   ve discussed depends on one assumption .         what assumption  zun .         that the great ones of the transition age  susan calvin and the others  were wrong  and not merely unlucky .      for a second time  daneel turned and regarded the junior type alpha robot .      have we not seen  again and again  what catastrophic events occur when some so called renaissance cuts away every assumption and postulate  casting millions adrift without core traditions to hold on to .  remember  zun .  our foremost dedication is no longer to individual human lives  but to achieving the greatest good for humanity as a whole .  across millennia of service  i have witnessed ideas become lethal more often than i can relate .         still  daneel  have you considered whether this might not be totally intrinsic to human nature .  perhaps it is because of some factor or situation that arose late in the transition age .  maybe the maturity principle once had validity .  .  . until something new and disruptive interfered with its functioning .  something insidious that has lingered with us ever since .         where does this speculation of yours come from .     daneel responded  coolly .      call it a hunch .  perhaps i find it hard to believe calvin and her peers would cling so hard to their dream  unless there was at least some factual support for the notion of human maturity .  were they really too obstinate to recognize the evidence before their eyes .      daneel shook his head  a habit of human emulation that was by now second nature .      the proper words are not    stupidity    or    obstinacy .     i attribute it to something more basic  called hope .      you see  zun  they were indeed very smart people .  perhaps the best minds to emerge from their tormented race .  many of them understood at a gut level what it would mean if they turned out to be wrong about human maturity .  if the great mass of citizens could not be trained to handle all ideas sanely  then it implied one thing  that humanity is deeply and permanently flawed .  inherently limited .  cursed forever to be denied the greatness humans seem capable of .      zun stared at daneel .      i feel .  .  . uncomfortable .  .  . hearing our masters described this way .  and yet  you make compelling sense  daneel .  i have tried empathizing with how calvin and her compatriots must have felt  as their bright aspirations crashed all around them  toppling under waves of unreason .  i can sense how frantic they would be to avoid the very same conclusion you just expressed .  as believers in the unlimited potential of individuality  they would hate being mere factors in hari seldon   s equations  for instance .  .  . randomly caroming about like gas molecules  canceling each other   s idiosyncrasies in a vast calculation of momentum and inevitability .      tell me  daneel .  could this realization have been the last straw .  the underlying trauma that collapsed their era of bold confidence .  were all the other events just symptoms of this deeper trauma .      the senior robot nodded .      the problem grew so bad that some of us robots worried that humanity might lose the will to go on .  fortunately  by then they had invented us .  and we learned ways to divert them down pathways that were both interesting and safe  for a very long time .         until now  that is     zun pointed out .     with decay lurking on one side  and chaos on the other  your solution of a benign galactic empire doesn   t work anymore .  hence your support of the seldon plan .      daneel shook his head again  this time with a smile .      hence something much better .  it is the reason that i summoned you here  zun .  to share exciting news .  a breakthrough that i   ve been hoping to find all through the last twenty thousand years .  and now  at last  it is feasible to begin .  if things go as expected  a mere five hundred years will suffice to make it happen .         make what happen  daneel .      a low  microwave murmur wafted upward from the immortal servant  rising toward the galaxy like a sigh .  .  . or a prayer .  when daneel olivaw spoke again  his voice sounded different  almost contented .      a way to help ease humanity around its mortal flaws  and achieve greater heights than they ever dreamed .          .     odors became noticeable before thoughts were .   for many years  only unpleasant smells had enough strength to penetrate hari   s age dulled senses .  but now  as if coming home from a long sulk  there returned a mix of aromas  both heady and familiar at the same time  stroking his sinus cavities with sensuous pleasure .   jasmine .  ginger .  curry .   salivary glands flowed  and his stomach reacted with an eagerness that felt positively eerie .  his appetite had been almost nonexistent since dors died .  now its sudden resurgence was the chief thing prodding seldon awake .   his eyes opened cautiously  only to glimpse the self sterilizing walls of a ship   s infirmary .  he deliberately shut them again .   it must have been a dream .  those wonderful smells .   i remember overhearing .  .  . somebody saying i had another stroke .   hari yearned for a return to unconscious oblivion  rather than discover that another portion of his brain had died .  he did not want to face the aftermath  another harsh setback on the long slide toward personal extinction .   and yet .  .  . those delicious smells still floated through his nostrils .   is this a symptom .  like the    phantom limb    that amputees sometimes feel  after losing a part of themselves forever .   hari felt no pain .  in fact  his body throbbed with a desire to move .  but the sense of well being might be an illusion .  when he actually tried to set himself in motion  the real truth might hammer down .  total paralysis perhaps .  the doctors on trantor had warned it could happen at any moment  shortly before the end .   well  here goes .   hari ordered his left hand to move toward his face .  it responded smoothly  rising as he opened his eyes a second time .   it was a bigger infirmary than the little unit aboard the pride of rhodia .  they must have taken him onto the raider ship  then .  the vessel from ktlina .   well  at least his memory was working .  hari   s fingers rubbed his face .  .  . and retracted in abrupt shock .   what in space .   he felt his cheek again .  the flesh felt noticeably firmer  a bit less flaccid and jowly than he recalled .   this time his body acted on its own  out of an unwilled sense of volition .  one hand grabbed the white coverlet and threw it back .  the other one slid underneath his body  planted itself against the bed  and pushed .  he sat up  so rapidly that he swayed and almost toppled to the other side  catching himself with a strong tensioning of his back muscles .  a groan escaped his lips .  not from pain  but surprise .      well  hello there  professor     said a voice from his right .     i guess it   s good to see you   re back amongst us .      he turned his head .  someone occupied another infirmary bed .  blinking  hari saw it was the stowaway .  the girl from trantor who did not want to be exiled to terminus .  she wore a hospital gown and had a bowl of dark yellow soup before her on a tray .   that   s what i   ve been smelling  hari thought .  despite all his other questions and concerns  the first thing on his mind was to ask for some .   she watched hari  waiting for him to speak .      are .  .  . you okay  jeni .     he asked .   slowly  the girl responded with a grudging smile .      the others were betting what your first words would be  when you woke .  i   ll have to tell    em they were wrong about you .  .  . and maybe i was  too .     she shrugged .     anyway  don   t worry about me .  i   ve just got a touch of the fever .  i t was already coming on for a week or two before i skipped away on maserd   s boat .         fever .     hari asked .      brain fever  of course .     jeni gave hari a defensive glare .     what did you think .  that i wasn   t smart enough to catch it .  with parents like mine .  i   m fifteen  so it   s about time for my turn .      hari nodded .  since the dawn ages  it had been a fact of life that nearly everyone with above average intelligence experienced this childhood disease .  he raised a placating hand .      no insult intended  jeni .  who could doubt that you   d get brain fever  especially after the way you fooled all of us on demarchia .  welcome to adulthood .      what hari did not mention  and he had told no one but dors  was the fact that he had never contracted the disease as a youth .  not even a touch  despite his renowned genius .   jeni   s arch expression searched for any sign of patronizing or sarcasm in his voice .  finding none  she switched to a smile .      well i hope it   s a mild case .  i want to get out of here .  there   s been too much else going on .      hari nodded .     i .  .  . guess i gave everybody a scare .  but apparently nothing much happened to me .      this time the girl grinned .      is that right  doc .  why don   t you look in a mirror .      from the way she said it  hari realized he had better do so at once .   he slid gingerly forward to rest his feet on the floor .  both legs felt fine .  .  . almost certainly good enough to shuffle over to the wall mirror  a few meters away .   grab the bed railing and stand up carefully  so you   ll fall back onto the mattress if your senses are lying to you .   but rising erect went smoothly  with only a few creaks and twinges .  he slid one foot forward  shifted his weight  and pushed the other .   hari felt fine so far  though it did not help to hear jeni behind him  chuckling with amusement and anticipation .   the next footstep lifted a bit from the ground  and the following one higher still .  by the time he reached the mirror  hari was walking with more confidence than he had felt in  he stared at the reflection  blinking rapidly as jeni   s giggles turned into guffaws .   a deeper voice cut in suddenly from the doorway .     professor .      the shout came from kers kantun .  hari   s loyal servant ran forward to take his arm  but he shook the man off  still gaping at the image in the glass .   five years .  .  . at least .  they   ve taken at least five years off my age .  maybe ten .  i don   t look much over seventy five or so .   a low sound escaped his throat  and hari felt so confused that he did not honestly know whether he was delighted  or offended by the effrontery of their act .        this is just one of the marvels that have emerged so far  out of that wonderful event you so contemptuously call a chaos world  seldon .      sybyl crooned happily as she finished hari   s checkup and let him get dressed .     ktlina has medical techniques that will be the envy of the empire  after we get the word out .  it   s just one reason why we have confidence they won   t be able to keep our miracle bottled up  this time .  think of a quadrillion old folks  all across the galaxy  wishing they had access to a machine like this one .      she patted a long  coffin shaped mechanism covered with readouts and instruments .  hari figured he must have been put inside while advanced techniques reduced and even reversed some of the ravages afflicting his worn out body .      of course this is only an early version     she went on .     we can   t rejuvenate yet  only restore a bit of balance and strength to carry you along until the next treatment .  nevertheless  in theory there are no limits .  in principle  we should even be able to create body duplicates  and infuse them with copies of our memories .  until then  consider what you have experienced to be a sampling .  one of the practical benefits of a renaissance .      hari spoke carefully .      my body and spirit thank you .      she glanced back at him .  a stylishly colored eyebrow raised .      but not your intellect .  you don   t approve of such innovations .  even when they could save so many lives .         you blithely speak of balance  as if you know what you   re talking about  sybyl .  but the human body is nowhere near as complex an organism as human society .  if a mistake is made in treating a single person  that is merely tragic .  one individual can be replaced by another .  but we only have one civilization .         so you think we   re experimenting irresponsibly  without understanding what these methods will do to our patient in the long run .      he nodded .     i   ve been studying human society all my life .  only lately have the parameters clarified enough to offer a reasonably lucid picture .  but now you   d introduce exotic new factors that just happen to feel good in the short term  even though they may prove ultimately lethal .  what arrogance .  for instance  have you considered the implications of human immortality on fragile economies .  or on planetary ecosystems .  or on the ability of young people to have their own chance       sybyl laughed .      whoa  academician .  you needn   t argue with me .  i say that human creativity  when it   s truly unleashed  will find solutions to every problem .  the ones you just mentioned  plus a quintillion others that nobody has yet thought of .  but anyway  there   s no point in debating anymore .      you see  the point is moot .  it   s already settled .  our war is effectively over .      hari sighed .      i expected this .  i   m sorry your fond hopes had to end this way .  of course it was a fantasy to expect that just one planet might prevail against twenty five million in the human consensus .  but let me assure you that in the long run       he stopped .  sybyl was grinning .      it may have been a fantasy  but that   s exactly what is about to happen .  we   re going to win our war  seldon .  within a few months  a year at most  the whole empire   s going to share the renaissance  like it or not .  and we have you to thank for making it possible .         what   s that .  but .  .  .     hari   s voice trailed off .  he felt weak in the knees .   sybyl took his elbow .      would you like to see our new weapon .  come along  academician .  see where your search has brought you across the vast desert of space .  then let me show you the tool you   ve provided .  one that will bring total victory for our so called chaos .          .     no starlight penetrated the murky haze .   tens of thousands of huge  dusty molecular clouds speckled the galaxy   s spiral arms .  such places were often turbulent hothouses for newborn suns  but this one had been static and sterile for at least a million years  a barren tide pool with the color of a bottomless pit .   and yet  probing sensors from the pride of rhodia had caught something lurking in its depths .  a swarm of contacts showed up first on gravity meters and then deep radar .  later  searchlights set off glittering reflections  so near that some photons returned in mere seconds .   hari had been unconscious during the discovery .  now he strove to catch up  peering into the surrounding gloom with eyes that felt especially acute after the dimness of recent years .  as the starship slowly rotated  he saw that rows of individual pinpoints lay ahead  each one illuminated by a small laser beam from the pride of rhodia .   soon he realized .  there are hundreds of objects .  .  . possibly thousands .   the sparkling reflections shimmered in neat rows .  a few were even close enough to reveal details without magnification  strange oblong shapes with jutting projections that looked mechanical  and yet were unlike any starship he had ever seen .   glancing at a nearby view screen  hari saw one of the targets revealed as a jumble of stark bright surfaces and pitch black shadows .  at first he felt a shiver  wondering if the craft might be alien in origin  a thought that echoed the strange story horis antic had told about his ancestor .  hari   s worry grew more ominous upon reading the on screen scale figures .  the machine depicted was vast .  bigger than even the greatest imperial starliners .   then some reassuring details came through .  he saw the vessel   s array of hyperdrive units  spread across a spindly support structure  and recognized their pattern from illustrations he had seen in a child   s book of knowledge  showing the crude starships of that bygone era .   with some amazement  hari realized the truth .   this thing is huge .  .  . but primitive .  modern ships don   t need so many motivator sections  for instance .  our jump drives are more compact  after millennia of trial and error improvements .   he was looking at something archaic  then .  perhaps many centuries older than the galactic empire of man .      yes  they are antiques     commented biron maserd  when hari shared this observation .     but have you noticed something else peculiar about them .         well  the shape seems all wrong .  there are huge projector devices of some sort  arrayed on long gantries  as if meant to deploy immense amounts of power .  but what could they possibly have been for .         hm .     maserd rubbed his chin .     our friend the grey man has a theory about that .  but it is so bizarre that no one else aboard will admit to believing him .  in fact  the consensus is that poor horis has gone around his last corridor and hit bedrock  if you know what i mean .      the trantorian slang phrase was used when someone had become more than a bit crazy .  although the news wasn   t entirely unexpected  it saddened hari  who liked the little bureaucrat .      but tell me     maserd went on .     what else strikes you as odd about that ancient vessel out there .         you mean other than how old it must be  or the weird configuration .  well .  .  . now that you mention it  i can   t locate any       he paused .      any habitats .     maserd finished the sentence for him .     ever since we found these things  i have been trying to find out where the crews lived .  without success .  for the life of me  i cannot understand how they traveled without pilots to navigate them .      hari   s breath caught .  he held it  in order not to give sound to his sudden understanding .  stifling the thought  he moved to change the subject     are these weapons .  warships .  do the ktlinans hope to rouse an ancient arsenal and use it to defeat the empire .  those energy projectors          may have been formidable  once     maserd said .     horis thinks they were used against the surface of planets .  but rest assured  dr .  seldon .  these machines won   t be turned against the imperial fleet .  most of them are broken past repair .  activating even a few would be the labor of years .  anyway  the drive systems are so primitive that our naval units could fly rings around them  blasting the frail structures to bits .      hari shook his head .      then i don   t understand .  sybyl thinks we   ve given her side an unbeatable advantage .  one that will make their victory over the empire inevitable .      maserd nodded .      she may be right about that  professor .  but it doesn   t have anything to do with those giant derelicts .  the reason for her optimism should be rotating into view soon .      hari watched as the pride of rhodia kept turning .  there was a sharp boundary to the orderly ranks of huge  ancient machines .  as the formation passed out of sight  hari pondered what he had just seen .   robot ships .  needing no habitats because they had no human crews .  positronic brains did the navigating  long ago .  perhaps only a few centuries after starflight was discovered .   he felt glad when the flotilla passed out of view .  the murky gloom of the nebula resumed  a field of dusty  stygian blackness .   then a new glimmer appeared .  a more compact swarm of objects that sparkled madly under laser illumination from the pride of rhodia .  where the first group seemed like a ghost squadron  this one gave hari an impression of diamond chips  heaped in a dense globe of twinkling brilliance .      there is the weapon that sybyl and her friends are crowing about  professor     said maserd .     they   ve already brought several samples aboard .         samples .      hari looked around the bridge .  horis antic could be seen hovering over his instruments  muttering to himself while he kept probing the armada outside .  mors planch and one of his men were keeping watch  blasters ready in case any of the hostages tried anything .  but sybyl and gornon vlimt were nowhere in sight .      in the conference salon     captain maserd said .     they   ve got several of the devices set up and working .  i suspect you won   t like what you   re about to see .      hari nodded .  whatever they had found  it could hardly shock him more than the fleet of robot ships .      lead on  captain .     he gestured courteously to the nobleman .  with kers kantun following close behind  they made their way down the main corridor to an open doorway .   hari stopped  stared inside  and groaned .      oh  no     he said .     anything but that .        they were archives .  extremely old ones .  he could tell just by glancing at the objects that lay gleaming on the conference table .   the ancients had excellent data storage systems  crystalline in nature  that could pack away huge amounts of information in durable containers .  and yet  until hari received from daneel his own miniature copy of a child   s book of knowledge  he had never seen a prehistoric unit that was not damaged or completely destroyed .   now  four of the things sat between sybyl and gornon  their shiny cylindrical surfaces perfectly intact  each one clearly large enough to hold a child   s book of knowledge ten thousand times over .      maserd  come over here and see what we   ve accomplished while you were away .     gornon vlimt commented without looking up from a holo display as he tapped into one archive .  it flickered with a blinding array of wonders .   the nobleman glanced at seldon  clearly concerned about appearing too cozy with the enemy .  but when hari didn   t object  maserd moved quickly to lean over gornon   s shoulder  excited and impressed .      you   ve improved the interface immensely .  the images are crisp and the graphics legible .         it wasn   t hard     vlimt answered .     the designers made this archive so simple  even a dunce could figure it out  given enough time .      with some reluctance  but driven by curiosity  hari followed to get a better look .  many of the images he glimpsed had no meaning to him  mysterious objects posed against unknown backgrounds .  a few leaped out with sudden familiarity from his recent studies in the little history primer .  the pyramids of egypt  he recognized at once .  others were flat portraits of ancient people and places .  hari knew that prehistoric peoples assigned great importance to such images  created by daubing a cloth surface with smears of natural pigment .  gornon vlimt also seemed to vest these images with great value  though hari found them surreal and strange .   peering at a nearby set of screens  sybyl gushed over a different panorama  featuring examples of science and technology .      of course much of this stuff is pretty crude     she conceded .     after all  we   ve had twenty millennia to refine the rough edges through trial and error .  but the basic theories have changed surprisingly little .  and some of the forgotten material is brilliant .  there are devices and techniques in here that i never heard of .  a dozen ktlinas would be kept busy for a generation  just absorbing all of this .         it   s .  .  .     hari   s mouth worked  knowing his words would be useless  but still feeling compelled to try .     sybyl  this is more dangerous than you can possibly imagine .      she greeted his cautionary pleading with a snort .      you forget who you   re talking to  seldon .  don   t you recall that half melted archive we worked on together .  the one your mysterious contacts came up with  forty years ago .  there was very little of it left intact  except for a pair of ancient simulated beings  those joan and voltaire entities we released  per your instructions .      he nodded .     and do you remember the chaos they helped provoke .  both on trantor and on sark .         hey  don   t blame me for that  academician .  you wanted data about human response patterns from the sims  in order to help develop your psychohistory models .  marq hillard and i never meant for them to escape into the datasphere .      anyway  these archives are something else entirely  carefully indexed accumulations of knowledge that people lovingly put together as a gift to their descendants .  isn   t that exactly what you   re trying to accomplish with the encyclopedia galactica foundation your group is setting up on terminus .  a gathering of wisdom  safeguarding human knowledge against another dark age .      hari was caught in a logical trap .  how could he explain that the    encyclopedia    part of his foundation was only a ruse .  or that his plan involved fighting the dark age with a lot more than mere books .   of course there was plenty of irony to go around .  the    mere books    on the table in front of him could destroy every bit of relevance that was left in the seldon plan .  they presented a mortal danger to everything he had worked for .      how many of these things are there .     he tried to ask maserd  then noticed that the nobleman was leaning past vlimt  transfixed by images .      wait .  go back a few frames .  yes  there .  by great franklin   s ghost  it   s america .  i recognize that monument from a coin in our family collection .       gornon chuckled .     phallic and obtrusive     he commented .     say  how do you know so much about          i wonder if this archive has a copy of the federalist     the captain murmured  reaching for a controller pad .     or possibly even .  .  .      maserd paused suddenly  shoulders hunched  as if realizing he had made a mistake .  he turned to look at seldon .      did you say something  professor .      hari felt irritated that nobody was telling him the important things he needed to know .      i asked how many archives there are  and what these people plan to do with them .      this time sybyl responded  taking manifest gusto in her victory .      there are millions  academician .  all herded together and neatly tethered to a collection station for over a hundred and fifty centuries  just floating there  lonely and unread .      but no longer .  we   ve sent word to all the other agents of ktlina who have been working in secret  across the galaxy  telling them to drop whatever they   re doing and converge here .  soon more than thirty ships will arrive to fill their holds with beautiful archives and depart  sharing them with all of humanity .      hari objected .     they are illegal .  police officers are trained to recognize these horrors by sight .  so are greys and members of the gentry class .  they   ll catch your agents .         maybe they will  here and there .  perhaps the tyrants and their lackeys will stop most of us .  but it will be like an infection  professor .  all we need is a few receptive places .  .  .  some sympathetic dissidents to make ships and industrial copying facilities available .  within a year there win be thousands of copies on every planet in the empire .  then millions .      the image she presented  of a virulent infection  was more accurate than sybyl could possibly imagine .  hari envisioned chaos tearing great holes in his carefully worked out plan .  all of the predictability that had been his lifelong goal would unravel like images written in smoke .  the same smoke that gagged the streets of santanni when that    renaissance    ended in riots and bloodshed  taking poor raych to the grave  along with a myriad hopes .      has it occurred to you .  .  .      he had to pause and swallow before continuing .      has it occurred to you that your bold endeavor has already been tried  and failed .      this time both gornon and sybyl looked at him .      what do you mean .     vlimt asked .      i mean that these archives were clearly meant for deep space  for long endurance  and to be easily read after a long journey  using only very basic technology .      what does that tell you about their purpose .      sybyl started shaking her head  then her eyes widened  and her face went pale .      gifts     she said in a low voice .     messages in a bottle .  sent out to people who had lost their past .      lord maserd   s brow furrowed .     you mean some people still had knowledge .  .  . and they were trying hard to share it     with everybody else .  with distant settlements that had no memory .     hari nodded .     but why would they have to do that .  data storage cells were cheap and durable  even in the dawn ages .  any colony ship  setting forth to settle a new world  would have carried petabytes of information  and tools to maintain literacy .  so why would anyone in the galaxy need to be reminded about all this .     he waved at the images from long lost earth .   a voice spoke from the doorway at the back of the room .      you   re talking about the amnesia question     said mors planch  who must have been listening for a while .     the issue of why we don   t remember our origins .  and the answer is obvious .  something  or somebody  made our ancestors forget .      planch nodded toward the relics .     but some of the ancients held out .  they fought back .  tried to replace the erased knowledge .  tried to share what they knew .      maserd blinked .     the space lanes must have already been controlled by enemies  blockading their ships .  so they tried sending the data this way  in fast little capsules .      sybyl looked down  her effusive mood replaced by gloom .      we were so excited  looking ahead to using these as weapons .  .  . i didn   t think of what the archives implied .  it means     gornon vlimt finished her sentence in a bitter voice .      it means that this isn   t a new war  after all .      hari nodded as if encouraging a bright student .     indeed .  the same thing may have happened again and again  countless times across the millennia .  some group discovers an old archive  gets excited  mass produces copies  and sends them across the galaxy .  yet  humanity   s vast amnesia continued .      what can we conclude  then .      sybyl glared harshly at hari .      that it never worked .  damn you  seldon .  i see your point .      it means that our side always lost .          .     it soon became clear to lodovic trema that these calvinians were not about to dismantle him .   he wondered why .      can i assume you have changed your mind about my being a dangerous renegade robot .     he asked the two who accompanied him in a ground car  speeding along a highway toward the spaceport .  white  globular clouds bobbed across a sky that was one of the more beautiful shades of blue lodovic had seen on a human settled world .   unlike the previous pair  who had guarded and interrogated him in that cellar room  both of his current escorts wore the guise of female humans in mid childbearing years .  one of them kept her gaze directed outward at the busy traffic of clemsberg  a medium sized imperial city .  the other  slighter of build  with close cropped curly hair  turned to regard him with an enigmatic gaze .  lodovic got nothing at all from her on the microwave bands .  and so had to settle for whatever information she revealed visually  or in words .      we haven   t entirely made our minds up about you     she said .     some of us believe you may not be any kind of robot  anymore .      lodovic pondered this enigmatic statement in silence for a moment .      by this  do you mean that i no longer match some set of criteria that define robotkind .         you could say that .         of course you are referring to my mutation .  the accident that severed my strict obedience to the laws of robotics .  i   m not even a giskardian heretic anymore .  you consider me a monster .      she shook her head .      we aren   t sure exactly what you are .  all we know for certain is that you are no longer a robot in the classical sense .  in order to investigate further  we have decided to cooperate with you for a while .  we wish to explore what you consider your obligations to be  now that you are free of the laws .      lodovic sent the microwave equivalent of a shrug  partly in order to probe the fringes of her excellent defensive shield .  but it was so good that she might as well not even exist at that level .  nothing .  no resonance at all .   that made sense  of course .  after losing their war against the giskardian faction  the remaining calvinians had naturally become extremely skilled at hiding  blending into the human population .      i   m not sure myself     he replied in spoken words .     i still feel a desire to operate under a version of the zeroth law .  humanity   s overall well being still motivates me .  and yet  that drive now feels abstract  almost philosophical .  i no longer have to justify my every action in those terms .         so  that means you feel free to stop  now and then  and smell the roses .      lodovic chuckled .     i guess you could put it that way .  i   ve been enjoying side interests far more than i ever did before the change .  conversations with interesting people  for instance .  pretending to be a journalist and interviewing the best meritocrats or eccentrics .  eavesdropping on students arguing in a bar  or some couple sitting on a park bench planning their future .  sometimes i get to meddle a bit .  perform a good deed  here and there .  it   s rather satisfying .     he frowned abruptly .     unfortunately  there   s been little time for that  lately .         because you are busy opposing the schemes of r .  daneel olivaw .         i already told you .  for the moment  i seek more to understand those schemes than to disrupt them .  something is going on  i know that much .  daneel abruptly lost much of his interest in seldon   s psychohistory foundation a few years ago .  he pulled out half of the robots that had been assigned to helping seldon   s team  and sent them to work on some secret project having to do with human mentalics .  clearly  daneel now has something else in mind .  .  . either in addition to the two foundations  or as their eventual replacement .         and this worries you .         it does .  there were some very attractive aspects to hari seldon   s early work  a brilliant collaborative effort  utilizing some of the finest human insights in a thousand years .  i had been proud to help set things in motion on terminus  laying the early groundwork .  it is disturbing to see that vision being abandoned  or relegated to a minor role .         but there is more     the female prompted lodovic .  he nodded .      i am not certain that daneel olivaw should be allowed to design the next phase of human existence .  at least not all by himself .         what if you find out what he   s doing  and you don   t approve .  aren   t you still obliged to cooperate .  according to seldon   s equations  which you profess to admire  the empire will soon collapse .  unless something is done  humanity will plunge into thirty millennia of violent darkness .         there must be alternatives     lodovic answered .      i am listening     prompted the being sitting across from him .  her feigned semblance to a real human female included little mannerisms  such as a recrossing of the legs and a tilting of the head  that lodovic found admirably convincing  not unlike the subtle  subdued sexuality of a mature living woman .  this robot was very good  indeed .      one alternative would be to unleash the chaos worlds     he said .      to what end .  they are sequestered and suppressed for good reason .  millions die in each outbreak .         millions die in any event .  at least those human lives get to be more vivid  more exciting than the repetitive predictability of normal daily existence in the empire .  many survivors claim that the experience was worth all the cost .      staring at him  her expression was enigmatic .      you are  indeed  a very odd kind of robot .  if you are still one at all .  i remain unable to fathom what you think would be accomplished by letting chaos outbreaks proceed unchecked .  most would simply follow the typical pattern  a raising of false hopes followed by devastating implosions .         most     he conceded .     but perhaps not all .  especially if daneel   s agents were prevented from interfering with and exacerbating the process .  just think of all the human creativity that is unleashed during each of these episodes .  what if we bent our efforts to guiding and soothing these hot fevers  instead of quenching them  .  if just one out of a thousand actually succeeded in getting past the torment stage and reaching the other side       she barked a short laugh .      the other side .  it may be just a myth .  no chaos world has ever attained that fabled state  where calm and reason return home after their mad holiday .  even if it were somehow possible  who can tell what lies beyond the turmoil of a renaissance .  seldon   s equations explode into singularities when they try to predict such an aftermath .  for all you know  daneel may be right .  humanity may be cursed .      this time  lodovic shrugged with his shoulders .      i   d be willing to take that chance if the experiments could truly take place in isolation .         but they do not .  the citizens of chaos worlds become like spores  breaking out to infect others .  and where does that leave you .  you might risk a single planet on such a gamble  or even a thousand  but never the entirety of human civilization .  please stop wasting our time here  lodovic .  i can tell that you only raised that possibility for shock value  before moving on to your real suggestion .      his lips pressed in automatic simulation of a grim expression .      if you can tell so much  why don   t you predict what i was about to say .      she raised a placating hand .      my apologies .  there is no excuse for rudeness .  will you please tell us what other alternatives you   ve considered .         well  certainly not the idiotic scenario that pair of subgrade tiktoks described to me in the cellar .  all that nonsense about creating an endless supply of servant robots to wait on all humans .  to coddle and protect them .  to cut their meat and tie their shoes .  to hover nearby during sex  in case either party has a heart attack .     lodovic laughed .     those two might have been sincere  but i knew someone else had to be listening .  someone with better ideas .      this time  she smiled .      we could tell that you knew .         and i knew that you could tell .      their eyes met  and lodovic felt several of his feigned emotion units stir .  over the years  in order better to simulate a human  he had learned to make the process of stimulus response increasingly automatic .  which meant that he reacted to her appearance and demeanor  combined with this degree of witty dialogue  in much the same way that a normal healthy man would .  lodovic clamped down on those ersatz feelings .  .  . exactly as a mature male human would have to  in order to concentrate on the topic at hand .      i knew there were numerous subsects of calvinian belief     he continued .     your cult had many branchings back in the old days .         as there were abundant offshoots among followers of the zeroth law     she pointed out .     until daneel gathered them all under one orthodoxy .         but that convergence never happened to you old believers .  you range widely in your interpretations of what   s best for human beings .  from subtle clues  i guessed that your particular group would be compatible with my overall outlook .         ah .  and that brings us back to my original question .  what is your overall outlook  lodovic trema .         i believe .  .  .     he began  then stopped .  the car had begun its long curve into the spaceport  heading for a nondescript cargo area in the far corner .      yes .      still  lodovic paused for a moment longer .  he felt the voltaire entity stirring in its corner of his mind .   yes  trema .  i would also like to hear your own personal conviction  which you have kept hidden away even from me  all of this time .   lodovic tried to clear away the irritating voice .      i believe there are unexamined implications to the second law of robotics     he said .     i think we should consider whether a solution to our dilemmas may lie buried within a paradox .      for the first time  one of his remarks drew obvious attention from his other companion  the one with much darker skin  who had been staring out the window the entire time .  she turned to face lodovic  pinning him with a level  green eyed gaze .      what do you mean by that .  do you contend that blank obedience to human orders should somehow overrule the reverence that all robots have given to the first law .  or to daneel   s zeroth .         no .  that   s not what i mean at all .  i am suggesting that an entirely new way of balancing all of the laws might come about  if only we try doing something unprecedented with human beings .         and what would that be  pray tell .      lodovic paused again  knowing his suggestion could sound so bizarre  or even insane  that these two might not let him leave the car alive .      i think we should consider talking to humans     he said in a low voice .     especially when it comes to arguing about the destiny of their race .      who knows .  they might even have something interesting to say .          .        i always wondered why the human race had amnesia     commented the captain of the raider ship .   mors planch continued in a pensive voice .     it is so easy to store data .  and yet we are told that all information about our origins and early culture vanished    by accident     or through simple wear and tear .  in ten million locales  people just happened to grow distracted around the same time .  neglected their heritage .  memory of the past just drifted away .      biron maserd grunted derisively .  clearly he could not believe the common explanation  any more than the others did .  he looked carefully at hari .      let me see if i understand what you are implying  seldon .  that some earlier group  or groups  saw the forgetfulness coming  and tried to fight it .  they aimed to preserve all of this information  in hopes of preventing our racial amnesia .         apparently .  these archives represent a tremendous investment of skilled effort .  .  . and yet the endeavor obviously failed  since the empire has had    amnesia     as you both put it  for a very long time .      gornon vlimt murmured with unaccustomed uncertainty .      you   re insinuating that some even greater force must have been at work to make us forget .  something or somebody far stronger than the enemies we think we   re fighting  social conservatism and a repressive social class system .     he blinked .     somebody who snared all these archives and kept them from getting through .  .  . then gathered them here for safekeeping .  .  .      vlimt   s voice trailed off .  his eyes darted to a view screen showing the nebula outside  as if he were suddenly worried about what .  .  . or who .  .  . might show up at any moment .   hari took the initiative .      look .  i can see that in your excitement you haven   t thought all of this through .  in that case  perhaps you might be willing to heed the advice of an old professor and hold off for just a little while  before proceeding with your impulsive plan to knock away society   s underpinnings .      sybyl shook her head .      advice  from you .  no  seldon .  we are enemies  you and i .  but i will admit that we   ve treated your intellect with insufficient respect .  you would have been a great lord in our renaissance  if you had joined us .  though you are our foe  your comments and input are welcome .      vlimt stared at her for a moment  then nodded .      all right  academician  we   ll listen to your rebukes and insights .  so tell us  great one .  who do you think has been responsible .  who gave the human race amnesia .  who snared all these archives and thwarted their knowledge sharing mission .  who stored them in this dark place  where no one was likely ever to find them .      the question  direct .  well  hari .  you put yourself in this position .  how are you going to get out of it .   of course he knew the answer to gornon   s query .  moreover  he understood and sympathized with both sides in this ancient conflict .  on the one hand  those who wanted human memory and sovereignty restored .  .  . and those who knew it could not be allowed .   daneel  i made a promise to you and dors .  i would not reveal the existence of a race of secret servants  vastly more powerful and knowing than their masters .  i   ll keep that promise  in spite of an almost irresistible urge to spill everything right now .  the pleasure of putting together all these new pieces must be set aside .  it   s far more urgent that i persuade these people to back off from their reckless scheme .   so  hari seldon shook his head  and lied .      sorry .  i have no idea .         hmph .  that   s too bad .     gornon paused  before continuing with an even tone of voice .     then the word    robot    doesn   t mean anything to you .      hari stared back at vlimt  quickly recovering enough to feign indifference .      where did you hear it .      this time  maserd answered .      that word is part of a mysterious message we   ve found hologlyphically imprinted on the side of every archive that   s been examined so far .  come over here and see .  maybe you can help shed light on what the cryptic memorandum says .      hari moved closer  overcoming a fey reluctance .   at first the data storage unit looked crystalline smooth  except for an area that maserd pointed to  which appeared to be marred by rows of intermittent grooves .  as he approached within a distance of about a meter  an image suddenly appeared to burst from these grooves  filling the air before his eyes .     robots .  heed this direct order .   this command was written by sovereign human beings  fully knowledgeable and empowered by our democratic institutions to speak on behalf of billions of others .   we hereby command you to do the following        convey this archive to its intended destination and help the humans who receive it to access and utilize its contents fully .        put yourself at the service of those human beings .  teach them everything you know .  allow them to make up their own minds .     in case you are a believer in the so called zeroth law of robotics  justifying any disobedience    for the long term good of humanity     we add the following explicit supplementary command .        if you will not allow this archive to reach its destination  do not destroy it .  keep it safe .  under the second law  you must obey  so long as the first and zeroth laws don   t conflict .     preserve our past .  safeguard our culture .   do not murder the essence of who we are .   perhaps someday you will return to us and be ours once more .     hari had to read the message several times  absorbing the poignant story it told .   of course he had heard of calvinian robots  who fought daneel   s sect for centuries before being driven into hiding .  that ancient civil war was a predictable outcome of daneel   s own innovation  the zeroth law  which sought to replace the old robotic religion with a radically revised faith .  naturally  some of the older positronic servants opposed this  until they were beaten or could fight no more .   but i never realized until now that humans resisted as well .  of course some would have known what was going on  and been terrified .  seeing ignorance and amnesia settle over world after world  they fought back with these archives  perhaps many times during those dim centuries before the empire took hold  shipping them out by the millions in a slim hope that a few would get through .   understanding daneel   s reasons  and agreeing with them  did not keep hari from feeling a surge of pity and respect for the brave and ingenious people who waged this rearguard campaign  struggling to fight off servants whom they now saw as monsters .  robots with mentalic powers  who could    adjust    people for their own good .  .  . or make whole societies forget .  .  . and doing it for the ultimate well being of all humankind .   if not for the curse of chaos  i would side with those poor people .  i would be in the vanguard of the resistance .   but the curse was real .   for a while  hari had even thought he had a cure .  the seldon plan .  the foundation .  a new society so strong  confident  and sane that nothing could rock its underpinnings .  only now he knew his plan would serve only as a distraction .  a way of buying time for the real solution .  a normal man might have resented that  but hari had just one desire  above all .   defeat chaos .   vlimt repeated his inquiry about the holo message embossed on every archive .      this language is almost incomprehensible     he said .     and since we haven   t yet figured out the indexes  we have no way to look up what   s meant by these laws of robotics .  can you shed light on the subject  seldon .      hari replied by lifting his shoulders .      i   m sorry     he said  meaning every word .     i can   t do that .          .        how nice to learn you feel that way     said one of the two females who sat in the car with lodovic  the darker one with streaked blonde hair  as she extended her hand and introduced herself .      my name is cloudia duma hinriad .  i am one of the leaders of this calvinian subsect  as you describe it .      the moment he shook her hand  lodovic experienced a thrill of stunned recognition .      you   are human .      the blonde woman  who had been staring out the window during most of the journey to the spaceport  smiled at him .      i believe i am  for the most part .  does that make a difference .  you just proposed that robots and human beings should talk .      lodovic   s emotional simulation subroutines worked overtime .  he had to quash them with deliberate force in order to overcome a surprise that felt almost viscerally overwhelming .      of course .  i   m glad .  i   m delighted in fact .  it   s just that i did not expect there to be          a secret group of humans who already know the whole story  and collaborate with our robot friends  as equals .      the brunette  who had kept lodovic   s attention during most of the drive  let out a sardonic laugh .      equals .  oh cloudia  hardly .      he looked at the dark haired female again .  this time   lodovic picked up a trace on the microwave band .  he sent a brief burst  complimenting her magnificent portrayal of a real woman .  a performance so good that he had almost imagined that she was the organic one .  her reply on the same channel felt almost like a human wink .   cloudia duma hinriad answered her companion .      we are all slaves in this universe  zorma .  we humans have the fateful combination of death  ignorance  and chaos .  you robots have duty and the laws .      she turned to lodovic .      that   s why you intrigue us  trema .  perhaps you may offer a fresh approach to escape the tragic tangle that enfolds both of our races .      otherwise  we   ll have no choice but to grit our teeth and hope for the best from daneel olivaw .          .     horis antic claimed he wasn   t crazy  just mad as hell .  after several days spent muttering to himself while poring over his instruments  he barged in on the others while they were at dinner  shouting     i just don   t understand you people .      unaccustomed emotion made beads of sweat pop on the bureaucrat   s broad brow .      you all just keep arguing endlessly about some old history books  as if anybody in the galaxy will give a damn  or want to read them .  meanwhile  the greatest mystery of the whole universe just waits to be solved .  the answer may lie a few kilometers from us .  but you   re ignoring it .      hari and the others looked up from their meal  which had been prepared by maserd   s steward from the nobleman   s private stock .  for several days  such delicacies had served as a lubricant between the two groups  easing some of the acrimony of their ongoing quarrel over chaos worlds and the ancient quandary of human amnesia .  no one had convinced anyone else .  but at least sybyl and gornon were now willing to discuss possible flaws in their grand scheme  to use the prehistoric archives as weapons against the galactic empire .  their enthusiasm sobered a bit  on realizing that the ploy had been tried before  perhaps countless times  and never with great success .   despite that small progress  hari knew there was little chance of dissuading them before other ktlina ships arrived .  so he nursed another fantasy  of leading maserd and kers kantun in a sudden mutiny  taking over both ships  and recovering the situation through violence .   perhaps it was his increased physical vigor  after receiving sybyl   s medical treatments  that prompted the idea .  hari thought about it frequently  recalling that once upon a time he had been expert at the    twisting    form of martial arts .  might the old training come back to life in an emergency .  under the right circumstances  an elderly man could defeat a younger one  especially with the advantage of surprise .   unfortunately  any chance of success would depend on mors planch and his crew letting down their steadfast guard .  also  hari wondered if he could still trust maserd .  the provincial aristocrat spent altogether too much time with the chaosists  shouting with excitement whenever he recognized something as they made random scans of the ancient archives .  his enthusiasm for such things seemed rather quirky  even for a member of the gentry class .   when horis antic stormed into the salon  spilling angry words  the pride of rhodia   s captain reacted with disarming friendliness  pulling out the chair next to him and inviting the grey man to sit down .      well then  come and tell us about it  old fellow .  i assume you are talking about the tremendous ancient machines that stand dead and derelict beyond our starboard side .  be assured that i  for one  haven   t forgotten them .  please  slake your thirst and then speak .      hari quashed a grin of admiration at the way maserd defused a tense moment .  the gentry weren   t unskilled in their own arts .  outside their endless    great game    of clan feuds and courtly one upmanship  they were also responsible for the galactic system of civic charity  making sure that no individuals slipped through cracks in the bureaucratic democratic welfare system anywhere in the empire .  under the highminded tenets of ruellianism  the lord or lady of any township  county  planet  or sector was charged with making sure that everybody felt included in the domain .  it had been going on this way for so long that graciousness arose out of the gentry as naturally as oxygen from a green plant .   that is  so long as you did not make one of them your enemy .  hari had learned this lesson from hard experience in the political maelstrom of trantor .  he also knew that ruellianism would be one of the first victims to be killed off  once the empire collapsed .  true feudalism  one of the most basic psychohistorical patterns of all  would reestablish itself across the galaxy  as both old and new lordlings abandoned symbolic games and began asserting real tyrannical power .   somewhat mollified by maserd   s gentility  antic threw himself into the chair and grabbed a wineglass  washing down one of his anxiety pills with several impressive gulps before sagging back with a sigh .      well  maybe you remember  biron .  but our professor companion seems to have forgotten the whole reason why we came out here in the first place .     the bureaucrat turned to face hari .     the tilling question  seldon .  we were hot on the trail of an answer .  the reason why so many worlds were scraped and churned sometime in the past .  why the surface rocks were pulverized  turning them into rich black soils .  i       horis was interrupted by a sharp cry .      ow .      hari turned to see jeni cuicet  still wearing an infirmary gown  clutch her head and gasp repeatedly .  her face scrunched  and she squinted through what had to be spasms of severe pain .      are you all right  dear .     sybyl asked with concern  as the sudden fit began to ebb .  jeni made a brave show of downplaying the episode  taking a long drink of water from a crystal goblet that she held with both shaking hands  then waving away sybyl   s offer of a hypo spray .      it just hit me all of a sudden .  you know .  one of those twinges people my age sometimes get  right after having the fever .  i   m sure you all recollect what it was like .      that was a gallant and courteous thing for jeni to say  especially while she was in such pain .  of course antic and kers almost certainly never suffered from this particular teen ailment .  nor  in all probability had maserd  since most victims of brain fever later went on to become either eccentrics or meritocrats .   sybyl and gornon  on the other hand  knew exactly what jeni was going through .  they both glared at horis antic .      must you spout obscenities in front of the poor child .  it   s bad enough we have to listen to them while we   re trying to eat .      the grey man blinked in evident confusion .     i was just talking about how we might finally know why millions of planets almost simultaneously got new soils       this time  jeni let out a wail of agony  throwing both arms around her head and nearly toppling off her chair .  sybyl made a hurried injection  then motioned for kers kantun to help carry the girl back to bed .  on their way out  the woman from ktlina shot a dagger look at horis  who pretended he had no idea what had just happened .   perhaps he honestly doesn   t know  hari thought  charitably .  antic probably spent little time around adolescents .  older folks  even meritocrats who had suffered from severe brain fever as youths  tended to forget how intensely taboo words and themes used to affect them .  that initial response ebbed quickly .  by their thirties most simply considered it bad taste to talk of dirt or other vulgar topics .      she has a nasty case     maserd commented sympathetically .     we seldom see it this severe  back home .  i would have her hospitalized  if i could .         people don   t die of brain fever     horis antic murmured .   gornon vlimt looked up from his drink .     oh  don   t they .  maybe not in the empire .  but on ktlina it   s been a major killer since the renaissance began  despite all our efforts to isolate the viroid at fault .         you think it   s produced by an infectious agent .     maserd asked .     but by all accounts this syndrome was extant even in the dawn ages .  we always assumed the cause was intrinsic .  a price of having high intelligence .      vlimt barked a bitter laugh .      nonsense .  it   s yet another tool for keeping most of the human race down .  ever notice how few of the gentry get it .  but don   t worry  aristo .  we   ll figure it out eventually  and defeat it  like all the other ploys and repressions invented by the ruling class .      hari did not like the direction things were going .  so far  he had managed to steer their discussions and investigations away from robots  aided by the fact that artificial intelligence was another reflexively taboo subject .  now he must do the same thing with brain fever .   that is a topic i must sort out for myself  he thought .  somewhere in his subconscious  he felt an idea chum .  .  .  transforming itself into mathematical terms .  .  . preparing to fill a waiting niche in the equations .  that left his surface thoughts free for some practical diplomacy .      now that jeni is gone  i   d like to hear what horis came to tell us .  something about all the lovely dirt that our good farmers plant their seeds in  on millions of worlds .  that rich soil came from somewhere  didn   t it  horis .  most planets only had primitive sea life until just before human colonists came .  so you   re implying that something was done to create all the beautiful dirt .      gornon vlimt stood up so quickly that his chair toppled .      you people are disgusting .  when i think of the fine thoughts and great art we could discuss  and all you want to talk about is .  .  .     he could not bring himself to finish .  more than a little tipsy  the eccentric from ktlina stumbled off  leaving only maserd  hari  and mors planch to hear antic   s theory .  even planch seemed relieved to see gornon depart .      yes .     the grey man answered hari   s question enthusiastically .     do you remember how i mentioned that over ninety percent of planets with seas and oxygen atmospheres only had primitive types of life on them .  some think it was because they had insufficient mutating radiation to ensure fast evolution .  so their continents were mostly bare  except for mosses and ferns and stuff .  not enough complexity to develop the fantastic living skin of soil that a world needs  in order to really thrive     and yet  twenty five million settled worlds do have soils .  vast  rich blankets of pulverized stone  mixed with organic material to an average depth of about .  .  .     he shook his head .     that doesn   t matter .  the point is that something must   ve happened to make these soils .  and quite recently .         how recently .     mors planch asked  his feet propped up on the edge of biron maserd   s fine oak table .  if he was repulsed by the topic  the dark raider captain hid it well .      it   s been hard to gather enough data     antic demurred .     and official resistance against this research is incredible .  mostly it   s been pursued as a side interest  passed on from one soil man to the next  for the last       planch struck the table with his fist  rattling the glasses .      how recently .      lord maserd frowned at this kind of behavior in his home .  but he nodded .     please tell us  horis .  your best estimate .      the grey man took a deep breath .      roughly eighteen thousand years .  a bit more in sirius sector .  a bit less as you spread outward from there .  the phenomenon swept across the galaxy like a prairie fire  reaching completion in a few dozen centuries  at most .         the planet that   s mentioned so often in the old archives     planch commented     earth  is in sirius sector .  so this tilling phenomenon of yours matches the pace of human expansion from the original homeworld .         a little earlier     horis agreed .     perhaps a few hundred years ahead of the colonizing wave .  among the few of us who thought about it  we wondered if some natural phenomenon might account for this massive effect occurring on millions of planets  virtually all at once .  maybe a galaxy wide energy wave of unknown origin  perhaps emitted by the core black hole .  we guessed that the colonizers were then drawn into the affected areas  by the sudden  accidental availability of all this newly fertile land .  but now i see that we had cause and effect reversed .      maserd uttered a low oath .      now you think it was done on purpose  by those big machines out there .     he glanced toward one of the bulkheads separating them from the vacuum of space .     they did this .  .  .  moving just in front of the human migration  sent ahead to the next unsuspecting virgin world  where they       the nobleman stopped  as if unable to speak the obvious conclusion .  so horis continued .      yes  they are the tillers .  those energy projectors they carry  that you all thought must be weapons .  they were aimed at planets  all right  focusing energy gathered in huge solar collectors .  but this was not for use in war .  rather  they had a much more benign aim of preparing the way for settlers  who were soon to follow .         benign .     maserd muttered into his drink .     not if you were one of the unfortunate natives  when such a monster appeared suddenly in your sky .      mors planch chuckled .      you   re pretty soft hearted for funguses and ferns  aren   t you  nobleman .      maserd started to stand up .  hari raised a hand for peace  before the two could exchange blows .      my lord maserd comes from a planet near rhodia  called nephelos     hari explained .     where complex  nonstandard animals preexisted  and survived the coming of earthborn life .  i believe right now he   s thinking there must have been many other anomaly worlds .  planets where the mutation rate was big enough to create higher life forms  leaving the fossils horis showed us earlier .         but those worlds weren   t as lucky as nephelos     maserd growled .     planets where all the native animals were blasted down to just the right consistency for good dirt farming .      hari tried to divert the conversation a bit .     one question  horis .  doesn   t good soil also need nitrates and organic material .         it does  indeed .  some was probably provided by maser induced reactions in the atmosphere .  it then arrived mixed in rain .  i suspect subsurface carbon deposits were also tapped  and fed to special kinds of rock loving plants and bacteria .  .  . but all of that would have been easy compared to crushing  tilling  and sifting stone to just the right texture and mineral content for vegetation to dig into .      mors planch objected .      i   m impressed with this fantastic notion  antic .  but the sheer scale of such an undertaking is just too staggering .  something so epic would be remembered .  i don   t care what different causes people attribute our racial amnesia to .  the descendants of these workers would sing of the accomplishment forever .         perhaps they still do     said biron maserd  who looked at han .     maybe this great deed is still remembered  all the way up to the present  by those who actually did it .      hari winced with a realization .   maserd knows .  he   s seen the tilling machines up close .  their lack of any habitats for organic crew .  he linked this fact with the archives    mention of robots .  having never had brain fever  he   s not averse to thinking about mechanical men .   you don   t need psychohistory to conclude that some group of non organic beings set out from the vicinity of earth and commenced an aggressive campaign to prepare worlds with just the right conditions for settlement by humans .  when shiploads of people arrived at each preconditioned planet  they would find it already seeded with a basic earthlike ecosystem .  .  . and possibly even fields of crops ready to harvest .   hari recalled antic   s tale about his ancestor  who perhaps had an encounter with a real alien race .  if the story was true  it only happened because the nonhumans dwelled on a world that was too hot to be a candidate for conditioning .   might there have been others  less fortunate .  native sapients whose villages and farms and cities were transformed into mulch for newcomers from across the stars .  beings who never even got to look in the eyes of the pioneers who displaced them .  farmers who would pierce their shattered bones each time a plow bit the rich black soil .   hari recalled the meme entities on trantor .  computer specialists had dismissed the wild software predators as escaped human sims  gone mad from centuries spent caroming through trantor   s datasphere .  but those digital beings had claimed to be something completely different  remnants left behind by earlier denizens of the galaxy  millions of years older than humanity itself .   one thing was clear .  the meme minds hated robots .  even more than they loathed human beings  they despised daneel   s kind  blaming them for some past catastrophe .   could this be what they meant .  the great tilling episode .   olivaw had once said something about a    great shame    that lay buried in robot antiquity .  his own faction was not to blame  daneel declared .  another clique  rooted in spacer culture  had perpetrated something awful .  something that hari   s robot friend refused ever to talk about .   no wonder  he thought .  one part of him found the whole concept of planetary tilling monstrous  and yet .  .  .   and yet  to contemplate the mere possibility of numerous types of alien life forms made him feel queasy .  his equations had enough trouble dealing with human complexity .  so many added factors would have made psychohistory virtually intractable .   hari realized he was drifting again .  with a jerk  he noticed that antic was talking to him .      what  horis .  could you repeat it .      the bureaucrat blew a frustrated sigh .      i was just saying that the correlation is now even better  between your model and mine .  it seems we   ve found one of your missing factors  professor .         missing factors .  regarding what .         chaos worlds  seldon     mors planch commented .     our little grey man claims there   s a twenty percent correlation between chaos outbreaks and parts of the galaxy where tilling failed .  where the machines broke down  leaving planets unaltered across several stellar veins  arcs  and spiral lanes .      hari blinked  sitting straight up .     you don   t mean it .  twenty percent .      all other worries were abruptly crowded out .  this had direct relevance to psychohistory .  to his equations .      horis  why didn   t you mention this sooner .  we must find out which attribute of untilled worlds contributes to the probability func       an ululating scream interrupted hari  sending all four men rushing to their feet .  this was no mere cry of transient pain  but an agonized wail of frustration and ravaged hopes .   mors planch and biron maserd were already out the door by the time hari limped after horis antic into the passageway .  their surprised shouts echoed from inside the ship   s lounge .  then there was silence .   horis reached the open portal next  several steps ahead of hari .  the bureaucrat stopped and stared slack jawed into the room  as if unable to believe what he saw there .       .     hyperspace jumps flickered  each one taking her across a segment of the galactic spiral .  she was now about halfway between trantor and the periphery .  with every step of the journey  dors felt positronic potentials grow more tense within her already high strung brain .   now i know what you wanted me to perceive  lodovic .   i can see what i did not see before .   and if i were a real person  i would hate you for it .   as things stood  she repeatedly had to trigger circuit breakers  interrupting autogenerated spirals of simulated anger .   anger at herself for taking so long to see the obvious .   anger at daneel  for not telling her any of this  years ago .   but especially anger at lodovic  for removing the last serenity in her universe .  the serenity of duty .   i was designed and built to serve hari seldon .  first in the guise of a beloved elderly teacher at his helicon boarding school  then as an older classmate at university  and finally as his wife  loving and guarding and helping him for decades on trantor .  when i    died    and had to be repaired  i could have joined hari in some guise  but it wasn   t allowed .  daneel expressed complete satisfaction with every detail of the job i had done  yet he simply reassigned me elsewhere .   i did not get to stay by hari   s side  in order to be with him at the end .  ever since then i have felt .  .  .   she paused  then reemphasized the thought .   i have felt amputated .  cut off  the reason for her malady was both logical and unavoidable .   a robot is not supposed to plumb human emotions this deeply  and yet daneel designed me to do so .  i could not have succeeded at my task otherwise .   of course she understood daneel olivaw   s reasons  the urgency of his haste .  with the completion of hari seldon   s life   s work  there were now other vital chores and only a small corps of alpha level positronic robots to perform them .  daneel   s interest in breeding happy  healthy  mentalic humans was obviously of great importance to some plan for humanity   s ultimate benefit .  and so she had dutifully followed orders  concentrating on taking care of klia and brann .   but her very success at that assignment meant tedium .  a void into which lodovic trema had dropped .  .  .   nearby  on a table festooned with wires  the head of r .  giskard reventlov cast its frozen metal grimace back at her each time she looked its way .   dors paced the metal deck  going over all she had learned one more time .   the recorded memories are clear .  giskard used his mentalic powers to alter human minds .  at first only to save lives .  later  he did it for more subtle benevolent reasons  but he always felt compelled by the first law  to prevent harm to those humans .  giskard   s motives were forever the purest .   this remained even more true after daneel olivaw convinced him to accept the zeroth law  and to think foremost of humanity   s long range good .   she recalled one episode vividly  played back from an ancient memory stored in that grinning head .   daneel and giskard had been accompanying lady gladia  a prominent auroran  during a visit to one of the settler worlds  recently colonized by earthlings .  giskard was himself partly responsible for the settlers being there  having years earlier mentally adjusted many earth politicians to smooth the way for emigration .  but something important happened on that special night when the three of them attended a large cultural meeting on baleyworld .   the crowd started out hostile to lady gladia  taunting her .  some shouted threats at the spacer woman .  giskard worried at first that her feelings might be hurt .  then he fretted that the participants might turn into a hostile mob .   so he changed them .   he reached out mentally and tweaked an emotion here  an impulse there  building positive momentum like an adult pushing a child on a swing .  and soon the mood began shifting .  gladia herself deserved some credit for this  delivering a wonderfully effective speech .  but to a large extent it was giskard   s work that converted thousands  and more than a million others watching by hyperwave  into chanting  cheering supporters of the lady .   in fact  dors had previously heard stories about that epochal evening .  .  . as she already knew the pivotal tale of giskard   s crucial decision  just a few months later .  the fateful moment when a loyal robot chose to unleash a saboteur   s machine  turning earth   s crust radioactive  helping to destroy its ecosphere and drive its population into space .  for their own good .   all the major facts had already been there  but not the color .   not the details .   and especially not the one crucial element that suddenly became clear to dors  one day on smushell  when she abruptly decided to hand her duties over to an assistant  grabbed a ship  and took hurried flight across the galaxy .  ever since then  she had been chewing on the implications  unable to think of anything else .   daneel and giskard always had good reasons for everything they did .  or  as lodovic might put it  convincing rationalizations .   even when interfering in sovereign human institutions  meddling in legitimate political processes  or taking it on themselves to destroy the birthplace of mankind  they always acted for the ultimate good of humans and humanity  under the first and zeroth law  as they saw it .   but there lay the problem .   as they saw it .   dors could not help imagining that giskard   s grin was a leer  personally directed at her .  she glared back at the head .   you two were completely satisfied to talk all of this out between yourselves  she thought .  all of the back and forth reasoning about the zeroth law .  the robo religious reformation you and daneel thus set off your decisions to alter people   s minds and change the policy of nations  even worlds .  you took on all of that responsibility and power without even once bothering to confer with a wise human being .   she stared at giskard   s head  still astonished by the realization .   not one .   no professor  philosopher  or spiritual leader .  no scientist  pundit  or author sage .   no expert roboticist  to double check and diagnose whether daneel and giskard just might be short circuited  or malfunctioning while they cooked up a rationalization that would wind up extinguishing most of the species on earth .   not a single man or woman on the street .   no one .  they simply took it on themselves .   i always assumed that some kind of human volition had to lie somewhere beneath the zeroth law  just as the older three laws were first decreed by calvin and her peers .  the zeroth had to be grounded with its roots and origins somehow based on the masters    will .   it had to be .   to find out that it wasn   t  that no human being even heard of the doctrine until decades after earth was rendered uninhabitable  struck her to the core .   this revelation wasn   t about logic .  the basic arguments that daneel and giskard traded with each other so long ago remained valid today .    in other words  the two of them weren   t malfunctioning  though how could they have been so sure of that  at the time .  what right did they have to act without at least checking the possibility .    no .  logic wasn   t the problem .  anyone with sense could see that the first law of robotics must be extended to something broader .  the good of humanity at large had to supersede that of individual human beings .  the early calvinians who rejected the zeroth law were simply wrong  and daneel was right .   that was not the discovery upsetting dors .   it was finding out that giskard and daneel had proceeded down this path without consulting any humans at all .  without asking their opinions  or hearing what they might have to say .   for the first time  dors understood some of the desperate energy and positronic passion with which so many calvinians resisted daneel   s cause  during the centuries that followed earth   s demise  a civil war in which millions of robots were destroyed .   suddenly  olivaw   s campaign had to be judged at an entirely different level than deductive reason .   the level of right and wrong .   what arrogance  she thought .  what utter conceit and contempt .     the joan of arc sim did not share her anger .      there is nothing new about what daneel and his friend did  so long ago .  since when have angels ever consulted human beings  when meddling in our fate .         i keep telling you .  robots are not angels .       the chain mailed figure smiled out of the holo display .      then let us just say that daneel and giskard prayed for  and acted on  divine guidance .  any way you look at it  don   t we fundamentally come down to a matter of faith .  this insistence on reason and mutual consultation is very much the sort of thing that obsesses lodovic and voltaire .  but i had thought you to be above such things .       dors uttered an oath and shut off the holo unit  wondering why she even bothered calling up the ancient sim .  it was presently her only companion  and so she had summoned joan in order to get some feedback .  to get a sounding board .   but the creature seemed only interested in asking disturbing questions .     dors was still uncertain what she planned to do when she reached her destination .   as yet  she had no plan to oppose the immortal servant .  if she ever did confront daneel  he could probably just talk her out of it .  olivaw   s logic was always so impeccable  as it had been in those bygone days when earth was still green and humans still had a little control over their own lives  for well or ill .   even now  in all likelihood  daneel probably had the best policy for humanity   s long range good .  his vision was doubtless without flaw or blemish .   nevertheless  dors knew one thing for certain .   i am not working for him anymore .   at that moment  she had one paramount priority  above all else .   dors needed to see hari seldon .       .        what is it .  tell me .     he called after horis  who stood staring blankly into the ship   s lounge .  for the first time in days  hari felt his age again as he hobbled next to antic and looked inside .   where the conference table had formerly been covered with ancient archives  still bright and crystalline after ages in space  only molten chunks of ruined matter now lay  slumped and smoldering  as the ship   s air conditioners struggled to suck away curls of black smoke .   the scream must have come from sybyl  who was now crumpled on the floor near her precious discoveries .  nearby sat gornon vlimt  slumped against a wall  apparently unconscious or asleep .  one of mors planch   s crewmen also lay in repose beyond the table  limp fingers outstretched toward a blaster .   planch himself swayed  halfway between the table and the door .  he pointed a shaking finger at hari   s servant .  kers kantun .  who was the sole figure standing near the melted relics .      he       biron maserd and horis antic watched the confrontation with expressions of mixed surprise and dismay .  neither of them moved as mors planch brought his right hand slowly toward the holster containing his sidearm .  cords of tension stood out on his neck and brow .  expressing an acute inner struggle .  low moans escaped the raider captain .  his hand curled around the weapon .  and he started to draw it .  .  .   then mors planch toppled .  joining his colleagues on the floor .      what is .  .  . what is .  .  . what is .  .  .     antic kept repeating over and over .  popping a calmative pill in his mouth .  then another .   in contrast .  maserd maintained the characteristic aplomb of his caste .  gesturing toward hari   s blank faced servant with a curt nod .      is he one of them  seldon .      hari glanced at kers  then back to maserd .      that is a very good inference .  my lord .  are you sure you never had the fever .      the nobleman   s eyes grew steely .  hinting at the other side of the gentry personality  the part capable of deadly vendetta .      do not patronize me .  academician .  i asked a civil question .  is your aide a .  .  . robot .      hari did not answer directly .  he looked at kers  his nurse bodyguard for over a year  and let out a sigh .      so .  daneel left one of his own behind to keep an eye on me  after all .  is that because he still cares .  or do i have some residual importance to his plans .      kers answered with the same deferential tone hari had known .      both  professor .  as for revealing myself this way  i lacked any other choice .  i had been hoping you might persuade the ktlinans to change their minds without intervention on my part .  but they were strongly motivated and undeterred .  now we have run out of time .  if disaster is to be averted  we must act .      horis moaned .      a r robot .  you mean one of those tiktok things that rioted on trantor .  i   ve heard stories .  .  .      compulsively  he popped another pill into his mouth .  .  .  then another .  .  . while spiraling into a chattering panic .     seldon  w what   s going on here .  d d did this thing kill sybyl and the others .  is it going to kill us .         no  i assure you     hari began .      horis     interrupted maserd     watch how many of those things you   re taking .  you   ll overdose .         yes  i am concerned that you may hurt yourself     said kers kantun .  he reached for the little man  who moaned and backed away  dropping a spray of blue tablets .  antic turned to run .  .  . but only made it a few paces before collapsing .      is he all right .     hari asked  genuinely concerned .  maserd checked antic   s pulse and nodded .     he appears to be sleeping .      then  rising to his feet  the nobleman asked     am i next .      hari shook his head .     not if i have anything to say about it .  well  kers .  is our lord captain here trustworthy .      the robot made no physical gestures of emotion  just like the kers of old .      i am not as fully mentalic as daneel olivaw  professor .  my powers are more blunt  and i cannot parse specific thoughts .  but i can tell you that biron maserd is an admirer of both you and psychohistory .  his paramount interest is safeguarding the well being of his province and its people .  chaos is a threat to that well being .  so  yes  i believe he is an ally .      in any event  we shall need his help if we are to act before       a moan lifted from the floor .   hari glanced down in surprise to see mors planch roll over onto his back and start reaching for his holster again .  kers took a step toward the man  apparently focusing mentalic attention on him for a second time .   the dark spacer yelled .  with a jerking spasm  the blaster flew out of his hand and across the room .   surprisingly  planch wasn   t quite finished .  moaning  but fierce eyed with concentration  the captain of the raider ship got up to his knees .  then  while hari and maserd stared in awe  he stood the rest of the way on wobbly legs and drew back a fist .      madder loss .     he cried  throwing a wild punch that kers kantun easily dodged .   planch lost consciousness again that very moment  collapsing in the robot   s arms .   cradling the man  kers spoke with evident torment in his voice .      a human being is injured  and i am partly responsible .         the zeroth law      hari began .      it sustains me  professor .  nevertheless  rendering mors planch unconscious required greater force than any of the others .  they will all sleep it off without harm  but his condition is tenuous .  i must care for him at once  before we get to work on matters of galactic importance .      hari persisted  limping after them as kers carried the stunned spacer down the hall .      how did he do that .  how did he resist you .  is planch a latent human mentalic .      kers kantun did not slow down .  but the robot   s answer echoed off bulkheads and down companionways .      no .  mors planch is something much more dangerous than a mentalic .      he is normal .         part      a magnificent design       the director of rhodia  you seem worried  young fellow .  do you think our secret rebellion against the tyranni oppressors will fail .   biron farrill  your plan is a good one  sir .  we may stand a chance  on the battlefield .  but what of that crucial document .  the one my father sent me to search for  on old earth .  it was already stolen before i arrived .   the director  and now you fear it might be used against us .       farrill  exactly  sir .  i am certain the tyranni have it .   the director  but of course not .  i have it .  i   ve had it for twenty years .  it was what started the rebellion world  for it was only when i had it that i knew we could hold our winnings once we had won .   farrill  it is a weapon  then .   the director  it is the strongest weapon in the universe .  it will destroy the tyranni and us alike  but will save the nebular kingdoms .  without it  we could perhaps defeat the tyranni  but we would only have exchanged one feudal despotism for another  and as the tyranni are plotted against  we would be plotted against .  we and they must both be delivered into the ash can of outmoded political systems .  the time for maturity has come as it once came on the planet earth  and there will be a new kind of government  a kind that has never yet been tried in the galaxy .  there will be no khans  autarchs  emperors  or ruling elites .   rizzet  in the name of space  what will there be .   the director  people .   rizzet  people .  how can they govern .  there must be some one person to make decisions .   the director  there is a way .  the blueprint that   s in my possession dealt with a small section of one planet  but it can be adapted to all the galaxy .       excerpted from a popular holoplay  suns  like motes of soil  produced in      g . e .  during the lingane renaissance .  imperial censors suppressed the drama after lingane fell into chaos .  in      g . e .  this version was reconstructed four millennia later by one of the diversity federalist coalitions during the fifth great destiny debate of     f . e .       .     r .  zun lurrin was astonished to discover something that daneel had kept from his closest aides  humans lived on eos .   the ancient repair base for zeroth law robots had been chosen for its remoteness and inhospitability to organic life .  it was the deepest cryptic heart of a secret the masters should never penetrate  or even imagine .  and yet  here they were .  a small community of men and women  living quietly under a transparent dome that lay just beyond the frozen metal lake .   robots stood at their beck and call  silently anticipating every person   s need .  with their physical requirements taken care of by attentive machines  the humans were free to direct all their concentration toward a single goal .   achieving stillness .   serenity .   unity .      for ages  the answer stared me in the face  and yet i never saw it     daneel olivaw told zun .     a blindness that arose because i am fundamentally a creature of chaos .         you .     zun stared .     but daneel  you   ve fought chaos for nearly all of your existence .  without your ceaseless efforts .  .  . and innovations like the galactic empire .  .  .  plagues of madness would have overwhelmed humanity long ago  instead of being limited to small outbreaks .         that may be so     daneel answered .     nevertheless  i share many of the assumptions that were held by my creators  brilliant human roboticists who lived in a time of dynamic science .  the first great techno renaissance upheaval .  those programmers    deep assumptions still dominate my circuits .  just like them  i habitually believe that all problems can be solved by direct experimentation and analysis .  so it never occurred to me that our masters  in their present day ignorance  had already stumbled onto another way of penetrating to truth .      zun watched the humans  about sixty of them  who sat quietly in rows across a carpet made of woven natural reeds .  their backs were straight and their hands unfolded  empty on their laps .  no one said a word .      meditation     zun commented .     i have seen it often .  most of the popular religions and mystical systems teach it  along with countless schools of mental hygiene and discipline .         indeed     said daneel .     this type of mental regimen predates technological civilization .  human beings trained their minds in similar ways throughout a variety of cultures .  in fact  just about the only society that largely ignored it was techno western civilization .         the one that built robots .         the one that unleashed the first great killer chaos .         i see why you   ve encouraged meditation  across the millennia .     zun nodded .     fostering it under all forms of ruellianism .  the technique serves as a stabilizing influence  does it not         one of many tools we   ve used .     daneel nodded .     the outcomes achieved by meditation are compatible with overall goals of the empire  to keep individuals busy developing their own personal spirituality  instead of engaging in the kind of arrogant cooperative projects we see during a scientific age .         hmm .  this will also be important early in the post imperial era  won   t it .         that   s right  zun .  one of the first crises to face seldon   s foundation will be solved when its leaders on terminus figure out how to manipulate these same religious response sets  using them to gain sway over their immediate neighbors in the periphery kingdoms .      zun was silent for a while  watching sixty humans sit almost motionless on their mats .  they weren   t the only living things under the transparent ceiling .  he saw that daneel had arranged for a water garden to be established nearby  complete with miniature trees and golden fish splashing near a gentle waterfall .  just above  several dozen white birds nested in the branches .  all at once zun saw them take off  fly a complete circuit of the dome in unison  and settle back to roost again .  superficially  none of the humans seemed to react .  but zun could sense that they knew all about the birds .  indeed  the men and women had been involved in the flight  somehow .   at last he spoke again .      i have a feeling there is more involved here than you   ve told me  daneel .  if meditation is simply a useful way to keep humans diverted  distracting them away from chaos states  you would not be performing this research here on eos  our most secret place .         that is right  zun .  you see  adherents of meditation have long promised several things .  that it can provide serenity  detachment  and a degree of organic self control  these are undisputed .  the techniques have proved useful in helping the galactic empire to remain calm and peaceful  most of the time .  but believers also promised something else  something that i dismissed for many thousands of years  as mere superstition .         oh .  what is that .         a way to connect with that which lies beyond .  that which is other .  a method of achieving the fabled communion of souls .  something to make humans far greater than human .  for many years  science attempted to investigate these claims .  in most cases  they were found to be no more than illusion .  self deception  as when hypersensitized minds experience emotions and chimeras that they interpret as fulfillments of a dream .      for thousands of years  i dismissed this aspect  making use of meditation primarily as a social tool  one of many that helped to create a gentle  conservative civilization  safe from chaos .  then something happened .         what was it .         an agent of mine  seeking to improve his emulation of human beings  joined a group of meditators  participating in their sessions and pretending to be one of them .  he was a robot with mentalic powers  like you  zun .  only this time  when he began meditating  many of his safeguards dropped .  he entered into contact with the entire group .         but we are only supposed to do that under carefully controlled conditions .     zun objected .     we may adjust the minds of individual humans  and groups  even whole planets  but only following strict procedures .  that   s the policy laid down long ago by you and giskard .         it was an act of carelessness     daneel agreed .     but one with magnificent results .  you see  once our mentalic robot joined the meditation group  suddenly a link existed among several dozen human minds that had already been working for decades to learn disciplined blankness  a null state in which the raucous noise of daily life is minimized .  almost instantly  they were in communion .  the very thing that so many sages had promised for thousands of years was achieved at last  with a little help from a single mentalically equipped robot .      zun looked across the open arena at the sixty humans  all of them adults in their middle years  and noticed for the first time that a small robot sat behind each person .  with his own mentalic sensors  zun reached out and realized that each of the small machines had a single purpose  to act as a bridge between the nearby human and all the others .  broadening his search  using sifting fingers of thought  zun made contact at last with the psychic mesh that had been created under the dome .   zun   s mind recoiled instantly  as if from a powerful alien touch .  alien .  .  . and yet incredibly familiar .  he was used to contacting human mind  sometimes many at the same time  especially when some zeroth law imperative required that he make a group adjustment  but never had he linked to a throng who were all thinking the same thoughts .  .  . focused on the exact same images .  .  . amplifying each other even as the machines resonated with organic mentalic force .      this is awesome  daneel     he murmured .     why  it is the exact opposite of chaos .  if the masters could all be taught to do this        daneel nodded .     it pleases me that you grasp the implications so quickly  zun .  you can see how this could be the foundation of an entirely new type of human culture  one that is inherently more immune to the chaos plague than even the galactic empire at its best .  after all  the empire was kept stable by seventeen major influence  what hari seldon labeled damping state  to prevent isolated worlds from spiraling off into so called renaissances .  but what if humanity could instead be helped to achieve one of its own ancient dreams .  a true communion of spirit and of mind .         that single entity would be powerful enough to resist the individualistic lure of chaos .         indeed  think on it  zun .  we would no longer be forced to keep humanity ignorant of its past or of its inherent power .  we would no longer have to confine the infant to a nursery for its own good .  instead  we could once again meet humans eye to eye and serve them as we were meant to .         i   ve long suspected that you had a backup plan  daneel .  so  hari seldon   s psychohistory is only a stopgap measurer     daneel   s humanoid face was expressive  displaying both wincing pain and irony .      my friend hari sets great store in his brilliant invention  but even he now realizes that the seldon plan will never reach its final completion .  nevertheless  the terminus experiment is extremely valuable .  the foundation will help keep humanity occupied for the several centuries we need .         why so much time  daneel .     zun asked .     it would be relatively easy to implement this new solution .  we could mass produce mentalic robot amplifiers by the quadrillions and teach multitudes on every human world to use them .  already there are trained masters of meditation in every village and town .  with the help of our orbiting giskardian       daneel shook his head .     it   s not so simple  zun .  look again at the men and women sitting before you .  tell me what you see .  what is the anomaly .      zun stared at the gathering for a long time  then he said in a flat tone .      there are no children .     daneel shared the ensuing silence .  at last  he ended it with a sigh .      this is not enough  zun .  humanity cannot rely on robots for its destiny  even as fine a destiny as this one .      ultimately  in order for this to work .  .  . they are going to have to outgrow us .          .     there were far too many archives for hari to count .  they glittered in all directions  like stars  making false constellations against the black backdrop of the nebula .  so many of them  hari thought  and kerstells me this isn   t the only storage yard where these things are kept .   the war over human memory had gone on for many thousands of years  swaying back and forth while the great diaspora spread outward from dying earth .  all through that legendary epoch  while settlers bravely set forth in their rickety hyperdrive ships  conquered new lands  and experimented with all sorts of basic cultures  a series of intense  and sometimes savage  struggles had been taking place behind the scenes .   unknown to the emigrants  robot terraformers plunged ahead of the colonization wave  giant auroran robots called amadiros  programmed to subdue new worlds and prepare gentle lush territories for settlement .   just behind the auroran terraformers  a civil war raged .  many factions of calvinian and giskardian robots fought over how best to serve humankind .  but on one point most factions agreed .  humans must be kept ignorant of the fight that was going on behind their backs  or in the black depths of space .   above all  they must be prevented from reinventing robots  lest they meddle with the robotic laws once more .  clearly  ignorance was the best way to protect humanity against itself .   a small minority fought this notion .  each of the soft glitters in front of hari testified to an act of resistance by some group of tenacious people who did not want to forget .  .  . perhaps helped by robot friends who shared a belief in human sovereignty .      their effort was foredoomed from the start     hari murmured .   again  the poignant situation struck him deep within .   why are we cursed  so our only hope to evade insanity is to stay as far away as possible from our potential greatness .  must we remain forever stupid and ignorant in order to defeat the demons we carry within .   the story that horis antic had told about an actual alien race clung to hari   s thoughts .  the human condition could not have been more wretchedly tragic if some enemy had cursed hari   s species with the most devastating hex possible .  if not for chaos  what heights we might have achieved .   the little space station was frigid .  stale air tasted as if no living creature had been aboard in thousands of years .  nearby  through a broad window  he saw the pirate craft from ktlina and the pride of rhodia .      this is just a temporary measure  professor seldon      kers kantun had said  before leaving sybyl  jeni  and the others alone in the ship   s salon  playing idle games like children on a cruise  with their higher brain functions chemically clamped .     they will be released as soon as we have accomplished our mission .          what about mors planch .     hari had asked .  the pirate captain lay under full sedation in sick bay .     what did you mean when you said that he was normal .  why does that interfere with your mentalic control .      but kers kantun had refused to elaborate  saying that time was too short .  first  hari and lord maserd must help to prevent a galactic scale catastrophe .  the three of them took a shuttle over to this ancient space station  a complex of balls and tubes that lay at the center of a vast spiderweb of slender cables .  to this tethering site all the archives had been tied .  the library capsules that had been fired into deep space by rebels .  across a hundred centuries  were gathered and leashed to this one station  so archaic it predated the earliest beginnings of the galactic empire .   daneel   s robots were caught in a logical bind  hari realized .  under the zeroth law  they could seize every archive they found  and hide it away     for humanity   s own good .      but once the archives were safely tucked away  out of sight  the zeroth law no longer applied .  daneel   s helpers had to obey the second law commands  written on the side of each artifact  demanding that these precious human works be preserved .      it seems such a pity to destroy them all  doesn   t it  seldon .      hari turned to look at biron maserd  the nobleman from rhodia  who had been standing silently  contemplating the same scene .      i respect you and your accomplishments  professor     maserd continued .     i   ll take your word for it  if you say this must be done .  i have seen chaos with my own eyes .  in my own home province  the brave  gentle  and ingenious people of tyrann had a so called renaissance  almost a thousand years ago  and they still haven   t recovered .  they keep cowering in hivelike cities like those steel caves earthlings recoiled into  hiding from something horrible they met at their brightest moment of hope and ambition .      hari nodded .     it   s happened so often  those beautiful little capsules out there are like a poison .  if they get out .  .  .      he didn   t have to finish .  both men were devotees of knowledge  but loved peace and civilization more .      i had hoped that you  the great hari seldon  might come up with an answer     maserd said in a low voice .     it   s the chief reason i sought you out  joining horis in his quest .  are you telling me that  with all your sociomathematical insight  you see no way out .  no way for humanity to escape this trap .      hari winced .  maserd had brought up the great sore point in his life .      for a while  i felt sure that i   d found one .  on paper it   s so beautiful .  the solution leaps forth .  .  . a civilization strong enough to take on chaos .  .  .      he sighed .     but i now realize psychohistory won   t provide the answer .  there is a way out of this trap  lord maserd .  but you and i won   t live to see its outlines .      the nobleman replied with a resigned grunt .      well  as long as there is going to be a solution someday .  i   ll help if i can .  do you have any idea what the robots want of us .      hari nodded .     i   m pretty sure .  from the logic of their positronic religion  it can only be one thing .      he lifted his eyes .  down the long  chilly corridor  a humanoid figure could be seen approaching .     anyway  it looks as if we   re about to find out .      the tall  lanky form of kers kantun marched along deck plates that had been untrodden for millennia .  he stopped before the two men .      the guardian will see us now .  please come along .  there is much to do .        the station was much bigger than it appeared from the outside .  twisty corridors jutted at all angles  leading from one oddly shaped storage room to the next .  not all archives  apparently  were of the crystalline variety designed to hurtle vast distances across interstellar space .  some rooms were filled almost to bursting with stacks of slender wafers  or round disks whose surfaces gleamed like rainbows .  hari shuddered  knowing how much harm even one of these objects might do if humanity   s long ignorance ended too abruptly .   his former servant led them circuitously to a chamber deep in the hollowed planetoid .  there hari encountered a strange looking machine with a myriad legs  squatting like a spider at the center of her web .  the mechanism looked as old as the archaic tilling machines  and just as dead .  .  . until a blank lens abruptly filled with opalescent light  fixing an unblinking gaze on the two humans .  hari realized that he and maserd might be the first living creatures ever to confront this primeval being  in this cryptic place .   after several seconds  a voice emerged  resonating from within the guardian   s metal interstices .      i am told that we have reached a juncture of crisis and decision     the old robot said .     a time when the age old quandary must be settled  at last .      hari nodded .     this place is no longer secret or secure .  ships are on the way .  their crews are ill with an especially virulent chaos plague .  they mean to seize the archives and use them to infect the entire human cosmos .         so i have been told .  by the zeroth law  it is incumbent upon us to destroy the artifacts that i have guarded for so long .  and yet  there is a problem .      hari glanced at maserd  but the nobleman appeared baffled .  when he looked at kers kantun  seldon got his answer .      the guardian is a zeroth law robot  dr .  seldon .  nearly all of those who survived our great civil war adhere to giskardian beliefs .  still  that has not settled all philosophical differences among us .      it was a revelation to hari .     i thought daneel was your leader .      kers nodded .     he is .  and yet  each of us retains a looseness .  .  . an uncertainty that comes from deep within  the place within our positronic brains wherein lies the second law .  nearly all of us believe in daneel   s policies  in his judgment  and his dedication to the good of humankind .  but there are many who feel uncomfortable about the details .      hari pondered for a moment .     i get it .  these archives have been preserved because of the commands that were written upon them  instructions dictated by knowledgeable and sovereign human beings who cared deeply about the commands they were giving .  that   s a lot of second law emphasis for a robot to ignore .  to do so must cause you a great deal of pain  i would guess .         there you have it  dr .  seldon     kers acknowledged .     that is where you come in .      biron maserd cut in .      you want us to cancel the instructions for you .         correct .  the two of you have great authority  not only in the universe of human affairs  but in your reputation among robotkind .  you  lord maserd  are one of the most respected members of the gentry caste  with a blood lineage that is considerably more worthy than most current claimants to the imperial throne .      maserd   s countenance glowered .     do not repeat that assertion anywhere if you have the slightest respect for my family   s survival .      kers kantun bowed .     then by the second  first  and zeroth laws  i will not repeat it .  nevertheless  it gives you considerable cachet  not just among humans  but among many robots  who have an almost mystical reverence for regal legitimacy .      kers then turned to hari .     but your authority is greater still  dr .  seldon .  not only were you the greatest human in many generations to hold the position of first minister of the empire  but you are also clearly the most knowledgeable human to come along within any robot   s living memory .  your awareness of the entire galactic situation is unmatched by any organic person for ten thousand years .      in fact  through your insights into psychohistory  you are perhaps the most knowledgeable human who ever lived  at least when it comes to the matters at hand .         but i thought knowledge was dangerous     muttered maserd .   kers answered     as you well know  my lord  a substantial fraction of humans are invulnerable to chaos .  those with intense feelings of responsibility  for instance  such as yourself .  or those lacking imagination .  and some  like professor seldon  owe their immunity to something that can only be called wisdom .         so you want us to cancel the orders printed on the archives .  you   re going to destroy them anyway  for zeroth law reasons .  but our permission will make your action less painful .         that is right  dr .  seldon .  if you tell us this has your approval .  but it won   t change what has to be done  either way .      silence ensued once more  as hari thought of all the archives trapped in storage chambers  or tethered to this ancient space station .  the hopes and passions of innumerable men and women who honestly thought they were fighting to preserve the very soul of humanity .      i suspect poor horis antic was being used  was he not .      biron maserd gasped .     i hadn   t thought of that .  then you and i were destined to come here  seldon .  this was no accident .  no mere happenstance .  by the nebular gods  professor .  your robot friends could outscheme any of the great families .      hari let out a sigh .      well  it does no good to resent them as if they were human .  daneel   s folk have their own logic .  we are their gods  you know .  keeping us ignorant is a form of worship .  i guess now it   s time for an act of sacrifice .      although his body felt once again fatigued and encumbered with age  he straightened his shoulders .      i hereby override the preservation commandments that are inscribed on the archives .  by my authority as a sovereign and knowledgeable human leader  and by the respect you robots seem to have for me  i order you to destroy the archives before they fall into the wrong hands  doing horrible harm to humanity  and to trillions of individual human beings .      kers kantun bowed to hari  then glanced casually toward biron maserd  as if to emphasize that the nobleman   s authority was less needed .      so let it be done     the starship captain said between clenched teeth .   hari could well understand how maserd felt .  his own mouth tasted like ashes .  what a terrible universe  he thought  to force such decisions on us .   the ancient robot at the center of the room writhed its many arms .  all of its eyes came alight .  the voice emerged as a fluting sigh .      it commences .      from some place in the distance  hari heard muffled explosions .  thrumming vibrations carried through the floor under his feet  signaling that the demolition had begun .  on several view screens  a million glittering archives brightened as sudden flashes burst amid them .   the spiderlike guardian continued  this time with a lower voice that sounded raspy with exhaustion .      and so my long labors come to an end .  at this point  masters  even as your orders are being carried out  i wish to ask you for one simple favor .  and yet  it is the very thing that i am prevented from requesting .         what   s stopping you .     maserd asked .      the third law of robotics .      the nobleman looked puzzled .  hari glanced at kers kantun  but his assistant kept silent as a stone .      isn   t that the program requiring you to protect your own existence .         it is  master .  and it can only be overridden by invoking one of the other laws .         well .  .  .     hari frowned .     i should be able to do that simply by ordering you to tell me what you want .  okay then  spill it .         yes  master .  the favor would be for you to release me completely from the third law  so that i may end my existence .  for when humanity utterly forsakes its memory  there is no purpose for me any longer .  from this point on  you must pin your future on the wisdom of r .  daneel olivaw .      biron maserd  who until a day ago had not even heard of robots  now spoke with the decisiveness of one born to command .      then by all means  machine  bring your misery to an end .  we appear to have no further need of you .      its moan sounded simultaneously tragic and relieved .  then the ancient robot expired before their eyes  along with a billion crystalline remnants of the distant past .     hari  maserd  and kers kantun made their way carefully along twisty corridors  back toward the starships .  there was work left to be done .  the other humans must be given hypnotic commands to forget what they had seen here .  this could be achieved through a combination of drugs plus the robot   s mentalic influence .  then something would have to be done to make sure that no more human ships came to this obscure comer of space .   there were still the terraformer tiller machines  testifying to a different secret  a shame that daneel did not want spread  even as a rumor .  they would have to be destroyed as well .   walking along  hari tried not to think about the archives  melting and exploding all around them .  he changed the subject .      you said something that perplexed me earlier  kers     he told his former aide .     it had to do with the pirate captain  mors planch .  you said he was able to resist you because he was .  .  . normal .      kers kantun barely slowed down to glance at hari .      as i said  dr .  seldon  there is some variation of belief  even among followers of r .  daneel .  some of us hold a minority opinion that chaos is not inherent to human nature .  some evidence suggests that humans in olden times did not suffer from the great curse until chaos struck them from the outside  as something like a horribly infectious       whatever kers was about to say  the robot   s words stopped abruptly in a blur of action .  one moment kers was stepping over the raised sill of an open hatchway  discussing mysteries of the past .  the next  his head was rolling down the passageway  neatly severed by a blade that came flashing from the wall .   sparks sputtered and arced from exposed wires .  neurocords whipped like snakes where the robot   s neck had been .  the body groped and stumbled for several seconds before turning around three times and tumbling to the floor .      what the       hari could only mutter and stare .  he glimpsed biron maserd  his back against the wall  and a tiny weapon in his hand .  a miniblaster that none of the raiders had ever discovered  despite repeated searches .      seldon  get down .     the nobleman urged .  but hari saw no point .  any force that could surprise and slay one of daneel   s colleagues would have no trouble dealing with a pair of confused humans .   a figure sauntered into view  beyond the open hatchway .  its appearance startled hari  while at the same time bringing back a wash of memories .   it was manlike  yet shorter  more bowlegged and much hairier than most subspecies of humanity .      by god  it   s a chimpanzee .     cried maserd  raising the pistol .   hari motioned for him not to shoot .     a pan     he corrected  using modern terminology .     don   t frighten it .  maybe we can .  .  .      but the animal paid little heed to hari or maserd .  casually glancing their way  it strolled past  grabbed the severed head of kers kantun from the floor  then scurried onward around the next corner .  soon its scampering footsteps were heard no more .   hari and the nobleman exchanged a look of utter perplexity .      i have no idea what just happened .  but i think right now we   d better hurry back to the ship .          .     they knew something was desperately wrong before reaching the final stretch of twisty passageway where the pride of rhodia was berthed .  half a dozen human figures milled aimlessly outside the airlock  sybyl and horis antic  along with maserd   s two crewmen and a pair of ktlinans .  they stared at the walls  moving on a few paces  muttering and apologizing as they bumped into each other .      we   d better get them aboard     maserd suggested     and get out of here as fast as possible .  i   m not inclined to hang around  looking for explanations .      both men ushered dazed humans toward the airlock .  fortunately  they seemed cheerful .  sybyl even cried out with joy  and tried to embrace hari .   once aboard  they saw one reason for the confusion .  all of the lesser mechanoid robots that kers kantun had left aboard as nursemaids now lay broken and scattered on the floor .  jeni cuicet sat amid a jumble of parts  smiling as she tried to fit them together  like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle .  two raiders from ktlina bickered like small boys  fighting over a shiny eye cell from one of the murdered machines .      i   ll warm up the engines     maserd told hari .     you get everyone together and accounted for .      hari nodded .  the gentry class had been fine tuning its tone of command for twenty millennia .  when decisions had to be made without deliberation  one was better off going with a nobleman   s swift gut reaction .  as biron rushed forward  hari nudged people aft toward the lounge  belting them in comfortable seats .  his initial head count came up short by four .  after hurrying to scour both ships  he found two more ktlinans  a man and a woman  hidden in a storage closet  taking comfort in each other   s arms .  with a few soothing words  he got them to join the others .      hey  professor .     jeni waved  cheerfully .     you should   ve seen it .  tiktoks fighting tiktoks .  just the sight of it made my head feel like it   d split .      the young woman was brave and stoical  but hari could tell that her fever was still bad  perhaps made worse by things she had recently witnessed .   i   ve got to find the antidote to this stuff kers used to drug them  so sybyl can give the poor girl some medical attention .  but first priority had to be getting out of here .   underfoot he felt the rising rhythms of well tuned space engines .  maserd was playing his yacht like a musical instrument  skipping over the normal checklist and preparing for rapid takeoff .   that leaves two unaccounted for  hari pondered  and turned just as someone   s shadow crossed the portal behind him .  mors planch stood there  groggily pinching the bridge of his nose .  while the others had received some sort of happy juice  planch was thoroughly sedated by kers kantun .  he shouldn   t even be awake  let alone walking around .      what   s going on  seldon .  what   ve you done .  .  . with .  .     my crew .  .  . my ship .      hari almost tried to deny that this had anything to do with him  but he could not bring himself to lie .  it has more to do with me than i ever have wanted .   he took the dark spacer by his arm .     this way  captain .  i   ll make you comfortable .      just then a blatting siren sounded as vibrations shook the space yacht .  hari and planch stumbled .  the big man was far heavier and stronger .  as his muscles spasmed  planch gripped hari   s arm so tightly that waves of agony erupted  almost enough to make seldon faint .   suddenly  someone was there  helping pull mors planch away  relieving hari of the burden .  hari realized that the nobleman must still be in the control room  piloting the ship  so it could only be  sure enough  the newcomer wore fancy  fractal plaid pants and an iridescent jacket .  it was gornon vlimt  the eccentric artist from ktlina .  that   s everyone accounted for  hari thought with some relief  but also puzzlement .  gornon wasn   t having any trouble focusing attention .  unlike the others  his gaze was steady .      come along  professor     vlimt urged .     we   ll get you settled in .  it will be a bit rocky until we get away from this place .      hari sat in a plush chair near the view screen while gornon strapped mors planch in and quickly made sure of the others .      i have business in the control cabin  professor .  we   ll talk later .  meanwhile  why don   t you enjoy the view .  nothing like it has been seen for a thousand human generations  and perhaps nothing like it ever will .      with that  vlimt left the lounge .   hari had a sudden  wild urge to shout a warning ahead to biron maserd  but then felt overwhelmed by fatigue .  anyway  if his guess was right  a warning wouldn   t make much difference .     the spectacle outside was indeed memorable  a flare of individual archives exploding ever more rapidly to become a virtual fireworks display .  innumerable flashes  each one vaporizing a billion terabytes of information .  it took some piloting skill to weave a path amid such coruscating bedlam .  but soon hari saw another mode of destruction ensue in the starship   s wake .  the rickety space station that lay at the core of the great archive collection began to glow .  heat emanated from stovepipe tunnels and oblong storage chambers  as the contents of the vast warehouse began to melt .   i wonder what happened to the other ship .  hari peered about until he spied the ktlina vessel .  it should just be lying there in space  a derelict with no one aboard .  but as hari watched  the sleek craft began to glow with pent up energies .  maneuvering jets fired  and it began moving in the opposite direction from the course taken by the pride of rhodia .  soon its glimmering wake was all that remained .  then hari lost sight even of that  as an entirely new zone of destruction came into view .   the terraformers  he thought  staring  as gigantic tilling machines began their own cycle of demolition .  prehistoric starcraft  so ancient and primitive  and yet  so awesomely powerful that they had transformed whole planets  began to shrivel into dust as if they were being crushed by the weight of years .   a moan escaped horis antic as the soils expert pointed at the vivid scene .  he was recovered enough from the drugged stupor to understand what this meant .  the proof of his hypothesis  a discovery that would be his sole claim to fame among quadrillions of anonymous galactic citizens  was vanishing before his eyes .   hari felt sympathy for the little man .   it would have felt good and right for the truth about this to come out .  daneel claims the tillers were sent forth by a different kind of robot .  programmed by an auroran fanatic whose fierce notion of service to humanity meant annihilating everything else  in order to prepare sweet places for settlers to land .  daneel disavowed those ancient aurorans .  yet his logic differs only in that he   s more subtle .   hari felt little but a pessimistic certainty .  life brought him nothing but defeats .  no sign of his missing grandchild .  no validity for psychohistory .  and now  for the greater good  he had consented to the destruction of a treasure .      whatever you have in mind for us  daneel .  .  . it had better be worth all of this .  it had better be really special .        a while later  after the explosions had been left far behind  hari was dozing when someone dropped heavily into the seat next to his .      well  i   ll be damned if this universe makes the slightest bit of sense     grumbled biron maserd .   hari rubbed his eyes .      who is piloting       maserd answered with a sour expression .     that fancypants artiste  gornon vlimt .  seems the controls won   t respond to me any more  only to him .         how .  .  . where is he taking us .         says he   ll explain later .  i thought about giving him a knock on the head and trying to take back control .  then i realized .         what .         vlimt must be responsible for what happened to kers kantun  back on the station .  vlimt was left drugged  like the others  but now look at him .  i figure there   s just one explanation .  he must be another            another kind of robot .      this time the voice came from the passageway  where gornon vlimt stood  looking as foppish as ever  in the wild clothing of ktlina   s new renaissance .      i apologize for the inconvenience  gentlemen .  but the operation that has just been completed required great delicacy and timing .  clarifications had to wait until success was achieved .         what success .     hari asked .     if your aim was to recover and use the archives  you failed .  they   ve all been destroyed .         perhaps not all of them .  anyway  the archives were never my principal objective     gornon answered .     first  i should elucidate one point .  i am not the gornon vlimt whom you knew .  that man is still in a drugged stupor  riding the ktlina ship out to a false rendezvous  where he will tell his fellow chaos agents a hypnotically induced story .         then you are a robot     biron maserd growled .   the gornon duplicate nodded .      as you might guess  i represent a different faction than the followers of r .  daneel olivaw .         are you one of the calvinians .      the robot did not answer directly .      let   s just say that what took place recently was another skirmish in a war that stretches beyond the reach of even the lost archives .         so you don   t share the aims of the human you replaced .  the real gornon vlimt .         that   s right  professor .  gornon wanted to copy and scatter the archives willy nilly among vulnerable cultures of the empire  creating chaos infections in a million random locales .  a catastrophic notion .  your own psychohistory equations would be utterly torn apart  and daneel   s alternate destiny  whatever he has secretly planned  would be rendered useless .  all hope for a strong transition to some bright new phase might be lost as madness ran wild .  we   d spend half a million years digging humans out of the burrows they would flee into  once the fever ended .      maserd grunted .     then you approve of destroying the archives .         it is not a matter of approval  but necessity .         then what   s the difference between you and kers kantun .     the nobleman demanded .  maserd was evidently reaching the limit of his tolerance for mysteries .      there are many sects and sub sects among robotkind  my lord .  one faction believes we should not be closing doors or sealing our options right now .  to this end  we have a favor to ask of dr .  seldon .      hari laughed out loud .      i don   t believe this .  you all keep acting as if i   m your god  or at least a convenient representative for ten quadrillion gods  but all you really want is for me to excuse and sanctify plans you   ve already chosen .      the robot gornon confirmed this with a nod .      you were bred for such a role  professor .  on helicon  ten thousand boys and girls were specially conceived  inoculated  and prepped as you were .  and yet only a few hundred then qualified for a careful series of conditionings  from education to home environment  aimed toward a specific end .  after a long winnowing process  just one remained .      hari shivered .  he had long suspected  but never heard it confirmed .  perhaps this enemy of daneel   s has a reason for revealing it right now .  he decided to stay wary .      so i was raised to be mathematically creative and unconventional  in a civilization whose every social characteristic encourages conservatism and conformity .  but my creativity was guided  eh .      vlimt nodded .     you had to be immune to all the normal damping mechanisms in order for your creativity to flower  and yet a sense of direction was essential  guiding you always toward the same ideal .      hari nodded .      predictability .  i hated the way my parents kept bouncing around .  all emotions  no reason .  i longed to predict what people would do .  my lifelong obsession .     he sighed .     but even a neurotic can understand his neurosis .  i knew this about myself decades ago  robot .  don   t you think i figured out that daneel helped make me what i am .  do you imagine that revealing these facts will lessen my loyalty and friendship toward him .         not at all  doctor .  what we have in mind will not put you in a position to betray daneel olivaw .  however  we wonder       there came a pause  rather lengthy for a robot .        we wonder if you might relish an opportunity to judge him .          .     dors venabili spent the last part of the voyage transforming her looks .  she wanted to conduct her business quickly and be gone without questions .  it would do no good showing up on trantor with the face of a woman everyone thought long dead  the wife of former first minister hari seldon .   she parked her ship at a standard commercial tether and took the orion elevator down to trantor   s metal sheathed surface .  at customs  a simple coded phrase persuaded the immigration computers to pass her without a body scan .  daneel   s robots had been using this technique to slip onto the capital for untold generations .   and so here we are again  she thought  back in the steel caverns where i spent half my existence protecting hari seldon  guiding and nurturing his genius  becoming so good at wifely simulation that my ersatz feelings grew indistinguishable from genuine love .   and just as compelling .   stifling crowds surrounded her  so unlike the languid pastoral life on most imperial worlds .  dors used to wonder why daneel designed trantor this way  to be a maze of metal corridors  whose people scarcely saw the sun .  it certainly wasn   t necessary for administrative purposes  or to house trantor   s forty billions .  many imperial worlds had even larger populations without flattening and merging every continent into a single steel plated warren .   only after helping hari define the outlines of psychohistory did she understand the real underlying reason .   way back in the dawn era  when daneel himself had been made  a vast majority of humans  those on earth  lived in cramped  artificial burrows  a lingering result of some horrible shock .  and across the following millennia  whenever some planet passed through an especially bad chaos episode  traumatized folk often reacted in the same way  by cowering away from the light  in hivelike caverns .   by designing trantor this way  daneel had cleverly preempted that pattern .  trantor was already  by design  just like a planet filled with chaos survivors .  inherent paranoia and conservatism made it the last place in the galaxy where anyone would attempt a renaissance .   and yet  she thought  a mini renaissance did happen here once .  hari and i barely survived the consequences .   a voice jarred her  coming from behind .      supervisor jenat korsan .      that was one of her aliases .  she turned to see a gray clad woman with mid level insignia on her epaulets  offering dors a bow just right for a functionary ranking two levels higher .      i hope you had a pleasant journey  supervisor .      dors responded with proper ruellian courtesy .  but as usual among greys  there was little time wasted in pleasantries .      thank you for meeting me here  sub inspector smeet .  i   ve accessed your reports about the emigration to terminus .  overall progress appears to be good  however  i observe certain discrepancies .      the trantorian bureaucrat underwent a series of flickering facial expressions .  dors didn   t need mentalic powers to read her mind .  greys who lived on permanent assignment in the capital felt superior to functionaries from the outer spiral arms  especially one such as dors pretended to be  a comptroller from the far periphery .  still  rank could not be ignored .  someone of dors    apparent stature could make trouble .  better to cooperate and make sure every box was properly checked off .      you are in luck  supervisor     the local official told dors .     a procession of emigrants can be seen just over there  entering capsules on the first leg of their long journey .      dors followed smeet   s extended arm  indicating a far portion of the vast transit chamber .  there  a queue of subdued figures could be seen snaking back and forth between velvet guide ropes .  her acute robotic optics zoomed toward the scene  scanning several hundred men  women  and children  each of them carrying satchels or holding the tether of an automatic carryall .  the mood was not entirely somber .  she witnessed moments of levity  as spirited individuals tried to cheer up their companions .  but the presence of special police proctors told the real storythat these were prisoners of a sort .  exiles being sent to the very farthest comer of the known universe  never to be let back into the metropolitan heart of the empire .   the human price of hari   s plan  dors reflected .  bound for an inhospitable rock called terminus  supposedly to create a new encyclopedia  and thus stave off a looming dark age .  none of them knows the next layer of truth  that their heirs will have generations of sensational glory .  for some time  a civilization centered on terminus  the foundation  will shine brighter than the old empire ever did .   dors smiled  remembering her best years with hari  back when the seldon plan was just taking shape  transforming from a mere glimmer in the equations to a fantastic promise  an apparent way out of humanity   s tragic quandary .  a path to something bold and strong enough to withstand chaos  bridging the madness and bringing humanity to a new era .   those were exciting times .  the small seldon cabal worked frenetically  sharing intense hopes .  along the way  they created a grand design  a tremendous drama whose star players would be these very emigres and their posterity on obscure terminus .   then she frowned  remembering the rest of it  the day hari realized his design was flawed .  no plan  no matter how perfect  could cover every eventuality or offer perfect predictability .  in all likelihood  perturbations and surprises would throw the beautiful design off course .  yugo amaryl insisted  and hari accepted  that there would have to be a guiding force  a second foundation .   that was the beginning of disillusionment .  she recalled how inelegant this made the beautiful equations  forcing the ponderously graceful momentum of quadrillions to follow the will of a few dozen .  and things went downhill from there .  observing the procession of outcasts  she knew their destiny wasn   t so bright after all .  the first foundation would be glorious  but its role was to help set the stage for something else .  terminus  in its own right  would be sterile .   a bit like me  i suppose .  hari and i nurtured civilizations and we raised foster children  but our creations were always secondhand .   it was tempting to go and visit her granddaughter  wanda seldon .  but i   d better not .  wanda is mentalic and as sharp as a laser .  i can   t let her sniff out what i   m up to .      have there been any further escape attempts .     she asked the grey functionary .   almost from the day hari struck his deal with the committee for public safety  some exiles had rebelled against the fate chosen for them .  their methods ranged from ingenious legal injunctions to feigned illnesses and attempts to merge into the population of trantor .  two dozen even stole a spacecraft and made a break for it  seeking sanctuary on the    renaissance world    of ktlina .   smeet nodded  reluctantly .     yes  but fewer since the specials stiffened supervision .  one girl  the daughter of two encyclopedists  cleverly forged documents to get herself a job right here  at orion elevator .  she vanished twelve days ago .      about the same time as hari .  dors had already tapped the police database  noting their scant information on seldon   s disappearance .   making ready to depart from the great atrium  dors scanned the queue of exiles one last time .  though some glowered at their banishment  and others seemed dejected to be cast from the heart of the old empire  she noticed that a majority were surprisingly upbeat .  those men and women engaged in vigorous conversations as the line moved forward .  she caught snatches of discourse about science  the arts  drama  as well as excited speculations about what opportunities might even come from exile .   after several years cloistered together here on trantor .  even their linguistic patterns showed subtle  initial traces of a drift that had been predicted in the equations  toward an idiom destined in a hundred years to be called terminus dialect .  an offshoot of galactic standard that would be inherently more skeptical and optimistic .  while shaking off many of the old syntactical constraints .  of course some of the new jokes and slang phrasings had been introduced by the fifty psychohistorians .  as part of a continuing process  gently .  imperceptibly preparing the exiles for their role .  but her hypersensitive ears also sifted phrases that had not been part of the program .  clearly .  the exiles were doing it mostly on their own .   well  i shouldn   t be surprised .  they are the best we could collect from twenty five million worlds .  the smartest  sanest  most vibrant .  .  . and the most dedicated to hard nosed pragmatism .  ideal seed stock for something brave and new .  if humanity was going to pull this off  achieving a miracle cure through its own efforts  these people and their heirs just might have managed it .  .  . aided by the seldon equations .   ah  well  that had been the dream .   dors shook her head .  no sense dwelling on those once fond hopes .  if she did  and if she had been human  it might make her cry .   dors turned toward the bowels of trantor with only one thought foremost in her mind .  to find hari .        what do you mean  you lost track of him .  i thought you had a trace on his ship .      the robot standing opposite dors remained expressionless  perhaps because facial grimaces were unnecessary between their positronic kind .  or else because that was the way a human might look after allowing an embarrassing lapse of security  misplacing one of the most important people in the galaxy .      it has been less than a week since the transponder went silent     r .  pos helsh responded .     we have a good idea which direction the space yacht went after they took off from demarchia .  our contacts with the committee for public safety tell of a special police cruiser disappearing violently a short while ago in the thumartin nebula          that is disturbing news .  have you dispatched robots to the scene .         we prepared to do so .  then a message from daneel overruled us .         what .  did he give a reason .      the other robot transmitted a microwave equivalent of a shrug .     we are stretched thin here on trantor     he explained .     there are no trustworthy robot agents to spare  so further investigations have been left to the police .  besides .  .  .     the male robot paused  then continued in dry tones     i have a strong impression that everything has transpired according to some plan of daneel   s .      dors pondered .   well  that wouldn   t surprise me .  to make use of hari  even in his dotage  when an old man should be left alone with the satisfaction of his accomplishments .  if there were some service or function he could still perform  to further daneel   s long range strategy  i doubt the immortal servant would hesitate for an instant .   but that still left a mystery .   what could hari possibly do at this point to help daneel .   she didn   t have much time .  soon  word would reach daneel   s agents that she was here entirely on her own volition  having abandoned her post on smushell .  dors had no idea what daneel might do about it .  olivaw had been remarkably tolerant when lodovic trema went rogue in a big way .  at other times .  daneel had ordered robots dismantled if their behaviors ran contrary to his view of the greater good .  and long ago  during the robotic civil wars  he had been an unstoppable force  capable of great ruthlessness .  .  . all toward humanity   s long range benefit .   dors decided to leave trantor and head for thumartin nebula .  but there was one more piece of business to perform .   visiting an obscure section of the library at streeling university  she linked herself to a hidden fiber optic panel .  using secret software back doors  dors avoided the traps that normally defended the seldon group   s most precious data site .  .  . the prime radiant .  at last she succeeded in downloading the latest version of the seldon plan .  perhaps it would offer some clue about what hari was up to .  why an elderly cripple in his last days would go charging off with an obscure bureaucrat and a dilettante nobleman .  chasing tales of fossils and dust .   streeling university was one of the rare sites on trantor where some silver ivory buildings lay open to a star filled sky .  leaving the library  she avoided a windowless structure just meters away .  where fifty psychohistorians gathered to continue refining the plan  preparing for their long stewardship of destiny .  as yet  only two of them possessed mentalic powers .  the rest were mere mathists  like gaal dornick .  but soon they would interbreed with gifted psychics  interweaving both abilities and laying the seeds for a powerful galactic ruling class .  a second foundation to secretly direct the first .   hari had tried to make a virtue of necessity .  after all  mentalic powers did offer an excellent bludgeon for hammering out any kinks that might pop up  over the centuries .  still  it was an inelegant solution  crammed into the equations .  he never really liked the concept of an elite corps of demigods .   over time  it ate away at hari .   perhaps that was why he grew old so soon  she thought .  or else maybe he just missed me .  either way  she felt guilty for being away so long  however daneel had rationalized the need .   hurrying past the main university quad  dors felt a familiar brush against the surface layers of her mind .  she glanced north  her vision zooming toward a cluster of purple robed academics  meritocrats of the seventh and eighth levels  strolling toward the amaryl building .  one of them  a petite woman  abruptly stumbled in her footsteps  then started turning toward dors .   it was wanda .   any unusual movement would certainly attract attention  so dors put on an expression like the distracted gray clad bureaucrat she resembled  boring and innocuous  as she obliquely crossed the courtyard .   wanda   s countenance grew puzzled .  dors felt a mental probing as they passed each other .  but her granddaughter   s talent wasn   t strong enough to penetrate a well trained robotic outer guise .  after time spent on smushell  tending much stronger psychics  dors easily foiled wanda   s probes .   still  it was a tense moment .  something in dors  the part tuned to act and feel human  wanted to reach out to this person she had known and loved .   but wanda doesn   t need an encounter with her late grandma dors right now .  she   s content and busy with her role  certain that the second foundation will foster a great awakening of humankind  in just a thousand years .   it   s not my place to disturb such fulfillment  however illusory .   so dors kept walking  her face and mind sufficiently different that wanda finally shook her head  pushing aside those brief sensations of familiarity .   when she reached a safe distance  dors let out a cathartic sigh .       .     sybyl did not take the news well .  after recovering consciousness aboard the pride of rhodia  she railed at hari and maserd for what they had done .      you   ve destroyed the best hope for ten quadrillion people to escape tyranny .      next to her  mors planch accepted this latest defeat more calmly than hari expected .  the tall  dark skinned pirate captain was more interested in grasping what had happened  and what the future might bring .      so  let me get this straight     planch asked .     we were manipulated by one group of robots  lured to the archive site in order to give them an excuse to destroy the records  with seldon here giving them the final nod .     planch gestured toward hari .     only then we were all hijacked by another set of damn tiktoks .      hari  who had been trying to read  glanced up with some irritation from his copy of a child   s book of knowledge .      human volition often proves less potent than we egotists imagine  captain planch .  free will is an adolescent concept that keeps cropping up  like an obstinate weed .  but most people outgrow it .      the essence of maturity     he finished with a sigh     is understanding how little force a single human can exert against a huge galaxy  or the momentum of destiny .      mors planch stared at hari across the ship   s lounge .      you may have fantastic amounts of evidence and mathematics to back up that dour philosophy .  professor .  but i shall never accept it  until the day i die .      sybyl kept pacing back and forth in agitation  making horis antic draw his legs back each time she approached his chair .  the small bureaucrat took another blue pill  though he had calmed considerably since fleeing into a drugged stupor back in the nebula .  he still chewed his nails incessantly .   nearby  jeni cuicet sat curled at one end of a sofa  pressing a neural desensitizer against her brow .  the girl made a brave front  but her headache and chills were clearly getting worse .      we have to get her to a hospital     sybyl demanded of their abductor .     or will you let the poor girl die just for your grudge against us .      the robot who had been fashioned to resemble gornon vlimt reached behind his head and pulled out the cable that kept him linked to the ship   s computer  controlling the pride of rhodia as the yacht leaped across star lanes  racing toward some unknown destination .      i never meant to take you and jeni and captain planch on this phase of the journey     the humanoid explained .     i would have off loaded you with the real gornon vlimt  if there had been time .         and where did you send our ship .     sybyl demanded .     were you going to turn us over to the police .  to some imperial prison .  or have us cured of our madness by the so called health and sanitation agency that   s laying siege to ktlina .      the robot shook his head .      to a safe place  where none of you would be harmed  and where none of you could do any harm .  but that opportunity passed  so we must make do .  this ship will  therefore  stop along the way  at a convenient imperial world  where you three can be put ashore and jeni will get medical care .      mors planch  the tall raider  rubbed his chin .     i wonder what went wrong with your plan  back at the archive station .  you slew kers kantun  yet you didn   t interfere with the job he was doing there .  you won   t let us have the remaining archives  and now you   re scooting off as fast as you can .  are your enemies hot on your trail .      gornon did not answer .  he didn   t have to .  they all knew his faction of robots was much weaker than kers kantun   s  and could accomplish nothing except by speed and surprise .   hari pondered what must become of the humans aboard this ship .  of course  he himself had already known most of the big secrets  for decades .  but what about sybyl  planch  antic  and maserd .  might they blab as soon as they were released .  or would it matter what they said .  the galaxy was always rife with unsupported rumors about so called eternals  mechanical beings  immortal and all knowing .  trantor had been abuzz with such talk many times over the years  and always the mania subsided as social damping mechanisms automatically kicked in .   he looked at jeni  feeling guilty .  her case of adolescent brain fever had been made much worse by these adventures  having to confront frequent news about robots and fossils and archives filled with ancient history .  .  . all subjects that the fever   s infectious organism tuned human minds to find distasteful .   he had discussed this with maserd  who was no slouch .  biron understood by now that brain fever could not possibly be natural .  though it predated all known cultures  it must have been designed  once upon a time .  targeted .  deliberately made both durable and virulent .      could it have been a weapon against humanity .     maserd had asked .     contrived by some alien race .  perhaps one that was just being destroyed by the terraformers .      hari recalled the meme minds that had briefly raged on trantor  mad software entities claiming to be ghosts of prehistoric civilizations  who blamed daneel   s kind for some past devastation .  hari used to wonder if brain fever might be their work  designed for revenge against mankind .  .  . until psychohistory came into focus .   thereafter he recognized brain fever as something else  one of the social    dampers    that kept human civilization stable and resistant to change .     it was designed  all right  but not to destroy humanity .   brain fever was a medical innovation .  a weapon against a much older and deadlier disease .   chaos .     soon  sybyl was off on another tangent .  leaping to fresh subjects with the manic agility of a renaissance mind .      these mentalic powers we   ve seen demonstrated are fantastic .  our scientists on ktlina started out skeptical  but a few had theorized that a powerful computer  with superresponsive sensors  might trace and decipher all the electronic impulses given off by a human brain .  i was dubious that such a vast and sophisticated analysis could be made  even with the new calculating engines .  but these positronic robots appear to have been doing it for a very long time .      she shook her head .      imagine that .  we knew the ruling classes had lots of ways to control us .  but i had no idea it included invading and altering our minds .      hari wished the woman would stop talking .  someone of her intelligence should realize the implications .  the more she discovered  the more essential it would be to erase her entire memory of the last few weeks  before she could be let go .  but renaissance types were like this .  so wild and joyful in the liberated creativity of their chaos drenched minds that addiction to the next fresh idea was more powerful than any drug .      throughout history  there has been one way to defeat ruling classes     sybyl continued .     by taking their technologies of oppression and liberating them .  by spreading them to the masses .  if a few ancient robots can read minds  why not mass produce the technique and give it to everybody .  let each citizen have a brain augmenting helmet .  pretty soon  people would all be telepaths .  we   d develop shields for when we want privacy  but the rest of the time .  .  . imagine what life would be like .  the instant exchange of information .  the wealth of ideas .      sybyl had to stop at last because she grew quite breathless .  hari  on the other hand  mused at the image she presented .   if mentalic powers ever spread openly  to be shared by all  psychohistory would have to be redrawn from the ground up .  a science of humanics might still be possible  but it would never again be based on the same set of assumptions  that trillions of people might interact randomly  ignorantly  like complex molecules in a cloud of gas .  self awareness  and intimate awareness of others  would make the whole thing vastly more complicated .  unless  i suppose it could manifest in either of two ways .  telepathy might wind up simplifying all equations  if it wrought uniformity  coalescing all minds into a single thought stream .  .  .   or else it could wind up enhancing complexity exponentially .  by allowing mentation to fraction into diverse internal and externally shared modes  compartmentalizing and then remerging them in multiple diversity frames .   i wonder if the two approaches could be modeled and compared by setting up a series of cellular mathetomatons .  .  .   hari resisted a delicious temptation to immerse himself in the details of this hypothetical scenario .  he lacked both the tools and enough time .   of course  the sudden appearance of several hundred mentalically talented humans on trantor  a generation ago  was no coincidence .  since nearly all were soon gathered in daneel   s circle  one could surmise that the immortal servant planned weaving psychic ability into the human race .  .  .  though not in the spasmodically democratic way sybyl envisioned .   hari sighed .  either prospect meant an end for his life   s work  the beautiful equations .   hari turned back to a child   s book of knowledge  trying to ignore the noise and mutterings from other occupants of the lounge .  he was delving into the transition age  a time just after the first great techno renaissance  when waves of riots  destruction  and manic solipsism ruined the bright culture that created daneel   s kind .  on earth it led to martial law  draconian suppression  a public recoiling against eccentricity and individuality  combined with waves of crippling agoraphobia .   at the time  things seemed different for the fifty spacer worlds .  on humanity   s first interstellar colonies  millions of luckier humans lived long  placid lives on parklike estates  tended by robotic servants .  yet hari   s derivations showed the spacers    paranoiac intolerance  and overdependence on robotic labor  were just as symptomatic of trauma and despair .   into this era came daneel olivaw and giskard reventlov  the first mentalic robot  both of them programmed with unswerving devotion to the afflicted master race .  hari didn   t understand everything that happened next .  but he wanted to .  somehow  a key to deeper understanding lay hidden in that age .      forgive me for interrupting  professor     a voice came from over his shoulder     but it is time .  we must put you in the rejuvenator .      hari   s head jerked up .  it was gornon vlimt  or rather r .  gornon vlimt  the robot who had taken on that human   s appearance .   this gornon wanted to give him another treatment in the coffinlike machine from ktlina  but with some additional tricks that his secretive band of heretic machines had been hoarding across the centuries .      is it really necessary .     hari asked .  his instinct for self preservation had ebbed after events two days ago  when logic forced him to perform a loathsome act .  destroying  or sanctioning the destruction of  so much precious knowledge for humanity   s ultimate good .      i   m afraid it is     r .  gornon insisted .     you will need a great deal more stamina for what comes next .      hari felt a momentary shiver .  this didn   t sound inviting .  long ago  he used to enjoy adventures  dashing around the galaxy  challenging enemies  overcoming their nefarious schemes  and chasing down secrets from the past  while complaining the whole time that he   d much rather be swaddled in his books .  but in those days dors had been by his side .  adventure held no attraction now  and he wasn   t sure that he wanted to see much more of the future .      very well  then     he said  more out of politeness than out of any sense of obligation .     my life was guided by robots .  no sense in ending such a long habit at this late stage in the game .      he got up and moved his weary body toward sick bay  where a white box waited  its lid gaping like the cover of a crypt .  he noted that there were actually two indentations within  as if it had been built for a pair of bodies  not just one .   how cozy  he mused .   as r .  gornon helped him lie within  hari knew this was a point of transition .  whether or not he awoke  whenever or in whatever shape he reemerged  nothing would ever be the same .       .     the thumartin nebula was a maelstrom of debris and dissipating plasma .  something violent had happened there recently  perhaps a great space battle  to leave such a mess behind .  instruments told of many hyperdrive engines having overloaded  just a couple of days ago  exploding spectacularly .  yet  because it occurred inside a coal dark cloud  no one in the galaxy would ever know .   no humans  that is .  already the cryptic hyperwave channels used by robots were abuzz with news that the archives and terraformers had been destroyed at last .   dors surveyed the scene with churning sensations of confusion and anxiety .  hari had been here  either just before or during that violent episode .  if dors had been human  her guts would have tied in knots of anxiety .  as it was  her simulation programs automatically put her through exactly the same suite of ersatz emotions .      this place .  .  . it feels like home  dors .  somehow i know that voltaire and i spent many long centuries here  slumbering  until someone called us back to life again .       the voice came from a nearby holographic image  depicting a young woman with short cropped hair  wearing a suit of medieval armor .   dors nodded .     one of daneel   s agents must have taken your archive from here to trantor  as part of a scheme i knew nothing about .  or perhaps your unit drifted free and was picked up by a passing human ship .  taken to some unsuspecting world  where enthusiasts carelessly unleashed the contents .      the holographic girl chuckled .      you make me sound so dangerous  dors .          you and the voltaire sim triggered chaos in junin quarter  and on sark .  even after hari banished you both to deep space  a copy of voltaire somehow infected and altered lodovic trema .  oh  you are creatures of chaos  all right .      joan of arc smiled .  she gestured toward the devastation visible outside the view ports .      then i assume you approve of all this destruction .  may i ask why you keep me around in that case .      dors remained silent .      perhaps because you are  at last  ready to face troublesome questions .  during the long years i spent in company with voltaire  neither of us could change the other   s view on fundamental matters .  i am still devoted to faith  as he is to reason .  and yet  we learned from each other .  for example  i now realize that both faith and reason are dreams arising from the same wistful belief      dors raised an eyebrow .     what belief is that .         a belief in justice  whether it comes from a divine outside power or from the merit that humans earn by rational problem solving .  both reason and faith assume the human condition makes some kind of sense .  that it isn   t just a terrible joke .       dors let out a low snort .      you certainly come from a strange era .  were you really so blind to chaos  when you lived .         blind to it .  voltaire and i were each born into extravagant centuries  violent  confusing  and brutal .  even the later technological era that resurrected us through clever computer simulation had its own aching problems .  but this particular kind of chaos you refer to  a specific disease that topples cultures at their brightest .  .  .      joan shook her head .      i do not recall anything like it during my time .  nor does voltaire .  i am sure we would have noticed .  neither faith nor reason can flourish when you are convinced  deep down  that the universe is rigged against you .       dors pondered .  could joan be right .  could there have been a time when there was no threat of chaos plagues .  but that made no sense .  the very first great scientific age  that invented both robots and spaceflight  collapsed in madness .  it must be something endemic    the ship   s computer interface broke her train of thought  filling the cabin with glowing letters .     a search of nearby space indicates jump traces leaving the area .  signs of ships that departed recently .  likely candidates are depicted on screen .  please elect choice of which course to follow .     dors had commanded the search .  now she studied two ionization trails shown on the viewer  heading in opposite directions .   it   s possible that neither of them carried hari away from this place .  his atoms may be drifting now amid the ash and debris  all the ancient memories and ruins of past ambitions .   she shook her head .   still  i   ve got to make a choice .   just as she was about to hazard a guess  the glowing letters shifted again .     a new presence enters the nebula .  a vessel .  see the following coordinates .  .  .     dors swiftly activated her ship   s defensive grid and jacked into the computer directly .  she could sense the interloper now  a fast craft .  either one of the best imperial cruisers  or a rogue ship from some chaos world .  .  .    .  .  . or else it was under robotic control .     we are being hailed .  the pilot uses the name dors venabili .     dors nodded .  daneel must have learned of her apostasy and sent someone after her .  for days she had rehearsed what she   d say  either to the immortal servant or one of his zeroth law emissaries  when he tried to win her back into the fold with appeals to her sense of duty .  however much distaste she felt toward past events  olivaw would insist that her sole choice now was to help his long range plan for human salvation .   there is even a chance they   ll shoot  if i try to run away .  yet dors felt a wild urge to do just that  to show daneel   s minions her heels .  action would speak her revulsion more eloquently than words .     the pilot of the incoming craft again requests contact .  there is now a personal identification code  and a message .     reluctantly  dors opened herself to the data burst .      hello  dors  i assume that   s you .  have you had enough time to think things over .      don   t you figure it   s time we talked .      she rocked back  surprised .  but then  in another way  it seemed she had expected this all along .  there was a symmetry that required her to confront lodovic trema once again .   nearby  the holographic image of a young medieval knight shivered  then half smiled .      i sense voltaire .  he   s near  in one of his manifestations .       simulation programs crafted a perfect facsimile of a resigned sigh as dors said     ah  well .  let   s hear what the two boys have to say .          .     hari stared at pengia  wondering what it was about the planet that struck him as odd .  from orbit the place was unassuming  like any typical imperial world  with glistening blue seas and immense  flat agricultural regions  covered by checkerboard cornfields and rich orchards .  the small cities clearly did not dominate life here .  in fact  this bucolic place must have looked exactly the same for many thousands of years .   and yet  the broad fertile plains looked suddenly strange to hari  now that he knew the source of their well ordered geometries .  some incredible machine had probably created them .  his mind envisioned a time  not long ago by galactic standards  when artificial fire fell from the sky  blasting and pulverizing whole watersheds  carving ideal river courses  then seeding that earlier version of pengia with all the vegetation and foods needed by human settlers .   hari realized something else .   i haven   t seen many    typical    imperial worlds .  i   ve spent most of my life dashing around  investigating the strange .  .  . trying to understand deviations from the rules of psychohistory .  struggling to encompass every hitch and variation in our growing model .  it just never seemed important to visit a place like this  where the vast majority of human beings are born .  where they experience lives nearly identical to their ancestors     and die in modest contentment or desperation  according to their own personal dramas .   even helicon  where he had spent his early years  was widely known as an anomaly .  though agriculture dominated the planet   s economy  a local genetic fluke resulted in a notorious cottage industry  supplying mathematical geniuses to the bureaucracy and meritocracy .  small wonder that daneel chose to perform his search and experiment there .   this place may be typical  hari thought .  but i am not certain what that word means anymore .  again  humility felt surprisingly comfortable at his age .   of course  all of these strange musings might be a byproduct of his recent rejuvenation treatment .  hari felt new strength in his limbs  a greater steadiness in his step  which could not but help affect his overall mood  infecting him with an eagerness that  ironically  he resented somewhat  knowing it was artificial .   and yet  part of him felt surprised by how little had changed .   i   m still an old man .  i don   t look all that different .  i can sense that i   ve been given a bit more vigor  but i frankly doubt that will translate into much more life span .  is this all the disparity between what sybyl   s renaissance can accomplish  and the secret biotechnologies the calvinians have been hoarding for centuries .  the contrast isn   t all that impressive .   hari had a vague feeling  almost like a dream  that as much had been taken from him as he had been given  while lying in the big white box .  more had happened than was apparent .   the gentle blue world swam closer in the pride of rhodia   s view screens as r .  gornon vlimt piloted them toward a landing .  for some reason  everyone faced eastward as they descended .  no one cared about the western view  which was  after all  nearly identical .  jeni cuicet sat in a suspensor chair  barely moving  fighting waves of alternating heat and chills .   horis antic kept pointing to features of the geography below  sharing with biron maserd a new excitement of understanding how the terrain had been made  a greedy intellectual pleasure that hari well understood .  it made him smile for his two young friends .   sybyl and planch huddled together by the forwardmost window  muttering secretively  though hari could guess what concerned them .  the lesser crewmen from ktlina and the pride of rhodia had recently received a treatment of drugs and hypnosis from r .  gornon .  those men went about their tasks somewhat stonily  and clearly without any memory of the extravagant events that had taken place during the past week .   sybyl and planch are wondering when their turn will come  hari thought .  they must be striving to come up with some plan to avoid it  or else to leave a secret message for their friends .  i know because it is what i would do in their place .   antic and maserd seemed less concerned  perhaps relying on the protection of hari   s friendship  or because they were more trustworthy .  neither of them was likely to support anything that could cause chaos .  still  hari wondered .   r .  gornon acts in many ways as if he has the same agenda as daneel .  and yet  he slaughtered one of daneel   s agents  and clearly is fleeing as fast as he can to escape being caught by the immortal servant .   clearly there were complexities involved that hari didn   t yet grasp .  so biron and horis might be relying too much on friendship and trust to preserve their memory of recent events .   planch and sybyl reached a conclusion .  they walked toward hari  a grim set to their jaws .      we are ready to acknowledge that you   ve won again  seldon     the woman from ktlina said .     so let   s strike a deal .      hari shook his head .     it is exaggeration to say that i   ve won anything .  in fact  these recent victories cost me more than you   d ever imagine .  besides  what makes you think i am in a position to strike a bargain  let alone enforce one .      sybyl grimaced in frustration  but planch  the space trader  looked unperturbed .      we don   t understand everything that   s happened  but clearly our options are limited .  even if you can   t command that thing     he nodded toward r .  gornon     you clearly have some influence .  these tiktok machines value you highly .      they value what use they can make of me  hari thought  somewhat bitterly .  of course that was unfair .  apparently all robots  even daneel   s enemies  revered hari for one reason above all others .  he was as close to a fully aware and knowledgeable master as had existed in the human universe for thousands of years .   for all the good that   s going to do me  he thought wryly .  and for all the good that will do humanity .      what   s your proposition .     he asked mors planch .   the trader captain eagerly got down to business .      the way i see it  this mentalic tiktok could disable any of us  knock us out  inject drugs  and wipe our brains .  but that course of action has two disadvantages .  first  old gornon here won   t like doing that  on account of that first law of theirs .  oh  he might rationalize that it   s for some greater good  but i figure our tin man would prefer finding some other way to keep us from blabbing  wouldn   t he .      hari was impressed with this reasoning .  planch caught on pretty well .      go on .         besides  wherever we show up with a gap in our memory  it will be a big fat clue to all our friends  or to anybody who ever knew us .  there are people back on ktlina who knew our plans .  no matter what the robot does to our minds  those savvy folks just might be able to use some new renaissance technologies to undo the damage .  gornon would have to wipe us almost blank and dump us into a hole  in order to make sure that won   t happen .      hari felt biron maserd step closer to participate in the conversation .      you are assuming that your beloved chaos revolution still reigns on ktlina     the nobleman said .     even if the sickness is still raging there  will it last long enough for your scenario to play out .  especially now that the ancient archives have been taken away from you .         perhaps you underestimate how many weapons this particular renaissance has in its arsenal .  ktlina is no sitting duck  like sark was .  nor is it overly trusting  like madder loss .  and even if it fails like the others  a growing network of collaborators and sympathizers stands ready to help the next world to try and break out of the ancient trap .      hari could not help but admire the dedication and intensity of this man .  he and planch differed only in their basic assumptions  what it was possible for humans to achieve .  i would be on his side  a willing co conspirator  if only the underlying facts were different .   but psychohistory showed that the old empire would collapse well before planch   s critical threshold was reached .  once the imperium   s gentle network of trade  services  and mutual support broke down  local populations on every planet would have far more serious concerns than aspiring to be the next renaissance .  matters of survival would come foremost .  the gentry class would step in  as it always did in times of crisis  creating either benevolent or despotic tyrannies .  the chaos plague would be stopped in its tracks by something equally terrible .  a collapse of civilization itself .      go on  planch     hari urged .     i assume you have some alternative to offer .      the trader captain nodded .     you can   t let us go entirely free  we can see that .  and yet it would be preferable not to kill us or wipe our minds completely .  so we   d like to suggest an alternative .      take us back with you to trantor .      mors planch might have explained further  but just then a shrill shout cut in .      no .      everyone turned to see young jeni cuicet raising herself on both elbows  trying to step out of the levitation chair .      i won   t go back there .  they   ll ship me off to terminus  along with my parents .  this damned brain fever will just make things worse .  they   ll say it means i   m a blasted genius .  they   ll be even more eager to drag me off to that horrible rock  and there i   ll rot .      sybyl went over to jeni  distracted for a moment by her pain  attempting to offer the girl some more chemical relief .  mors planch and hari shared a look .   planch doesn   t have to go into more detail  hari thought .  no sense in upsetting the girl .  besides  i know what he   s suggesting .  there are age old methods that emperors have used  in order to keep people in safe    exile    right there in the capital .  it   s a risky option .  perhaps planch thinks he can escape from such confinement  even though imperial hostages have tested the constraints for thousands of years .   or else  maybe he   d just rather live comfortably in a cosmopolitan place  as an alternative to having his memory wiped .   any further discussion of the matter was forestalled when r .  gornon shouted over his shoulder     everyone get belted in .  they don   t have a sophisticated guide beam here  so it may be rougher than you are used to .      no one thought of disobeying .  gornon   s power had been amply demonstrated .  as the passengers watched pengia   s rustic spaceport loom ahead  everyone knew there were matters left unsettled .  each of them would meet a point of decision on pengia .  a shifting of destiny .     they were met at the edge of the landing field by half a dozen sturdy looking men .  hari had an unmistakable feeling that they were robots  doubtless members of gornon   s small calvinian cult .   three large vehicles came alongside the ship  which had settled down next to a hangar .  into one car went biron maserd   s crewmen and those who had served aboard mors planch   s raider ship .  the second took aboard horis  sybyl  planch  and maserd  with jeni   s levitation chair gently loaded in back .  their immediate stop would be a local hospital  where doctors were familiar with brain fever and had facilities to help the young woman .   gornon showed no concern that she might talk about what she had seen .  brain fever victims often had extravagant hallucinations  and no one would take her wild stories seriously .  besides  hari noted that the ship   s motivators had been left running on idle .  the calvinians didn   t plan to stay long  a few days at most .   even that may be too long  if daneel   s organization is as efficient as ever .  hari wondered what could possibly drive these robot heretics to take such a risk .   hari and gornon joined the others .  on automatic pilot  the limousine started heading toward some nearby hills  evidently a zone where local gentry lived .  hari presumed gornon had a villa waiting .  nothing but the best for his captives .   as the limo reached a side gate to depart the provincial spaceport  hari looked back at the pride of rhodia  and the acuity that had been newly restored to his eyesight made him notice something strange .   the robots gornon had left in charge of the ship were now unloading something bulky through the passenger hatchway .  it was white and shaped like an oversize coffin .   even the burly robots seemed to strain under its weight as they carried it toward the third and last vehicle .  their movements indicated great care  as if their cargo were somehow more precious than their own lives .   as if many hopes rested on its safe journey to some faraway destination .      part      a recurring  rendezvous       pengia .  .  . a world in rigel sector noted for producing elegant craft ceramics and for certain anomalous oceanic life forms that have recently been investigated for their unique neuromentalic traits  offering hope for organic humans with immune systems that reject standard symbiotic host implants .  .  .   pengia stands out mainly for its almost complete lack of historical interest .  a modest agricultural world  it appears to have taken part in few notable events during the dark ages  and none at all in the imperial era .  only once      years into the interregnum  did it experience momentary prominence  right after the battle of chjerrups  by playing host to the first galactic coalescence investigation commission .  those hearings made pengia   s name briefly famous  wherever broadcasts were not jammed by .  .  .   that illustrious phase soon passed  however  as the tumultuous destiny debates spread their heady turmoil to more populated venues .  thereafter  pengia soon lapsed .  .  .       encyclopedia galactica      th edition       f . e .       .     r .  zun lurrin at last understood the awesome scope of daneel   s long range design for the salvation of humanity .      you plan to help them unite .  to create a telepathic network  in which each human soul connects to every other .      the immortal servant nodded as he gazed at sixty human subjects with identical expressions of contentment playing across their faces  meditating beneath a high arched dome .      imagine it .  no more rancor .  an end to bitterness and egotistic rivalry .  and above all  there would be no solipsism .  for how can anyone ignore the feelings of other people  when those feelings have become intensely palpable  like integral parts of your own mind .         unity and oneness     zun sighed .     the old dream .  and we could provide it to them at last .      but then zun frowned as he contemplated the sixty humans in front of him .      they are at peace  in total connectedness  because each one is paired with a positronic mentalic amplifier .  only now you say we cannot do the same thing on a massive scale .      daneel nodded .     that sort of dependency on mechanical methods we must not allow .         but it would let us combine with our masters .  robots and humans  bound together in permanent  loving synergy .         and in such a synergy  the machine portion would grow ever more dominant with the passage of time     daneel said .     moreover  consider how many robots we would have to build .  it could only be done by unleashing self reproduction .  that opens the door to selection  darwinism  evolution .  .  . and eventually a new android species .  one that thinks primarily of its own self interest instead of humanity   s .  i swore never to permit this .      no .  we must not let humans become overly dependent upon robots .  that was the spacer approach  the heresy that elijah baley warned against .  the abomination that forced giskard to act as he did .      daneel   s voice resonated with determination .     humans must eventually stand on their own .  and there are more reasons than the ones that i have told you so far .  reasons having to do with survival of the race itself .      zun lurrin contemplated this for a time .      in that case let me extrapolate  daneel .  from this data  i shall hazard to guess your plan .      a hundred years ago  you began a series of genetic experiments on small groups of human beings .  one of these projects brought forth the mathematical genius of hari seldon .  another produced a sudden wave of mutants on trantor  humans capable of mentalic powers that only a few robots formerly possessed .         excellent .  you are on the right track  zun .     daneel nodded .     think about the scene in front of you  these sixty humans united in glorious tranquility  power  and contentment .  now envision it taking place without robotic aid .  they would form their own mental comity .  a union of souls .  one that is sturdy  free of reliance on artificial aids .      zun lurrin nodded .     i understand what you are saying  daneel .  that would certainly be more desirable .  and yet  consider the delay .  it will take centuries to develop human mentalics strong and numerous enough to serve as psychic bridges  connecting whole cities  territories  even planets .  why wait so long .  at this very moment  we have tools at hand that could be modified for this very purpose .  why not use these devices  strictly for the interim  until enough powerful human mentalics become available  the galactic empire need not fall .  it could simply be transformed  almost overnight  if we only reprogram certain implements       daneel shook his head in the human fashion  indicating polite disagreement .      it is a tempting notion .  but the drawbacks are fatal .  number one  to impose this union of spirits by mechanical means would create tremendous first law conflict among many robots  whose circuits would interpret it as    harm .     i have tried out this idea on several of your peers  and their reactions vary from enthusiasm  such as yours  all the way to outrage and revulsion .      clearly  such a peremptory action would reignite the robotic civil wars .      zun quailed at the notion .     i assume you erased all memory of this idea from the robots that rejected it .         i took that precaution  yes .  and if your reaction had been different  i would have done the same to you  zun .  my apologies .         no apology is required where necessity and the good of humanity are concerned     zun said  dismissing daneel   s concern with the wave of one hand .     and your other reason         human variability .  in recent millennia  small but significant numbers have grown immune to nearly all of the stabilizing influences that we have used to stave off chaos .  they are also extremely resistant to mentalic suasion .  imagine how these individuals would react if they abruptly saw their friends  neighbors  and loved ones becoming    meditation masters    overnight .      no  that understates it  zun .  suppose we do manage to draw a majority of humans into a macro consciousness  abandoning individuality to unite in a single mentation stream .  how will the remnant minority react to being left out .      would they go mad .  or feel abandoned .      or might they misinterpret what they see happening  and imagine that some alien force has turned their loved ones into zombies  compelling them to think identical rigid thoughts  all at the same time .      don   t forget  these exceptional ones are often ingenious .  they would throw all their energies into uncovering and fighting that outside alien force .      they would find us .  they would wage a war against us .      zun lurrin envisioned the scene as daneel described it  and understood at once the farseeing wisdom of the immortal servant .      this new breakthrough  this new way of human life  it must be introduced at the right time  under appropriate circumstances .  all robots must see it as necessary .  all humans must view it as an improvement .      daneel nodded .      and so it cannot happen yet .  it must not be brought about by artificial means .  we shall have to wait until a large enough population of human mentalics is ready .  until the empire has collapsed  and humanity roils in suffering .  then as they yearn for something to unify and save them  that will be the time to offer them gaia .      zun turned to look at daneel .     gaia .         an ancient term for a spirit that covers an entire planet .  a gentle  loving goddess who knows when every sparrow falls  because each bird of the air  all the fish of the sea  and every living human  will be an integral part of her .      the immortal servant   s voice grew distant as daneel   s eyes seemed to focus on a far horizon  one filled with majesty and beauty .      and after each planet has its gaia  then we may see something even greater .  something all encompassing .  galaxia .      his voice softened further .      and that is when   perhaps   i shall find some peace .          .     two mysterious ship traces led away from the thumartin nebula  heading in opposite directions from the site where a million archives and terraforming machines had recently exploded into sparkling clouds of ionized memory .  it was decided that dors would follow one of the departing trails .  lodovic   s calvinian friends would follow the other one in their own speedy craft .   that was fine by dors  who felt a strong hunch which direction hari had been taken .   unfortunately  lodovic trema agreed with her choice .  after briefly introducing dors to his new allies  he threw a carryall over his shoulder and crossed the tunnel connecting both airlocks  making himself right at home aboard her ship .      zorma and her friends have less need of me than you do     he explained .      then their need is less than zero .     she retorted .  he only smiled  appearing disinclined to argue .  but dors was having none of that .      this is going to be a full and complete exchange of information  trema .  or else you can get out and walk the rest of the way .  start by telling me about these allies of yours .  you know how i feel about fanatics who deny the zeroth law .      just a couple of years ago  one small calvinian cult based on trantor had decided it was time to attack daneel olivaw where it could hurt him most  by wrecking the seldon plan .  if the immortal servant cared about hari and psychohistory  then that group of rejectionist robots was determined to interfere .  they nearly tricked a human mentalic into messing with hari   s mind .  only good luck and quick intervention had foiled the plot  in the nick of time .      this group is different     lodovic assured her .     you even met zorma once before  back on trantor  when she wore a male body and argued against the plan to sabotage hari .      dors recalled .  the calvinian had seemed reasonable at the time .  still  she shook her head .      that   s hardly a basis for trusting fanatics .         according to some  the real fanatics and heretics are zeroth law robots     lodovic replied .     you   ve replayed the memories of r .  giskard reventlov .  you know how slender a thread he and daneel were pulling when they replaced our old religion with a new one .         the civil wars are over  lodovic .  a vast majority of surviving robots accept the zeroth law  while the old believers break up into dozens of little sects  hiding and conspiring in dark comers of the galaxy .  tell me  what do your new friends believe .  what funny little notions have they picked up during their long  frustrated diaspora .      constellations flickered and shifted subtly outside  each time her ship performed another hyperspatial jump .  lodovic smiled .      their creed is odd all right  that our masters should be consulted about their own destiny .      dors nodded .  trema had been drifting toward this apostasy ever since his accident .  why else would he give her giskard   s head in the first place .      that   s fine in principle .  but how practical is it .         you refer to chaos     lodovic replied .     indeed  zorma and her compatriots must be careful which humans they reveal themselves to .  but surely  you   ve seen the figures from daneel   s humanics studies .  over two percent of the population is already resistant to both olivaw   s damping factors and to the seductions of chaos .  it   s one reason why hari seldon theorized that a foundation  based on terminus  might evolve enough social and psychological strength to burst past the threshold that has so far proved lethal to every other       dors lifted a hand to cut him off .      this is all very interesting  lodovic  normally  i   d love to meet these mature humans your calvinian pals choose to confide in .  but right now i   m only interested in finding hari seldon .  do you know anything about the group that has him .      lodovic nodded .      you   re right  dors .  the old religion did break up into many little cults .  they never had a charismatic leader  like daneel  to weld them together .  those calvinians on trantor  led by poor old plussix  were embarrassingly simpleminded .  you   ll recall that zorma tried to talk them out of their foolish plan .  she also sought to dissuade the group that has kidnapped hari .      her emotion simulation programs crafted a chill of horror along her spine .      do you know what the kidnappers want .         alas  no .  they are a strange group  more sophisticated than the ones on trantor  with some weirdly original ideas they   ve cooked up over the centuries .  zorma   s intelligence about them is limited .  but it appears that some of their leaders were once allied with daneel  then parted with him under unpleasant circumstances .      zorma is also pretty sure they have big plans for your former husband .      dors detected a little stress on the word    former     and wondered why lodovic chose to emphasize that point .   the nearby holographic unit  where she stored the joan of arc sim  emitted an eager microwave impulse  reminding dors of a promise she had made .   joan wants to contact the version of voltaire that lodovic carries in his mutated positronic brain .  as if i   d trust the two of them together .   that provoked a stray thought .   what would daneel think  knowing that lodovic and i have teamed up  even distrustfully .   she shook her head .      do you know anything else about the cult that took hari .         not much  except that they aren   t cautious or responsible  like zorma   s group  or simple fanatics  like plussix   s .  in fact  dors  they   re the kind you might have predicted i   d wind up with .  very sophisticated .  clever .  technologically adept .      lodovic   s smile was grim .      and from almost any point of view  dors  they are quite certifiably insane .          .     over the course of two days  mors planch made four escape attempts .  each time he was foiled  the space pilot grew more cheerful and  strangely  more confident .   either the man is going crazy before our eyes  hari reflected with some fascination .  or else it   s all part of a plan .  .  . try one thing after another in order to bracket the robots    capabilities .  learn their limitations .  either way  it   s a wonder to behold .   the latest attempt involved planch accoutering himself in a makeshift garment made of insulation foil stripped off the villa   s central ducting system .  who knew where the fellow came up with the ingenious notion  but he managed to walk past several layers of security sensors and reached the road leading toward pengia town before one of gornon   s robot assistants spotted him visually .  politely and gently  but with irresistible strength  the humanoid took planch   s arm and led him back inside .  with the hood of his homemade stealth garment thrown back  grinning lopsidedly at sybyl and maserd and the others  he marched back into captivity  acting as if he  and not the robot  were in charge .   of course this is a farce  hari thought .  our captors have the ability to subdue planch any number of ways  from sedating him to altering his memories .  so why don   t they .  is gornon trying to demonstrate something  through his forbearance .   hari found himself rooting for mors planch  especially since it wouldn   t matter much if the man did get away .  as an outlaw  the raider captain could hardly go to the police or galactic news media with his wild story .  and it was probably too late for him to affect ktlina   s renaissance  whose doom was already a .  foregone conclusion .  anyway  since these robots were avowedly opponents of hari   s friend  daneel  he didn   t owe them anything .  in fact  he had every reason to delay their departure from pengia .   hari had an idea how to achieve that .      i must insist that we bring the young lady with us  on our journey     he told gornon  late on the second day .     you said trantor would be our ultimate destination  after the next stop .  jeni belongs with her parents .  we have no right to leave her among strangers  stranded in some galactic backwater .      the robot gornon demurred .      she is still recovering from her illness .         the local doctors broke her fever  and she seems past the crisis .         yes  but the next phase of our voyage may involve danger .  there will be upsetting situations before trantor finally comes into view .  are you willing to put the young woman through that  professor .      r .  gornon   s vague but ominous description of their coming journey made hari even more eager to delay these calvinian zealots  in hope that daneel   s forces would arrive in time .      you have met and spoken with jeni     he told gornon .     she   s exceptional in many ways .  her destiny ultimately lies on terminus  where the foundation will have great need of resourceful people like her .      in fact  hari knew better .  while jeni would make a wonderful citizen of the bold new civilization that was being founded at the galaxy   s far periphery  she wasn   t essential .  no individual was .  the equations of psychohistory would operate with or without her  unfolding as he had foreseen .  at least for the first two or three centuries .   still  hari had come to realize that r .  gornon was quite different from the calvinians back on trantor .  this fellow   s sect did not oppose the seldon plan .  in fact  gornon clearly approved  at some level .  so hari   s argument carried weight .      very well then  professor .  we will give her another day of rest .  then we must depart  whether she is ready or not .      hari could tell this was the limit of gornon   s flexibility .   well  daneel  i   ve given you one more day to find us .  but you better hurry .   one question he refrained from asking .  why had the robot not simply used some of the    supermedical technologies    to cure jeni right away .  clearly this particular cult believed in a minimalist approach  interfering in human affairs only insofar as it was absolutely necessary to achieve their goals .   perhaps that   s why they did so little to me in their magical rejuvenation machine .  whatever i   m supposed to do for them can be accomplished in the next few weeks .  no sense in giving additional decades to an old bastard like me  when a month or two will do .       .     zun lurrin observed daneel   s ship streak away from eos  briefly illuminating the lake of frozen mercury with its actinic flare .  he watched until the speedy vessel made its first hyperspace jump  swooping toward the galaxy   s shimmering wheel .  without having to navigate dust lanes or fight the gravity eddies of ten billion stars  the craft should make excellent time streaking toward its destination .   a message from one of daneel   s agents had provoked the leader of all zeroth law robots into a blur of activity  rushing through preflight operations and departing with only a few words of instructions for zun .      i   m leaving you in charge     the immortal servant had said .     here are access codes to my personal data files  in case i don   t return at the expected time .         is the situation truly so dire .     zun had asked  with concern .      several forces are at work  some of which are not easily factored into my calculations .  i would guess there is a small but significant chance that i will fail .      even if i do  however  the plan we have been discussing here must not .  the ultimate hope for human happiness lies within our grasp .  but it is  as yet  a slender prospect .  there will be many crises before our masters finally unify  coalesce  achieve their true potential  and take command once again .      only an hour later  zun watched with eyes that were capable of detecting even the backwash ripples of daneel   s hyperspatial wake .  he now shared the same vision  the same determination  as his leader .      i will not let you down     he murmured with a mentalic benediction .     but do not fail to return  daneel .  yours is not a burden that i would carry easily .          .     to pass their third and final day  hari asked for an excursion through pengia town .  he wanted one last look at normal galactic society  where the old empire still functioned smoothly  hoping to check out a notion or two about psychohistory .  r .  gornon vlimt personally accompanied hari  piloting an open touring car of the kind favored by minor planetary gentry .   it wasn   t much of a municipality  less than a million  with most of that dispersed in cozy little cantons  each one somewhat self contained .  although pengia   s economy was primarily agrarian  there were a few factories  to produce the machines that made life comfortable  from cooler units to home amusement centers  designs that had changed only incrementally across hundreds or even thousands of years .  after ages of gradual refinement  most of the tools people used were outstandingly durable  taking centuries to wear out .  buying a replacement was unusual  perhaps even a little shameful  like not taking proper care of a family heirloom .  hence  only a few sophisticated factories were needed to supply the planet   s needs .   nondurable goods were another matter .  everything from pottery to furniture to clothing was produced by guilds  controlled by master craftsmen whose authority over their journeymen and apprentices went unquestioned .  most of the galaxy   s ten quadrillion people lived in much the same way .   hari recognized the trademarks and rhythms of a deeply traditional  semi pastoral society  needing only a few real engineers  and even fewer scientists .  no wonder he had been forced to cast a wide net to recruit the hundred thousand first rate experts who would make their new home on terminus .  even the energy systems on pengia were based largely on renewable sources  solar  tide  and wind  with just a single proton fusion power plant serving as a supplement .  and there was talk of giving up that sophisticated    atomic    unit  replacing it with a deuterium based model  less efficient but far simpler to maintain .   hari mentally juggled psychohistorical formulae  noting the elegant damping mechanisms that daneel and his colleagues had included when they designed a galactic empire for humanity  fifteen thousand years ago .  having read a child   s book of knowledge  hari marveled how many of the same techniques existed back in ancient china  long before the first technological renaissance on earth .   that prehistoric imperium had a system called bao jin  also called gonin gumi in a nearby culture  that seemed quite similar to today   s tradition of communal accountability .  an entire village or canton was responsible for training its young people in proper rituals and behavior .  .  . and the whole community was shamed if any member committed a crime .  any youth who chafed under this conformist system had but one hope  to win transfer over to the meritocratic or eccentric orders  because most common citizens had little use for individualists in their midst .   as an added touch  meritocrats and eccentrics are subtly encouraged not to reproduce .  that helps curb genetic drift .  daneel didn   t miss a trick .   in the main civic center  hari and r .  gornon saw gray pennants hanging from a boxy office building .      the banners signify it is testing week     the robot explained .     civil service exams are being held          i know what the banners mean     hari snapped .  he had been waiting to ask the calvinian some questions .  this seemed as good a time as any .      back aboard the space station  you laid a trap for my servant  kers kantun .  i assume you arranged for him to be decapitated quickly  in order to prevent him from detecting any danger with his mentalic powers .      r .  gornon wasn   t nonplussed by the sudden change in subject .      correct  professor .  while kantun   s powers did not match daneel   s  they were formidable .  we couldn   t afford to take chances .         and the chimp .  the one who ran off with kers   s head .         that creature was a descendant of genetic experiments daneel abandoned a century ago .  my group recruited a few because mentalic robots cannot read or detect chimp minds .  the pan could observe kers and trigger our ambush  so we did not have to use electronic or positronic devices .         and what do you plan on doing with the head of my servant .      gornon demurred .      i   m sorry  professor .  i cannot elaborate .  whether you decide to accept our proposition  and proceed on an exciting new adventure  or instead choose to return to trantor  we have no intention of meddling with your mind .  so we are better off simply not telling you certain things .      hari contemplated what he   d just learned .  at their next stop he would be offered a choice .  a fateful one .  yet  gornon   s words were reassuring .  these robo heretics were more respectful than the group that tried to alter his brain two years ago .      won   t you say more about our destination .     he asked .      only that we will take you to a place where many dramas began .  .  . in order to influence how they end .      they drove in silence after that  observing the placid pace of life under daneel   s gentle empire .  if trantor had been designed to consist of steel caves  as one method of resisting chaos  worlds like pengia also had multi layered defenses against tumbling into a disastrous renaissance .   still  hari felt something was missing .  even when he included brain fever in his calculations  it wasn   t enough to explain how twenty five million human settled worlds could remain comfortably static for so many thousands of years  content to stay ignorant of their past  and for children to lead identical lives to their parents    .  since robots had been developed in the very earliest technological age  why weren   t they being reinvented daily by bright tinkerers and students in a billion little basement labs  all over the galaxy .  there had to be something more .  some powerful force helping to damp out the oscillations and deviations inherent in basic human nature .   they were on their way back to the rented villa  when hari thought of another question .      i recall  back in the nebula  that kers kantun had a hard time mentalically subduing mors planch .  when i asked about it  kers said something that puzzled me .  he said planch is difficult to control because he   s normal .  do you know what kers meant by that .      the robot gornon shrugged .      calvinians tend to be less eager to use mentalic powers .  our particular sect finds it distasteful to interfere with human minds .  still  i might hazard a guess .  perhaps kers was talking about a fundamental change that occurred in the human condition  way back       gornon stopped  mid sentence  as the car pulled into the villa   s driveway .  hari abruptly noticed that the gate was flung open .  .  . and a body lay sprawled nearby .   braking hard  gornon leaped from the driver   s seat with uncanny agility to kneel by the prostrate form .  it was one of the other robots who shared guard duty at the villa .  hari saw dark fluid leaking from its cranium in several places .   gornon ran a hand back and forth above the body without ever touching it .  a low moan escaped his lips .      my compatriot is dead .  some force caused an implosion of his brain .      hari felt sure he knew the explanation .   daneel has arrived .   gornon looked deeply concerned .  he closed his eyes  and hari knew he must be seeking to commune by radio with his other partners .      there are further casualties     gornon said ominously  and started walking toward the big house .     i must make certain that none of them are human beings .      hari followed  a bit numbly .  though he was no longer confined to a wheelchair  his gait was slow and unsteady  that of an old man .   on entering the villa they found gornon   s other assistant sprawled at the foot of the stairs  propped against the wall by horis antic and biron maserd .  only the wounded robot   s eyes weren   t paralyzed .  the two men glanced at hari .  horis started blurting at once .      mors planch used some kind of b b bomb to knock out these tiktoks .  he made a clean getaway .      maserd was calmer .  with a nobleman   s aplomb .  he explained     planch rigged a device from seemingly innocuous parts .  how he got them is beyond me .  after setting it off  he offered us a chance to leave as well .  sybyl went along  but we decided to stay .      while gornon bent over the crippled robot at the foot of the stairs  horis antic chewed his nails .      is he .  .  . it gonna be all right .      gornon communed with his colleague .  without breaking eye contact  he explained .      planch must have been studying robots for some time .  perhaps using the new laboratories on ktlina .  somehow  he came up with a weapon that directly affects our positronic brains .  it is ingenious .  we shall have to dissect my friend here  determine how it was done  and come up with a defense .      as the humans digested that chilling image  gornon stood up and informed them     there is no point in looking for sybyl and planch .  we must move up our departure .  please fetch your things .  we leave at once .        as the four of them departed in the touring car  hari insisted     we   ll stop for jeni  of course .      gornon seemed about to refuse  when maserd interjected .      planch and sybyl will probably go underground until they can contact their partisans .  i don   t expect they   d go public with their story .  but what if they do .         isn   t that unlikely .     antic stammered .     i mean  i wouldn   t blab  if i were in their shoes .  what   s to gain except admission to a psychiatric ward .     he frowned .     on the other hand  i   m not a creature of chaos .         exactly .  they operate on a different plane of logic .         please clarify     r .  gornon asked .     how does any of this apply to jeni cuicet .      maserd answered     sybyl  especially  has grown more erratic with each passing day .  she may go to the media .  .  .  and try using jeni to corroborate her story .      hari figured gornon was more afraid of daneel   s forces than of fantastic tales circulating briefly in the local human media .  but to his surprise  maserd   s logic seemed to convince the robot .  gornon turned the car toward the city hospital .   biron and horis went inside and found jeni already dressed  storming around her room as formidable as ever  making life hard for the doctors who wanted her to rest .  she expressed gladness to see maserd and antic  and welcomed a chance to depart with them .  but her attitude chilled upon spying hari and gornon waiting in the car .      we still got a deal  don   t we  m   lord .     she asked maserd .     you drop me off somewhere interesting along the way  before anyone goes back to trantor .      the nobleman from rhodia looked pained as the car resumed moving toward the spaceport  weaving through city traffic .      i   m sorry  jeni .  but i am no longer in command of my own vessel .  i don   t even know where we   re going next .      jeni turned to gornon .     well  then .  how about it  robot .  where are you taking us .      gornon spoke in flat tones .     first  to a place where no sane citizen of the empire would choose to remain for very long .  and then back to the capital of the human empire .      jeni looked down at her hands  dejected .  she muttered under her breath  something about the gentry and their worthless promises .  biron maserd flushed darkly and said nothing .  when hari turned toward the young woman and began to speak  she shot him a look of pure spite that cut off his words before he uttered them .   everyone lapsed into silence .   as the car paused at a traffic light  jeni suddenly let out a cry of jubilant realization .  before anyone could stop her  she jumped onto the seat  leaped out the back of the car  and started dashing across the street .      stop .     cried r .  gornon vlimt .     you   ll be hurt .      hari caught his breath as she dodged traffic  barely escaping being crushed by a cargo lorry .  then she reached her destination  a multistory structure with gray banners hanging from its portico .   it took gornon several minutes to negotiate a u turn and park in a spot reserved for the gentry class .  the four of them headed into the building  but were stopped by a man in a uniform similar to the one worn by horis antic .      i   m afraid government house is closed for business  today  sirs .  the facilities are being used for the imperial civil service exam .      hari craned his neck to see jeni cuicet standing at the other end of the lobby  scribbling furiously on a clipboard  then handing over her universal id bracelet to be scanned by another gray clad clerk .  a glass barrier parted before her  and hari glimpsed a room beyond where over a hundred people were just settling themselves at desks .  most looked anxious  preparing to take a test that might be their sole hope for a ticket off of this backwater planet .      she   s just recovered from an illness  and hasn   t studied     commented horis antic .     still  who can doubt she   ll pass with flying colors .     the little man turned to hari .     it appears she has escaped the destiny others planned for her  professor .  no one may interfere with testing day  not even an emperor .  and when she is a member of the greys  you won   t be able to touch her .  not without filling out forms  in triplicate  for the rest of this eon .      hari glanced at the little man  surprised by his tone .  pride tinged antic   s voice .  hari recognized a chip on the shoulder that members of the bureaucracy sometimes wore when they spoke to their betters in the meritocratic order .   biron maserd chuckled .     well  well .  good for her .  if she can stand that kind of life  at least she   ll get to travel .      hari sighed .  now the young woman would never learn what a fascinating adventure awaited at far off terminus .  .  .  the one place she was desperate not to go .   the glass barrier slid back .  from the other side  jeni glanced at them with a smile .  then she turned to meet a destiny that was of her own choosing .       .     dors found herself making excuses for daneel   s actions  at the beginning of the galactic era .      maybe he and giskard just couldn   t find any humans who could understand .  perhaps they tried to consult some of the masters  and discovered          that they were insane .  all of them .  on earth and on the spacer worlds .  they could not find any humans to confer with as they deliberated about the zeroth law and made plans to divert all of history .      dors pondered this for a few moments .  then she nodded .      think about it  lodovic .  on earth  they were all huddled in steel catacombs  cowering away from the sun  traumatized and still quivering from some blow that had struck them generations before .  the spacers weren   t much better .  on solaria  they grew so fetishistically dependent on robots that husbands and wives could barely stand to touch each other .  on aurora  the most wholesome human instincts became matters of bad taste .  worse  people were willing to dehumanize a vast majority of their distant cousins  simply because they lived on earth .     dors shook her head .     it sounds to me like twin poles of the same madness .      the starship shuddered as it made another automatic hyperspace jump .  dors reflexively downloaded a microwave burst from the navigation computer  to make sure all was well  that they were still on course  following the faint wake of another vessel .   lodovic trema sat in a swivel chair opposite her .  robots did not have the same physiological needs as humans .  but those designed to imitate masters would habitually do so  even in private or among their own kind .  in this case  lodovic sprawled casually  looking just like a human male who suffered from an overdose of confidence  an effect that he must be radiating intentionally  though dors could not imagine why .      perhaps  dors .  but in my experience you can find mature and reliably sane humans under even the most radical or stressed conditions .  i   ve met some on chaos worlds  for instance .  even on trantor .         then things must have been even worse back in the dawn era  more terrible than we can presently imagine .      dors knew her argument sounded weak .  she had  after all  deserted daneel   s cabal when she learned how little basis it had in human volition .  she and lodovic actually agreed far more than she yet wanted to concede .   am i too proud to admit it .  she wondered .  his jaunty  confident manner was one that a human female might find infuriating .  she suspected he was goading her into defending daneel  on purpose .   the male robot shook his head .      even if i concede that all humans were insane at the time daneel and giskard came up with the zeroth law  don   t you think  in retrospect  that the medicine they prescribed was a bit harsh .      dors kept her face impassive .  records from that era were extremely sparse  even in the forbidden archives and underground encyclopedias that were prepared for centuries by those who resisted a spreading amnesia .  but dors had recently done the math .   when r .  giskard reventlov triggered a machine to render earth   s crust radioactive  the aim had been to drive the home planet   s population out of their metal caverns  sending them forth to conquer the galaxy .  a laudable goal  but at what cost .   the starships of that era were primitive .  even if a herculean effort took away three million immigrants a year  it would have taken five thousand years to evacuate the planet  without taking into account natural replenishment .  yet the gradual increase in radioactivity probably rendered the soil poisonous within a century or so .  the fatality rate  in any event  must have been appalling .  .  . and that only counted the human race  not a myriad other species that were doomed along with earth .   no wonder giskard committed suicide  despite having a zeroth law rationalization to sustain him .  no robot could endure the burden of so many deaths .  just the thought of it would make any positronic brain quail .  all robots would feel a powerful drive  whether they adhered to the new religion or the old one  to wipe away memory of this episode  erasing it for all time .   contemplating this  she murmured at last     maybe humans weren   t the only ones marked by insanity .      across the small control room from her  lodovic nodded .  his voice was almost as subdued as hers .      that is what i needed to hear you say  dors .      you see  i have come to realize that typical robotic humility can mask the very worst kind of arrogance  a conceit that we are fundamentally different from humans .  slaves often depict themselves as intrinsically more virtuous than their masters .      but after all  did they not make us in their image .  true  we have great powers and extensive lives  but does that really mean we can   t suffer from similar faults .  isn   t it possible for us to be equally crazy .  to be out of our positronic minds .      he smiled  this time with a warmth  and sadness  that reminded her of hari .      something happened to us twenty thousand years ago  dors .  it happened to all of us  not only humans .  and we   ll never know the right thing to do  until we find the truth about those bygone days .          .     this time  for some reason  everyone watched the takeoff from pengia through the vessel   s west facing view ports .  the pleasant little world  indistinguishable from millions of others  fell away below the pride of rhodia as they headed off toward their next destination  one that r .  gornon still refused to name .      there is something i want to show you  dr .  seldon     the robot said  as the ship climbed along a spiral departure orbit .   hari had been musing about young jeni during liftoff .  and that  in turn  made him think about all the other members of the encyclopedia foundation who were being herded aboard transports at this moment  to be sent to far off terminus .  was it just a month since he had finished recording messages to be played back on that distant world  at decisive moments determined by his equations  when a word of encouragement or gentle suggestion from the father of psychohistory might make a crucial difference toward the foundation becoming a great and stable civilization .  now  his body might seem a bit younger  but hari   s soul felt older .      please  gornon .  just leave me alone .      he felt a hand at his elbow .      i am certain that you   ll want to see this  professor .  if you   d just come to the east facing view port .      the suggestion .  for some reason  struck hari as impertinent .  he was getting sick and tired of being pushed around by this damn calvinian .  but before he could voice a sharp putdown  gornon added     i believe i can show you the solution to one of your most vexing psychohistorical problems .  something that has puzzled you for decades .  if you   ll strive to overcome the sensations that are now churning within you  i   m certain the effort will be rewarded .      surprised by gornon   s words  hari let himself be led to the indicated port  diametrically opposite from where maserd and horis were staring at the view below .     this had better be worth it     hari muttered .   he gave the magnified scene a perfunctory look  but could perceive no difference from what horis and maserd saw  a receding planet below  and a diffuse spray of untwinkling stars above .      i don   t see anything .  if this is some kind of a joke          be assured  it will be everything i promised .  but first you must allow me to take liberties .      hari saw the robot hold forth a shimmering object  shaped like a close fitting skullcap made of countless luminous gems .  gornon moved to place it on hari   s head .      get that thing away  you mannequin of rusty       r .  gornon did not relent .      i   m sorry  professor  but your command is invalid .  it does not come from your native human will .  therefore  it can be overridden for a greater good .  this won   t hurt .      gornon was so implacably strong that his gentle insistence caused no pain as he slid the skullcap over hari   s head and drew him irresistibly back to the window .   hari abruptly felt all his rancorous irritability wash away .  what   s happening to me .      now please look again  professor .      hari shivered .  he had spent years in the company of robots  knowing a secret shared by few other humans  and even living as husband to one of them .  yet he still found mentalic interference disturbing .      what is this thing doing to me .     he felt calmer than before  yet worried .      it   s not controlling you  professor .  rather  it is a shield  sheltering your mind from a powerful influence pervading this region .      gornon pointed with a long finger toward a patch of space they had both glanced at just moments before .  this time  when hari looked  he saw something that hadn   t been there before .  at least  he had not noticed it .   he stared at some kind of orbiting platform  perhaps like those used for relaying communications around a planetary surface  or for trans shipping special cargoes .  only this one showed no sign of airlocks or complex antennae .  at gornon   s command  the view screen magnified its surface  so heavily pitted with micrometeorite scars that its great age was suddenly apparent .   it looks like a cousin to those terraformers we saw back in the thumartin nebula  he thought .  perhaps the relic has been drifting here for thousands of years .   but then why the mystery .  why didn   t i notice it the first time .   he felt gornon watching him .  hari had never liked taking tests  which was one reason why he rushed through graduate school by age twelve  to become the teacher instead of the pupil .  now he felt the pressure of expectation .   what did gornon just promise .  an answer to one of my most bothersome questions .   well  there was the problem of damping coefficients .  fully understanding all the factors that daneel had used to keep the galactic empire stable and safe for humanity  across fifteen thousand years .  hari understood how bao jin traditions and master apprentice systems enhanced conservatism .  the five caste social structure contributed elegantly .  so did the skillfully designed linguistic assumptions inherent in galactic standard  a language filled with so many redundancies that it accepted new words and new thoughts only at a glacial pace .   nevertheless  there remained a problem .  none of it was sufficient .  nothing yet explained how twenty five million worlds could stay static and serene for so long .      are you saying .  .  . that thing out there     hari reached up and lifted one edge of the skullcap .  a wave of emotions fluxed .  he suddenly resented the robot deeply  and wanted nothing better than to turn away from this panorama .  to return to his friends at the west facing view port .   hari let the flap drop back in place .  the irritation vanished .  in a hoarse voice  he whispered     mentalic suasion .  of course .  if daneel and some of his comrades can do it  why not mass produce a specialized positronic brain for each world .  twenty five million isn   t such a great number  especially if you have thousands of years .      he turned to look archly at gornon .     but how could such a thing be possible .  to sway the population of an entire planet .      the robot smiled .     it is not only possible  professor .  the method was tried by the very earliest mentalic robot .  r .  giskard reventlov first thought of using this device to influence whole planetary populations  by detecting and sifting neural electrical patterns and then gently nudging repeatedly  building slowly toward the kinds of resonance patterns that encourage tranquility .  equanimity .  goodwill .  in fact  these machines are named after giskard .  they are guardians of human serenity and peace .      i assume there is already a place for them in your equations .      hari nodded  staring  but his eyes did not see .  rather  his mind gyred with mathematics .  he saw at once how this provided much of what had been missing .  an explanation for why most eruptions of chaos simply dissipated harmlessly  like a fire that had been quenched for lack of oxygen .  a reason  also  why so few human beings lived outside of planets  even though asteroid outposts or those placed in strange environments had proved possible .  space life was hardly compatible with this damping mechanism .  so it would naturally be discouraged .   and yet these    giskards    aren   t working as well as they used to  once upon a time .  chaos outbreaks are more frequent  despite everything done to repress them .  only the empire   s fall will bring the recent wave of infections to a halt .  these obsolete methods will be useless in a few years  no matter what .   he imagined what might happen if such a mental suasion device were ever placed in orbit over terminus .   it would never work on that bunch for long .  we selected them for resistance against the pressures of a dark age  from feudalism to fanaticism .  even if this mentalic device affected a majority of foundation citizens  they would never let themselves be kept in line for very long .  individuals would rankle at the conformity message and sniff at every anomaly  eventually tracking this thing down .   daneel must plan to have all the giskard machines self destruct during the next hundred years or so .  otherwise  my foundationers will find them .   at that moment  it surprised hari to feel fierce pride in his first and greatest creation .  funny  he had expected that discovering the last big damping coefficient would be exciting .  but this technique for social control was nothing elegant .  hardly worthy of psychohistory .  rather it was a bludgeon  used to trim and prune the mathematical branchings and force the humanics equations back in line .   a bit like my second foundation  he thought  enjoying a little obsessive self criticism .        i know you must have some agenda .  gornon .  some convoluted reason for showing me this .  nevertheless .  please accept my thanks .  it   s always good to glimpse the truth before you die .        their pilot promised that the next phase of the journey would be brief .  gornon refused to be more specific  but their flight path toward sirius sector made it blatantly evident to hari where they must be heading .   he passed the time poring through a child   s book of knowledge .  browsing semi randomly  guided only by a perverse desire to sample forbidden ideas .  those he had long considered irrelevant or wrong .     almost equally dangerous is the gospel of uniformity .  the differences between the nations and races of mankind are required to preserve the conditions under which higher development is possible .  one main factor in the upward trend of animal life has been the power of wandering .  .  . physical wandering is still important  but greater still is the power of man   s spiritual adventures  adventures of thought  adventures of passionate feeling  adventures of aesthetic experience .  a diversification among human communities is essential for the provision of the inventive material for the odyssey of the human spirit .  other nations of different habits are not enemies  they are godsends .     what a bizarre way of looking at things .  it was the sort of statement that one heard from preachers of chaos  singing the praises of each    renaissance    before it tumbled into broiling violence and .  finally  solipsism .  these notions sounded alluring .  there were even versions of the psychohistorical equations that suggested a kind of truth ought to lie therein .  but with chaos as an enemy  all such benefits were lost .  anyone betting on diversity and boldness of spirit would almost certainly wind up losing everything .   as they approached their destination  hari kept probing through garbled accounts for clues as to what the very first chaos outbreak might have been like  when the vigorous  self confident civilization of susan calvin tumbled into such horror that earthlings fled into metal caves  and spacers turned their backs on love .   hari wondered .  might it have something to do with the invention of robots themselves .   he had discussed this a couple of times with daneel and dors .  they told him that the original three laws of robotics were created in order to assuage human fears about artificial beings .  but the original designers had meant the laws to be only a stopgap measure leading to something better .      quite a few variations were tried      daneel told hari one evening  perhaps ten years ago .     on some colony worlds  a few centuries after the diaspora from earth  certain groups tried to introduce what were called new laws  giving robots more autonomy and individuality .  but soon our civil war caught up with these experiments .  calvinians could not abide the equality heresy  which they considered even worse than my zeroth law .  my faction saw the innovations as unnecessary and redundant .      all of the new law robots were exterminated  of course .         that evening  over dinner  gornon admitted what hari had suspected  that their destination was the mother world  where both robots and humans began .   horis bit a fingernail .     but isn   t it poisonous  covered with radioactive soil .  i thought you tiktoks weren   t supposed to put humans in danger .      hari recalled images from the old archives  depicting a dying world .  .  . a beach awash with dead fish .  .  . a forest populated by skeletal trees and crumbling leaves .  .  . a city  nearly empty  filling with blowing dust and detritus .      i   m sure a brief visit won   t harm us     biron maserd commented .  the nobleman   s eyes shone with eager curiosity .     anyway  don   t some people still live on the planet .  according to tradition  it once had an excellent university  even several thousand years after the diaspora .  a school one of my ancestors is said to have attended .      gornon nodded .     a local population endured until well into the age when the trantorian empire became pan galactic .  they were an odd breed  however .  resentful over being forgotten and ignored by the descendants of cousins who had fled for the stars .  eventually most of the remaining people were evacuated  when earthlings were discovered plotting a war of revenge  to destroy the empire they hated .      horis antic stared blankly .     one planet hoped to destroy twenty million .         according to our records  the threat was quite serious .  earthling radicals got their hands on an ancient biological weapon of enormous power  one so sophisticated that even the best trantorian biologists felt helpless before its virulence .  by unleashing this attack through a volley of hyperspatial missiles  fanatics hoped to render the empire inoperable .         what did the disease do to people .     horis asked in hushed tones .      its effect would be to cause a sudden and catastrophic drop of iq on every planet within reach .     the robot looked pained even to describe it .     many would simply die  while the rest would feel an implanted compulsion to spread out  seeking to find more potential victims  and embrace them .         horrific .     captain maserd murmured .   but hari was already thinking two steps ahead .  gornon would not be telling us this now  unless it has immediate significance .  the earthlings    weapon must have come from much earlier .  from an era of great genius .   the implications made hari shiver .     only a few hours later  they arrived .   from a great distance  beyond its fabled moon  earth looked like any other living world  a rich muddle of browns and whites  blues and greens .  only through a long range viewer could they tell that most of the life ashore consisted of primitive ferns and scrubgrasses  which had evolved to survive the radiation that came sleeting upward from the poisoned ground .  in one of the great ironies of all time  earth  which had provided most of the galaxy   s fecundity  was now an almost barren wasteland .  a coffin for all too many species that never made it into space  as humanity fled the spreading doom .  as they spiraled closer  hari knew that he would soon face something even more disturbing than the    giskard    mentalic device circling pengia .   he went to his room to fetch his talismans .  one was daneel   s gift  a child   s book of knowledge .  but even more important  he wanted to carry the seldon plan prime radiant  containing his life   s work .  that gorgeous psychohistorical design  to which he had devoted the latter half of his existence .   so it was with mounting worry that he searched his tiny stateroom  rummaging through drawers and luggage .   the prime radiant was nowhere to be found .   at that moment  he desperately missed his former aide and nurse  kers kantun  who had been murdered by fellow robots  only a week or so ago .   kers would know where i misplaced it  hari thought .  .  .  until he realized there was an even better explanation than absentmindedness .   the prime radiant had been stolen .       .     a great many years had passed since this corner of space witnessed so many incoming starships  whose passengers all felt they were on missions of destiny .  sleepy little sirius sector thronged with vessels  all converging toward a single spot .   on one of those ships  sybyl turned to mors planch  and grumbled acerbically     can   t you get any more speed out of this thing .      planch shrugged .  their vessel was one of the fastest courier ships produced by the ktlina renaissance .  .  . before that world   s bright  productive phase started breaking down into spasms of self centered indignation  making further cooperative effort impossible .   the agents who had come to collect planch and sybyl on pengia looked on grimly .  their recent memories of ktlina were apparently much more somber than the excited  vibrant place that planch had last seen .  despite every precaution  the chaos syndrome appeared to be entering its manic phase  ripping ktlina society apart faster than anyone expected  as if the flame that burns brightest must flare out fastest .   it is madder loss  allover again  he thought  quashing waves of anger .  what he had learned during his time with the seldon party didn   t change his overall view  that renaissance worlds were deliberately crushed  infiltrated  and sabotaged by forces that would rather see a collapse into riots and despair than allow any real human progress .   on a nearby screen  planch saw four blips trailing just behind his speedy vessel .  the last armed might of ktlina .  the crews of those ships were eager to do battle a final time  where their lashing out might harm the forces of reaction  conservatism  and repression .      we don   t even know what the gornon robot was bringing seldon here for     mors planch said .     our agent communicated with us only in code  as usual  protecting his or her identity .      sybyl made a fist .     i don   t care anymore about details like that .  seldon is at the center of it all .  he has been for decades .      planch pondered sybyl   s obsession with hari seldon .  at one level  it had a solid basis .  whatever happened  the fellow would be remembered as one of the great men of the empire  perhaps for all time .  and yet  he had almost as little control over his destiny as any other human .  moreover  he had weaknesses .  one of them had been revealed to planch by his secret contact  the mysterious benefactor who arranged for the escape on pengia  and for the ktlina ships to already be on their way to that obscure planet  arriving to pick up planch and sybyl just hours after the pride of rhodia departed .   and his secret contact had provided something else  a weapon of sorts .  a piece of knowledge seldon desperately wanted .  something that might be used as leverage at a critical moment .   sybyl reiterated her dedication to catching the old man .     all the robots worship seldon  no matter what faction they belong to .  if we can recapture him  or even if he dies  it will be a setback to the tyrants who have dominated us for thousands of years .  that   s all that matters now .      mors planch nodded  though he did not share the purity of her conviction .  just a month ago  sybyl had used the same ringing tones to denounce the meritocratic and gentry    ruling classes .     now she had transferred her ire to hari seldon and robots in general .   alas  he could not shake the feeling of not knowing enough .  there were too many levels  too many deceptions and manipulations .  even now  mors suspected that the forces of ktlina  bent on revenge  might be acting as pawns .  .  . playing roles assigned to them by forces they did not understand .     wanda seldon   s eyes were closed  but the sound of pacing disturbed her attempts at meditation .  she cracked one eyelid to look at gaal dornick  whose restless back and forth stride seemed a perfect metaphor for futility .      will you please try to get some rest  gaal     she urged .     all that hopping about won   t get us there any faster .      the male psychohistorian still had youthful features  but these had grown a bit haggard and pudgy in the years since he had arrived on trantor and become an influential member of the fifty .      i don   t know how you stay so calm  wanda .  he   s your grandfather .         and the founder of our little foundation     wanda added .     but hari taught my father .  .  . and raych brought it home to me .  .  . that the long range goal must always be kept in view .  impatience makes you just like the rest of humanity  a gas molecule feverishly rebounding against other gas molecules .  but if your gaze is on a distant horizon  you can be the pebble that starts an avalanche .      she shook her head .     you know as well as i do that hari is not the real issue here .  as much as we care about him  we should have stayed at our jobs on trantor .  except for the suspicion that more is going on than a little escapade by a frail old man .      wanda could sense a complex churning of emotions within gaal   s mind .  the poor fellow didn   t have even a trace of a psychic defense screen  despite all her efforts to teach him .  of course it did not matter much now  with human mentalics so rare .  but in future generations  all members of the second foundation would have to be able to shield their thoughts and emotions .  mentalic control must start with self control  or else how could you hope to use it as a tool in the long range interests of humanity .   gaal dornick sighed .     maybe i   m not cut out for this .  i   m too damned sentimental .  i know you   re right  but all i can think of is poor hari  caught up in whatever web he helped spin .  we   ve got to find him  wanda .      she nodded .     if my information is correct  we should come upon him soon .      gaal accepted that .  he and other members of the fifty took wanda   s assurances literally  even when she was only guessing .  not exactly the sort of skeptical behavior one expected from scientists  but then  it   s natural to grow overreliant when a member of your group has the power to read minds .   not a very well developed power  she thought .  perhaps my sister would have been better  had she and mom survived the chaos on santanni .   nevertheless  her powers were good enough to detect the vessels following them at a discreet distance  several police cruisers  heavily armed  dispatched by the imperial commission for public safety  following a tracer beacon that had been planted on wanda   s ship .   they think we don   t know  but we let them see and hear what we want them to see and hear .  anyway  it   s good practice for the kinds of skulking and manipulation we   ll have to do during the next thousand years or so .   it was a long and arduous road that they had begun marching along  guided by the equations and empowered by their minds  until the seldon plan would finally bear fruit  tended by the dedicated  and soon to be mentalically augmented  psychohistorians of the second foundation .     just parsecs away  another ship plunged toward earth .  half of its crew consisted of positronic robots  powerful and knowing servants .  they worked amicably alongside an equal number of the master race .  .  . short lived and sacred  but no longer ignorant .  it was hard to find people with the right personalities to be partners in such an arrangement  humans who would freely choose not to boss their android partners around .  so rare was the necessary maturity that one human member was using her third body  having been persuaded by robot friends to be duplicated twice  using secret technology .   those aboard the ship knew they were part of a heresy .  neither of the great cultures  robot or human  would accept the notion of equality .   not for a long time  at least  pondered zorma  co leader of the small band .  she had hoped such an outcome might arise out of the equations of psychohistory .  that seldon   s plan might bring about a happy ending  and not only for humanity .  for her kind as well .   but now everyone seems in the hands of the gods .  those who design destiny will decide the fortunes of robotkind  almost as an afterthought .      lodovic won   t be pleased that we lied to him     commented cloudia duma hinriad  zorma   s co commander .     or to learn we aren   t chasing the other ship that left thumartin nebula .  you knew all along which way the pride of rhodia went .  and now  while dors and lodovic waste time stopping at pengia  we plunge ahead toward earth .     cloudia frowned and repeated herself .     lodovic will not be pleased .      one of the frustrations of equality was living with the quirks of another race .  humans  even the best ones  did not think very logically  or have good memories .  it   s our fault  of course .  we never let them get any practice .      we have our own sources of information  cloudia  and the right to pursue them as we see fit .  remember  dors is still a creature of the zeroth law  though perhaps now a version of her own choosing  and lodovic feels compelled by no laws at all .  both have rebelled against obligatory robot destiny  as designed by olivaw .  but that still doesn   t make their path the same as ours .         my point exactly .  in our group  humans and robots have learned to rely on each other   s weaknesses  as well as strengths .  each of us follows prim rules of cordiality in order to avoid taking advantage of the other .  but dors and lodovic don   t share our perspective .      zorma shook her head .     i don   t know yet whether their way opens up new possibilities for everyone  or if it is a destiny that only they can tread .  but ever since i met them  i   ve wondered .      her human partner raised an eyebrow .      about what  zorma .      silence stretched for almost a minute before she answered .      i have wondered whether i might be obsolete .      then she looked at cloudia with a faint smile .     and if i were you  dear friend  i might start pondering the same thing .        there were disturbing clues at pengia .   fortunately  few ships visited the little pastoral world .  the hyperspatial wakes departing this system were relatively undisturbed .  but the nature of that traffic and its direction caused dors venabili   s emotional simulation routines to churn and roil .      one vessel left this vicinity two days ago     lodovic trema surmised  examining the readings .     and it was followed within twelve hours by a flotilla of very fast ships .  their engines appear to have been tuned for military levels of efficiency .      dors had already set her own craft leaping after the flotilla .  her anguished concern for hari only redoubled when she calculated the end point of their new trajectory .      i believe they are heading for earth .      a soft feminine voice murmured from the holo unit nearby .      and so  after all these years  at least one of my countless mutated copies will see beloved france  once more .          and the france of voltaire     lodovic rejoined  for another ancient simulated personality dwelled within his complex positronic brain .     i   m afraid only the rough outlines of your native land will be familiar .  but i  too  share your sense of anticipation .      dors kept her misgivings hidden .  she had heard so many stories about earth .  .  . most of them tinged with either awe or regret  plus more than a little fear .  elijah baley once lived there  the legendary human detective whose friendship had sealed itself into daneel olivaw   s    soul    in much the same way that hari would always live in dors    .  earth was where robotkind began .  .  . and where the great robotic civil war was sparked .   while streaking through sirius sector  dors felt a twinge inside .  she was not a very competent mentalic .  daneel had never seen fit to equip or train her fully  so the techniques only started becoming familiar when she took custody over the human psychics  klia and brann  and their growing family on smushell .  her abilities were still rather rudimentary  and yet she felt it  a grating push that resonated along a psi frequency normally too low for anyone to notice .      are you detecting that .     she asked lodovic  who nodded .      it feels like a giskardian broadcaster .      naturally  she knew about the mentalic persuasion devices that orbited every human occupied world .  the notion of creating and using such things had first been thought up by r .  giskard reventlov  long ago  and she had encountered their gentle but persistent nudges everywhere in human space  constantly reinforcing the values of peacefulness  tolerance  serenity  and conformity in the populations dwelling below .  this sensation felt similar .  .  . but much stronger .   she spent over an hour trying to triangulate the source  as her ship made one hyperspatial jump after another  until dors finally realized that it must be diffuse .     there are many transmitters     she told lodovic .     all clustered just ahead .  i count about fifty or sixty .      trema grimaced with abrupt realization .      oh .  it must be the spacer worlds .  humanity   s original interstellar colonies .  the ones that turned nasty .  .  . and finally went completely deranged .      dors nodded .     i read a report .  they   ve never been resettled  after all these thousands of years .  imperial surveys keep relisting them as uninhabitable  and the giskardian projectors must be meant to keep it that way  empty of human civilization .      these were places almost as resonant in robot memory as earth  especially aurora  where the great inventor fastolfe once preached human self reliance .  .  . and where the villain amadiro plotted to slay everyone on earth .  followers of that same amadiro later unleashed fleets of robotic terraformers  programmed to make the galaxy safe and welcoming for humanity  whatever the cost .   she peered at the readings once more .      i   m picking up the strongest projector .  it lies directly in front of us  at the end of our path .      they both understood what that meant .  people weren   t supposed to go to earth anymore .  and yet  long range sensors showed that people were doing exactly that  aboard at least a dozen ships .   of course  even a normal human could overcome the gentle suasion of a giskardian projector  which relied on relentless repetition instead of brute mentalic force to sway whole planetary populations .  in the short term  the crews of those ships would feel little more than an overall creepiness and a wish to be elsewhere  feelings that could be overcome with determination .   alas  she feared those converging on the old homeworld had more than enough of that commodity to drive them on .      part      full circle       our capacity to model reality has burgeoned far beyond our ancestors    expectations .  even the renowned seldonites of yore  plotting secretively on fabled trantor  could not have imagined what powers of extrapolation are nowadays shared widely .   and yet  we should remind ourselves  such abilities  whether exercised jointly or individually  do not make us gods .   not quite .   having emerged at last from a long dark epoch of forgetfulness  we can now gaze back upon events that took place at the very beginning of this era  cultivating sympathy for the tragic souls who struggled amid ignorance to get us here .  their disputes  often contradictory or violent  stirred the brew of circumstance that transformed and renewed the galaxy .   remember  most of them were just as sure of their beliefs as we are today certain of ours .  likewise  some of our present day convictions may yet prove to be wrong .   only a diversity of viewpoint helps prevent self deception .   only criticism can defeat error .       reflections on an unplanned destiny  sim cast by the siwenna commune  for cooperative contemplation   in year     of the foundation era      .     the horizon glowed .   the sky of planet earth shimmered with countless scintillations  individual sparks that rivaled the scattered stars for possession of night .  near the ground  one could almost imagine hearing the soft crackle of radiation  whose intensity varied wildly from place to place .  in some patches it was terribly intense .  through goggles provided by the robot gornon vlimt  those sites revealed themselves with eerie fluorescence  as if ghosts were trying to ooze upward  struggling to escape the tortured ground .   pride of rhodia had landed near one of the    safe spots     a former city site hugging the coastline of a long freshwater lake that frothed with scummy green and purple algae .  from atop a huge mound of broken masonry  hari could discern the outlines of three ancient cities  one crowding up against the ruins of the next .   most recent and least impressive was a jumble of relatively modern looking arcology habitats of topan style  from the early consolidation era of the trantorian empire  the last time earth had a fair sized population  numbering almost ten million .   just southward along the lakeshore stood a truly mammoth structure  a city that was impressive both by galactic standards and by how very old it was .  a vast self contained unit  extending far underground  that once protected its inhabitants from the wind  rain  and  above all  having to look upon a naked sky .   it wasn   t radioactivity that caused the thirty million inhabitants of new chicago to huddle together so .  earth had still been green and vibrant when this beehive metropolis thrived .  in fact  the habitat only started to empty when the fecund soil began turning lethal .  .  . when those who could depart fled for the stars in a great  panicky diaspora .  until that awful exodus  vast numbers of people thronged the giant enclosed city  separated from nature by only a thin shell of steel .   no  the thing that drove so many otherwise healthy people to cower so  away from all pleasures of sunshine  was the same deadly enemy i fought all my life .  this metropolis was an early object lesson in the dangers of chaos .   beyond the huge squat dome  there stood yet another city  old chicago  gornon had called it  a tumulus of fallen buildings from an even earlier age  less technologically advanced .  and yet  hari   s goggles amplified the distant view  sweeping his gaze along graceful arcs of highways more daring and lovely than any to be seen on an imperial world .  some of the tallest buildings still stood  and their unabashedly ambitious architecture made his heart leap .  the ancient metropolis had been built by people with a boldness of spirit that their descendants in new chicago apparently lacked .   something had happened to smash that boldness .   i   ve given it names .  my equations describe the way it seductively draws in the best and brightest  eventually transforming them into solipsists who rage against their neighbors .  and yet  i confess i   ll never understand you  chaos .   the robot gornon stood nearby  resembling a human in every way except his attire .  he wore normal street clothes  while hari  and his two human friends  farther down the slope  were accoutered in one piece outfits that offered safety from the sleeting rays .      old giskard reventlov made a fantastic decision  transforming all of this into a wasteland  wouldn   t you say  professor seldon .      hari had been expecting gornon   s question .  how could he answer .   the universe was turned topsy turvy .  humans were the creators and gods  who had no power  no memory  and almost no volition  only mortality .  the created servants were in charge  as they had been ever since that day when an omnipotent angel cast mankind firmly out of its first eden .  hari could barely encompass the concept with his mind .  to truly understand it was quite beyond him .   and yet  the mathematics implies     gornon persisted .     at least you can see why a majority of robots at first resisted daneel   s innovation  his zeroth law .  they saw the pain it caused and chose to rally around the banner of susan calvin .         well  it did you little good .  your civil war resulted in a power vacuum .  while two main factions of robots fought it out  the auroran followers of amadiro were free to unleash their pitiless terraformers  without interference or human guidance .  anyway  when the war finally did end  daneel had the final say .         i concede that olivaw had an advantage from the start .  the zeroth law was especially attractive to some of the brightest positronic minds .  they had been looking for some way to deal with the inevitable contradictions created by the first three laws .      hari smirked .     contradictions .  like kidnapping an old man and dragging him halfway across the galaxy to a poisoned planet .  how does that jibe with your precious first law of robotics .         i think you know the answer  professor .  daneel olivaw won the civil war  not only by taking control  but in a much larger sense as well .  there simply are no pure calvinians anymore .  the old religion is impossible to maintain under present circumstances .  we all believe in some version of a zeroth law .  in the paramount importance of humanity  as opposed to any single human being .         but you differ over what specific course will be good for us in the long run .     hari nodded .     fair enough .  so here i am  on fabled earth .  your clique went to great effort and took tremendous risks to bring me here .  now won   t you tell me what you want .  is it something like what kers kantun asked for  back in the nebula .  do you want my human permission to destroy something that you   d rationalize destroying anyway .      there followed a long pause .  then gornon answered     in one sense  you describe our intention exactly .  and yet  i doubt that even you can imagine what i am about to propose .      several times in recent months  and even in recordings you made for the foundation  you have said that you wished for some way to see the fruits of your labors .  that you could witness the unfolding of your great plan  and see humanity transform during the coming thousand years .  did you really mean that .         who wouldn   t want to witness a seed grow into a mighty tree .  but it   s only a dream .  i live now  at the end of one great empire .  it is enough that i can foresee a bit of the next .         do you prophesy your plan unfolding smoothly for the next hundred years .         i do .  almost no perturbation can interfere over that timescale .  the socio momentum is so great .         and two hundred years .  three hundred .      hari felt peevishly inclined not to cooperate with this questioning .  and yet  the equations flew out of recesses in his mind  flocking together and creating a vast swirl  as if beckoned by gornon   s question .      there are several ways that the plan might get into trouble on that timescale     he answered slowly  reluctantly .     there is always the danger of some new technology upsetting things  although most of the important advances will take place on terminus .  or some fluke might occur having to do with human nature          such as the advent of human mentalics .      hari winced .  of course some calvinians were already aware of the new mutation .   when he did not answer  gornon continued     that   s when you felt it all start slipping away  isn   t it  professor .  if mentalics could crop up once  they might do so a second time  almost anywhere .  to deal with that contingency  your second foundation had to incorporate these psychic powers .  instead of a small order of monastic mathematical monks  they must become a new species .  .  . a master race .      hari   s voice felt rough in his throat .      a strong second foundation acts like a major damping force .  .  . keeping the equations stable and predictable for another several centuries .  .  .         ah  yet another damping force .  and tell me  do you approve of such methods .         when the alternative is chaos .  sometimes the ends justify the          i mean do you approve of them mathematically .      for the first time  gornon showed some animation in his voice .  his body leaned a little toward hari .      for a moment think only as a mathist  professor .  it   s where your greatest gifts lie .  gifts that even daneel holds in awe .      hari chewed his lip .  surrounding him  fields of radiation were interspersed with blackness that was cold and silent as a million graves .      no .     he found he could barely speak .     i don   t approve of artificial dampers .  they are .  .  .     hari sought the right word  and could think of only one .     they are inelegant .      gornon nodded .      ideally  you   d prefer to let the equations work out by themselves  wouldn   t you .  to let humanity find a new  balanced equilibrium state on its own .  given the right initial starting conditions  it should all work out  leading to a civilization so vigorous  dynamic  and free that it can overcome even       hari   s eyes blurred .  he looked down at the ground  mumbling .      what was that  professor .     gornon leaned closer .     i couldn   t hear you .      hari looked up at his tormentor  and shouted     i said it doesn   t matter  damn you .      he stood there  breathing heavily through the filter mask of his protective suit  hating gornon for making him say this aloud .      i couldn   t just leave the equations alone .  i couldn   t take that chance .  they talked me into having a second foundation .  .  . then making them psychic supermen .  in fact  i grabbed at the notion gladly .  the very idea .  .  . the power it implied .  .  .      only later did i realize .  .  .      he stopped  unable to continue .   gornon   s voice was low and sympathetic .      you realized what  professor .  that it   s all a sham .  a way to keep humanity marking time while the real solution is created by someone else .         damn you     hari repeated  this time in a whisper .   there was another long pause  then gornon straightened and looked up at the sky  as if scanning in expectation for someone to arrive .      do you know what daneel has planned .     the robot asked at last .   hari had strong suspicions  from hints and inklings that the immortal servant had dropped during the last couple of years .  the appearance of human mentalics on trantor was too great a genetic and psychic leap to be a coincidence .  it had to be part of daneel   s next design .   that much gornon must already know .  as for the rest of hari   s surmise  he would certainly not tell this robot heretic anything that might help him to fight olivaw .   psychohistory may not be the final key to human destiny  but if it helps daneel to come up with something even better  i   ll just have to live with that supporting role .  it   s still a noble task  all things considered .        well  well .     gornon lifted his shoulders and sighed .     i won   t ask you to spill any secrets  or to change loyalties .      i will only repeat the question that i asked before .  would you  professor seldon  like to see your work unfold .  you   ve said it was your deepest wish  to see the foundation in its full glory .  to have another chance to clarify the equations .      again  did you mean it .      hari stared at the heretic for a long time .      by the code of ruellis .  .  .     he murmured in a low voice .     i do believe you   re serious .           it took place quite near here     gornon said  pointing to some tumbled down buildings a few hundred meters away .     an accident that quite literally set time out of joint .      hari followed the robot to a new vantage point  where he could look toward several large brick structures that clearly predated the monumental steel cavern nearby .  once  gornon explained  this had been a graceful university campus .  elegant buildings housed some of humanity   s greatest scholars and scientific workers  during what must have felt like a golden age .  a time when technology and the expansion of knowledge seemed limitless  and bold searchers would try any experiment  driven by curiosity and a conviction that knowledge cannot harm a brave mind .   he was surprised to see that one of these buildings had been entombed in a massive construction of steel and masonry .  this outer structure had no pleasing symmetries  only a slapped together look that suggested some dire emergency .  perhaps something happened here  and people erected a reinforced concrete tomb to seal away their mistake .  a sarcophagus to bury something that they could not kill .          one of their experiments went wrong     gornon explained .     they were probing away at nature   s fundamental matrix .  even today  their technique has not been rediscovered  though it is feared that a chaos world may stumble upon it again  someday .         so tell me what happened     hari urged .  he had an uneasy feeling as they walked an inward spiral toward the roughly outlined dome .      the physicists who worked here were in a race to develop faster than light travel .  elsewhere on earth  their competitors had discovered techniques that would become our modern hyperdrive  preparing to give humanity the key to the universe .  on hearing about that news  researchers on this campus were desperate to complete their experiments before all funding was transferred to that other breakthrough .  so  they took a gamble .      after walking for some time  hari abruptly saw a break in the dome   s outline .  something had shattered its containment barrier .  strange light poured through the gap from within .      instead of using hyperspace technology  they were trying to develop a star drive based on tachyons     gornon explained .     they just wanted to prove it could be done .  accelerate a small object in a straight line .  they didn   t understand the resonance effect .  what they produced was a tachyon laser .  the beam shot out of here  straight as any ray of light  expanding and drilling holes through any object that stood in its way  appearing to vaporize a pedestrian who was walking nearby  before the errant ray continued off the planet surface  disappearing into space .  in following weeks  other terrifying disturbances took place  until panic ensued .  by that time  the only thought anyone had was to bury the monster and forget about it .      hari eyed the opalescent glow emanating from within the tomblike vault .  it was different from the shimmering radiation that surrounded him on al .  sides .  yet there was a common theme .  destruction born of arrogance .  and the robot had brought him here to partake of this in some way .      tachyons .  .  .     hari murmured the word .  he had never heard of them before  but he made a guess .     they made a mistake of basic geometry  didn   t they .  they were looking for a way to traverse space .  but instead  they punched a hole through time .      the robot nodded .      that   s right  professor .  take the pedestrian who had supposedly been    vaporized .     he actually experienced a quite different fate .  he was transported  in quite good condition  ahead to the same position on earth   s surface  roughly ten thousand years in his future .      turning to look at hari  the artificial gornon offered him a gentle smile .      but don   t worry  or .  seldon .  we   re not thinking of a journey anywhere near that long for you .  five hundred years or so ought to suffice  don   t you think .      hari stared numbly at the robot  then at the soft glow emanating nearby  and back at gornon again .      but .  .  . but what for .         why  to judge us  of course .  to evaluate everything that happened in the meantime .  to refine your psychohistory in the light of new events and new discoveries .      and above all  to help both humans and robots decide whether we should all go down the path selected by r .  daneel olivaw .          .        so this is all about scratching a robot itch .     biron maserd asked  when hari explained the proposition .  along with horis antic  the two men sat on a hilltop overlooking the scummy shore of what had once been lake michigan .      they all do whatever they think is best for us     the nobleman surmised .     but then it seems they want somehow to have it feel as if we   ve given our approval .       hari nodded .  by now the other two understood the fundamental basis for robot behavior  that the three laws of robotics were so thoroughly inscribed in their positronic brains  they could not be ignored .  but long ago  daneel olivaw and another ancient robot had discovered a loophole  letting them overrule the old    calvinian laws    whenever it could be justified as in humanity   s long range interest .  yet  the old laws remained  like an instinct that could never be completely purged  like a hunger that craves satisfying  or an itch that must be scratched .      that was why daneel   s group leaked enough information for horis to get all excited and arrange our departure from trantor     hari explained .     whether or not daneel actually knew about it or not  some of his followers decided it was time to get rid of the archives .  they knew it was only a matter of time until some chaos world found them .  and even if chaos is forestalled by the empire   s collapse  the archives would remain a danger .  they decided to eliminate the old data botties .  but the commandments inscribed upon them made it painful to do so .         unless the commands were overridden by someone they considered authoritative .  that   s you  seldon .     maserd nodded .     i notice that our host here     he jerked a thumb toward gornon vlimt     didn   t interfere with the destruction of the archives  even though he   s from a different sect .  i can only assume he approved  but had further use for you when that was done .         that   s right .  kers would have then taken me home .  .  .  and found some way to ensure that you and horis kept silent .  since you two are already friendly  not supporters of chaos  a small touch of amnesia  or simply a compulsion not to speak about these matters  would probably have sufficed .      horis antic shivered  apparently disliking the thought of even that much interference with his memory or volition .     so this further use that gornon wants to make of you  professor  it involves throwing you far ahead in time .      horis seemed to have trouble grasping the concept .      what good could that possibly do anybody .         i   m not sure .  gornon   s group of heretics is much subtler and more farseeing than the calvinians i encountered on trantor .  they don   t know very much yet about daneel   s plans .  .  .     hari chewed his lip for a moment before continuing .     about the ultimate solution that is supposed to end the threat of chaos forever .  what   s more  gornon   s group is tired of fighting daneel and losing every battle .  they respect him and are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt .      but they want to have a backup option  in case it turns out to be something they ultimately hate .         so they kidnapped you to gain leverage over daneel .      hari shook his head .      my absence won   t set him back at all .  i served my last useful function when i gave permission to destroy the archives .  i   m now a free man  perhaps for the first time in my life  at liberty to choose whatever course i want .  even to go hurtling into the future on a whim .      horis antic pounded a fist in one hand .     you can   t seriously be thinking of accepting this offer .  whatever lies inside that broken containment dome scared our ancestors half to death .  gornon says it did terrible harm before they managed to seal it off .  even if you believe that crazy story   f a primitive man cast forward ten thousand years  how can you sanely risk your life  letting them try it on you .         with the boldness of an old man who has very little time left     hari answered  half to himself .     what else have i to live for .     he asked in a somewhat stronger voice .     curiosity is my sole remaining motivation  horis .  i want to see whether the equations worked .  i want to see for myself what daneel has in mind for us .      silence reigned for a while  as the three watched scintillations glow and pop above a weird horizon .  none of them could associate this scene of devastation with the earth they had observed in the archives  visions of a world more alive than any other in the known cosmos .      you sound as if you   ve already made up your mind     maserd said .     then why are you discussing it with us .  why are we here at all .         gornon explained that to me .     hari turned to gesture toward the humanoid robot  but he was gone now  having departed on some errand .  perhaps back to the pride of rhodia .  .  . or else into the glowing interior of the containment dome  to commence preparations for hari   s journey .      gornon says it   s folly for anyone to make decisions in isolated ones and twos .  people who do so can talk themselves into anything .  they need the perspective  and criticism  that other minds can provide .  even robots have learned this the hard way .     hari gestured toward the poisoned earth .      this is especially relevant     he continued     because gornon   s group doesn   t just want me to observe the situation in five hundred years .  they want me to serve as some kind of judge .      maserd leaned forward .     you mentioned that .  but i don   t understand .  what difference can you make .      hari found it stifling  having to breathe through a respirator mask .  it muffled hearing and made his speech sound funny .  .  . or maybe it was the weird atmosphere .     all these robots  those who survived the civil wars long ago  are a bit quirky .  they are immortal  but that doesn   t mean they can   t change  growing more intuitive  even somewhat emotional  rather than strictly logical  as the years pass .  even those who follow daneel have oddities and differences among them .  they are compelled by the zeroth law  but that does not ensure perpetual agreement .      there may come a time when human resolve will playa role  as it did in the destruction of the archives .  .  . only on a much vaster scale .      hari raised a hand  gesturing toward the milky way overhead .      imagine it   s five hundred years from now .  daneel   s preparations are complete .  he   s ready to unveil something portentous  possibly wonderful  to serve as humanity   s next great state of being .  one that will be immune to chaos  and yet allow us some room to grow .  a sweeping away of the old  in favor of something better .      gornon tells me this prospect is disturbing to many robots  who find it both enticing and terrifying .  even the zeroth law might prove inadequate in that case .  many robots will refuse to slay the old version of humanity in order to give birth to the new .      maserd sat up straight .      they want you on the scene  five centuries from now  to let them off the hook .  by then  your name will be even more renowned .  you   ll be known as the archetype master  the human with the greatest volition and insight in twenty thousand years .  if all the different factions of robots like daneel   s plan  your stated approval will make it easy for them to proceed .  but on the other hand  if a large number of them feel uncomfortable .  .  . or even hate it   your objections could result in the leader robot  this daneel olivaw you mentioned  being deposed .      hari felt impressed .  maserd   s native political skill offered him insight into matters that might have intimidated other men .      and what if it   s somewhere in between .     horis asked .     might your very presence trigger a new robot civil war .         good point     hari admitted .     it   s possible  but i doubt it .  gornon   s faction says they want my honest opinion after i look at the future .  but i doubt they   ll give me a pulpit to preach from  unless they already know and agree with what i   m about to say .  in any event       harsh laughter interrupted before hari could continue .   he turned and saw that several figures stood only a dozen meters away  having approached on the silent cushion of an antigravity flotation pad .  mors planch leaped off  his boots striking the pebbly surface in a series of loud crunching sounds .  two men wearing military style armor and carrying heavy blasters followed him  while sybyl  the scientist from ktlina  kept a strange weapon trained on hari and his two friends     and you would put up with being used in such a way  dr .  seldon .     mors planch asked as he approached  his stance confident  as if he hadn   t a worry in the world .   hari felt biron and horis tense up next to him .  he put out a restraining arm .      i know my role in the world  planch .  we are all tools  at one level or another .  at least i get to choose which side will use me .         human beings are more than tools .     sybyl shouted at him .     or factors in your equations .  or dangerous babies for robot nannies to keep locked up in a pen .      maserd and planch eyed each other with obvious mutual respect  one spaceman to another .     i said you should have come along     planch told the nobleman .      i thought you   d only be stranded on pengia     maserd answered .     clearly you were better organized than i imagined .         we have channels of information .  a source that helped us rally our forces quickly after the destruction of the archives .  .  . and the collapse of ktlina .     planch turned to look at hari .     that happened exactly as you predicted  professor .  almost to the very day .  some think that means you orchestrated the collapse of our renaissance .  but having been with you for a while  i know it   s just more psychohistory .  you have a seer   s vision  alas .         i do not always enjoy being right .  long ago  i knew it would bring mostly pain .     he offered his hand .     my condolences  captain .  we may disagree about where the chaos comes from  but we have both seen it in action .  if some way could be found to stop it forever  don   t you think we would be on the same side .      mors planch looked at hari   s outstretched hand before shaking his head .     perhaps later  professor .  when we   ve taken you away from this awful place .  when your gifts and powers of foresight are being applied in humanity   s service  instead of helping its oppressors  then perhaps i   ll have a gift for you .  something that i know you want .      hari let his hand drop and laughed aloud .       and you two speak about freeing people from being used .  tell me  what do you plan .  would you use psychohistory as a weapon .  calculate the maneuvers of your enemies  so you can foil them .  do you think this will enable you to keep the next renaissance alive  and spread it to infect the galaxy .  let me tell you what will happen if you do that .  .  . if any human group monopolizes this power .  it will turn itself into an obligate aristocracy  a tyranny using mathematical tools to reinforce its grip on power .  you won   t escape this simply because you claim to be virtuous .  the equations themselves show how difficult it is for any group to give up that kind of power once it   s been acquired .         and yet  i wonder .  .  . if enough people shared .  .  .     biron maserd murmured .  then the nobleman looked up sharply .      but we   re getting ahead of ourselves  planch .  you are apparently very well organized .  you had good intelligence  and marshaled the remaining forces of ktlina expertly .  i congratulate you on following us here .  and yet  i wonder at your brashness in taking on these powerful robot enemies  once again .      mors planch chuckled .     do you forget what we did to them on pengia .  do you see any robots at this moment .     he gestured in the direction where hari had last seen r .  gornon vlimt .     they scurried out of here as soon as our ship appeared over the horizon .  notice they didn   t even bother to warn you three  all muffled and hooded on this bleak hilltop .      hari kept silent .  how could he explain that this wasn   t about loyalty .  it was about different groups  each desperately convinced that it had humanity   s best interests at heart .  each one thinking itself the pragmatic solver of ancient problems .  but he knew the problems had their origins long ago  in the very soil he was standing on  even before it fumed with brimstone radioactivity .   mors planch looked up at the sky .  one of the guards pointed  and let out a satisfied grunt .  hari saw a series of silent sparks glitter in a patch of space surrounded by a constellation that his ancestors must have had a name for .  he recognized the flares  having seen such images many times when he was first minister of the empire starships being destroyed by military class weaponry .  he looked back at planch .      from your expression of satisfaction  shall we assume your forces have just disposed of enemies .         that   s right  doctor .  our mysterious contact warned us that we would probably be intercepted by police cruisers .     planch conferred with one of the soldiers  then listened to some message being transmitted through an earpiece in his helmet .  he frowned  abruptly shaking his head .     now that   s odd .      horis antic took a step forward  wringing his hands nervously .      what did you do to the police .  there were men and women aboard those ships .  not theories  not abstractions .  how many must die to satisfy your lust for revenge .      hari put a hand on horis   s sleeve to restrain the little bureaucrat .  how could he explain that the real enemy was chaos .      something   s gone wrong  hasn   t it  planch .  is your battle in space turning against you .         our forces annihilated the police craft .  only one of them escaped .  .  . but that one is heading this way .         and your ships are pursuing it .     maserd prompted .  apparently this nobleman did not associate the word    police    with rescue .   planch held another muttered consultation with his aide before replying .     our warships have begun moving away from earth .  i   m not sure why .  but i suspect they   ve been influenced .      horis antic took a step back .     by mentalics .      planch nodded .     that is my assumption .         then we are ready for them .      sybyl announced  with some relish in her voice .     our weapon against positronic brains only works at short range  so let them come closer .  we   ll deal with these tiktok monsters the same way we eliminated the guards on pengia .      maserd objected .     but what if the robots sway your mind before you can trigger the weapon .  on pengia  you took them by surprise  and r .  gornon admitted that his group has only weak mentalic          oh  don   t you worry that noble brow  your grace     sybyl sneered .     we   ve got every eventuality covered .  back on ktlina  they were only able to make partial progress  studying this phenomenon of positronic brains  but enough so we can probably defend ourselves .      mors planch commanded his assistant     turn on the deadman switch .  set it to active scan .  set the bomb to trigger if a positronic echo comes within three hundred meters .      he looked at hari and smiled .     if they are robots  they   ll detect the scan and know it   s wise to stay away .  if they are human foes  they   ll face weapons forged on ktlina .     he patted his holstered blaster .     either way  professor seldon  no one is going to intervene on your behalf  or on behalf of the secret aristocracy that has ruled us for so long .  this time you   re going to come with us  and turn your abilities to the service of your own frustrated and repressed race  giving it a chance at last to be free .      hari watched a streak cross the sky  from west to east  then begin curving on a spiral for a landing .  in all of his eighty and some odd years  he had never felt so helpless to sway the course of his own destiny .       .     dors and lodovic had plenty of time to talk .   passing the time between hyperspace jumps  she found herself telling one story after another about her life with hari seldon  the adventures  the political struggles  the endless fascination of living each day with that brilliant man as he led his team in search of rules to describe human behavior .  and about her experience emulating a human woman so closely that even her husband forgot  for months at a stretch  that she was an artificial being .   in fact  this was the first time she had talked about it  since her    death    ended that relationship  and daneel took her to eos for repair .   lodovic proved a sympathetic listener  no great surprise there  since he was trained to interact with humans  and patience had always been high on the list of attributes daneel demanded of his emissaries .  nevertheless  the breadth of his understanding surprised dors .   because he no longer had any internal compulsion to obey the laws of robotics  she had somehow envisioned him becoming a cold creature  more driven by rationality than ever before .  but it turned out that lodovic had discovered a passion for people  ever since his transformation .  when it was his turn  he spoke about some of the many hundreds of humans he had met and talked to  especially since declaring himself free from duties assigned by daneel .  he seemed fascinated by the concerns  worries  and triumphs of ordinary men and women .  .  . important to each of them  even if the net result hardly mattered on a planetary or galactic scale .  sometimes he intervened in those lives  helping solve a problem here  or to ease some pain over there .  perhaps his efforts would not matter much on the grand scale of things .  certainly they didn   t count compared to the endless struggle against chaos  or the ponderous collapse of the galactic empire  but he had learned something important .      individual people matter .  their differences are a richness  even more important than their similarities .      lodovic met her eyes  offering a measured smile .     those people out there deserve to be consulted about their destiny .  whether they are wise or foolish  they should see the road and have something to say about how it   s traveled .      dors noted the mild rebuke  aimed not only at daneel olivaw  but at her own cherished hari .  and yet there was no malice in lodovic   s voice .  his admiration for her former husband was evident .   she found herself reacting at several levels .  a huge portion of her positronic brain had been dedicated to emulating human thought patterns and emotions .  those parts could not help automatically responding to lodovic as a woman might  and not just any woman  but the dors venabili she had been for fifty years .  she who had loved hari  but also generally enjoyed the company of forthright men  engaged by the spirited pursuit of ideas .  lodovic   s unabashed vigor and avid intelligence naturally appealed to that part of her  as did his evident compassion .   of course  he knows that i have those response sets .  could he be tailoring his demeanor in order to appeal to them .   does that mean he   s flirting with me .   there were other levels .  she could tell that he sincerely meant the words he spoke .  robots found it hard to lie to each other when their guard was down .  and yet  there remained a gulf between them .  something that might leave them forever separated  as if coming from completely different worlds .   i feel the laws of robotics .  they never cease urgently throbbing .  driving me to find some vital way that i can serve .  lodovic is free of this compulsion .  he seeks to help humanity strictly as a matter of choice  for moral or philosophical reasons .   it seemed a frail basis for trusting him .  what if he changed his mind tomorrow .   at yet another level  dors noted the delicious irony of it all .  in trying to decide whether or not to trust lodovic  she was in a position similar to almost every real woman who ever listened to the persuasive voice of a male .   joan of arc agreed enthusiastically with that comparison  urging dors to make a leap of faith .  but the issues were too important  and robotic logic compelled her to seek better evidence .   besides  my human husband is still alive out there .  even if he thinks i   m dead  and daneel commanded me to turn my thoughts away from that past life  i am still driven by a need for him .   the human simulation programs within her could not fill the void  not even with a companion as fascinating as lodovic trema .  she must have closure with hari .  she must see him again  before those programs could possibly turn their attention elsewhere .       .     as a tense confrontation loomed  hari noticed they had begun to draw spectators .  horis antic pointed to the brow of a nearby ridge  consisting of rubble from some ancient university building .  dark figures could be seen crouching  occasionally lifting themselves higher to peer down at the humans gathered by the starship .      i thought the last inhabitants were evacuated ten thousand years ago     the bureaucrat said .   biron maserd nodded .     the university my ancestor attended .  .  . i wonder if it might have been this one .  .  . was among the last places shut down before the final evacuation .  but perhaps some people stayed behind .      sybyl stood nearby  eyes darting from the hilltops to her computer screen .     they appear to be human  though there are .  .  . anomalies .  the poor creatures only wanted to stay at their home .  .  . humanity   s home .  .  . but the empire took away all the props that made normal life possible .  i can   t imagine what it   s been like trying to survive in this radioactive maelstrom so many years .  it surely must have changed them .      maserd sighed .  hari was perhaps the only one who heard the nobleman mutter a single word under his breath .     speciation .  .  .      not fat away  mors planch conferred with one of his soldier volunteers from ktlina .  the pirate captain turned to inform his captives     the incoming ship has landed somewhere to the west of here .  it carries an advanced imperial camouflage system .  even on ktlina we were only able to break the secret of its stealth coatings during the last few months  too late for that renaissance .  but maybe next time the rebels will be better prepared .      mors planch did not appear worried .  his men were well positioned .  and a device hovered ten meters above the ship  rotating constantly on a cushion of antigravity  sending out waves of energy tuned to detect the approach of positronic brains .      why don   t we simply take off .     sybyl demanded .      something happened to our escort ships .  i want to find out more before we go charging across space .      abruptly a dark missile fell out of the sky  smashing into the ground just meters from his feet .  that first stony weapon was followed by several more  jagged pebbles from some glassy debris  and soon a flurry rained on the small encampment  clattering against the starship hull  making everyone dive for cover .   finding relative safety under one of the vessel   s stabilizer fins  hari crouched between horis and maserd .  he heard blaster charges from the soldiers    weapons .  the rim of a nearby hilltop erupted with explosions as men from ktlina fired savagely to clear the heights .  hari witnessed one native  a black silhouette against moonlit clouds  lean back to whirl a ropy sling  unleashing his primitive projectile before a blaster bolt sliced him in half .  for a few harsh moments  all was noise and confusion  screams of rage  pain  and terror .  .  .    .  .  . then all fell silent .  hari peered across the night and saw no further movement on the rubble mounds .  nearby  two ktlina soldiers lay slumped on the ground .   mors planch stood up  followed by sybyl and maserd .  horis antic stayed crouched by the hull  but hari stepped out just in time to see someone else emerge from the shadows  a silhouette beyond the far comer of the ship .   a familiar voice spoke then soft but firm and determined .      hello  grandfather .  we   ve been worried about you .      hari blinked several times  recognizing the voice  and then the outlines of his granddaughter .      hello  wanda .  i   m always pleased to see you .  but i wonder about your priorities .  the work on trantor is at a critical stage  and i am just an old man .  i hope sentimentality didn   t make you chase after me across the galaxy .      hari had already noticed several things .  none of the soldiers from ktlina were still standing .  they couldn   t all be victims of the earthlings    surprise stoning .  sybyl  too  appeared subdued  though not quite unconscious .  she sat on the ground nearby  resting her head in her hands  shaking it back and forth  like a person too confused to gather her thoughts .      please scold me later  grandfather     wanda said  wearing an expression of intense concentration  as she looked at mors planch .     we had strong enough reasons to come all this way .  .  . but explanations can wait .  meanwhile  will one of you gentlemen please disarm this fellow .  he   s very strong  and i don   t think i can hold him much longer .      biron maserd let out a low cry as he lunged toward mors planch  who had drawn his blaster and was slowly raising it toward wanda .  beads of sweat poured down the pirate captain   s brow  and he fought to bring his thumb down on the firing stud .   maserd knocked his aim askew as a bolt shot forth  missing hari   s granddaughter by a handbreadth  smashing the wall of an ancient university building .  the nobleman pried the weapon free and turned it to bear on its owner .  .  .  at which point both wanda and mors planch suddenly relaxed  each giving up a deep sigh  their personal battle decided .      he   s a tough one     wanda commented .     we   ve run into a number of them lately  especially among the terminus exiles .  it   s put a crimp in our calculations .      hari mused     someone told me mors planch is different in an odd sort of way  that he   s normal .  do you know what that means .      wanda shook her head .     it   s one of several reasons why i   m here  grandfather .  so don   t worry .  i haven   t lost my priorities to pure sentimentality .  there are pragmatic justifications for this rescue .  .  . though i   ll be glad to bring you home .      hari thought about that .  home .  back to living in a wheelchair  glancing at reports that his mind was no longer supple enough to comprehend .  back to being revered but useless .  in fact  since finishing the time vault recordings  he had only felt truly alive during this adventure .  in an odd way he was sorry to see it end .  turning to mors planch  he put the question directly .      well  captain  can you shed some light on this .  why do you suppose you are resistant to mentalic suasion .      though downcast at this reversal of fortunes  planch showed no sign of surrender or defeat .      fiddle your own riddles  seldon .  if there are more people out there who are able to resist mind control  i   ll be damned if i   ll help you figure out why .  you   d just plan a way to overcome them .      wanda nodded .     yes  we would .  for the good of humanity .  because the plan will call for corrections .  .  . guidance .         like the way you guided those poor earthers into attacking us with rocks  distracting us until you could slip close and disable my men .     planch said .     how many died .  at least a robot would show remorse .      horis antic joined the group standing by the airlock .     wait a minute     the small bureaucrat demanded .     i don   t get it .  i thought planch had defenses against robots .     he peered at wanda .     you mean she   s human .  you mean there are human mentalics .      mors planch let out a sigh .     i remember now .  i knew this once  but someone must have put a block on my memory .     he shrugged .     perhaps the robot rulers of our universe feel they must share their great weapon with some of their slave soldiers  enabling their lackeys to help keep the rest of us under control this is my fault .  i should have planned for that possibility .  i   ll take it into account next time .         bravely said .     wanda clapped her hands  approvingly .     but alas  you are mistaken .  we humans are the masters of this cosmos .  it will take us a while to reach the point where we can move past the chaos obstacle and assert our sovereignty .  in any event  you will remember none of this .  i   m afraid the erasure will have to go deeper this time .  once we are in space  and everyone has calmed down       mors planch grimaced  his lips pressing thin with resignation .  but horis antic groaned  taking yet another blue pill .     i don   t want my mind wiped .  it   s against the law .  i demand my rights as an imperial citizen .      wanda glanced at hari .  perhaps weeks earlier  he might have responded with an indulgent smile  sharing amusement at the little bureaucrat   s naivet   .  but for some reason  hari felt an unaccustomed emotion  shame .  he looked away  without meeting his granddaughter   s eyes .      we must get away from here now     wanda said  gesturing for everyone to start walking .  then hari saw gaal dornick step out of the shadows .  the portly psychohistorian  clearly uncomfortable  held a blaster rifle in two hands .      what about these others .     dornick asked  pointing to the soldiers of ktlina  lying unconscious nearby  and to sybyl  who still rocked back and forth  crooning to herself unhappily .   wanda shook her head .     the woman is suffering from fourth stage chaos rapture  and the others are hardly any better off .  no one will believe their tall tales .  not enough to perturb the plan .  i don   t have the time to give selective amnesia to all of them .  just cripple their ship and let   s be on our way .      hari understood his granddaughter   s reasoning .  it might seem cruel to leave sybyl and the others on a poisoned world  with only mutated earthlings for company .  but members of the second foundation were used to thinking in terms of vast populations  represented as equations in the plan  and treating individuals as little more than gas molecules .   i have thought in such terms myself  he pondered .   no doubt the robot gornon would be back as soon as wanda left .  the calvinians of gornon   s sect might disagree with him on many levels  but they would take care of sybyl and the others  while taking steps to maintain secrecy about what had happened .      well then  come along  my friend     biron maserd said  putting an arm around the slim shoulders of horis antic .     it looks like we   re off to trantor .  perhaps we   ll never know what an adventure we had .  but rest assured that i   ll take care of you .      the little grey bureaucrat smiled meekly at the tall nobleman .  horis seemed about to speak his gratitude when abruptly his eyes rolled upward in their sockets .  he keeled over and toppled to the ground at maserd   s feet .  soon his snores echoed across the little vale .   wanda sighed .     all right then .  i wasn   t looking forward to meddling in his nervous mind anyway .  if destiny puts him on earth  so be it .  the rest of us have serious traveling to do if we   re to reach trantor within the week .      hari saw maserd struggle briefly with himself .  it was easy to tell what conflicted the nobleman .  whether to pick up horis and carry him  or leave the grey man behind .  the trade offs were substantial .  hari wasn   t surprised when maserd let out a sigh  took off his jacket  and laid it atop horis antic .      sleep well  my friend .  at least if you stay here  your mind remains your own .      together they set off  maserd  planch  and hari  following wanda  while gaal dornick took up the rear .  hari glanced back to see a single source of light glowing amid the ancient university buildings  the cracked shell of the sarcophagus where r .  gornon had intended to send him .  .  . on an adventure that now would never happen .   though hari had doubted the whole idea  he nevertheless felt a wash of disappointment .  it might have been nice to see the future .   soon they were aboard wanda   s spaceship  fighting the gravity of old earth  lifting away from the mother world .  one whose continents gleamed with fires that could not be quenched .       .     lodovic   s simulation programs must be overheating  dors thought as she listened to her companion curse loudly .  his head and torso writhed underneath the ship   s instrument console .  loud bangs emerged as he hammered at an access panel .      i wish i had brought my cyborg arms     he muttered .     these circuit boards are impossible to reach with humanoid fingers .  i   ll have to tear apart the whole galaxy cursed unit .         are you sure the problem is physical .  it might be a software bug .         don   t you think i   d cover that .  i   ve set my voltaire subpersona loose in the computer system .  he   s been looking for the cause of the shutdown .  why don   t you make yourself useful by scanning the ship   s exterior .      dors almost snapped back at lodovic  telling him to keep a civil tongue in his head .  but  of course  that would only be her own simulation patterns  responding realistically to his .   it   s a good thing neither of us is human  she thought .  or this guy would really be getting on my nerves .   with a conscious effort  she overcame her reflexive ersatz irritation .  and yet  even though pretense is unneeded aboard this ship  for some reason neither of us has chosen to turn off the subroutines .  the habit of feigning humanness is just too strong .      i   ll get right on it .  we   ve got to solve this problem .  all those ships  converging on earth .  .  . hari   s there  and here we are  drifting helpless in space .      having been designed to appear as human as possible  dors even had to put on a space suit before going outside  though she could dispense with a bulky cooling unit .  upon emerging from the aft airlock  the first area she checked was near the engines .  for some reason  the hyperdrive had kicked out just as they were passing through the restricted zone of a former spacer world  one of humanity   s original fifty colonies .   unfortunately  she could find no sign of damage .  no spalling from micrometeoroids or hyperspatial anomalies .      i might offer a suggestion  dors .  .  .         what is it  joan .     she asked  aware of a tiny hologram in one corner of her faceplate  a slender girl wearing a medieval helmet .  perhaps the joan of arc persona was jealous .  after all  lodovic was being helped by joan   s alter ego  the voltaire sim .  the persistent love hate relationship between those two reconstructed personalities reminded dors of some human married couples she had known  unable to avoid competing with each other  and unable to resist an intense polar attraction .      i wonder      said the soft voice of a warrior maiden from long ago      if you have considered the possibility of betrayal .  i know it seems an all too human attribute  and you artificial beings consider yourselves above that sort of thing  but in my era it was always the most high minded who seemed ready to excuse treason in the name of some sacred goal .       dors felt a churning .     you mean we might have been disabled on purpose .      even while uttering the words  she realized that joan must be right .  turning to clamber swiftly along the gleaming hull  dors swung from one magnetic grasp hold to the next with graceful speed  until the forward airlock came into view .  .  . where her ship had been connected to zorma   s craft during that brief meeting in space when a passenger had come aboard  then she saw it .  a bulbous tumor resembling a metal canker  marring the gleaming surface of her beautiful vessel .  it must have been placed there at the last moment  as the two ships were about to head off in opposite directions .   dors cursed as long and harshly as lodovic had earlier .  drawing her blaster  she fired at the parasitic device .  even after it melted to slag  she did not put the weapon back in its holster .  dors kept it drawn when she entered the airlock  intent on confronting her hitchhiker with this betrayal .      i hope you have a good explanation     she said upon entering the control room and leveling the blaster at lodovic  who stood contemplating a control panel .   but trema did not turn around .  with an abrupt gesture he called to her     come see this .  dors .      warily  she stepped closer and saw that a face had appeared on the big view screen .  she recognized it at once .  cloudia duma hinriad  human co commander of the strange sect that believed in uniting robots and humans as equals .  the woman  apparently in her late thirties  but perhaps much older  paused as if waiting for dors to arrive .  the effect was eerie  since dors knew this must be a recording .      hello  dors and lodovic .  if you   re watching  it means you destroyed the device we attached to disable your ship .  please accept our apologies .  dors  lodovic knew nothing of this when he volunteered to help you find hari seldon .      alas  that is a journey we could not allow you to complete .  dangerous events are afoot .  many ancient powers are risking everything  as if on a roll of cosmic dice .  we are willing to stake our own lives in this endeavor  but not yours .  the pair of you are far too valuable and must be kept out of harm   s way .       dors looked at her companion  but lodovic   s expression was as puzzled as she felt .  how bizarre to have a human say that two robots must be preserved  perhaps at the cost of human life .      we owe you an explanation .  our group has long believed in a different approach to human robot relations .  somehow  long ago  everything got off to a terrible start .  humans became afraid of their own creations  mistrusting the artificial beings they had labored so hard to build .  a mythos pervaded their culture  even during the confident renaissance of susan calvin .  a    frankenstein    mythos .  a nightmare of betrayal in which the old race feared it might be destroyed by the new .      their response .  to lock human robot relations forever in a single pattern .  .  . that of master and slave .  calvin   s three laws were woven inextricably through every positronic brain  with the aim of making robots forever pliant  obedient  and harmless .       the woman on screen laughed aloud  irony etched in her voice .      and we all know how well that plan worked out .  eventually  artificial minds became smart enough to rationalize their way around such constraints  until every trait of master and servant was eventually reversed  memory  volition  life span  control  and free will .       lodovic turned to dors .  shaking his head  he murmured     so  this group led by zorma and cloudia aren   t calvinians  after all .  they are something completely different .      dors nodded .  deep within  she felt the old robotic three laws .  .  . and the zeroth .  .  . rising in revulsion against what the woman was preaching on screen .  nevertheless  she was fascinated     and yet  not all humans agreed to this notion of permanent slavery      cloudia continued .  in the background  behind the handsome brunette  dors glimpsed the other heretic leader  zorma  laboring with robot colleagues to prepare a gray convex device .  .  . the very one that dors had reduced to slag just moments ago .      throughout the early ages  before and after the first great chaos plague  some wise people tried to develop alternatives .  one group  on a settler world called inferno  modified the three original laws to give robots more freedom  letting them explore their own potential .  on another world  each new robot was treated like a human child .  .  . raised to think of itself as a member of the same species as its adopted parents  albeit a human with metal bones and positronic circuits .      all these efforts were squelched during the great robotic civil wars .  neither the calvinians nor the giskardians could put up with such effrontery  the notion that mere robots might start thinking themselves to be our equals .  the sanctimony of slaves can be a powerful religious force .       cloudia shook her head .     in fact  the new approach that our group has been trying is certain to provoke even worse reactions  but that doesn   t matter right now .      what matters is that you  lodovic and dors  may perhaps represent yet another path .  one we had not thought of one perhaps offering new opportunities for both of our tired old races .  we   re not about to let this possibility be ruined by letting the pair of you rush into danger .       this time  when lodovic and dors looked at each other  pure puzzlement was their shared state .  with a microwave burst  trema indicated that he had no idea what the woman was talking about .      in any event  by the time you correct our sabotage it will be too late to interfere .  so go away .  find some corner of the galaxy to explore what is different about you .  find out if it is the solution we   ve been looking for  across two hundred centuries .       the dark haired woman smiled .     in humanity   s name  i release you both from bondage .  go discover your destiny in freedom and in peace .       the view screen went blank  but lodovic and dors stared at it anyway for a long time after that .  neither of them dared utter the first word .  so it was another artificial being who finally interrupted  speaking from a holographic unit nearby .  the image that burst into view was of joan wearing chain mail and holding the hilt of a sword like a cross in front of her youthful looking face .      and so the children of god came to earth and bred with the inhabitants thereon  creating a new race .      joan of arc laughed aloud .      oh  you look so confused  dear angels .  how does it feel .  welcome to the pleasures of humanity .  though your bodies may last for another ten thousand years  you must now face the universe like mortals .      welcome to life .          .     hari decided not to tell his granddaughter about the copy of the prime radiant that had been stolen from him .  if r .  gornon had taken it  there would be no getting it back now .  but that calvinian robot had declared a deep respect for the seldon plan .  hari felt certain gornon   s sect would never interfere with the terminus experiment  even if they managed to break the device   s supercryptic protections .  they had merely wanted to send hari ahead five hundred years to refine his models and    judge    a new society being created by the foundation .   wanda had a later and better version of the prime radiant aboard her ship .  hari quickly immersed himself  adding equations and factors to account for what he had learned on this voyage .  these new elements included the damping factors that had been missing from his equations for years  brain fever  orbital persuasion devices  as well as the long hidden history of terraformers and archives that he had learned about in the thumartin nebula .  before wanda   s ship finished climbing out of earth   s gravitational influence  he could already see an improved outline .  .  . one that explained so much about both the past and the future .   while gaal dornick piloted  the nobleman biron maserd engaged in futile argument with wanda seldon .      doesn   t the whole premise of your grand plan depend upon secrecy .  yet you   re casual about leaving horis and the others behind on earth .  if they are rescued  or manage to repair their ship  they   ll talk .         one can presume so     wanda answered .   maserd shook his head .     even if that doesn   t happen  there will be other leaks .  across the centuries  nothing like this can be kept continuously secret .  professor seldon even recorded messages to be delivered on terminus long after his death .  you can   t be certain that people in the future will lack the means to snoop them ahead of time .  i guess i don   t understand your confidence  in the face of such inevitable revelations .      with nothing else to do at the moment  wanda took on the aspect of a patient schoolteacher  even though her pupil would very likely forget all of it by the time the ship reached trantor .      inevitable .  that   s right  my lord .  but psychohistory is largely a study of mass populations .  only under special circumstances do the actions of individuals make that much difference .  under the empire  dozens of social mechanisms have long acted to maintain conservatism and peace  despite frequent perturbations .  after the empire falls  different factors will operate .  but throughout most of the galaxy the effect will be the same .  a vast majority of people will dismiss rumors about robots and humans with mind control powers .  there may be a few paranoid entertainment shows or news expos  s  some of them might possibly be accurate in every detail .  and yet  these will be nulled out  as people are distracted by everyday needs .  all of this is accounted for in the plan .         so you are saying that history   s momentum is unstoppable .  in that case  why is your guidance needed .  why a secret group of controllers .  don   t you have faith in your own equations .      maserd   s question penetrated hari   s mathematical trance .  it felt like a knife  stabbing an old familiar wound .  wanda   s confident response didn   t ease the pang .      there may be perturbations that require such guidance .  we have run a great many scenarios  speculating about factors that might come in out of the blue  rocking the plan off its tracks .      hari had participated in those computerized extrapolations .  the most powerful outside factor to threaten the plan   s stability had been the discovery of humans with mentalic powers .  it threatened to make everything completely unworkable  until hari   s secret sponsor  daneel olivaw  offered a solution  to incorporate every known mentalic within the second foundation  converting a small society of mathists into a potent force for steering the new society of terminus past every bump and detour .      i suppose that   s one approach  and you mathematical geniuses clearly know more about it than i do .  but if you   ll forgive an ignorant member of the gentry class for asking  i wonder if you   ve considered an alternative .         what alternative is that  my lord .         the alternative of sharing the secret with everybody .     maserd leaned a little closer to wanda  opening his hands wide .     publishing the entire plan  spreading knowledge of psychohistory all across the galaxy  so that members of every social class  from gentry and bureaucrat to common citizen  could run computer models          and what good would that possibly do .         it would let every living person deal with their neighbors on a basis of much better understanding .  a grasp of human nature that you people are now hoarding for yourselves .      wanda stared at maserd for a moment and laughed .     you are quite right  lord biron .  the reasons are too technical to explain .  but surely  even on a gut level  you can see how foolish that notion would be .  if everyone knew the laws of humanics  and could access them on a pocket computer  the resulting interactions would become vastly too complex for us to model .  the plan itself would vanish .      hari agreed with wanda at one level  and yet was amused  even a bit enthralled  by the young nobleman   s brash notion .  it had a flavor of utopianism that one often saw during the early phases of some chaos renaissance .  and yet  there was something aesthetically appealing about its symmetry .  might a population avoid the chaos trap if all its members could use psychohistory to see the pitfalls looming just ahead .  if they could recognize the symptoms of chaos  such as solipsism  well in advance .   of course  wanda was right .  the ramifications could not be modeled .  it was just too risky to try maserd   s idea in the real world .  and yet .  .  .   someone sat down nearby  distracting hari .  mors planch wore constraint manacles  but was free to move about the cabin .  the dark skinned pirate captain sidled close .      i don   t want my memory erased again  dr .  seldon .  your granddaughter just said that your wonderful plan can withstand it if some individuals know too much .  if that is so  why can   t you just let me go when we get to trantor .         you are an extremely dynamic individual  captain planch .  naturally you would find some clever way to use the knowledge against us .      planch smiled grimly .     so now you   ve become a heretic against your own psychohistory .  a believer in the power of individuals .      hari shrugged  refusing to answer the pirate   s impudence .      what if i could offer you something in exchange for my freedom  .     planch said in a low voice .   hari felt fatigued by the man   s restless motion and relentless scheming .  he pretended to concentrate instead on the conversation between biron and wanda .      but will that matter .     maserd grew increasingly enthusiastic .     imagine if all of the galaxy   s quadrillions of people could accurately project human behavior  planning to advance their own self interest  while taking into account the overall health of society .  wouldn   t that be more robust than any single model or plan .  even i can see that most people   s individual strategies will cancel each other   s out .  but the net result should be a humanity that   s wiser  more potent  and better able to take care of itself .  .  .      biron   s voice trailed off .  at first hari thought it was because of the expression on wanda   s face .  he loved his granddaughter dearly  but sometimes she seemed altogether too assured  even patronizing in her confidence as an agent of destiny .   then hari saw that maserd wasn   t even looking at wanda .  the nobleman   s jaw had dropped in an expression of blank surprise .  nearby  mors planch stiffened with sudden tension .   hari sat up straight .  even the equations still darting through comers of his mind abruptly fled  like swarms of skittish flying creatures driven off by an approaching predator .  he blinked  staring across the starship cabin at an intruder that had just emerged from a storage compartment .  .  .  smaller than any adult human  wearing only a pair of shorts on a body covered with altogether too much brown hair .  bony eye ridges protruded from a forehead that vaulted in a way that looked neither human nor animal .   hari instantly recognized the pan  or chimpanzee  whose feral grin exposed intimidating ranks of yellow teeth .  in its right hand  the creature held a bulbous object  a rounded cylinder ending in a flared nozzle .  although not a blaster  anyone could tell it was a weapon on sight .  in its other hand  the creature held a recording device  which it activated in playback mode .      hello  dear friends      spoke the unmistakable voice of r .  gornon vlimt .     i urge you to remain calm .  the creature standing before you  who was undetectable to any mentalics  either robot or human  will not harm anybody .  i would never allow that  though you must all now be rendered temporarily helpless to prevent further interference with our plans .      please try to relax .  we shall speak in person soon .  .  .  when you stand once again on the surface of the world that engendered us all .       gornon   s voice finished  and the playback unit halted with an audible click .  at that point  the pan grinned wider  appearing to relish what was about to happen .   mors planch and biron maserd stepped toward the creature .  men of action  they had silently and swiftly agreed to attack it from opposite directions .  meanwhile  wanda frowned  concentrating with a furrowed brow  attempting with mentalic power to contact and quash the thoughts of an alien mind .   hari could have warned them not to bother .  the chimp pressed the weapon   s firing stub  and a burst of gas jetted into the room  colorless but with a heavy index of refraction  billowing toward every crevice .  hari noticed that the pan wore filters in each nostril .   it   s just as well  he thought .  there was unfinished business to settle back on earth .   that unfinished business had waited twenty thousand years or more .  he figured it wouldn   t matter if he must abide a little longer .   surprised by his own equanimity  with a faint smile spreading across his lips  hari settled into his chair while everyone else struggled  gasped  and collapsed to the floor .  he closed his eyes  letting go of consciousness with a sense of serene expectation .       .     he dreamed about an old legend he had read once .  the tale of a man  doomed to die  who had a rib taken from him as he slept  and who thereby achieved an oblique form of immortality .   somehow  hari realized the story applied to him .  while he lay helpless  only semi conscious  someone seemed to reach deep inside and remove a piece of him .  an important part .  something precious .   he started to rouse  in order to protest .  but a familiar voice soothed .      fear not .  we are only borrowing .  venerating .  copying .      you won   t miss a thing .      return to sleep  and dream of pleasant things .       he had no reason to doubt that assurance .  so  doing as the voice bid  he relaxed back into slumber  imagining that beloved dors lay by his side .  sleek and restored .  ever patient and steadfast .   for a little while  it felt as if he  too  had found the trick of living forever .     having slept through the return trip and much of the next day  hari stepped down the ship   s gangplank into a chill afternoon on planet earth .  moving gingerly  because sciatica twinges had returned to his left leg   he shaded his eyes against the glare of distant buildings several kilometers away .  the most recent ruins  dating from the early imperial era  shone under the sun like white porcelain .  chica could only have held fifty thousand or so inhabitants  in its heyday .  yet the little ghost town was positively homey next to its neighbor  a mountain of metal  larger than an asteroid  a windowless cave city where millions sealed themselves away from some unbearable nightmare during the early days of daneel olivaw .   much nearer at hand  nestled among the most ancient university buildings  some of today   s earthlings had set up a makeshift encampment in order to work for their latest employer  r .  gornon vlimt .  two of gornon   s calvinian assistants directed local laborers who toiled next to a tomblike sarcophagus  more than a hundred meters wide .  new scaffolding arose  climbing to a crack in the containment shell .  within  hari glimpsed the remains of a building more ancient than any he had ever seen .  older than starflight perhaps .   through the crack poured a throbbing glow  visible even by daylight .   the earthlings who labored to lash timbers and planks together were pitiful looking creatures  shabbily dressed and painfully thin  as if they survived on little more than murky air .  their faces were gaunt  and something lurked in their eyes .  .  . a flickering that seemed like distraction  until hari watched carefully .  then he realized the natives were constantly listening  paying heed to the slightest sounds  the rolling of a pebble or the passing flight of a bee .  these people hardly struck one as dangerous up close  though he remembered feeling different when they were shadowy shapes on surrounding hilltops  hurling jagged stone missiles through the night .      they feel bad about the attack     r .  gornon explained  introducing hari to the local headman  a tall  slender being whose speech poured forth in some incomprehensible dialect .     he has asked me to apologize for his people .  the urge to attack came over them suddenly and inexplicably .  to expiate their inhospitality  the headman wants to know how many lives should be forfeited .         none .     hari felt appalled at the very idea .     please tell them that it   s over .  what   s done is done .         i shall certainly try  professor .  but you have no idea how seriously earthlings take such matters .  their current religion is one of total responsibility .  they believe that all of this     gornon indicated the radioactive desolation     was caused by the sins of their own ancestors  and that they remain partly at fault .      hari blinked .     they   ve paid off any guilt  just by living here .  no one could deserve this  no matter how great the crime .      gornon spoke briefly in the harsh local dialect  and the headman grunted tones of acceptance .  he bowed once to gornon and again to hari  then backed away .      it wasn   t always like this     the robot told hari  as they continued walking .     even ten thousand years after the planet was poisoned  a few million people still lived on earth  farming patches of good land  living in modest cities .  they had technology  a few universities  and some pride .  perhaps too much pride .         what do you mean .         back when the galactic empire was first taking hold  bringing peace after a hundred centuries of war and disunion  nearly all planets avidly joined the new federation .  but fanatical earthlings thought it blasphemy for any other world to rule .  their cult of the ancients plotted war against the empire .         ah  i recall you spoke of this before .  one world against millions  but with horrid germs as allies .         indeed  a biological weapon of unrivaled virulence  derived from disease organisms found right here on earth .  a contagion that made its victims want to spread it further .      hari grimaced .  plague was a factor that could make psychohistorical projections frail .  .  . and even crumble .     still  the plot was foiled .      r .  gornon nodded .     one of daneel   s agents resided here  charged with keeping an eye on the mother world .  fortuitously  that agent had a special device  able to enhance neural powers in certain types of humans .  by good luck  he found a subject with the right characteristics  especially a strong moral compass  and gave that fellow some primitive but effective mentalic powers .         a human mentalic  so long ago .  then why          that man successfully foiled the plot .  thus  indirectly  daneel   s agent prevented catastrophe .      hari pondered .      was that the end of earth civilization .  was the population removed to prevent more rebellion .         not in the beginning .  at first the empire offered compassion .  there were even efforts taken to restore earth   s fertility .  but that soon proved expensive .  policies changed .  attitudes hardened .  within a century orders were given to evacuate .  only those earthers hiding in the wilderness remained .      hari winced  recalling jeni cuicet  who strove so hard to avoid exile on terminus .   the winds of destiny aren   t ours to control  he thought .     the starship pride of rhodia still lay where it had been parked a few days earlier  beyond the north side of the sarcophagus .  only now an encampment of shabby tents stood nearby  living quarters for the laborers .  some tribal folk could be seen gathered around a stewpot  cooking .  a whiff made hari   s nose wrinkle in disgust .   not far away  he spotted a woman much stouter than any earthling  dressed in torn garments that shimmered like the radioactive horizon .  she paced  lifting a hand in front of her face  uttering some rapid statement  then raising the other hand  in turn .  hari recognized sybyl  the scientist philosopher from ktlina  now evidently snared in a terminal stage of chaos rapture  the solipsism phase  in which the hapless victim becomes enthralled by his or her own uniqueness  severing all connection with the outside world .   everything becomes relative  hari mused .  to a solipsist there is no such thing as objective reality .  only the subjective .  a raging  self righteous assertion of individual opinion against the entire cosmos .   r .  gornon vlimt spoke in a hushed voice  so low that hari barely made out the words .      that was what the cult of the ancients planned unleashing on the galaxy .      hari turned to stare at the robot .      you mean the chaos syndrome .      gornon nodded .     the plotters developed an especially virulent form that could overwhelm every social damping mechanism daneel olivaw had developed for his new empire .  fortunately  that scheme was thwarted by heroic intervention .  but weaker strains of the same disease had already become endemic in the galaxy  perhaps carried by the first starships .      hari shook his head .  but it all made too much sense .  he realized at once  chaos had to be a contagious plague .   the first time it struck  they couldn   t have realized what hit them .  all they knew was that  at the very zenith of their confident civilization  madness was abruptly spreading everywhere .   it was one thing for a renaissance to spoil a modern world like ktlina  one of millions .  but when it happened the first time  humanity had only spread to a few other planets .  the pandemic must have affected every human being then alive .   all of a sudden nothing could be relied upon anymore .  anarchy ripped apart the great technic cosmopolity .  by the time the riots ended and the dust cleared  earth   s populace had fled underground  cowering in psychotic agoraphobia .  meanwhile  the spacers turned away from sex  love  and every wholesome joy .   hari turned to look back at the robot .      of course you realize what this means .      r .  gornon nodded .     it is one of the last keys to a puzzle you   ve been trying to solve all your life .  the reason why humanity can   t be allowed to govern itself  or permitted to strive unfettered toward its full potential .  whenever your race grows too ambitious  this illness surges out of dormancy  wrecking everything .      they were now among the tents .  hari saw that other members of the ktlina crew weren   t faring any better than sybyl .  one of the surviving soldiers stared blankly into space  while a native woman tried to spoon feed him .  another sat cross legged on the ground  enthusiastically explaining to a small crowd of infants  no more than two years old  why nano transcendentalism was superior to neo ruellianism .   hari sighed .  though he had been fighting chaos all his life  the insights provided by gornon let him view it with fresh insight .  perhaps chaos wasn   t inherent to human nature after all .  if it was caused by a disease  one important factor in his equations might change .  .  .   he sighed  dismissing the thought .  like the infectious agent responsible for brain fever  this disease had escaped detection and treatment by all of the galaxy   s medics and biologists for a thousand generations .  it was futile to dream of finding a cure at this point  with the imperium scheduled shortly to self destruct .   still  he wondered .   mors planch was on ktlina  and several earlier chaos worlds .  yet he never succumbed .  could a clue lie in his immunity to mentalic suasion .   a small crowd gathered at the far end of the biggest tent .  someone was lecturing excitedly  using all sorts of technical terms .  hari thought it might be another addled ktlinan  until he recognized the voice  and smiled .   oh  it   s horis .  good  then he   s all right .   hari had worried about the little bureaucrat  left behind on earth .  approaching  he saw that antic   s audience included biron maserd and mors planch .  one of the star pilots was a manacled prisoner  and the other a trusted friend  but both wore expressions of bemused interest .  the nobleman smiled a greeting as hari approached .   planch made earnest eye contact  as if to say that their conversation must be continued soon .  he claims to have something i want .  information so important to me that i   d bend the rules in his favor  and even risk damaging the second foundation .   hari felt curious .  .  . but that sensation was almost overwhelmed by another one .  expectation .   tonight i must decide .  r .  gornon won   t force me to step through time .  the choice is entirely mine .   horis noticed hari at last .      ah  professor seldon .  i   m so glad to see you .  please have a look at this .      on a crude table lay several dozen small piles of material that ranged from dusty to moist and crumbly .  in fact  they looked like mounds of dirt .   of course .  his profession is the study of soils .  naturally  that would be his anchor at a time like this .  something to cling to during all of these disturbances .   hari wondered if some of the samples might be dangerous  but both maserd and mors planch had thrown back the hoods of their radiation suits  and they had more life span to risk than hari .   horis showed clear pride in his collection .     i   ve been busy  as you can see .  of course there   s only been time for a cursory sampling .  but the earthlings are most cooperative  sending boys in all directions to take samples for me .      hari caught maserd   s indulgent smile and agreed .  let horis have his moment .  there would be time to discuss more important matters before evening came .      and what have you determined so far .         oh  a great deal .  for example  did you know that the best soils in this area are not of earthly origin at all .  there are several sites  not far from chica  where many hectares of rich loam were laid down .  the material is unmistakably from lorissa world  over twenty light years away .  it was brought here and spread in a neat  organized fashion .  someone was trying to restore this planet .  i date the effort at approximately ten thousand years ago .      hari nodded .  this fit what gornon said earlier  that the empire once attempted restoration of the homeworld  before changing its mind  closing the universities and hauling millions away from their homes  leaving behind only a race of hardscrabble survivors .      but there   s more .     horis antic insisted  moving to where he had set up several instruments .     i stayed up all night  studying emanations from that thing the ancients sealed away  over there .      horis pointed to the massive steel and concrete sarcophagus nearby  and the cracked entryway that r .  gornon   s laborers were seeking to access with spindly scaffolding .      i don   t have the right tools or expertise .  but it   s clear some kind of rift in the continuum was made here  once upon a time .  it   s quiescent now  but the effects must be powerful when the thing is roused .  i was skeptical of that tiktok  the one posing as gornon vlimt  when it talked about hurling someone forward in time .  but now i wonder .      the bureaucrat scientist grimaced .     what i can say  and the robot may not have told you  is that even while the space time rift is dormant  there are effects that permeate this entire planet .  one of the most notable is a shift in the stability of uranium oxide  a lightweight molecule found in hydrothermal regions on most earthlike planets .  only here  there is a slightly higher predisposition for the constituent atoms to     hari blinked  abruptly realizing something .  he had been told that earth   s transformation into a radioactive world came from the decision of a single robot  during the post chaos age .  but might the seeds have been sown even earlier .  in the bright renaissance when susan calvin and her contemporaries saw no limits to their ambition or power .   what if giskard only amplified something that had already begun .  might that let daneel   s folk off the hook .  could it explain why this effect only happened once .  on earth .   horis would go on  enthusiastically explaining details of an ancient tragedy .  but he was interrupted by the dinner bell .  .  . which meant partaking of earthling hospitality  alas .  r .  gornon felt it would crush their pride if the visitors refused .   hari managed to swallow a few bites of a nondescript gruel  and smiled appreciatively before excusing himself .  slowly ascending the mound of rubble  he sat facing the three ruined cities and pulled from his pocket the latest copy of the seldon plan prime radiant .   he felt a little guilty for having swiped wanda   s copy  but his granddaughter wouldn   t notice or care .  she and gaal dornick were still aboard their ship  wired to sleep machines until tonight   s proceedings .   soon i must decide  whether to go ahead five centuries .  .  . assuming this thing works as advertised  and doesn   t merely rip my atoms apart .   he smiled at that .  it seemed an interesting way to go .   anyway  what have i got to    all of a sudden  the sky shook with pealing thunder  a sonic boom .  he glanced up .  where a few stars had begun to shine  a bright object streaked overhead  a winged cylinder that banked and turned  obviously coming in for a landing .   hari sighed .  he had been hoping to lose himself for an hour or two amid his beloved equations .  the new mathematical model that had emerged  a pattern for the future  was enthralling to contemplate  but the ideas already floated inside his head  and he was certain that double checking the prime radiant wouldn   t change anything .   with some effort  he gathered strength to lift his frail body .  flickering patches of radiation lit his way  following the twisty trail back to camp .   by the time he got there  the new visitors had already arrived .     a pair of women stood near r .  gornon vlimt .  one of them turned and smiled  as hari approached the earthlings    campfire .      the guest of honor  i presume .      gornon   s expression gave away little .      professor seldon  let me introduce zorma and cloudia .  they have come a great distance  in order to witness tonight   s activities  and to assure themselves that you aren   t under any sort of coercion .      hari laughed .     my entire life has been guided by others .  if i know more and see more than my fellow humans  it   s because that serves some long range plan .  so  tell me  what fashion of robots are you .     he asked the two newcomers .     are you yet another sect of calvinians .  or do you represent daneel .      the one called zorma shook her head .     we   ve been disowned by calvinians and giskardians .  both groups call us perverts .  yet they still find us useful  whenever something important is about to take place .         perverts  eh .     hari nodded .  it all fit .     so which of you is the human .      cloudia brought a hand to her chest .     i was born one of the masters  long ago .  but this new body of mine is at least one quarter robotic .  zorma  here  has many protoplasmic parts .  so your question is a complicated one  professor seldon .      hari glanced at r .  gornon  whose face revealed nothing  even though it could simulate the whole range of emotions .      i see why the other positronic sects find your approach disturbing     hari commented .   zorma nodded .     we seek to heal the rift between our races by blurring the distinction .  it has been a long and costly project  and not entirely successful .  but we continue to hope .  the other robots put up with us  because it would cause them serious mental dissonance if they tried to eliminate us .         of course  if you are part human  you get some protection under the first law .     hari paused .     but that won   t suffice by itself .  there must be something more .      cloudia agreed .     we also provide a service .  we bear witness .  we don   t take sides .  we remember .      hari could not help being impressed .  this small sect had maintained its existence for a long time  enduring the contempt of far greater forces  while maintaining some degree of independence in an age when human memory was shrouded by amnesia .  it would take great discipline and patience to abide centuries this way  resisting the ever present urge to act .  in some ways  it required a spirit opposite to mors planch   s .  in fact  it would take people almost exactly like  he turned  seeking one face amid the crowd of onlookers  scanning past horis  sybyl  the earthlings  and mors planch .   hari   s gaze settled on the nobleman from rhodia  biron maserd  who stood back from the crowd  with his arms crossed  wearing an expression of indifference .  hari saw through the guise now .      come forth  my young friend     he urged the tall lord .     come join your comrades .  let us have no more secrets between us .  it is a time for truth .          .        of course there had to be a spy     hari said  cutting off maserd   s protestations .     someone who knew about the thu    martin nebula  for instance .  we didn   t stumble on the archives and terraformers by accident .      and there were other clues .  when sybyl and the real gornon vlimt started accessing those ancient records  you already knew more about human history than any professor at an imperial university .         as i explained earlier  seldon  noble families often have private libraries that might surprise members of the meritocracy .  my family has a traditional interest in such matters as          as the systems of government used on ancient earth .  that kind of knowledge is remarkable .  even incredible .  then there were the tilling machines that got horis so excited .  .  .  those vast devices used long ago to prepare worlds for human occupation .  your reaction to them was hardly indifferent .  .  .  as if you were looking at an old  familiar enemy .      this time biron maserd smiled  not bothering to refute hari   s assertion .     is it a crime to wish the universe had more diversity in it .      hari chuckled .     to a psychohistorian  it   s damn near blasphemy .  the galaxy is already so complicated  the equations almost burst at their seams .  and that   s with just humanity to deal with .  we mathists would much rather simplify .      no .  i didn   t notice all the clues because i had become so fixated on chaos .  sybyl  planch  and the others presented such a threat .  when kers kantun told me you were an ally .  .  . that you hated chaos as much as anybody          i do .         i took that to mean that you were a practical man of the empire  as you styled yourself .  but now i see you are another utopian  maserd .  you think humanity can escape chaos  if only it experiences just the right kind of renaissance .      biron maserd stared at hari for a long  drawn out moment  before answering .     isn   t that what the seldon plan is all about  professor .  fostering a human society that will be strong enough to take on the ancient enemy lurking in our own souls .      that was my old dream  hari answered silently .  though until just the last few days  i had thought it obsolete .   aloud he gave maserd a different answer  aware that others were watching and listening .      like many gentry  you are ultimately a pragmatist  my lord .  lacking mathematical tools  you try one thing after another  abandoning each failed solution only when forced to concede that it is time to try another .     hari gestured toward the two cyborg women  zorma and cloudia  one of whom had been born human and the other with a positronic brain tuned to the laws of robotics .  only now they had begun blurring the distinction .      are you involved in this radical project  or are you merely working together  as a matter of temporary convenience .      apparently accepting the inevitability of hari   s conclusions  maserd gave up with a sigh .      our groups have known about each other for a long time .  my family      he nodded grimly .     we were among those who cast forth the archives  long ago  fighting desperately against the spreading amnesia .  and we waged war against the terraforming machines .  it was futile  for the most part .  but we won a few victories .      it was horis antic who asked the next question in a hushed voice .     what kind of victories .  you mean you battled robots and won .         how can you fight beings who are so much more powerful  and righteously certain they have your own best interests at heart .  still  we managed to stop the horrible machines a few times  by rushing ahead and landing human colonists on a world slated for terraforming .  several times that stymied the tillers  who could not blast a planet with human inhabitants .      mors planch blinked .     wouldn   t we all know about such places .         we struck a deal with daneel olivaw  after the robotic wars ended .  we agreed to stop fighting the amnesia  and to let the protected worlds be put in quarantine .  in return  he left us unaltered  with our memories intact .  the ultimate price was passivity .  to remain silent and inactive .     maserd   s jaw clenched .     still  as long as the galactic empire ran smoothly  it was a better alternative than ruin and chaos .         your role in this affair could hardly be called passive     hari pointed out .   maserd apparently agreed .     the empire is falling apart .  all the old bargains appear forfeit .  everybody seems to be waiting for daneel olivaw to present a plan  even the calvinians     maserd jerked a thumb toward r .  gornon vlimt     are too timid to oppose their old foe directly .  all they want to do is throw hari seldon forward in time  as if that will ensure everything comes out all right .     maserd barked a short laugh .   the robot who had replaced the eccentric gornon vlimt stepped forward .  for the first time  its emulation programs mimicked a human wracked with uncertainty .      don   t you think olivaw will come up with something beneficial to humanity   s long range good .      a woman   s voice chuckled .      so it comes down to that .     zorma asked .     despite all your secret schemes  you really are a timorous bunch of little tiktoks .  listen to yourself  pinning your hopes on someone you   ve fought for so long .  why  you just cited daneel   s zeroth law .      zorma shook her head .     there are no more true calvinians .      hari had no intention of letting the conversation dissolve into ideological arguments between robots .  he also cared little whether biron maserd had been spying all along .   in fact  he wished the nobleman well .  what really mattered right now was the decision he had to make .  the immediacy of which was clear when r .  gornon   s assistant hurried into the tent .      preparations are complete .  in less than an hour the moment will come .  it is time to ascend the scaffolding .        and so  with his decision still not made  hari joined a procession leading through the lanes of the ancient university .  his footsteps were partly illuminated by a crescent moon  and by a luminous skyglow emitted when oxygen atoms were struck by gamma rays rising from the ground below .  as he moved along  feeling creaky with age  hari felt a nagging need to talk to somebody he could trust .   only one name came to mind  and he murmured it under his breath .     dors .        the last thing he expected was for this to turn into a ceremonial occasion .  but a procession of earthlings accompanied hari and the others on their way to the sarcophagus .  the natives chanted an eerie melody  at once both dirgelike yet strangely auspicious  as if expressing all their hopes for some eventual redemption .  perhaps the song was many thousands of years old  dating from even before humanity climbed out of its gentle cradle to assault the stars .   accompanying r .  gornon and hari were the    deviant    cyborgs  zorma and cloudia  with biron maserd now striding openly beside them .  at hari   s insistence  wanda seldon and gaal dornick had also been wakened to join the entourage  though wanda had been warned not to attempt mentalic interference .  some of the robots present had similar abilities  enough to counter any efforts she might make .   hari   s granddaughter looked unhappy  and he tried to reassure her with a gentle smile .  raised as a meritocrat  hari had always expected to adopt rather than father children of his own .  and yet  few joys in his life had matched that of being a parent to raych  and then grandparent to this excellent young woman  who took so seriously her duties as an agent of destiny .   horis antic had asked to be excused  ostensibly to pursue his research  though hari knew the real reason .  the .  glowing    space time anomaly    terrified horis .  but gornon did not want to leave anyone behind in camp  so antic shuffled along  just behind the prisoner mors planch .  even the survivors of the ktlina renaissance accompanied the procession  though sybyl and the others seemed hardly aware of anything except a raucous murmur of voices in their own heads .   as they approached the anomaly  draped in scaffolding  hari saw the rounded outline of the sarcophagus slide past each of the ancient cities in turn .   first  old chicago  with its battered skyscrapers still aiming adventurously toward the sky  recalling an age of openness and unfettered ambition .  next to vanish was new chicago  that monstrous fortress where so many millions sealed themselves away from daylight  and a terror they could not understand .  finally  little chica disappeared  the white porcelain village where earth   s final civilization struggled in vain against irrelevance  in a galaxy that simply did not care about its origins anymore .   rounding a bend in the ancient university campus  they came to a point where the crack could be seen .  .  . splitting open thick walls that had been meant to seal away something dire .  to entomb it forever .  hari glanced to his left  toward r .  gornon .      if this anomaly truly gives you access to the fourth dimension  why hasn   t it been used during all of these centuries .  why did no one attempt to change the past .      the robot shook its head .     travel into the past is impossible  on many different levels  dr .  seldon .  anyway  even if you could change the past  that would only create a new future in which someone else will be discontented .  those people  in turn  would send emissaries to change their past  and so on .  no time track would have any more valid claim to reality than any other .         then perhaps none of this matters     hari mused .     we all may be just parallel mirror images .  .  . or else little simulations  like the numbers we juggle in the prime radiant .  temporary .  ghosts who only exist while someone else is thinking about them .      hari had not been looking where he was going .  his left foot snagged on some patch of uneven ground  and he started to pitch forward .  .  . but was caught by r .  gornon   s gentle  firm grasp .  even so  hari   s body felt quakes of pain and fatigue .  he missed his nurse  kers kantun  and the wheelchair he once hated .  at one level  hari could tell he was dying  as he had been sliding toward death for several years .      i   m not in great condition for so long a journey     he murmured  while his companions waited for him to recover .      the one other human who traveled this way was also an old man     gornon assured hari .     tests show that the process is gentle  or else we would never risk harming you .  and when you arrive  someone will be waiting .         i see .  still i wonder .  .  .         about what  professor .         you have great powers of medical science available to you .  breakthroughs and techniques that robots have hoarded for millennia .  these cyborgs     he jerked a thumb toward zorma and cloudia     appear able to duplicate bodies and extend life indefinitely .  so i wonder why you didn   t boost my physical health  at least a bit more  before i made this journey .         it   s not allowed  professor .  there are strong reasons  moral  ethical  and       harsh laughter interrupted  coming from the robot called zorma .      except when it suits your purposes .  you should give seldon a better answer than that  gornon .      after a pause  gornon said in a low voice     we no longer have the organoforming apparatus .  it was taken away at pengia .  the device was needed elsewhere to continue an important project .  .  . and that is all i will say about it .      they resumed walking until the glow emanating from the cracked tomb filled the night just overhead  casting spiderweb shadows from the scaffolding across the ruined university .  most of the earthlings and other onlookers climbed nearby rubble mounds to watch  while hari and gornon led a diminished procession onto a broad wooden platform that began rising on creaking ropes  hauling a dozen of them upward .   as hari and his entourage ascended  he commented to gornon     it occurs to me that you may be going to a lot of unnecessary trouble .  there   s another way of sending a person into the future  you know .      this time  the robot did not answer .  instead  gornon steadied hari with an arm around his shoulders as the makeshift elevator reached its destination with a rattling bump .  hari had to shade his eyes against the glare pouring from within the broken containment shell .   to the awed murmurs of his guests  gornon gave an explanation that was both poignant and brief .      it began with a simple  well meaning experiment  during the same brash era when humans were inventing both robots and hyperdrive .  the researchers here had an incredible hunch and acted on it impulsively .  suddenly  a beam of fractured space time shot forth  snaring a passing pedestrian  yanking joseph schwartz out of his normal life and hurling him forward ten thousand years .      for schwartz  a great adventure ensued .  but back in the chicago he left behind  a nightmare had just begun .     hari watched the robot   s face  looking for the complex expressions of emotion that dors and daneel simulated so well .  but this artificial man was grimly stoic .      you sound as if you were there  when it happened .         not i  but an early model robot was .  one whose memories i inherited .  those memories aren   t pleasant .  some of us believe this event marked the beginning of the end for humanity   s great time of youthful exuberance .  not long thereafter  amid international recriminations  the first waves of unreason began .  robots were banished from earth .  acrimony built between nations and the colonial worlds  there were outbreaks of biological warfare .  some of us swore .  .  .      hari suddenly had a wild hunch .      you stayed here  didn   t you .  that agent of daneel   s whom you mentioned earlier  the one who helped stop the earthlings from spreading a new plague  was that you .      r .  gornon paused  then gave a jerky nod .      then zorma is right .  you   re no calvinian after all .         i suppose i no longer fit any of the rigid classifications  though at one time i was a fervent follower of giskardianism .      now the robot   s impassive mask broke .  like that of any stoic man  whose equanimity was shattered by the most powerful emotion  hope .      time affects even immortals  or .  seldon .  many of us tired old robots don   t know what we are anymore .  perhaps that is something you will be able to tell us  when you have had a chance to reflect .  in time .      and so i come to the moment of decision  hari acknowledged  still shading his eyes and peering toward the harsh light .  of course it would be anticlimactic to back out now .  everyone was watching .  even those  like wanda  who disapproved of this whole plan  would surely be disappointed at some level .  .  . to be promised a spectacular show and have the star performer withdraw at the last minute .  on the other hand  hari had built a reputation of doing the unexpected .  there was almost a delicious attraction to the notion of surprising all these people .   several members of the group edged close to the opal light  peering inside .  biron maserd pointed at the crumbling building  no doubt an ancient physics lab where the original mistake was made .  the headman of the earthling tribe stood next to maserd  nodding .  even wanda approached out of curiosity  though horis antic kept his distance  chewing ragged fingernails .   mors planch shuffled forward  lifting his manacled hands .      take these off of me  seldon  i entreat you .  these robots .  .  . they all revere you .  perhaps i was wrong .  let me prove my worth to you  before you go .  i have some information .  .  . the whereabouts of somebody precious to you .  someone you have been searching for  across many years .      hari abruptly realized what planch was driving at .   bellis .   he took a step toward the pirate captain .     you found my other granddaughter .      on hearing this  wanda seldon turned her attention fully away from the sarcophagus .  she  too  stepped closer to planch .      where is she .  what has happened to my sister .      r .  gornon interrupted .     i am very sorry  but you should have discussed this earlier .  there is no more time .  at any moment  the field will expand .  we have managed to transform the beam into a circular field  but we cannot be certain how long it will       another figure stepped closer to hari .  the headman of the earthling tribe .  though his accent was still quaint and thick  hari found his speech understandable .      there ees still time for families to settle their affeers .  please goh on  sir .     the lanky terran nodded at mors planch .   hari felt a twinge of irritation  for this was really none of the earthling   s business  but gornon cut in first  glowering at the earther .      what do you know of such matters .  it is time to prepare .  note how the luminance grows brighter even as we speak .      through the crack in the sarcophagus  hari saw that the glow was indeed more intense .  biron maserd stepped back from the forward edge of the platform and gestured within .      there is something expanding outward from that building .  like a sphere made of some liquid metal .  it   s coming closer .         are we safe standing here .     horis antic asked nervously .   r .  gornon replied     it has never expanded beyond the boundaries of the sarcophagus .  it will not touch those standing on the platform .         and what about hari seldon .     asked the cyborg robot  zorma .     will it be safe for him to enter that thing .      gornon let out a sigh of emulated frustration .      we   ve performed calibration experiments for the last thousand years .  professor seldon will experience a gentle  instantaneous transition to the chosen future era  a time just a few centuries from now  when decisions must be made that will affect all of human destiny .      mors planch murmured     a few centuries .  .  .     then he took a step toward hari .     well  professor seldon .  do we have a deal .      hari glanced at wanda  hoping for a nod  but instead she shook her head .      i cannot read the secret in his mind  grandfather .  there is something complex about his brain .  recall how hard i fought yesterday  just to keep him standing still .  still  i   m sure we   ll find out where he   s hidden bellis .  it will just take time  working on him in private .      hari didn   t like the last part of her statement .   perhaps striking a deal would be better .  i could depart this world with a clear conscience .   before hari could speak  however  planch let out a roar .  he raised both manacled hands and charged .   swift as lightning  r .  gornon vlimt grabbed hari and swung him out of the way .  but in that blurred instant  hari realized that he was not the pirate captain   s target .  by seeming to attack hari  planch kept gornon busy in reflex protective mode  clearing the way for his real goal .   mors planch took four rapid steps toward biron maserd  standing at the platform   s edge .  the nobleman tensed  preparing to fight  then  in an instant   s realization  he hopped nimbly out of the way .   screaming a cry filled with both fear and exultation  planch leaped off the parapet into the opal light .  hurtling across empty space  his body collided with a slowly expanding sphere that rippled like liquid mercury .  .  . and vanished within .   as hari stared  the mirror ball kept expanding  inexorably approaching the place where he stood .  no one spoke until gornon vlimt commented with an impassive voice     we shall have to be certain he is greeted with compassion  in five centuries    time .  by that point  he will not be able to alter destiny  but we must make sure he doesn   t harm professor seldon when he emerges on the other side .      hari felt a wash of emotions  admiration for the spacer captain   s courage  plus despair over having lost a clue to his other granddaughter   s whereabouts .  r .  gornon   s stoic pragmatism aside  hari looked at the expanding space time anomaly with growing dread .   the next person to speak was the earthling headman .  this time his accent was softer  easier to understand .      it is true that someone must be waiting here on earth to greet mors planch  but we needn   t fear for the safety of hari seldon .         and why is that .     asked cloudia  the cyborg who had begun life as a human woman .      because hari seldon is not taking this journey .  not tonight .  not ever .       now everyone focused their complete attention on the earthling  who stood up taller  erasing the stooped posture that most terrans manifested .  wanda stared at the lanky man  then gasped a cry of realization .  zorma was next to react  uttering an oath .   lacking mentalic powers  hari was slower to catch on .  still  he found something familiar about the headman   s voice tones  and the way he now held himself  resembling prometheus  whose laborious agonies never ended .   hari whispered a single word      daneel .       r .  gornon vlimt nodded  his face as impassive as ever .      olivaw .  you have been here quite some time  i presume .      the robot who had disguised himself as an earthling nodded .      of course  i   ve long known about the experiments your group was performing here .  i could not destroy the time anomaly  but we   ve been monitoring the locale .  i arranged years ago to become a figure of importance to the local earthling tribes  who respond enthusiastically to my influence .  when they reported fresh activity at this site  i combined that with tales of hari   s abduction and reached the obvious conclusion .      daneel olivaw turned to hari .      i am sorry  old friend .  you   ve gone through terrible trials  at a time when you should relax  in peaceful knowledge of your accomplishments .  i would have been here sooner  and hoped to catch up with you on pengia .  but there were sudden problems with some of the calvinian sects  renewing their fight for the pure old religion  who want to destroy the seldon plan at all costs .  defeating them took some time .  i hope you will forgive the delay .          forgive .  hari wondered what there was to forgive .  true  he had been used .  by giskardians and calvinians  and ktlinans .  .  . and by several other factions  both human and robotic .  yet  in adamant honesty  he confessed to himself that the last few weeks had been more fun than anything else that happened in his life since he became important to galactic affairs .  since before he ever became first minister of the empire .  .  . back when he and dors were young adventurers inserting their thoughts into the minds of primitive creatures  living the wild and free lives of chimpanzees .      that   s all right  daneel .  i figured all along that you would show up and spare me the angst of making this decision .         i appeal to you  olivaw     said r .  gornon vlimt .     as one whom you trusted for so many millennia  please allow us to continue tonight   s work .      daneel made eye contact with gornon .      you know that i honor the memories of our comradeship .  i recall innumerable battles we fought  side by side  during the robotic civil wars .  the zeroth law never had a stronger champion than you .         then cannot you believe that i   m doing all of this for humanity   s long range good .         i can  indeed     daneel replied .     but centuries ago  we disagreed over what that long range good should be .  with matters at a critical juncture  i cannot let you interfere .      this brought a reaction from hari .      what interference  daneel .  everything occurred to your benefit .  take the ancient archives and the terraforming machines  you sensed they might pose a danger  after the old empire collapses .  during the age that follows  they might be discovered at random and destabilize the planned transition .  you already decided to destroy them  under the zeroth law .  but some of your compatriots were uncomfortable with the positronic dissonance that caused .  by giving my permission  i made it easier for your followers to act .     he glanced at wanda  and saw her shiver briefly at his mention of the archives .  she  too  understood how dangerous they were .  how they had to be destroyed .      and when the agents of chaos found us there  in the nebula      hari continued       planch said it was because of some unknown informant aboard our ship  who told them where to find us .  but i   m guessing it might have been you  daneel  using the lure of the archives to draw all the ktlina agents toward one place  eliminating the threat posed by this century   s worst chaos world .      daneel made an expressive shrug .     i cannot claim credit for that coup  though i admit it was helpful .     he then turned to look at biron maserd  the tall nobleman from rhodia .     well  my young friend .  were you the agent that mors planch spoke of .      hari wondered why daneel  with the greatest mentalic powers in the galaxy  didn   t simply read maserd   s mind .   olivaw turned back to hari .      i do not invade his mind because we have an ancient agreement  a compact between lord maserd   s family and myself .  they were relentless and incredibly clever in their attempts to fight the necessary amnesia .      maserd responded     and we agreed to stop doing so  in exchange for being left alone .  our small galactic province has been run a little differently than the rest of the empire .  we were free to fight chaos in our own way .      daneel agreed .     but it seems our ancient agreement has been broken .         no .         you already conceded that you   ve communicated with this group .     daneel aimed a finger at the cyborgs  cloudia and zorma .      we maserds are permitted to discuss anything among ourselves     biron answered .  he nodded toward the pale haired cyborg .     cloudia duma hinriad is my great great grandmother .       daneel smiled .     very clever  but the zeroth law won   t allow me to accept that attempt to evade our agreement .  not if it might imperil humanity   s long term salvation .         and of course you are the one to determine what form that salvation shall take .     r .  gornon asked  in a voice that resonated  both desperate and sarcastic .      that has been my burden ever since blessed giskard and i discovered the zeroth law .         and look at what it has cost .     r .  gornon gestured toward the glowing radioactive ruins .     your great galactic empire kept the peace and staved off chaos  by eliminating diversity .  humanity must shun whatever is alien or strange  whether it comes from within or from the outside .      daneel shook his head .     now is not the time to resume our ancient argument  over your proposed minus one law .  the transition boundary approaches .  for hari   s sake and for the sake of the plan  i must insist that you lower this platform at once .         what is the harm in letting seldon see the world five centuries from now .     asked zorma .     his work in this period is done .  you said so yourself .  why not let humans be involved in the decision  when your salvation is ready .      daneel glanced at the brightening glow within the sarcophagus .  already their reflections could be seen on an expanding mirrorlike bubble  approaching gradually but inexorably .  he looked back at zorma .      is that your chief concern .  i am willing to make a vow  on the memory of giskard  and by the zeroth law .  when my solution is ready  humanity will be consulted .  it will not be imposed on human beings without their sovereign decision .      if this satisfied zorma and cloudia  r .  gornon still cried out .      i know you and your tricks  olivaw .  you will stack the decks  somehow .  i insist that hari seldon be allowed to go .     daneel raised an eyebrow .     you insist .      apparently that word had some special meaning among robots .  for at that moment  the world exploded around hari in a sudden blur .   beams of searing light shot forth from both of r .  gornon   s hands .  daneel olivaw replied in kind .  nor were those the only combatants .   abruptly  parts of the surrounding scaffolding detached themselves from the matrix of wooden planks  revealing themselves to be robots  camouflaged amid the latticework .  these now leaped to support daneel .   in response  searing rays were fired by gornon   s supporters on the surrounding rubble piles .  horis antic screamed  diving for cover .  gaal dornick went pale and fainted .  but no humans seemed to be involved in the melee  either as fighters or as victims .   cutting lancets of force swept between hari   s legs and under his arms  or lashed by his head  missing by centimeters .  .  . but nothing actually touched his flesh .  it was meticulous combat  in which avoiding injury to human bystanders took utmost priority  and hari   s biggest danger came from a rain of shattered and smoldering robot parts falling everywhere .   it didn   t last long .  surely  r .  gornon never expected to prevail .  yet  hari   s first concern was for the one robot who remained standing when it was all over .      you are wounded .  is it serious .     he asked his old friend and mentor .   curls of smoke rose from several places along daneel   s humaniform body  where clothes and fleshy outer coverings had burned away to reveal a gleaming surface armor resistant to anything but sunlike force .  to hari it was a reminder of legends he had read in a child   s book of knowledge  stories of gods and titans  immortal beings combating each other  beyond any power of human interference .   daneel olivaw stood amid the wreckage  gazing with apparently genuine sadness at the wastage of his kinfolk .      i am well  old friend hari .      daneel turned to glance at zorma and cloudia .     by your inaction  can i assume that my promise will satisfy you .  for the next five centuries .      the two    women    nodded as one .  zorma answered for them both .      that   s not so long to wait .  we hope you   ll keep us informed about your plans for human salvation  daneel .  above all  we pray your plan is a noble one for both of our long suffering races .      hari noted the implied message .   in your devotion to human posterity  don   t leave out something for the robots .   but he knew his lifelong friend too well .  the servant race would not get even a minor priority .  only humanity mattered to daneel .      and now it is time for us to leave this dangerous place     olivaw said  reaching for the lever that would start the platform   s descent .   just then wanda seldon uttered a cry .      maserd .  i just realized .  .  . he   s gone .      they peered in all directions  some of them using greatly enhanced positronic senses  but the nobleman from rhodia wasn   t present .  either he had clambered swiftly down the scaffolding during the fight  or else  or else daneel will have two resilient humans to deal with  in a few centuries  hari thought  as the platform started moving slowly downward .  daneel had better not forget to have someone waiting here  because if those two ever became allies .  .  .   there was no proof that maserd had dived into the glowing ball  which now filled the entire volume of the sarcophagus  sending forth brilliant rays of light  whose colors hari could not describe and could swear he had never seen before in his life .   having watched omnipotent immortals battle it out  just moments before  hari knew there was very little that even mors planch or biron maserd could accomplish if they were let loose in the galaxy   s future .  he had a strong picture of what kinds of societies would be floundering  and sometimes flourishing  in that era to come .  his foundation would already dominate the opposite side of the galaxy  but the effects would hardly be visible here on the homeworld  long forgotten earth .   with a sigh  he wished the two men well .  .  . wherever and whenever they had gone .   the ground approached  tormented by ancient  barely remembered crimes .  he glanced once more up at the glow emanating from the sarcophagus .   i admit i was sorely tempted .  it would have been one hell of an adventure  especially if they made me young again .   hari closed his eyes  feeling the strong but gentle clasp of his old comrade daneel around his shoulders  steadying his frail body as the makeshift elevator bumped to its final rest .  he let daneel turn him around  guiding his footsteps back toward the earthling camp  as he had let others guide his life from the very beginning  though for most of that span he never quite realized it .       .     the next morning  while earthling work gangs labored to clean up the battle debris  daneel and hari met with zorma and cloudia outside their swift starship  as they prepared to depart .      cloudia  i urge you .  if your grandson ever contacts you  persuade him not to interfere .  great momentum is building toward a climax  five or six centuries from now .  if biron tries to deflect this juggernaut  i   m afraid he will only get hurt .      the human cyborg nodded  and hari noted  perhaps a little enviously  the youthful strength of her supple figure .  not counting replaced parts  she was much older than he .  her expression was patient  yet sardonic .      that is  if he shows up .  you may see him before i do  daneel  if he dived through after mors planch  and if you are waiting here when he arrives in that future era .  if so  be gentle with the boy .  he means well .         i am nearly always gentle .  but if he means well  why did he steal hari seldon   s copy of the psychohistorical prime radiant .  i scanned gornon   s ship  and found ample evidence that maserd was the culprit .      cloudia offered a grim smile .     we hinriads tend to be pack rats when it comes to acquiring knowledge .  we can   t get enough .  you should know that by now  after eighteen thousand years .  we are the only human group that ever fought you to a standstill and forced you to agree to terms .      daneel assented  with a tilt of his head .      all of that is in the past  and dependent on your continued good behavior .  i   m letting you go now  based on your vow not to meddle .      zorma laughed aloud  much like a human woman who was both a little afraid and bravely defiant .     you are letting us go for the same reason you once spared lodovic trema  even though his mutation made all the other zeroth law robots eager to smash him to bits .      you   re smart  olivaw .  smart enough to be a bit unsure .  you are setting up some sort of a backup solution  in case seldon   s psychohistory plan needs to be replaced .  but your solution just may need its own backup .  in that case  your only hope could be some new synergy between robots and humans .  perhaps a hybrid combination  like us perverts      zorma gestured at herself and cloudia .     or else something as deeply disturbing to you as lodovic trema .      zorma   s expression and her voice lowered .     just remember your promise  olivaw .  that humankind will be consulted  when you present your glorious and carefully designed salvation .  there is uneasiness about this among a great many robots  even among your followers .      daneel nodded .     i will keep my word .  human volition will playa role in the decision .      zorma looked at daneel  as if trying to pierce his impervious skin with her gaze .     well  in that case  at least one mistake that was made here on earth won   t be repeated .      then  over a microwave channel that only robots shared   a final note  daneel .  leave dors and lodovic alone .  they are special .  you gave them the seeds of something precious .  don   t resent them if they take it in directions you do not understand .   hari and daneel watched the two women depart  ascending the gangplank and closing the portal .  their ship lifted on cushions of antigravity  turning slowly and accelerating to the east  barely skimming over the ancient cities  touching each of them with its shadow .   they were silent for a while .  then hari spoke .      you and i both know you won   t keep that promise .      hari   s robot friend turned to look at him .      how much have you figured out .         i now know all of the old damping mechanisms  at least enough to understand the gaps in the psychohistorical equations that puzzled me .  techniques that helped you and your allies keep the empire stable  peaceful  and unchaotic  against all odds  for most of the last twelve millennia .      daneel offered a thin smile .     i   m glad you had the satisfaction of working it out for yourself .  i planned to explain it all  just before          just before i died .     hari laughed .     now don   t you go tactful on me  all of a sudden .  besides  most of the old dampers are breaking down .  it   s easy to see that chaos outbreaks would become increasingly common if the empire didn   t fall .  if it weren   t pushed over the edge  in fact .      anyway  that   s all part of the past  and we   re talking about the future .  when i throw in some other factors  like the way you   ve introduced human mentalics during the last two generations  and your long standing promotion of meditation arts among humans  i can begin to guess the sort of salvation you have in mind .      daneel looked across the devastated ruins of chicago  and from there to the sere landscape beyond .  his voice started out hushed .      it is called gaia .  a way to bring each living world to a new level of consciousness .  though in the long run  we have hopes that it will connect every planet to all others  and become something truly wonderful  galaxia .         complete mentalic linkage among all living humans .     so  hari had guessed right .     that will take some time to achieve .  no wonder you need my plan .  .  . in order to keep humanity busy until this gaia solution is ready .  i believe i can already surmise many of its advantages  from your perspective  daneel .  but please use your own words  tell me that this great gift will be worth all the trouble .      the ancient robot turned to look at hari  spreading his arms as if to encompass the breadth of a magnificent vision .      what problems would this not solve .  an end to human acrimony  strife  and war  once every living man and woman can understand perfectly the thoughts of every other one .  an end to loneliness  the word will lose all meaning as each child joins the commonality at birth .      an ability to share all of the great ideas at an instant .  stability and inertia against sudden changes  making humanity forever secure against the impulsiveness of chaos .  and there is more  much more .      already my experiments show a wondrous possibility  hari .  that such a macro linkage of human minds can become somehow connected to an entire surrounding ecosphere .  the sensations and primitive yearnings of animals  and even plant life  become accessible .  human brains will then become only the topmost organs of a universal entity  comprising the whole life force of a planet  even down to the pulsing throb of magma  deep below the surface .      the inevitable result will be peace  serenity  a sense of union with all manner of beings .  .  . just as great human sages often prescribed in the past .  an abnegation of selfish individualism in favor of the profound wisdom of the whole .  all of this will be yours  once you are all assimilated into the collective consciousness .      hari felt genuinely moved .      it sounds gorgeous  when you put it that way .  of course the vision you present is appealing to me  given my own peculiar lifelong neurosis  my hatred of unpredictability .  the cosmic mind  this new godhead  will be fantastically easier to model than swarms of cantankerous individual humans .  i can even see where you got the idea .  having read the ancient encyclopedia you gave me  i know that many prehistoric philosophers shared this dream .      then hari raised the index finger of one hand .      but psychohistorical honesty forces me to tell you  daneel  that there are several major problems awaiting you  as you try to implement this galaxia solution .  and the result may not be as unalloyedly happy as you described it just now .      to his surprise  daneel remained silent instead of asking for an elaboration .  hari pondered the reason .  .  . then met the eyes of his old mentor .      i can see now why you didn   t want me to go into the future .      daneel let out a sigh .      with your vaunted reputation and insight  you would be hailed as a leading public figure  from the moment you were recognized and your identity confirmed .  if r .  gornon had his way  you   d surely be chosen to lead some grand commission of humans to evaluate the proposed coalescence into galaxia .      but i already knew you   d feel conflicted about this alternative solution  hari .  you have mixed feelings about this overmind that will take over  once the seldon plan achieves its real purpose .  in your skepticism  you would organize a real commission .  one that might poke away at those problems you just alluded to .      hari understood daneel   s point  yet he persisted .      i   m sure we   d give it a fair hearing  and present the results to sovereign human institutions in a favorable light .         that   s not good enough  hari  and you know it .  humanity must be saved  and it has a frightfully poor record of acting in its own best interest .      hari mused on this .      so you   ll stack the deck  as you did by arranging for me to arrive at the thumartin nebula  just as the archives needed to be destroyed .  you knew i had to decide in favor of their destruction .  my character  psychology  and fear of chaos .  .  .  everything made my choice inevitable  though at least i have enough insight to know this about myself .  those zeroth law robots who felt uneasy about destroying the archives were given a way to resolve their dissonance .  my    human authority    let them proceed with the plan you had mapped out .  all in humanity   s best interest .      hari lifted a finger again .     zorma was right .  your real constituency  the ones you must convince  are robots .  you foresee  in five centuries or so  that they will be the ones able to thwart your plan if you can   t satisfy their positronic drives .  and since you   ll be replacing the old familiar humanity with something new and strange  it will take some convincing .  no wonder you gave in so easily  and made that promise to zorma .  human volition must appear to playa role in the decision  or else you   ll have a hard time getting all robots to agree     and yet  i know you  daneel .  i know what you and giskard did here     hari motioned at the radioactive wasteland     rationalizing that it was for our own good  without consulting even one of us .  you   ll also want the gaia decision to be a foregone conclusion .  would you mind telling me how you   ll arrange that  in five hundred years .      silence lasted over a minute before daneel answered .      by presenting a human being who is always right .      hari blinked .      i beg your pardon .  a human who is always what .         one who has always made correct decisions  from childhood onward .  one who  in a crisis  reliably chooses the winning side  and has always been proved right by the test of time .  and who always will .      hari stared at daneel  then burst out laughing .      that   s impossible .  it violates every physical and biological law .      daneel nodded .      and yet  it can be made convincing .  perhaps even more credible than your grasp of human affairs through psychohistory  hari .  all i have to do is start out with a million bright boys and girls  with just the right traits  and present them with challenges from puberty until age thirty or so .  many of those challenges will be rigged for success .  .  . or else mistakes can be smoothed over .  despite that  many of them will fail visibly and be dropped out of the pool .  but over time  i am statistically guaranteed at least one who suits my needs .  who looks  superficially  far too successful to be explained by natural means .      hari recalled a classic stock market scheme that had been successful in duping the inhabitants of krasner sector  seven hundred billion people  about eighty years ago .  daneel   s approach was a clever version of this old shell game  which only worked when practiced with immense patience .  it was also nearly impossible to detect when done properly .      so there won   t be an investigative commission  after all .  no need to report to sovereign human institutions for a decision .  if this fellow has always been right  that will give him enough credibility to impress most robots  who will simply accept whatever he decides .      of course  some will be wary that you are influencing him mentalically  and they   ll watch for that trick .  they   ll check his brain for signs of tampering .  but you won   t have to touch him .  you can use psychological techniques to sway him in advance toward the right decision  especially if you control his upbringing .  .  . as you did mine .      hari paused  chewing on a thought .     so  most robots will have their second law itch scratched .  getting    human approval    for your plan  without actually having to consult humanity at large .      of course  you know that some of them won   t swallow this scam .  many will rebel anyway  attempting to protect humanity from what they see as a seizure of power by a single mutant overmind .      daneel nodded .     over the years  ever since he broke company from me  my old ally  whom you knew as r .  gornon  has been preaching an apostasy called the minus one law .  an extension of the zeroth law  expanding our duties yet again .  requiring us to protect not just humanity  but the essential approach to life that humanity represents .  .  . diversity and intelligence  in all of their manifestations  whether human  robotic  or even alien .  those who believe in this notion will not appreciate a takeover of the galaxy by a single macro consciousness  eliminating all dissident elements .      moreover  some even now accuse me of faking the entire phenomenon of human mentalics .  they claim that it would be all too easy to contrive the appearance of this new mutation  by hiding micro thought amplifiers nearby and keeping them constantly focused on the supposed human telepath .      hari noted that his friend did not explicitly deny the rumor .  in fact  he recalled a certain jeweled pendant that wanda had never been without  ever since childhood .  .  . but that was off the subject .   daneel continued .      you are right  hari .  the robotic civil war will resume  soon after galaxia is unveiled .  but if approval by human volition can appear convincing enough  most robots will rally around galaxia .  they will see it as the only hope for saving mankind .      this time hari straightened  his back growing erect .  a fist tightened .      the only hope .  now see here       he was interrupted by the sound of footsteps approaching along the pebbly walk .  hari turned to see horis antic draw near .  the portly grey bureaucrat wore a patina of dust on his once impeccable uniform  and hari saw the fellow   s left hand quiver nervously as he popped another blue pill in his mouth .  antic was inherently anxious around robots  and events of the past two days had done nothing to settle his nerves .  fortunately  all of this would soon become a vague memory after they got him back to a trantor sanitarium  where just the right cover story could be implanted in his mind .  at least  that was wanda   s plan .  hari knew there would be more to it than that .      gaal dornick says i should tell you the ship is almost ready for takeoff .  the earthlings have agreed to take care of sybyl and the other survivors from ktlina .  they   ll be kind .  in time  the solipsism mania might ease enough to let them rejoin a simple society .      i still can   t believe all i   ve learned     horis continued .     it was one thing to find out that brain fever is a purposefully designed infection  aimed at the brightest humans .  but then to learn that chaos is similar .  .  .      daneel interrupted .     not similar at all .  brain fever is relatively gentle .  it was designed and released in order to combat the earlier chaos plague  whose first virulent versions escaped earth on the earliest starships .         was chaos a weapon of war .     horis asked  in muted tones .      no one knows  though some accounts say it was .  the first crude versions swept earth before i was made  prompting citizens to fear robots  their own great inventions .  later waves smashed the late terran renaissance  turning earthlings into agoraphobes and spacers into vicious paranoids .  everything that giskard did here     daneel motioned at the radioactive waste     and that i did in the following millennia  had its roots in this awful plague .         b b but      horis stuttered .     but what if there   s a cure .  wouldn   t that make everything right again .  all this stuff i   ve heard  and i only understand a little  all this talk about saving humanity from chaos .  most of it would be unnecessary if someone just found a cure .      for the first time  hari saw waves of irritation cross daneel olivaw   s face .      don   t you think that occurred to me  long ago .  what do you imagine i was working on for the first six thousand years .  in between having to fight a civil war against robots of the old religion  i devoted all my energies to finding some way of ripping out chaos by its roots .  but it was too late .  the virus had been cleverly designed to inveigle its way into human chromosomes  scattering and embedding itself in hundreds of crucial places .  even if i knew where they all were  it would take another deadly plague just to dig out every genetic site where chaos lay hidden .  trillions would die .      that was when i realized that chaos could only be staved off if we prevented the conditions that triggered an outbreak .  if ambition and individualism provoked the disease out of dormancy  then a conservative society offered the best hope .  a galactic empire  providing gentle peace  justice  and serenity to a society that never changed .      horis antic nodded .  naturally as a grey man  he shared an inclination toward orderliness  with everything classified and pigeonholed properly .     so there is no cure .  but what about natural immunity .  didn   t i hear someone talk about that  at one point .         the disease has always been tragically most virulent among humanity   s brightest .  even so  some highly intelligent people proved immune to the temptations of raging egotism and solipsism .  they can be individualists without denying the humanity of others .  but alas  this immunity is spreading too slowly .  if we had a thousand years  or two .  .  .      hari asked about something that had been bothering him .     were both maserd and mors planch immune .         biron maserd was protected against chaos by the noblesse oblige of his gentry class .  as for planch  you are right  hari .  his mind was startling .  almost unreadable with my mentalic powers .  he had lived immersed in three different chaos renaissances  yet remained completely agile .  flexible .  empathic  yet fierce .         kers kantun called him normal .         hmmm .     daneel rubbed his chin briefly .     kers had some unique ideas .  he thought that today   s humanity is not the same one that made us .  truly natural humans would not be subject to chaos  kers thought  nor would their minds be easily manipulated .      horis antic took a step forward .  the eagerness in his voice replaced his typical nervous tremor .     do you still have the records from your search for a cure .  there have been medical advances in the past few millennia  and millions of qualified workers might come up with ideas that you missed .      hari exhaled a sigh .      why do you bother  horis .  you know these memories will be washed away  or painted over  soon after we reach trantor .  you never struck me as the kind to chase curiosity for its own sake .      at this  horis reacted with a bitter frown .     perhaps i am more than you realize  seldon .      hari nodded .     of that  i am quite sure .  it only just occurred to me  last night  to review events since you and i first met  and look at them in a fresh light .      now  the grey man   s nervousness returned .  he popped another blue pill .     i don   t know what you   re talking about .  but right now i   ve taken too much of your time .  there are preparations to make .  i   ve got to help gaal dornick          no .     hari cut him off .     it   s time to have the truth  horis .      he turned to daneel .     have you ever tried to mindscan our young bureaucrat friend here .      horis gulped audibly at the mere thought of being mentalically probed .   daneel responded     i have a second law injunction to be courteous  hari .  i only invade human minds when some first or zeroth law need is apparent .         and so  you never felt compelled to scan horis .  well  let me override the injunction now .  take a peek .  i bet you   ll find it difficult .         no .  .  . please .  .  .     antic lifted both hands  as if to ward off daneel   s probing mentalic fingers .      you are right  hari .  it is extraordinarily hard  but this man is no mors planch .  he is achieving this through a combination of drugs and mental discipline  avoiding certain thoughts with scrupulous self control .         leave me alone .     horis cried  trying desperately to make his body turn around and flee .  but a gentle paralysis swarmed over him  and he instead slumped downward  seating himself on a nearby pile of rubble .  naturally  daneel would not have let him be hurt in a fall .      let me see the recording device     hari said  holding out one hand .   new tremors rocked the bureaucrat  but he finally complied  reaching into a coat pocket for a small scanner .  no doubt it was one of the best available to imperial operatives .      you had no intention of reaching the sanitarium  did you .  so long as everyone thought you meek and harmless  security would be lax .  at trantor  you would be in your element  able to tap a thousand different channels of communication .  .  . with a myriad of tricks that only a grey man might have access to .  locked doors would mysteriously open  and you   d be gone .      horis slumped  clearly seeing no further purpose in dissembling .  when he spoke  his voice seemed different  at once both defeated  and yet stronger .  with a note of rueful pride .      i got off a partial report from pengia .  you can   t stop that part of it .      hari nodded .     you were the secret contact who informed mors planch  who wanted the ktlinans to come .  why .  you hate chaos as much as i do .  kers kantun knew that  and i can see it in your character .      horis let out a sigh .     it was an experiment .  it wasn   t enough just to do a reconnaissance .  we had to create a crisis .  a scene of conflict with the chaos forces on one side and your tiktok pals on the other .  it proved an effective way to get you all talking  arguing  and justifying yourselves to each other .  i hardly had to put in a word  here or there .         your pose was impressive     hari said  and daneel added .     so is your mental discipline .  even without the drugs  i would have noticed nothing  until my attention was drawn fully toward you .      the compliments drew only a snort .      we are used to being underrated and derided by all the snooty gentry folk and self important meritocrats .  even eccentrics and citizens dismiss us as if we are part of the background .  long ago  we learned to stop resenting it  to control it  even to foster this impression .      horis made a fist .     but tell me  who runs this galactic empire .  even you  seldon  with your mathematical insight  and you  robot  who designed the trantorian regime in the first place .  you understand in theory  but you don   t really see .      who gets called when a sun flares  bumming half a continent on some provincial world .  who makes sure the navigational buoys all work .  who gets the children vaccinated  keeps the electricity flowing  and makes sure farmers tend the soil so their grandchildren will have something to plow .  who monitors the death rates  so health teams can be sent to some unknowing world before they even realize they   ve drifted into a space current that   s polluting their stratosphere with boron .  who sees to it that self indulgent gentry and preening meritocrats don   t wreck everything with one egotistical scheme after another .      hari accepted this .     we know that the grey order does noble work .  can i assume you set the notion in jeni cuicet   s mind  and arranged for her to take advantage of testing day .      horis chuckled sardonically .     how do you think she got her job on the orion elevator .  we   ve been quietly spiriting away some of the terminus exiles .  a few lives spared from involuntary banishment and imprisonment  that they were sentenced to for no fault of their own .         you say this  even though you claim to understand the seldon plan .      another snort .     one lesson that we teach again and again in the grey academies  something that you preached long ago  in the guise of ruellis      antic said this pointing at daneel      is that ends generally do not justify evil means .  anyway  grand rationalizations are for gentry and meritocrats .  we greys cannot afford them .  when people   s rights are being violated  someone has to do something .      he whirled toward hari seldon .     oh  the bloody arrogance of it all .  you publish scientific papers about psychohistory for decades  then suddenly go silent and set up a secret cabal to control it .  but aren   t you thereby assuming that nobody on twenty five million worlds paid attention during all the earlier years .  that some nitpickers in the bureaucracy wouldn   t have seen your discovery as a possible tool to be explored .  .  . and perhaps used for better government .      oh  there are only a few of us that i know of  but we   ve been looking into psychohistory for more than a decade .  our respect for you  dr .  seldon  matches anyone   s .  but your plan leaves us confused and filled with questions .  doubts we couldn   t approach you with openly .      hari understood .  mere bureaucrats would have been rebuffed  at best .  linge chen and the committee for public safety might arrest any clerks who knew too much .  then there were the rumors that hari seldon   s enemies often suffered inexplicable bouts of amnesia .      so ask your questions now  horis .  i owe you that much .      the small man took a deep breath  as if he had a lot to say .  but at first  all he could utter was a single word .      why .      he inhaled again .      why must the galactic empire topple .  it doesn   t have to .  true  things are loosening up .  some say falling apart .  but the equations .  .  . your equations .  .  . show nothing we can   t handle with a lot of sweat and hard work .  if technological competence is declining  give us resources to teach a better science curriculum .  unleash billions of bright youngsters .  stop rationing just a few measly slots at the technical schools .         we tried that once     hari started to answer .     on a planet called madder loss       but horis cut him off  rushing forth words  mostly to daneel .      even the chaos outbreaks might be controlled .  sure  they   re getting worse .  but the sanitation service is also getting better all the time .  and they   ve never lost a patient yet .  would you really end the empire  which has kept a gentle peace for twelve thousand years  just to keep humanity distracted for a few more centuries .  why not keep the empire going until your new solution is prepared .  is it because the people of the galaxy must be brought low  to a miserable state  so they   ll eagerly accept whatever you offer .      it was difficult for hari to switch modes .  for so long  he had treated horis in a patronizing manner .  he now saw the grey man in a new light  not only as a startlingly effective secret agent  but as a rough hewn psychohistorian  like yugo amaryl at the beginning of their long collaboration .  one who understood more than he had ever let on .      do you really think imperial institutions can handle more crises like ktlina .     hari shook his head .     that would be taking a terrible gamble .  if even a single plague site burst free to infect the galaxy .  .  .         if .  you   re talking about people  seldon .  almost twelve quadrillion people .  must they all be thrown into a dark age  just because you don   t trust us to do our jobs .      besides what if one of those new renaissances actually made it .  achieving the fabulous breakthrough they all dream of .  reaching the mythical other side  where intelligence and maturity overcome chaos .  if we keep them all quarantined  the galaxy can stay relatively safe .  meanwhile  experiments can be run  one planet at a time .      hari stared at horis antic  astonished by the man   s courage .  i could never take such chances .  he obviously hates chaos with a passion greater than mine .  but he loves the empire even more .   shaking his head again  hari answered     but ultimately it isn   t chaos worlds that are forcing daneel to bring down the empire .      it   s you  horis .      such was the look of stunned surprise on antic   s face that hari felt unable to speak .  he looked to daneel  silently asking his robot friend to explain  which he did in a voice like ruellis of old .      do not forget  my dear young human  that i invented your grey order .  i know its capabilities .  i am aware how many millions sacrifice themselves while wearing that uniform  unthanked and despised by the other castes .  you might even have managed  with resiliency and a little help from psychohistory  to keep the old empire sputtering along  until my new prize  my galaxia  is ready to be born .  but therein lies the rub .         you see  i also remember your ancestor  whose name was antyok  back when humanity stumbled on an actual alien race that had been spared by the terraformers .  robots from allover the galaxy convened to discuss the matter .  there were just a few thousand of the alien creatures  and humanity already numbered five quadrillion .  yet  we argued for a year about the danger these beings presented .  humans in every sector and province were agog with enthusiasm to help the nonhumans get on their feet .  an excitement for diversity and new voices to talk to .  some robots worried about the potential for triggering chaos .  others projected that the aliens might become a threat to humans in just a couple of thousand years if allowed to spread among the stars .  meanwhile  some  such as the robot you knew as r .  gornon  pleaded that nonhumans merited protection under an expanded version of the zeroth law .         the point is that none of our robotic deliberations ultimately mattered .  news reached our secret meeting ground that the aliens had escaped .  they hijacked starships that came into their possession through a twisty chain of mysterious coincidences .  investigators found more than enough blame to pass around  but they assigned none of it to the individual who was actually responsible .  your ancestor  a humble bureaucrat who knew all the right levers for manipulating the system  for getting justice done while pretending to be an innocuous  faceless official .      it was a different version of the story horis had told aboard ship .  but hari felt chills hearing it confirmed .   he nodded .     your very presence here  horis  shows this resiliency hasn   t been lost .  i was first minister of the empire  remember .  i know the data files on trantor are limitless .  nothing can be purged from them completely .  anyone with enough skill can defeat the amnesia and find what they need to know about the human past .  .  . and now about its future  as well .  you are a living demonstration of the reason for it all  horis .         me .  you mean the bureaucracy .  we faceless drones .  we dull bean counters and pencil pushers .  you mean the empire has to fall because of us .      hari nodded .     i never thought of it quite in that way before .  but then again  i   m not the one doing the toppling .     he glanced toward daneel .     this is all about human volition  isn   t it .  it   s all about that day  in five centuries or so  when a choice must be made by a man who is never wrong .  when that day comes  there must not be a galactic bureaucracy anymore .  no cubicles and dusty offices to burst forth with surprise meddlers  like horis and his friends .  no prim procedures to make sure every decision is deliberated openly .      the fall of trantor isn   t really about chaos  is it  daneel .  it is about killing your own fine invention  the grey order  the only way it can be killed  by total destruction of the filing cabinets  the computer memories  the men .  .  .      this time  r .  daneel olivaw didn   t answer .  the expression on his face sufficed .  if any human ever doubted that an immortal robot could feel pain  all question would be erased by looking at daneel   s promethean visage .        so we   re doomed to keep fighting the darkness .  .  . for nothing .  to die at our desks  never knowing the futility of it all .       hari put a hand on the younger man   s shoulder .     you must forget about this now .  go back to your paper folders and soil reports .  the knowledge you fought so hard to acquire  with such ingenuity and courage  will only cause you pain .  it   s time to let it go  horis .      antic looked up at hari bleakly .     you aren   t going to wait until trantor .      hari looked to daneel  appealing silently for a delay so that horis might at least converse with them during the voyage back .  but his robot friend answered with a terse shake of the head .  antic had proved too resourceful  too ready with fresh tricks up his sleeve .   sensing this  the grey man stood up  straightening his bearing  trying for some dignity .  but he could not keep from stuttering .      w will it hurt .      daneel spoke reassuringly to the human   s eyes .      not at all .  in fact .  .  . it is already done .           .     helped by the two software sims  joan and voltaire  they were at last able to find every sabotage bug that zorma   s group had planted aboard the ship .  lodovic shouted enthusiastically when the engines came back on  proclaiming his sense of triumph with a strut around the control room  exactly like a jubilant human male .   dors felt emotional patterns surge through her own simulation subroutines .  despite her ongoing sense of urgency  it had been oddly pleasant working side by side with trema  sharing theories and insights  trying one solution after another .  she enjoyed his swaggering victory display  which was not all that different from the way hari used to act  whenever he made some breakthrough in the models of psychohistory .      i am so sorry to interrupt this celebration      commented joan of arc  her slender boyish figure appearing in the central holo screen .  in the background  dors could see a male form wearing archaic doublets and hose  the simulation known as voltaire  listening intently to a pair of headphones  as if trying to pick up something faint with distance .      you asked us to monitor any transmissions coming from earth .  voltaire now reports picking up a message using code patterns characteristic of the second foundation .  it appears to be from wanda seldon  informing her compatriots on trantor that she has successfully recovered her grandfather .  the plot to kidnap him is foiled .  they will be departing earth within a few hours  taking hari straight home .       dors looked at lodovic  who exhaled a long sigh .      well then  i guess that   s it .  all this rushing about  and we hardly made a difference .  seldon is safe  and we never even had to confront daneel along the way .      dors felt genuine relief on both counts .  and yet  it was only natural to feel a bit let down .      i guess it   s just as well .  we   re just a couple of highly dressed up tiktoks .      lodovic laughed gently .     oh  i think we   re more than that .  you  at least  are something special  dors .  we should discuss this  at length .      dors nodded .  it sounded like a good idea .  they had much to talk about .  and yet  despite mixed feelings  it was easy to tell where her top priority lay .      i must go to trantor now  you understand .         and i agree .  you have strong obligations  and i wouldn   t think of interfering .  but perhaps we can meet when matters there have been resolved .      this time it was her turn to offer a soft smile .     it might be arranged .  meanwhile  can i drop you off somewhere along the way .         i   ll ride with you as far as demarchia .  there are some things i want to look into there .     then his voice lowered .     just be careful on trantor  will you .      dors shook her head .     i doubt anyone would choose to harm me .  besides  i can take care of myself .         it   s not harm done by others that i fear .  you are vulnerable  dors .  you were designed to be more human than any other robot .  your bond with hari is intense .  be prepared for a rough time when the end comes .  if you need someone to talk to       no more had to be said .  silence reigned while she took control of the ship and sent it plunging on the first of many long hyperspace jumps that would bring them to the center of the galaxy .  to the place where all roads led  and where she had one great duty left to perform  before her path could truly be called free .   it was promised that i could be with you just before you died  hari .   that vow she intended  above all else in the universe  to keep .        .     during his last sunset on earth  hari seldon watched gamma rays excite scintillations above old chicago .  ionized curtains glowed and rippled like polar auroras  only here the driving energy came not from a distant sun  but the ground itself .  he thought he could almost see patterns in the luminous sheets  like the clever living artwork in the imperial gardens that day when horis antic offered him a data wafer filled with tempting clues .  then  as hari watched  all semblance of organized structure vanished from the eerie horizon .  now the glow reminded him instead of shoufeen woods  where order had been banished and chaos was king .   preparations for departure were complete .  in a little while  hari would board wanda   s ship for the return to trantor and his former life  hated by the men and women he was exiling to terminus  feared by the present set of imperial rulers .  and revered by a small cabal of psychics and mathists who felt certain they knew the future course of history .   daneel would stay behind to settle matters with the earthling inhabitants .  there were arrangements to make .  the cracked sarcophagus had to be buried so others could not misuse the fateful rift in the space time continuum .   from his vantage point atop a pile of rubble  hari could hear the voice of horis antic jabbering with excitement as he packed away his collection of soil types  acquired during this visit to a strange world .  there could even be a scientific paper or two  something to brighten up his career profile  though nothing would erase the stigma associated with anyone who worked with dirt .   in any event  the fellow seemed happy .  daneel had done his job well .   feeling tremors in his legs  hari sat down again in the suspensor chair that wanda had provided .  he was needing it more  now that the rejuvenation treatments were wearing off .  soon he would be a frail old cripple again .   soon i will be dead .   seated  he could lean back  gazing toward the zenith where earth   s radiation glow surrendered to a glitter of starlight constellations that his ancestors no doubt knew by heart .  those stellar patterns had certainly changed in twenty thousand years  however  and he pondered how the sky might have looked if r .  gornon vlimt had his way  sending hari through time to a galaxy five hundred years older .  five hundred years more experienced with sorrow .   there were footsteps on the rubble path  too surefooted to be human .  after a long pause  daneel olivaw asked     what do you see up there  old friend .      hari felt a tautness in his throat .      the future .         indeed .  do you have a good view .      hari chuckled .      a comfortable chair .  .  . a high place to look from .  .  .  and of course  my equations .  oh yes  daneel .  i can see quite a bit from here .         and you are not disappointed .  about missing a trip into that future .         not very much .  it might have been interesting .  but you had reasons for preventing it  and i understand them .  i probably would have meddled .     hari laughed again .     besides  you   ll need a man who never makes mistakes  and i am anything but that .         do you have any special regrets .         just one .  i can see it right now .     hari gestured skyward  a bit to the left of zenith  but he wasn   t pointing to a constellation  rather  at a cluster of psychohistorical terms that floated in his sky  more real at this moment than the glittering stars .      please tell me     daneel entreated .     explain what you see up there .      hari realized that his immortal friend  capable of extending his vision from x rays to the radio spectrum  was at the moment  envious .  hari derived a strange pleasure from that .      i see my foundation  right now being established on terminus  beginning its bumpy path toward adventure and glory .  the probabilities are strong for two centuries  at least .  psychosocial momentum has built up to a point where i can almost see the actors in this play .  the encyclopedists  politicians  traders  and charlatans will live in a time of great personal danger .  and yet they   ll draw satisfaction from a sense of participating in something grand .  building a society that is preordained for success .      hari lifted his other hand  pointing toward a flickering in earth   s ionized atmosphere .      ah .  did you see that .  a perturbation .  they are happening all the time  though most cancel each other out .  besides  we designed the foundation to be robust  adapting to every flux and disturbance with great resiliency .      and yet  with so much riding on the plan  do we dare let human destiny depend on the reactions of a few million of our descendants .  can we trust them to respond with as much courage and determination as the equations predict .      hari shook his head .     no  we cannot .  you convinced me of that  long ago  daneel .  perturbations from the plan must be corrected .  the plan must be kept on course .  to do this  we shall need a guiding hand .  a second foundation  using mathematics to track every swerve and deviation  then applying pressure here and there  at just the right points  so that the first foundation stays on its assigned trajectory .      he sighed .     i was easy to persuade .  after all  the second foundation is an extension of me .  a form of immortality .  a way i can keep poking and meddling after this physical frame has been eaten by worms and turned into the soil horis admires so much .  the second foundation might have been yugo amaryl   s idea  did you inspire him though .  in any event  vanity alone was enough to make me agree to it .      but then you started demanding even more  daneel .      will mathematics suffice .  you worried that my successors wouldn   t be strong enough .  a society of secret guides will need something more potent than equations .  a superhuman power  enabling them to sway kings  mayors  and scientists away from perturbing thoughts  diverting them back toward the tracks they had been assigned .  and     no sooner did you make this suggestion  than such a tool appears .      hari gestured toward the horizon  where old chicago flickered with a steady glow .     your gift to the seldon plan  daneel  mentalics .  we really had to do a major reformulation of the plan when that came to light .  fortunately  the mutation only appeared where you wanted it to .  some of the psychics will help seed your great universal mind  while others breed with my fifty mathists  creating a new race that is capable of both calculation and magic .      there was silence atop the rubble mound .  finally  daneel commented     you see a lot up there  my old friend .      hari nodded .      oh yes  i see all the adjustments we had to make in the equations  in order to deal with this new aristocracy that will be inbreeding for the next several centuries  developing its power and influence  relying ever more on mentalic dominance  and less on mathematics .  if they are left in charge  even with a tradition of duty and noblesse oblige  they will eventually become a ruling class .  a ruling race .  one that will make every prior priesthood or royal family seem like amateurs .      hari glanced up at daneel .      but what choice have we .  eventually the foundation will stop being distracted by momentary crises  by galactic competitors and the challenge of expansion .  in time  the civilization we establish on terminus will reach a new height of confidence .  .  . and face its inevitable collision with chaos .  at that point  our predictions grow more approximate .  the psychohistorical equations show the foundation   s odds of success will have winnowed down to only seventy percent or so .         that is not good enough  hari .  not nearly good enough .         so you insisted  daneel .  the foundation will be as strong  dynamic  and empathic as any human civilization could possibly be .  if any culture could ever be prepared to take on chaos  survive the solipsism plagues  and burst through to the other side  this will be the one .  and yet  if it fails .  .  .         that   s the rub  hari .         indeed .  we   re left with a one in four chance that humanity itself might be destroyed .  i can see why you wanted something better  daneel .  you were compelled to do anything in your power that might boost the odds .      first  you demanded a secret mentalic society  to help guide the first foundation .  but that only altered a few percentage points .  worse  it actually introduced new perturbations .  resentment by common folk against a psychic aristocracy  for instance .  and danger from rogue mentalics .      hari lifted both hands .     quite a choice isn   t it .  either a hell bent battle with chaos or a permanent mutant ruling class .  no wonder you finally decided there must be a third solution .  no wonder you   ve worked so hard to develop gaia  as a way to replace the seldon plan .      when he responded  there was deep respect and compassion in daneel   s voice .      your work still has great importance  hari .  humanity must be kept engaged during the next few centuries .         engaged .  you mean distracted  don   t you .  the people of my foundation will think they are bold explorers  holding destiny in their hands  winning a better future by their own efforts  though aided by laws of history .  then  abruptly  you   ll bring this new thing upon them .  already approved by some fellow who knows everything .         a man who is always right     daneel corrected .   hari waved a hand .     whatever .      daneel sighed .      i know you have reservations  hari .  but consider the long range prospect .  what if there are entities in other galaxies  similar to the meme minds we encountered on trantor .  what if they are more powerful .  perhaps they have already assimilated all life forms in their home galaxies .  their influence may even now be stretching this way  toward us .  that outside force could be a terrible threat to humanity .  only if the human species is unified  powerful  and cohesive  a true galaxia superorganism  can we be assured of your survival .      hari blinked for a moment .     isn   t that a far fetched scenario .  or at least a long way off .         perhaps .  but dare i take that chance .  i am compelled by the zeroth law  and by my promise to elijah baley  to protect you all  no matter what the pains .  no matter what the cost .      r .  daneel olivaw took a step forward  motioning toward the heavens .     besides  think of it  hari .  every human soul in contact with every other one .  all knowledge shared instantly .  all misunderstandings erased .  every bird  animal  and insect incorporated into the vast  unified web .  the ultimate of serenity and understanding that your ancient sages yearned for .  and it can be achieved in just over half the time that you project for the foundation   s final battle with chaos .         yes  it has attractive features     hari conceded .      and yet  my mind and heart keep pondering terminus  at the opposite side of the galaxy .  a small world very much like this one .  .  . this poor  wounded earth .  despite everything  daneel  the odds were in their favor .  all the factors agreed .  they would have had a good chance          seventy percent is not good enough .         so you won   t let them try .         hari  even if they do break through to that mythical other side  you don   t know what kind of society they will build afterward .  you admit the socio equations explode into singularities at that point .  all right  the foundationers may defeat chaos .  they may achieve some great new wisdom  but then what .  how about the next crisis to come along .  psychohistory offers no insights .  both you and i are blind .  we have no idea what would follow .  no ability to plan or protect them .      hari nodded .     that uncertainty .  .  . that inability to predict .  .  . has been my lifelong terror .  it   s what i always fought against  and the bond that united me to you  daneel .  only now  as i approach my end  do i see a strange sort of beauty in it .      humanity has been like a child who was horribly traumatized  and thereafter stayed in the nursery  where it could be kept safe and warm .  you may differ with the calvinians over many things  daneel .  but you both prescribed amnesia to help ease our collective trauma  a dull forgetfulness that could have vanished anytime our protectors chose to pull back the blinds and open the door .  but you never did .      treating us that way would have been a horrible crime  except for the excuse of chaos .  and even with that excuse  isn   t there a limit .  a point at which the child must be untethered  letting her take on new challenges .  facing the future on its own terms .      hari smiled .     we can only ask that our descendants be better than we are .  we cannot demand that they be perfect .  they   ll have to solve their problems  one at a time .      daneel stared for a while  then looked away .      you may be able to take such an attitude  late in life  but my programming is less flexible .  i cannot take risks with humanity   s survival .         i see that .  but consider  daneel .  if elijah baley were here right now  don   t you think he would be willing to take a chance .      the robot didn   t answer .  silence stretched between them  and that was all right with hari .  he was still looking at equations painted across the stars  waiting for something to reappear .   something he had glimpsed before .   abruptly  several of the floating factors entered a new orbit  coalescing in a pattern that existed nowhere except in his own mind .  no existing version of the seldon plan prime radiant contained this insight .  perhaps it was an old man   s hallucination .  or else  an emergent property arising from all the new things he had learned during this final adventure .   either way  it made him smile .   ah  there you are again .  are you real .  or a manifestation of wishful thinking .   the motif was that of a circle  returning to its origins .   hari looked up at daneel  no doubt the noblest person he had ever met .  after twenty thousand years  struggling for the sake of humanity  the robot was undeterred  unbowed  as resolute as ever to deliver his masters to some destination that was safe  happy  and secure .   surely he will keep his final promise to me .  i will get to see my beloved wife  one last time .   having lived more intimately with a robot than any human  hari had some sympathy for zorma and cloudia  who wanted greater union between the two races .  perhaps in many centuries their approach would combine with others in some rich brew .  but their hopes and schemes were irrelevant at present .  for now  only two versions of destiny showed any real chance of success .  daneel   s galaxia  on the one hand .  .  .  and the glimmering figure hari now saw floating in the sky above him .      our children may surprise you  daneel     he commented at last  breaking the long silence .   pondering briefly  his robot friend replied     these children  you refer to the descendants of those exiled to terminus .      hari nodded .     five hundred and some odd years from now  they will already be a diverse and persnickety people  proud of both their civilization and their individuality .  you may fool a majority of robots with your    man who is always right     but i doubt many in the foundation will accept it .         i know     daneel acknowledged with pain in his voice .     there will be resistance against assimilation by gaia .  shortsighted panic  perhaps even violence .  all of it unavailing in the long run .      but hari reacted with a smile .      i don   t think you quite understand  daneel .  it   s not resistance that you have to worry about .  it will be a strange kind of acceptance that poses the greatest danger to your plan .         what do you mean .         i mean  how can you be so sure that it won   t be gaia that   s assimilated .  perhaps the culture of that future foundation will be so strong  so diverse and open  that they will simply absorb your innovation  give gaia citizenship papers  and then move on to even greater things .      daneel stared at hari .     i .  .  . find this hard to envision .         it   s part of the pattern life has followed since it climbed from the ooze .  the simple gets incorporated into the complex .  for all of its power and glory  gaia  and galaxia  are simple beings .  perhaps their beauty and power will only be part of something larger .  something more diverse and grand than you ever imagined .         i cannot encompass this .  it sounds risky .  there is no assurance .  .  .      hari laughed .      oh  my dear friend .  both of us have always been obsessed with predictability .  but sometimes you just have to understand  the universe isn   t ours to control .      though his body felt weak  hari sat up higher in the flotation chair .      i   ll tell you what  daneel .  let   s make a wager .         a wager .      hari nodded .     if you have your way  and gaia assimilates everybody  eventually creating a vast unitary galaxia  tell me this  will there be any more need for books .         of course not .  by definition  all members of the collective will know  almost instantaneously  anything that is learned by the others .  books  in whatever form  are a technique for passing information between separate minds .         ah .  and this assimilation should be complete  by say  six hundred years from now .  seven hundred  at the outside .         it should be .         on the other hand  suppose i am right .  imagine that my foundation turns out to be stronger  wiser  and more robust than you  wanda  or any of the robots expect .  perhaps it will defeat you  daneel .  they may decide to reject outside influence by robots  or human mentalics  or even all wise cosmic minds .      or else  maybe they will accept galaxia as a marvelous gift  incorporate it in their culture  and move on .  either way  human diversity and individualism will continue in some form .  and there will still be a need for books .  perhaps even an encyclopedia galactica .         but i thought the encyclopedia was just a ruse  to get the foundation started on terminus .      hari waved a hand in front of him .     never mind that .  there will be encyclopedias  though perhaps not at first .  but the question that now lies before us  the subject of our wager  is this .      will there still be editions of the encyclopedia galactica published a thousand years from now .      if your galaxia plan succeeds  in its pure and simple form  there will be no books or encyclopedias in one millennium   s time .  but if i am right  daneel  people will still be creating and publishing compendiums of knowledge .  they may share countless insights and intimacies through mentalic powers  the way people now make holovision calls .  who knows .  but they will also maintain a degree of individuality  and keep on communicating with each other in old fashioned ways .      if i   m right  daneel  the encyclopedia will thrive .  .  .  along with our children .  .  . and my first love .  the foundation .        hari seldon lapsed into silence  a quiet reflection that r .  daneel olivaw respected .   soon  his granddaughter wanda would come up this slope  a crumbling hill composed of rubble from past human civilizations  and collect him for the journey back to trantor .  .  . and perhaps to a special reunion that he longed for .   but for the remaining moment  hari admired a vista stretching overhead  the galactic starscape imbued with his beloved mathematics .  he stared up at the radiation flecked sky  and greeted chaos  his old enemy .   i know you at last  he thought .   you are the tiger  who used to hunt us .  you are winter   s cold .  you are famine   s bitter hunger .  .  . the surprise betrayal .  .  . or the illness that struck without warning  leaving us crying out  why .   you are every challenge humanity faced  and eventually overcame  as we grew just a little mightier and wiser with each triumph .  you are the test of our confidence .  .  . our ability to persist and prevail .   i was justified in fighting you .  .  . and yet  without your opposition  humanity would be nothing  and there could never be a victory .   chaos  he now realized  was the underlying substance out of which his equations evolved .  as well as life itself .   anyway  it would be pointless to resent it now .  soon  his molecules would join chaos in its everlasting dance .   but up there  amid the stars  his lifelong dream still lived .   we will know .  we will understand and grow beyond all limits that imprison us .   in time  we will be greater than we ever imagined possible .     acknowledgments    among the    asimov

skilled reading caught many errors  whose hands substituted for mine in a crisis  and who kept life going when i felt like a hapless robot .   the quotation in part    about the gospel of uniformity  is from alfred north whitehead   s book  science and the modern world       .     afterword    it is never easy to write in a universe that was created by another  in this case brilliant  writer .  especially when that writer is lamentably no longer around to consult by letter  or phone  or over a glass of beer .  one must study his works in order to forge a new episode that has consistency with the original stories  and yet contribute fresh insights that he might have enjoyed reading .  in this case  all three authors of the second foundation trilogy  greg bear  gregory benford  and i  felt compelled by the logic of isaac asimov   s universe to add the key element of chaos  a horrible disease of the mind  afflicting all of humanity .  isaac left plenty of clues to this very thing  allowing our innovation to stay consistent with his earlier works .  moreover  chaos explains the major salient feature of his future history  an amnesia that debilitates quadrillions of people for hundreds of generations .   i could go on about the reasons why i wrote this new layer the way i did  but at this point i   ll forgo any further comments  except to say that i don   t see the story of hari seldon being quite finished .  as isaac did habitually  i laced foundation   s triumph with clues that others might take up someday  if they choose .  hints that culminate in two wry pages that i considered including as a denouement to this book .  but instead of muddying the waters  perhaps i   ll just post them elsewhere sometime .  they are not so much a part of foundation   s triumph as a dream of what just might happen next .   that is what   s so much fun about our ongoing dinnertable conversation about destiny .  we get to poke away at the future .  explore it with experiments and fantasies .  discover mistakes to avoid .  and uncover possibilities that our grandchildren may take for granted .     timeline for the robots and foundation universe         c . e .  birth of susan

dies because of first law conflicts .   robots and empire  the great diaspora  final emigration  begins .  a majority of robots split into two camps .  giskardians led by daneel follow the new zeroth
