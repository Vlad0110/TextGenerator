begin reading     polly cut off her hair in front of the mirror  feeling slightly guilty about not feeling very guilty about doing so .  it was supposed to be her crowning glory  and everyone said it was beautiful  but she generally wore it in a net when she was working .  she   d always told herself it was wasted on her .  yet she was careful to see that the long golden coils all landed on the small sheet spread out for the purpose .   if she would admit to any strong emotion at all at this time  it was sheer annoyance that a haircut was all she needed to pass for a young man .  she didn   t even need to bind up her bosom  which she   d heard was the normal practice .  nature had seen to it that she had barely any problems in this area .   the effect that the scissors had was   erratic  but it was no worse than other male haircuts here .  it   d do .   she did feel cold on the back of her neck  but that was only partly because of the loss of her long hair .  it was also because of the stare .   the duchess watched her from above the bed .   it was a poor woodcut  hand colored  mostly in blue and red .  it was of a plain  middle aged woman whose sagging chin and slightly bulging eyes gave the cynical the feeling that someone had put a large fish in a dress  but the artist had managed to capture something extra in that strange  blank expression .  some pictures had eyes that followed you around the room  this one looked right through you .  it was a face you found in every home .  in borogravia  you grew up with the duchess watching you .   polly knew her parents had one of the pictures in their room  and knew also that when her mother was alive she used to curtsy to it every night .   she reached up and turned this picture around so that it faced the wall .   a thought in her head said no .  it was overruled .  she   d made up her mind .   then she dressed herself in her brother   s clothes  tipped the contents of the sheet into a small bag that went into the bottom of her pack along with the spare clothes  put a note to her father on her bed  picked up the pack  and climbed out of the window .  at least  polly climbed out of the window  but it was oliver   s feet that landed lightly on the ground .   dawn was just turning the dark world into monochrome when she slipped across the inn   s yard .   the duchess watched her from the inn sign  too .  her father had been a great loyalist  at least up to the death of her mother .  the sign hadn   t been repainted this year  and a random bird dropping had given the duchess a squint .   polly checked that the recruiting sergeant   s cart was still in front of the bar  its bright banners now drab and heavy with last night   s rain .  by the look of that big fat sergeant  it would be hours before it was on the road again .  she had plenty of time .  he looked like a slow breakfaster .   she let herself out of the door in the back wall and headed uphill .   at the top  she turned back and looked at the waking town .  smoke was rising from a few chimneys  but since polly was always the first to wake  and she yelled the maids out of their beds  the inn was still sleeping .  she knew that the widow clambers had stayed overnight  it had been    raining too hard for her to go home     according to polly   s father  and  personally  she hoped for his sake that she   d stay every night .  the town had no shortage of widows  for nuggan   s sake  and olga clambers was a warm hearted lady who baked like a champion .  his wife   s long illness and paul   s long absence had taken a lot out of her father .  polly was glad some of it was put back .  the old ladies who spent their days glowering from their windows might spy and peeve and mumble  but they had been doing that for too long .  no one listened anymore .   she raised her gaze .  smoke and steam were already rising from the laundry of the girls    working school .  the building hung over one end of the town like a threat  big and gray with tall  thin windows .  it was always silent .   when she was small  she   d been told that was where the bad girls went .  the nature of    badness    was not explained  and at the age of five polly had received the vague idea that it consisted of not going to bed when you were told .  at the age of eight she   d learned it was where you were lucky not to go for buying your brother a paint box .   she turned her back and set off between the trees  which were full of birdsong .   forget you were ever polly .  think young male  that was the thing .  fart loudly and with self satisfaction at a job well done  walk like a puppet that   d had a couple of random strings cut  never hug anyone  and  if you meet a friend  punch them .  a few years working in the bar had provided plenty of observational material .  no problem about not swinging her hips  at least .  nature had been pretty sparing there  too .   and then there was the young male walk to master .  at least women swung only their hips .  young men swung everything  from the shoulders down .  you have to try to occupy a lot of space  she thought .  it makes you look bigger  like a tomcat fluffing his tail .  she   d seen it a lot in the inn .  the boys tried to walk big in self defense against all those other big boys out there .  i   m bad  i   m fierce  i   m cool  i   d like a pint of shandy and me mam wants me home by nine     let   s see  now   arms out from the body as though holding a couple of bags of flour   check .  shoulders swaying as though she was elbowing her way through a crowd   check .  hands slightly bunched and making rhythmical circling motions as though turning two independent handles attached to the waist   check .  legs moving forward loosely and apelike   check     it worked fine for a few yards until she got something wrong and the resultant muscular confusion somersaulted her into a holly bush .  after that  she gave up .   the thunderstorm came back as she hurried along the trail  sometimes one would hang around the mountains for days .  but at least up here the path wasn   t a river of mud  and the trees still had enough leaves to give her some protection .   there was no time to wait out the weather  anyway .  she had a long way to go .  the recruiting party would cross at the ferry  but polly was known to all the ferrymen by sight and the guard would want to see her permit to travel  which oliver perks certainly didn   t have .  so that meant a long diversion all the way to the troll bridge at t  bz .  to the trolls  all humans looked alike and any piece of paper would do as a permit  since they didn   t read .  then she could walk down through the pine forests to pl  n .   the cart would have to stop there for the night  but the place was one of those nowhere villages that existed only in order to avoid the embarrassment of having large empty spaces on the map .  it was just what she wanted .  no one knew her in pl  n .  no one ever went there .  it was a dump .   it was  in fact  just the place she needed .  the recruiting party would stop there  and she could enlist .  she was pretty certain the big fat sergeant and his greasy little corporal wouldn   t notice the girl who   d served them last night .  she was not  as they said  conventionally beautiful .  the corporal had tried to pinch her bottom  but probably out of habit  like swatting a fly  and there was not enough for a big pinch  at that .   she sat on the hill above the ferry and had a late breakfast of cold potato and sausage while she watched the cart cross over .  no one was marching behind it .  no lads had been recruited back in munz this time .  people had kept away .  too many young men had left over the last few years  and not enough had come back  and of the ones who   d come back  sometimes not enough of each man had come back .  the corporal could bang his big drum all he liked .  munz was running out of sons almost as fast as it accumulated widows .   the afternoon hung heavy and humid  and a yellow pine warbler followed her from bush to bush .   last night   s mud was steaming when polly reached the troll bridge  which crossed the river in a narrow gorge .  it was a thin  graceful affair  put together  it was said  with no mortar at all .  and it was said that the weight of the bridge anchored it ever more deeply into the rock on either side .  it was said to be a wonder of the world  except that very few people around here ever wondered much about anything and were barely aware of the world .   it cost one penny to cross  or one hundred gold pieces if you had a billygoat .       halfway across polly peered over the parapet and saw the cart far  far below  working its way along the narrow road just above the white water .   the afternoon   s journey was downhill all the way  through dark pines on this side of the gorge .  she didn   t hurry and  toward sunset  she spotted the inn .  the cart had already arrived  but by the looks of it the recruiting sergeant had not even bothered to make an effort .  there was no drum banging like there had been last night  no cries of    roll up  my young shavers .  it   s a great life in the ins and outs .         there was always a war .  usually they were border disputes  the national equivalent of complaining that the neighbor was letting their hedge grow too long .  sometimes they were bigger .  borogravia was a peace loving country in the midst of treacherous  devious  warlike enemies .  they had to be treacherous  devious  and warlike  otherwise we wouldn   t be fighting them  eh .  there was always a war .   polly   s father had been in the army before he took over the duchess from polly   s grandfather .  he didn   t talk about it much .  he   d brought his sword back with him  but instead of hanging it over the fireplace he used it to poke the fire .   sometimes old friends would turn up and  when the bars were shut for the night  they   d gather around the fire and drink and sing .  the young polly found excuses to stay up and listen to the songs they sang  but that had stopped when she   d got into trouble for using one of the more interesting words in front of her mother  now she was older  and served the beer  it was presumably assumed that she knew the words or would find out what they meant soon enough .  besides  her mother had gone where bad words would no longer offend and  in theory  never got said .   the songs had been part of her childhood .  she knew all the words of    the world turned upside down    and    the devil shall be my sergeant    and    johnny has gone for a soldier    and    the girl i left behind me    and  after the drink had been flowing for a while  she   d memorized    colonel crapski    and    i wish i   d never kissed her .      and then  of course  there had been    sweet polly oliver .     her father used to sing it when she was small  and fretful or sad  and she   d laughed to hear it simply because it had her name in it .  she was word perfect on the words before she   d known what most of them meant .   and now      polly pushed open the door .  the recruiting sergeant and his corporal looked up from the stained table where they were sitting  beer mugs halfway to their lips .   she took a deep breath  marched over  and made an attempt at saluting .      what do you want  kid .     growled the corporal .      want to join up  sir .      the sergeant turned to polly and grinned  which made his scars move oddly and caused a tremor to shake all his chins .  the word    fat    could not honestly be applied to him  not when the word    gross    was lumbering forward to catch your attention .  he was one of those people who didn   t have a waist .  he had an equator .  he had gravity .  if he fell over  in any direction  he would rock .   sun and drink had burned his face red .  small dark eyes twinkled in the redness like the sparkle on the edge of a knife .  beside him  on the table  were a couple of old fashioned cutlasses  weapons that had more in common with a meat cleaver than a sword .      just like that .     he said .      yessir .         really .         yessir .         you don   t want us to get you stinking drunk first .  it   s traditional  you know .         nosir .         i haven   t told you about the wonderful opportunities for advancement and good fortune  have i .         nosir .         did i mention how the spanking red uniform will mean you   ll have to beat the girls off with a stick .         don   t think so  sir .         or the grub .  every meal   s a banquet when you march along with us .     the sergeant smacked his belly  which caused tremors in outlying regions .     i   m the living proof .         yes  sir .  no  sir .  i just want to join up to fight for my country and the honor of the duchess  sir .         you do .     said the corporal incredulously  but the sergeant appeared not to hear this .  he looked polly up and down  and polly got the definite impression that the man was neither as drunk nor as stupid as he looked .      upon my oath  corporal strappi  it seems that what we   ve got ourselves here is nothin    less than a good  old fashioned patriot     he said  his eyes searching polly   s face .     well  you   ve come to the right place  my lad .     he pulled a sheaf of papers toward him with an air of bustle .     you know who we are .         the tenth foot  sir .  light infantry  sir .  known as the    ins and outs     sir     said polly  relief bubbling through her .  she   d clearly passed some sort of test .      right  lad .  the jolly old cheesemongers .  finest regiment there is  in the finest army in the world .  keen to join  then  are yer .         keen as mustard  sir .     said polly  aware of the corporal   s suspicious eyes on her .      good lad .      the sergeant unscrewed the top from a bottle of ink and dipped a nib pen in it .  his hand hovered over the paperwork .      name  lad .     he said .      oliver  sir .  oliver perks     said polly .      age .         seventeen come sunday  sir .         yeah  right     said the sergeant .     you   re seventeen and i   m the grand duchess annagovia .  what   re you running away from  eh .  got a young lady in the family way .         he   d have    ad to have    ad help     said the corporal  grinning unpleasantly .     he squeaks like a little lad .      polly realized she was starting to blush .  but then  young oliver would blush too  wouldn   t he .  it was very easy to make a boy blush .  polly could do it just by staring .      don   t matter anyway     said the sergeant .     you make your mark on this here document and kiss the duchess and you   re my little lad  you understand .  my name is sergeant jackrum .  i will be your mother and your father  and corporal strappi here will be just like your big brother .  and life will be steak and bacon every day  and anyone who wants to drag you away   ll have to drag me away too  because i   ll be holding onto your collar .  and you might well be thinking there   s no one that can drag that much  mr .  perks .     a thick thumb jabbed at the paper .     just there  right .      polly picked up the pen and signed .      what   s that .     said the corporal .      my signature     said polly .   she heard the door open behind her  and spun around .  several young men   she corrected herself  several other young men   had clattered into the bar  and were looking around warily .      you can read and write  too .     said the sergeant  glancing up at them and then back to her .     yeah  i see .  a nice round hand  too .  officer material  you are .  give him the shilling  corporal .  and the picture  of course .         right  sergeant     said corporal strappi  holding up a picture frame on a handle  like a looking glass .     pucker up  private parts .         it   s perks  sir     said polly .      yeah  right .  now kiss the duchess .      it was not a good copy of the famous picture .  the painting behind the glass was faded  and something   some kind of moss or something   was growing on the inside of the cracked glass itself .  polly let her lips brush it while holding her breath .      huh     said strappi  and pressed something into her hand .      what   s this .     said polly  looking at the small square of paper .      an iou .  bit short of shillings right now     said the sergeant  while strappi smirked .     but the innkeeper   ll stand you a pint of ale  courtesy of her grace .      he turned and looked up the newcomers .     well  it never rains but it pours .  you boys here to join up too .  my word  and we didn   t even have to bang the drum .  it must be corporal strappi   s amazin    charisma .  step up  don   t be shy .  who   s the next likely lad .      polly looked at the next recruit with a horror that she hoped she was concealing .  she hadn   t really noticed him in the gloom  because he was wearing black   not cool  styled black  but a dusty black  the kind of suit a person got buried in .  by the look of it  that person had been him .  there were cobwebs all over it .  the boy himself had stitches across his forehead .      your name  lad .     said jackrum .      igor  thur .      jackrum counted the stitches .      you know  i had a feeling it was going to be     he said .     and i see you   re eighteen .            awake    .         oh  gods        commander samuel vimes put his hands over his eyes .      i beg your pardon  your grace .     said the ankh morpork consul to zlobenia .     are you ill  your grace .         what   s your name again  young man .     said vimes .     i   m sorry  but i   ve been traveling for two weeks and not getting a lot of sleep and i   ve spent all day being introduced to people with difficult names .  that   s bad for the brain .         it   s clarence  your grace .  clarence chinny .         chinny .     said vimes  and clarence read everything in his expression .      i   m afraid so  sir     he said .      were you a good fighter at school .     said vimes .      no  your grace  but no one could beat me over the one hundred yard dash .      vimes laughed .      well  clarence  any national anthem that starts with    awake .     is going to lead to trouble .  they didn   t teach you this in the patrician   s office .         er   no  your grace     said chinny .      well  you   ll find out .  carry on  then .         yes  sir .     chinny cleared his throat .     the borogravian national anthem     he announced  for the second time .       awake sorry  your grace  ye sons of the motherland  taste no more the wine of the sour apples  woodsman  grasp your choppers .   farmers  slaughter with the tool formerly used for lifting  beets the foe .   frustrate the endless wiles of our enemies  we into the darkness march singing  against the whole world in arms coming  but see the golden light upon the mountain tops .   the new day is a great big fish .        er       vimes said .     that last bit    .         that is a literal translation  your grace     said clarence nervously .     it means something like    an amazing opportunity    or    a glittering prize     your grace .         when we   re not in public  clarence     sir    will do .     your grace    is just to impress the natives .     vimes slumped back in his uncomfortable chair  chin in his hand  and then winced .      two thousand three hundred miles     he said  shifting his position .     and it   s freezing on a broomstick  however low they fly .  and then the barge  and then the coach       he winced again .     i read your report .  do you think it   s possible for an entire nation to be insane .      clarence swallowed .  he   d been told that he was talking to the second most powerful man in ankh morpork  even if the man himself acted as though he was ignorant of the fact .  his desk in this chilly tower room was rickety  it had belonged to the head janitor of the kneck garrison until yesterday .  paperwork cluttered its scarred surface and was stacked in piles behind vimes   s chair .   vimes himself did not look  to clarence  like a duke .  he looked like a watchman  which  in fact  clarence understood  he was .  this offended clarence chinny .  people at the top should look as though they belonged there .      that   s a very   interesting question  sir     he said .     you mean the people           not the people  the nation     said vimes .     borogravia looks off its head to me  from what i   ve read .  i expect the people just do the best they can and get on with raising their kids  which  i might say  i   d rather be doing right now  too .  look  you know what i mean .  you take a bunch of people who don   t seem any different from you and me  but when you add them all together you get this sort of huge raving maniac with national borders and an anthem .         it   s a fascinating idea  sir     said clarence diplomatically .   vimes looked around the room .  the walls were bare stone .  the windows were narrow .  it was damn cold  even on a sunny day .  all that bad food  and that bumping about and sleeping on bad beds   and all that traveling in the dark  too  on dwarf barges in their secret canals under the mountains  the gods alone knew what intricate diplomacy lord vetinari had pulled off to get that  although the low king owed vimes a few favors        all of that for this cold castle over this cold river between these stupid countries  with their stupid war .  he knew what he wanted to do .  if they   d been people  scuffling in the gutter  he   d have known what to do .  he   d have banged their heads together and maybe shoved them in the cells overnight .  but you couldn   t bang countries together .   vimes picked up some paperwork  fiddled with it  and threw it down again .      to hell with this     he said .     what   s happening out there .         i understand there are a few pockets of resistance in some of the more inaccessible areas of the keep  but they are being dealt with .  for all practical purposes the keep is in our hands .  that was a clever ruse of yours  your gr   sir .      vimes sighed .     no  clarence  it was a dull old ruse .  it should not be possible to get men into a fortress dressed as washerwomen .  three of them had moustaches  for goodness sake .         the borogravians are rather   old fashioned about things like that  sir .  on that subject  we appear to have zombies in the lower crypts .  dreadful things .  a lot of high ranking borogravian military men were interred down there over the centuries  apparently .         really .  what are they doing now .      clarence raised his eyebrows .     lurching  sir  i think .  groaning .  zombie things .  something seems to have stirred them up .         us  probably     said vimes .  he got up  strode across the room  and pulled open the big heavy door .      reg .     he yelled .   after a moment  another watchman appeared and saluted .  he was gray faced and clarence couldn   t help noticing when the man saluted that the hand and fingers were held together with stitching .      have you met constable shoe  clarence .     said vimes cheerfully .     one of my staff .  been dead for more than thirty years and loves every minute of it  eh  reg .         right  mister vimes     said reg  grinning and revealing a lot of brown teeth .      some fellow countrymen of yours down in the cellar  reg     said vimes .      oh  dear .  lurching  are they .            fraid so  reg .         i shall go and have a word with them     said reg .  he saluted again and marched out  with a hint of a lurch .      fellow countrymen .  he   s  er  from here .     said chinny  who had gone quite pale .      oh  no .  the undiscovered country     said vimes .     he   s dead .  however  credit where it   s due  he hasn   t let that stop him .  you didn   t know we have a zombie in the watch  clarence .         er   no  sir .  i haven   t been back to the city in five years .     he swallowed .     i gather things have changed .      horribly so  in clarence chinny   s opinion .  being consul to zlobenia had been an easy job  which left him a lot of time to get on with his business .  and then the big semaphore towers marched through  all along the valley  and suddenly ankh morpork was an hour away .  before the clacks  a letter from ankh morpork would take more than two weeks to get to him  and so no one worried if he took a day or two to answer it .  now people expect a reply overnight .  he   d been quite glad when borogravia had destroyed several of those wretched towers .  and then all hell had been let loose .      we   ve got all sorts in the watch     said vimes .     and we bloody well need    em now  clarence  with zlobenians and borogravians scrapping in the streets over some damn quarrel that began a thousand years ago .  it   s worse than dwarfs and trolls .  all because someone   s great to the power of umpteen grandmother slapped the face of someone   s great ditto uncle .  borogravia and zlobenia can   t even agree on a border .  they chose the river  and that changes course every spring .  suddenly the clacks towers are now on borogravian soil   or mud  anyway   so the idiots burn them down for religious reasons .         er  there is more to it than that  sir     said chinny .      yes  i know .  i read the history .  the annual scrap with zlobenia is just the local derby .  borogravia fights everybody .  why .         national pride  sir .         what in .  there   s nothing there .  there   s some tallow mines  and they   re not bad farmers  but there   s no great architecture  no big libraries  no famous composers  no very high mountains  no wonderful views .  all you can say about the place is that it isn   t anywhere else .  what   s so special about borogravia .         i suppose it   s special because it   s theirs .  and of course there   s nuggan  sir .  their god .  i   ve brought you a copy of the book of nuggan .         i looked through one back in the city  chinny     said vimes .     seemed pretty stu           that wouldn   t have been a recent edition  sir .  and i suspect it wouldn   t be  er  very current that far from here .  this one is more up to date     said chinny  putting a small but thick book on the desk .      up to date .  what do you mean  up to date .     said vimes  looking puzzled .     holy writ gets   written .  do this  don   t do that  no coveting your neighbor   s ox           um   nuggan doesn   t just leave it at that  sir .  he  er   updates things .  mostly the abominations  to be frank .      vimes took the new copy .  it was noticeably thicker than the one he   d brought with him .      it   s what they call a living testament     chinny explained .     they   well  i suppose you could say they    die    if they   re taken out of borogravia .  they no longer   get added to .  the latest abominations are at the end  sir     he said helpfully .      this is a holy book with an appendix .         exactly  sir .         in a ring binder .         quite so  sir .  people put blank pages in and the abominations   turn up .         you mean magically .         i suppose i mean religiously  sir .      vimes opened a page at random .      chocolate .     he said .     he doesn   t like chocolate .         yes  sir .  that   s an abomination .         garlic .  well  i don   t much like it either  so fair enough   cats .         oh  yes .  he really doesn   t like cats  sir .         dwarfs .  it says here     the dwarfish race which worships gold are an abomination unto nuggan    .  he must be mad .  what happened .         oh  the dwarfs that were here sealed their mines and vanished  your grace .         i bet they did .  they know trouble when they see it     said vimes .  he let    your grace    pass this time  chinny clearly derived some satisfaction from talking to a duke .   he leafed through the pages and stopped .      the color blue .         correct  sir .         what   s abominable about the color blue .  it   s just a color .  the sky is blue .         yes  sir .  devout nugganites try not to look at it these days .  um       chinny had been trained as a diplomat .  some things he didn   t like to say directly .      nuggan  sir   um   is rather   tetchy     he managed .      tetchy .     said vimes .     a tetchy god .  what  he complains about the noise their kids make .  objects to loud music after nine p . m .  .         um   we get the ankh morpork times here  sir  eventually  and  er  i   d say  er  that nuggan is very much like  er  the kind of people who write to its letter column .  you know  sir .  the kind who sign their letters    disgusted with ankh morpork              oh  you mean he really is mad     said vimes .      oh  i   d never mean anything like that  sir     said chinny hurriedly .      what do the priests do about this .         not a lot  sir .  i think they quietly ignore some of the more  er  extreme abominations .         you mean nuggan objects to the dwarfs  cats  and color blue and there   re more insane commandments .      chinny coughed politely .      all right  then     growled vimes .     more extreme commandments .         oysters  sir .  he doesn   t like them .  but that   s not a problem because no one there has ever seen an oyster .  oh  and babies .  he abominated them  too .         i take it people still make them here .         oh  yes  your gr   i   m sorry .  yes  sir .  but they feel guilty about it .  barking dogs  that was another one .  shirts with six buttons  too .  and cheese .  er   people just sort of  er  avoid the trickier ones .  even the priests seem to have given up trying to explain them .         yes  i think i can see why .  so what we have here is a country that tries to run itself on the commandments of a god who  the people feel  may be wearing his underpants on his head .  has he abominated underpants .         no  sir     chinny sighed .     but it   s probably only a matter of time .         so how do they manage .         these days  people mostly pray to the duchess annagovia .  you see icons of her in every house .  they call her the little mother .         ah  yes  the duchess .  can i get to see her .         oh  no one sees her  sir .  no one except her servants has seen her for more than thirty years .  to be honest  sir  she   s probably dead .         only probably .         no one really knows .  the official story is that she   s in mourning .  it   s rather sad  sir .  the young duke died a week after they got married .  gored by a wild pig during a hunt  i believe .  she went into mourning at the old castle at prince marmaduke piotre albert hans joseph bernhardt wilhelmsberg and hasn   t appeared in public since .  the official portrait was painted when she was about forty  i believe .         no children .         no  sir .  on her death  the line is extinct .         and they pray to her .  like a god .      chinny sighed .     i did put this in my briefing notes  sir .  the royal family in borogravia have always had a quasi religious status  you see .  they   re the head of the church  and the peasants  at least  pray to them in the hope that they   ll put in a good word with nuggan .  they   re like   living saints .  celestial intermediaries .  to be honest  that   s how these countries work in any case .  if you want something done  you have to know the right people .  and i suppose it   s easier to pray to some picture than to a god you can   t see .      vimes sat looking at the consul for some time .  when he next spoke  he frightened the man to his boots .      who   d inherit .     he said .      sir .         just following the monarchy  mr .  chinny .  if the duchess isn   t on the throne  who should be .         um  it   s incredibly complex  sir  because of the intermarriages and the various legal systems  which  for example           who   s the smart money on  mr .  chinny .     said vines wearily .      um  prince heinrich of zlobenia .      to chinny   s astonishment  vimes laughed .      and he   s wondering how auntie   s gettin    on  i expect .  i met him this morning  didn   t i .  can   t say i took to him .         but he is a friend of ankh morpork     said chinny reproachfully .     that was in my report .  educated .  very interested in the clacks .  got great plans for his country .  they used to be nugganatic in zlobenia  but he   s banned the religion and  frankly  hardly anyone objected .  he wants zlobenia to move forward .  he admires ankh morpork very much .         yes  i know .  he sounds almost as insane as nuggan     said vimes .     okay  so what we   ve probably got is an elaborate charade to keep heinrich out .  how   s this place governed .         there isn   t much .  a bit of tax collecting  and that   s about all .  we think some of the senior court officials just drift on as if the duchess is alive .  the only thing that really works is the army .         all right  how about coppers .  everyone needs coppers .  at least they have their feet on the ground .         i believe informal citizens    committees enforce nugganatic law     said chinny .      oh  gods .  prodnoses  curtain twitchers  and vigilantes     said vimes .  he stood up  and peered out through the narrow window at the plain below .  it was nighttime .  cooking fires in the enemy camp made demonic constellations in the darkness .      did they tell you why i   ve been sent here  clarence .     he said .      no  sir .  my instructions were that you would  um  oversee things .  prince heinrich is not very happy about it .         oh  well  the interests of ankh morpork are the interests of all money lov   oops  sorry  all freedom loving people everywhere     said vimes .     we can   t have a country that turns back our mail coaches and keeps cutting down the clacks towers .  that   s expensive .  they   re cutting the continent in half  they   re the pinch in the hourglass .  i   m to bring things to a    satisfactory    conclusion .  and frankly  clarence  i   m wondering if it   s even worth attacking borogravia .  it   ll be cheaper to sit here and wait for it to explode .  although i notice   where was that report   ah  yes   it will starve first .         regrettably so  sir .         igor stood mutely in front of the recruiting table .      don   t often see you people these days     said jackrum .      yeah  run out of fresh brains     ave yer .     said the corporal nastily .      now then  corporal  no call for that     said the sergeant  leaning back in his creaking chair .     there   s plenty of lads out there walking around on legs they wouldn   t still have if there hadn   t been a friendly igor around  eh  igor .         yeah .  well  i heard about people waking up and findin    their friendly igor had whipped out their brains in the middle of the night and buggered off to flog    em     said the corporal  glaring at igor .      i promith you  your brain ith entirely thafe from me  corporal     said igor .  polly started to laugh  and stopped when she realized absolutely no one else was doing so .      yeah  well  i met a sergeant who said an igor put a man   s legs on backwards     said corporal strappi .     what good   s that to a soldier  eh .         could advance and retreat at the thame time .     said igor levelly .     thargent  i know all the thtorieth  and they are nothing but vile calumnieth .  i theek only to therve my country .  i do not want trouble .         right     said the sergeant .     nor do we .  make your mark  and you   ve got to promise not to mess about with corporal strappi   s brain  right .  another signature .  my word  i can see we   ve got ourselves a bleedin    college of recruits today .  give him his cardboard shilling  corporal .         thank you     said igor .     and i would like to give the picture a wipe  if it   th all the thame to you .     he produced a small cloth .      wipe it .     said strappi .     is that allowed  sergeant .         what do you want to wipe it for  mister .     said jackrum .      to remove the invithible demonth     said igor .      i can   t see any invis       strappi began and stopped .      just let him  all right .     said jackrum .     it   s one of their funny little ways .         dun   t seem right     muttered strappi .     practically treason           can   t see why it   d be wrong just to give the old girl a wash     said the sergeant shortly .     next .  oh        after carefully wiping the stained picture and giving it a perfunctory peck  igor came and stood next to polly  giving her a sheepish grin .  but she was watching the next recruit .   he was short and quite slim  which was fairly usual in a country where it was rare to get enough food to make you fat .  but he dressed in black and expensively  like an aristocrat  he even had a sword .  the sergeant was  therefore  looking worried .  clearly a man could get into trouble talking wrong to a nob who might have important friends .      you sure you   ve come to the right place  sir .     he said .      yes  sergeant .  i wish to enlist .      sergeant jackrum shifted uneasily .     yes  sir  but i   m sure a gentleman like you           are you going to enlist me or not  sergeant .         not usual for a gentleman to enlist as a common soldier  sir     mumbled the sergeant .      what you mean  sergeant  is  is anyone after me .  is there a price on my head .  and the answer is no .         how about a mob with pitchforks .     said corporal strappi .     he   s a bloody vampire  sarge .  anyone can see that .  he   s a black ribboner .  look  he   s got the badge .         which says    not one drop        said the young man calmly .     not one drop of human blood  sergeant .  a prohibition i have accepted for almost two years  thanks to the league of temperance .  of course  if you have a personal objection  sergeant  you only need to give it to me in writing .      which was quite a clever thing to say  polly thought .  those clothes cost serious money .  most of the vampire families were highly nobby .  you never knew who was connected to who   not just to who  in fact  but to whom .     whoms    were likely to be far more trouble that your common  everyday    who .     the sergeant was looking down a mile of rough road .      got to move with the times  corporal     he said  deciding not to go there .     and we certainly need the men .         yeah  but s   posin    he wants to suck all my blood out in the middle of the night .     said strappi .      well  he   ll just have to wait until private igor   s finished looking for your brain  won   t he .     snapped the sergeant .     sign here  mister .      the pen scratched on the paper .  after a minute or two  the vampire turned the paper over and continued writing on the other side .  vampires had long names .      but you can call me maladict     he said  dropping the pen back in the inkwell .      thank you very much  i must say  si   private .  give him the shilling  corporal .  good job it   s not a silver one  eh .  haha .         yes     said maladict .     it is .         next .     said the sergeant .  polly watched as a farm boy  breeches held up with string  shuffled in front of the table and looked at the quill pen with the resentful perplexity of those confronted with new technology .   she turned back to the bar .  the landlord glared at her in the manner of bad landlords everywhere .  as her father always said  if you kept an inn you either liked people or went mad .  oddly enough  some of the mad ones were the best at looking after their beer .  but by the smell of the place  this wasn   t one of those .   she leaned on the bar .      pint  please     she said  and watched glumly as the man gave a scowl of acknowledgment and turned to the big barrels .  it   ll be sour  she knew  with the slop bucket under the tap tipped back in every night  and the spigot not put back  and   yes  it was going to be served in a leather tankard that had probably never been washed .   a couple of new recruits were already knocking back their pints  though  with every audible sign of enjoyment .  but this was pl  n  after all .  anything that made you forget you were there was probably worth drinking .   one of them said     lovely pint  this  eh .     and the boy next to him belched and said     best i   ve tasted  yeah .      polly sniffed at the tankard .  the contents smelled like something she wouldn   t feed to pigs .  she took a sip  and completely changed her opinion .  she would feed it to pigs .   those lads have never tasted beer before  she told herself .  it   s like dad said .  out in the country  there   re lads who   d join up for an uninhabited pair of breeches .  and they   ll drink this muck and pretend to enjoy it like men  heyup  we supped some stuff last night  eh  lads .  and then next thing     oh  lor      that reminded her .  what   d the privy be like here .  the men   s one out in the yard back at home was bad enough .  polly sloshed two big pails of water into it every morning while trying not to breathe .  there was weird green moss growing on the slate floor .  and the duchess was a good inn .  it had customers who took their boots off before going to bed .   she narrowed her eyes .  this stupid fool in front of her  a man making one long eyebrow do the work of two  was serving them slops and foul vinegar just before they marched off to war        thith beer     said igor  on her right     tastes of horthe pith .      polly stood back .  even in a bar like this  that was killing talk .      oh  you   d know  would you .     said the barman  looming over the boy .     drunk horse piss  have you .         yeth     said igor .   the barman stuck a fist in front of igor   s face .      now you listen to me  you lisping little        a slim black arm appeared with amazing speed and a pale hand caught the man   s wrist .  the one eyebrow contorted in sudden agony .      now  it   s like this     said maladict calmly .     we   re soldiers of the duchess  agreed .  just say    aargh .         he must have squeezed .  the man groaned .      thank you .  and you   re serving up as beer a liquid best described as foul water     maladict went on  in the same level  conversational tone .     i  of course  don   t drink   horse piss  but i have a highly developed sense of smell  and really would prefer not to list aloud the things i can smell in this murk  so we   ll just say    rat droppings    and leave it at that  shall we .  just whimper .  good man .     at the end of the bar  one of the new recruits threw up .  maladict nodded with satisfaction .  the barman   s fingers had gone white .      incapacitating a soldier of her grace in wartime is a treasonable offense     he said .  he leaned forward .     punishable  of course  by   death .     maladict pronounced the word with a certain delight .     however  if there happened to be another barrel of beer around the place  you know  good stuff  the stuff you   d keep for your friends if you had any friends  then i   m sure we could forget this little incident .  now  i   m going to let go of your wrist .  i can tell by your eyebrow that you are a thinker  and if you   re thinking of rushing back in here with a big stick  i   d like you to think about this instead  i   d like you to think about this black ribbon i   m wearing .  know what it means  do you .      the barman winced  and mumbled     tem   prance league           right .  well done .     said maladict .     and one more thought for you  if you   ve got room .  i   ve only taken a pledge not to drink human blood .  it doesn   t mean i can   t kick you in the fork so hard you suddenly go deaf .      he released his grip .  the barman slowly straightened up .  under the bar  he would have a short wooden club  polly knew .  every bar had one .  even her father had one .  it was a great help  he said  in times of worry and confusion .  she saw the fingers of the usable hand twitch .      don   t     she said .     i think he means it .      the barman relaxed .     bit of a misunderstanding there  gents     he mumbled .     got the wrong barrel in .  no offense meant .      he shuffled off  his hand almost visibly throbbing .      i only thaid it wath horthe pith     said igor .      he won   t cause trouble     said polly to maladict .     he   ll be your friend from now on .  he   s worked out he can   t beat you so he   s going to be your best mate .      maladict subjected her to a thoughtful stare .      i know that     he said .     how do you .         i used to work in an inn     said polly  feeling her heart begin to beat faster  as it always did when the lies lined up .     you learn to read people .         what did you do in the inn .         barman .         there   s another inn in this hole  is there .         oh no  i   m not from round here .      polly groaned at the sound of her own voice  and waited for the question    then why come here to join up .     it didn   t come .  instead  maladict just shrugged and said     i shouldn   t think anyone is from around here .      a couple more new recruits arrived at the bar .  they had the same look   sheepish  a bit defiant  in clothes that didn   t fit well .  eyebrow reappeared with a small keg  which he laid reverentially on a stand and gently tapped .  he pulled a genuine pewter tankard from under the bar  filled it  and timorously proffered it to maladict .      igor .     said the vampire  waving it away .      i   ll thtick with the horthe pith  if it   th all the thame to you     said igor .   he looked around the sudden silence .      look  i never thaid i didn   t like it     said igor .  he pushed his mug across the sticky bar .     thame again .      polly took the new tankard and sniffed at it .  then she took a sip .      not bad     she said .     at least it tastes like it   s        the door pushed open  letting in the sounds of the storm .   about two thirds of a troll eased its way inside  and then managed to get the rest of itself through .   polly was okay about trolls .  she met them up in the woods sometimes  sitting among the trees or purposefully lumbering along the tracks on the way to whatever it was trolls did .  they weren   t friendly  they were   resigned .  the world   s got humans in it  live with it .  they   re not worth the indigestion .  you can   t kill    em all .  step around    em .  stepping on    em doesn   t work in the long term .   occasionally a farmer would hire one to do some heavy work .  sometimes they turned up  sometimes they didn   t .  sometimes they   d turn up  lumber around a field pulling out tree stumps as if they were carrots  and then wander off without waiting to be paid .  a lot of things humans did mystified trolls  and vice versa .  generally  they avoided one another .   but she didn   t often see trolls as   trollish as this one .  it looked like a boulder that had spent centuries in the damp pine forests .  lichen covered it .  stringy gray moss hung in curtains from its head and its chin .  it had a bird   s nest in one ear .  it had a genuine troll club  made from an uprooted sapling .  it was almost a joke troll  except that no one would laugh .   the root end of the sapling bumped across the floor as the troll  watched by the recruits and a horrified corporal strappi  trudged to the table .      gonna en list     it said .     gonna do my bit .  gimme shillin    .         you   re a troll .     strappi burst out .      now  now  none of that  corporal     said sergeant jackrum .     don   t ask  don   t tell .         don   t ask .  don   t ask .  it   s a troll  sarge .  it   s got crags .  there   s grass growing under its fingernails .  it   s a troll .         right     said the sergeant .     enlist him .         you want to fight with us .     strappi squeaked .  trolls had no sense of personal space  and a ton of what was  for practical purposes  a kind of rock was looming right over the table .   the troll analyzed the question .  the recruits stood in silence  mugs halfway to mouths .      no     said the troll at last .     gonna fight wi    en army .  gods save the       the troll paused  and looked at the ceiling .  whatever it was seeking there didn   t appear to be visible .  then it looked at its feet  which had grass growing on them .  then it looked at its free hand and moved its fingers as if counting something .         duchess     it said .  it had been a long wait .  the table creaked as the troll laid a hand on it  palm upwards .     gimme shillin    .         we   ve only got the bits of pape       corporal strappi began .  sergeant jackrum jabbed an elbow into his ribs .      upon my oath  are you mad .     he hissed .     there   s a ten man bounty for enlisting a troll .     with his other hand he reached into his jacket pocket  pulled out a real silver shilling  and placed it delicately in the huge hand .     welcome to your new life  friend .  i   ll just write your name down  shall i .  what is it .      the troll looked at ceiling  feet  sergeant  wall  and table .  polly saw its lips move .      carborundum .     it volunteered .      yeah  probably     said the sergeant .     er  how   d you like to shav   to cut off some of that hai   moss .  we   ve got a  a sort of a   regulation        wall  floor  ceiling  table  fingers  sergeant .     no     said carborundum .      right .  right .  right     said the sergeant quickly .     it   s not a regulation as per such  actually  it   s more of an advisory .  silly one  too  eh .  i   ve always thought so .  glad to have you with us     he added fervently .   the troll licked the coin  which gleamed liked a diamond in its hand .  it actually did have grass growing under its fingernails  too  polly noticed .   then carborundum trudged to the bar .  the crowd parted instantly  because a troll never had to stand at the back of the press of bodies  waving money and trying to catch the barman   s eye .   he broke the coin in two and dropped both halves on the bar top .   eyebrow swallowed .  he looked as though he would have said    are you sure .     except that this was not a question barmen addressed to people weighing over half a ton .   carborundum thought for a while  and then said     gimme drink .      eyebrow nodded  disappeared briefly into the room behind the bar  and came back holding a double handed mug .  maladict sneezed .  polly   s eyes watered .  it was the kind of smell you sense with your teeth .  the pub might make foul beer as a matter of course  but this was eye stinging vinegar .   eyebrow dropped one half of the silver coin into it  and then took a copper penny out of the money drawer and held it over the fuming mug .  the troll nodded .  with just a hint of ceremony  like a cocktail waiter dropping the little umbrella into a double entendre  eyebrow let the copper fall .   more bubbles welled up .  igor watched with interest .   carborundum picked the mug up in two fingers of each shovel like hand  and swallowed the contents in one gulp .  he stood stock still for a moment  then carefully put the mug back on the bar .      you gentlemen might like to move back a bit     murmured eyebrow .      what   s going to happen .     said polly .      it takes    em all differently     said eyebrow .     looks like this one   s   no  there he goes        with considerable style  carborundum went over backwards .  there was no sagging at the knees  no girlie attempt to soften the fall .  he just went from standing up  one hand out  to lying down  one hand up .  he even rocked gently for some time after hitting the floor .      got no head for his drink     said eyebrow .     typical of the young bucks .  wants to play the big troll  come in here  order an electrick floorbanger  doesn   t know how to handle it .         is he going to come around .     said maladict .      no  that   s it until dawn  i reckon     said eyebrow .     brain stops working .         shouldn   t affect him too much  then     said corporal strappi  stepping up .     right  you miserable lot .  you   re sleeping in the shed out the back  understand .  practically waterproof  hardly any rats .  we   re out of here at dawn .  you   re in the army now .         polly lay in the dark  on a bed of musty straw .  there was no question of anyone getting undressed .  the rain hammered on the roof and the wind blew through a crack under the door  despite igor   s effort to stuff it with straw .  there was some desultory conversation  during which polly found that she was sharing the dank shed with    tonker    halter     shufti    manickle     wazzer    goom  and    lofty    tewt .  maladict and igor didn   t seem to have acquired repeatable nicknames .  she   d become ozzer by general agreement .   slightly to polly   s surprise  the boy now known as wazzer had taken a small picture of the duchess out of his pack and nervously hung it on an old nail .  no one else said anything as he prayed to it .  it was what you were supposed to do        they said the duchess was dead     polly had been washing up when she   d heard the men talking late one night  and it   s a poor woman who can   t eavesdrop while making a noise at the same time .   dead  they said  but the people up at prince marmaduke piotre albert hans joseph bernhardt wilhelmsberg weren   t admitting it .  that was    cos what with there being no children  and with royalty marrying one another   s cousins and grannies all the time  the ducal throne would go to prince heinrich of zlobenia .  there .  can you believe that .  that   s why we never see her  right .  and there hasn   t been a new picture all these years .  make you think  eh .  oh  they say she   s been in mourning    cos of the young duke  but that was more   n seventy years ago .  they say she was buried in secret and     at which point  her father had stopped the speaker dead .  there are some conversations where you don   t even want people to remember you were in the same room .   dead or alive  the duchess watched over you .      the recruits tried to sleep .   occasionally  someone belched or expelled wind noisily  and polly responded with a few fake eructations of her own .  that seemed to inspire greater effort on the part of the other sleepers  to the point where the roof rattled and dust fell down  before everyone subsided .   once or twice she heard people stagger out into the windy darkness  in theory  for the privy  but probably  given male impatience in these matters  to aim much closer to home .  once  coasting in and out of a troubled dream  she thought she heard someone sobbing .   taking care not to rustle too much  polly pulled out the much folded  much read  much stained last letter from her brother  and read it by the light of the solitary  guttering candle .  it had been opened and heavily mangled by the censors  and bore the stamp of the duchy .  it read       it was in a careful hand  the excessively clear and well shaped writing of someone who had to think about every letter .   she folded it up again .  paul had wanted medals  because they were shiny .  that   d been almost a year ago  when any recruiting party that came past went away with the best part of a battalion  and there had been people waving them off with flags and music .  sometimes  now  smaller parties of men came back .  the lucky ones were missing only one arm or one leg .  there were no flags .   she unfolded the other piece of paper .  it was a pamphlet .  it was headed    from the mothers of borogravia .  .     the mothers of borogravia were very definite about wanting to send their sons off to war against the zlobenian aggressor .  .  and used a great many exclamation points to say so .  and this was odd  because the mothers in the town had not seemed keen on the idea of their sons going off to war  and positively tried to drag them back .  several copies of the pamphlet seemed to have reached every home  even so .  it was very patriotic .  that is  it talked about killing foreigners .   she   d learned to read and write after a fashion because the inn was big and it was a business and things had to be tallied and recorded .  her mother had taught her to read  which was acceptable to nuggan  and her father made sure that she learned how to write  which was not .  a woman who could write was an abomination unto nuggan  according to father jupe  anything she wrote would by definition be a lie .   but polly had learned anyway  because paul hadn   t  at least to the standard needed to run an inn as busy as the duchess .  he could read if he could run his finger slowly along the lines  and he wrote letters painfully  with a lot of care and heavy breathing  like a man assembling a piece of jewelry .   he was big and kind and slow and could lift beer kegs as though they were toys  but he wasn   t a man at home with paperwork .  their father had hinted to polly  very gently but very often  that polly would need to be right behind him  when the time came for him to run the duchess .  left to himself  with no one to tell him what to do next  her brother just stood and watched birds .   at paul   s insistence  she   d read the whole of    from the mothers of borogravia .  .     to him  including the bits about heroes and there being no greater good than to die for your country .   she wished  now  she hadn   t done that .  paul did what he was told .  unfortunately  he believed what he was told  too .   she put the papers away and dozed again  until her bladder woke her up .  oh  well  at least at this time of the morning she   d have a clear run .   she reached out for her pack and stepped as softly as she could out into the rain .   it was mostly just coming off the trees now  which were roaring in the wind that blew up the valley .  the moon was hidden in the clouds  but there was just enough light to make out the inn   s buildings .  a certain grayness suggested that what passed for dawn in pl  n was on the way .   she located the men   s privy  which  indeed  stank of inaccuracy .   a lot of planning and practice had gone into this moment .  she was helped by the design of her breeches  which were the old fashioned kind with generous  buttoned trapdoors  and also by the experiments she   d made very early in the mornings when she was doing the cleaning .  in short  with care and attention to detail  she   d found that a woman could pee standing up .  it certainly worked back home in the inn   s privy  which had been designed and built with the certain expectation of the aimlessness of the customers .   the wind shook the dank building .   in the dark  she thought of aunty hattie  who   d gone a bit strange around her sixtieth birthday and persistently accused passing young men of looking up her dress .  she was even worse after a glass of wine  and she had one joke     what does a man stand up to do  a woman sit down to do  and a dog lift its leg to do .     and then  when everyone was too embarrassed to answer  she   d triumphantly shriek    shake hands .     and fall over .  aunty hattie was an abomination all by herself .   polly buttoned up the breeches with a sense of exhilaration .  she felt she   d crossed a bridge  a sensation that was helped by the realization that she   d kept her feet dry .   someone said     psst .      it was just as well she   d already taken a leak .  panic instantly squeezed every muscle .  where were they hiding .  this was just a rotten old shed .  oh  there were a few cubicles  but the smell alone suggested very strongly that the woods outside would be a much better proposition .  even on a wild night .  even with extra wolves .      yes .     she quavered  and then cleared her throat and demanded  with a little more gruffness     yes .         you   d need these     whispered the voice .  in the fetid gloom  she made out something rising over the top of the cubicle .  she reached up nervously and touched softness .  it was a bundle of wool .  her fingers explored it .      a pair of socks .     she said .      right .  wear    em     said the mystery voice hoarsely .      thank you  but i   ve brought several pairs       polly began .   there was a faint sigh .     no .  not on your feet .  shove    em down the front of your trousers .         what do you mean .         look     said the whisperer patiently     you don   t bulge where you shouldn   t bulge .  that   s good .  but you don   t bulge where you should bulge  either .  you know .  lower down .         oh .  er   i   but   i didn   t think people noticed       said polly  glowing with embarrassment .  she had been spotted .  but there was no hue and cry  no angry quotations from the book of nuggan .  someone was helping .  someone who had seen her        it   s a funny thing     said the voice     but they notice what   s missing more than they notice what   s there .  just one pair  mark you .  don   t get ambitious .      polly hesitated .      um   is it obvious .     she said .      no .  that   s why i gave you the socks .         i meant that   that i   m not   that i   m           not really     said the voice in the dark .     you   re pretty good .  you come over as a frightened young lad trying to look big and brave .  you might pick your nose a bit more often .  just a tip .  few things interest a young man more than the contents of his nostrils .  now i   ve got a favor to ask you in return .      i didn   t ask you for one  polly thought  quite annoyed at being taken for being a frightened young lad when she was sure she   d come over as quite a cool  non ruffled young lad .  but she said  calmly     what is it .         got any paper .      wordlessly  polly pulled    from the mothers of borogravia .  .     out of her shirt and handed it up .   she heard the sound of a match striking  and a sulfurous smell that only improved the general conditions .      why  is this the escutcheon of her grace the duchess i see in front of me .     said the whisperer .     well  it won   t be in front of me for long .  beat it   boy .      polly hurried out into the night  shocked  dazed  confused  and almost asphyxiated  and made it to the shed door .  but she   d barely shut it behind her and was blinking in the blackness when it was thrust open again  to let in the wind  rain  and corporal strappi .      all right  all right .  hands off   well  you lot wouldn   t be able to find    em   and on with socks .  hup hup hi ho hup hup        bodies were suddenly springing up or falling over all around polly .  their muscles must have been obeying the voice directly  because no brain could have got into gear that quickly .  corporal strappi  in obedience to the law of noncommissioned officers  responded by making the confusion more confusing .      good grief  a lot of old women could shift better   n you .     he shouted with satisfaction as people flailed around looking for their coats and boots .     fall in .  get shaved .  every man in the regiment to be clean shaven  by order .  get dressed .  wazzer  i   ve got my eye on you .  move .  move .  breakfast in five minutes .  last one there doesn   t get a sausage .  oh deary me  what a bloody shower .      the four lesser apocalyptical horsemen of panic  bewilderment  ignorance  and shouting took control of the room  to corporal strappi   s obscene glee .  polly  though  ducked out of the door  pulled a small tin mug out of her pack  dipped it into a water butt  balanced it on an old barrel behind the inn  and started to shave .   she   d practiced this  too .  the secret was in the old cutthroat razor that she   d carefully blunted .  after that  it was all in the shaving brush and soap .  get a lot of lather on  shave a lot of lather off  and you   d had a shave  hadn   t you .  must have done  sir  feel how smooth the skin is     she was halfway through when a voice by her ear screamed     what d   you think you   re doing  private parts .      it was just as well the blade was blunt .      perks  sir .     she said  rubbing her nose .     i   m shaving  sir .  it   s perks  sir .         sir .  sir .  i   m not a sir  parts  i   m a bloody corporal  parts .  that means you calls me    corporal     parts .  and you are shaving in an official regimental mug  parts  what you have not been issued with  right .  you a deserter  parts .         no  s   corporal .         a thief  then .         no  corporal .         then how come you got a bloody mug  parts .         got it off a dead man  sir   corporal .      strappi   s voice  pitched to a scream in any case  became a screech of rage .      you   re a looter .         no  corporal .  the soldier           had died almost in her arms  on the floor of the inn .   there had been half a dozen men in that party of returning heroes .  they must have been trekking with gray faced patience for days  making their way back to little villages in the mountains .  polly counted nine arms and ten legs between them  and ten eyes .   but it was the apparently whole who were worse  in a way .  they kept their stinking coats buttoned tight  in lieu of bandages over whatever unspeakable mess lay beneath  and they had the smell of death about them .  the inn   s regulars made space for them  and talked quietly  like people in a sacred place .   her father  not usually a man given to sentiment  quietly put a generous tot of brandy into each mug of ale  and refused all payment .   then it turned out that they were carrying letters from soldiers still fighting  and one of them had brought the letter from paul .  he pushed it across the table to polly as she served them stew  and then  with very little fuss  he died .   the rest of the men moved unsteadily on later that day  taking with them  to give to his parents  the pot metal medal that had been in the man   s coat pocket and the official commendation from the duchy that went with it .  polly had taken a look at it .  it was printed  including the duchess   s signature  and the man   s name had been filled in  rather cramped  because it was longer than average .  the last few letters were rammed up tight together .   it   s little details like that which get remembered  as undirected white hot rage fills the mind .  apart from the letter and the medal  all the man left behind was a tin mug and  on the floor  a stain which wouldn   t scrub out .      corporal strappi listened impatiently to a slightly adjusted version .  polly could see his mind working .  the mug had belonged to a soldier  now it belonged to another soldier .  those were the facts of the matter  and there wasn   t much he could do about it .  he resorted  instead  to the safer ground of general abuse .      so you think you   re smart  parts .     he said .      no  corporal .         oh .  so you   re stupid  are you .         well  i did enlist  corporal     said polly meekly .  somewhere behind strappi  someone sniggered .      i   ve got my eye on you  parts     growled strappi  temporarily defeated .     just you put a foot wrong  that   s all .      he strode off .      um       said a voice beside polly .  she turned to see another youth  wearing secondhand clothes and an air of nervousness that didn   t quite conceal some bubbling anger .  he was big and red haired  but his hair was cut so close that it was just head fuzz .      you   re tonker  right .     she said .      yeah  and  er   could i have a borrow of your shaving gear  right .      polly looked at a chin as free of hair as a billiard ball .  the boy blushed .      got to start sometime  right .     he said defiantly .      the razor   ll need sharpening     said polly .      that   s all right  i know how to do that     said tonker .   polly wordlessly handed over the mug and razor  and took the opportunity to duck into the privy while everyone else was occupied .  it was the work of a moment to put the socks in place .  anchoring them was a problem  which she solved by unwinding part of one sock and tucking it up under her belt .   they felt odd  and strangely heavy for a little package of wool .   walking a little awkwardly  polly went in to see what horrors breakfast would bring .   it brought stale horse bread and sausage and very weak beer .  she grabbed a sausage and a slab of bread and sat down .   you had to concentrate to eat horse bread .  there was a lot more about these days  a bread made from flour ground up with dried peas and beans and dried vegetable scrapings .  it used to be made just for horses  to put them in fine condition .  now you hardly ever saw anything else on the table  and there tended to be less and less of it  too .   you needed time and good teeth to work your way through a slice of horse bread  just like you needed a complete lack of imagination to eat a modern sausage .   polly sat and concentrated on chewing .   the only other area of calm was around private maladict  who was drinking coffee like a young man relaxing in a sidewalk caf    with an air of someone who has life thoroughly worked out .  he nodded at polly .   was that him in the privy .  she wondered .  i got back in just as strappi started yelling and everyone started running around and rushing in and out .  it could have been anyone .  do vampires use the privy .  well  do they .  has anyone ever dared ask .      sleep well .     he asked .      yeah .  did you .     said polly .      i couldn   t stand that shed  but mr .  eyebrow kindly allowed me to use his cellar     said maladict .     old habits die hard  you know .  at least     he added     old acceptable habits .  i   ve never felt happy not hanging down .         and you got coffee .         i carry my own supply     said maladict  indicating an exquisite little silver and gilt coffee making engine on the table by his cup     and mr .  eyebrow kindly boiled some water for me .     he grinned  showing two long canine teeth .     it   s amazing what you can achieve with a smile  oliver .      polly nodded .     er   is igor a friend of yours .     she said .  at the next table  igor had obtained a sausage  presumably raw  from the kitchen  and was watching it intently .  a couple of wires ran from the sausage to a mug of the horrible vinegary beer  which was bubbling .      never seen him before in my life     said the vampire .     of course  if you   ve met one you have  in a sense  met them all .  we had an igor at home .  wonderful workers .  very reliable .  very trustworthy .  and  of course  so good at stitching things together  if you know what i mean .         those stitches round his head don   t look very professional     said polly  who was beginning to object to maladict   s permanent expression of effortless superiority .      oh  that .  it   s an igor thing     said maladict .     it   s a look .  like   tribal scars  you know .  they like them to show .  ha  we had a servant once who had stitches all the way around his neck  and he was extremely proud of them .         really .     said polly weakly .      yes  and the droll part of it all was that it wasn   t even his head .      now igor had a syringe in his hand  and was watching the sausage with an air of satisfaction .  for a moment  polly thought that the sausage moved        all right  all right  time   s up  you horrible lot .     barked corporal strappi  strutting into the room .     fall in .  that means line up  you shower .  that means you too  parts .  and you  mr .  vampire  sir  will you be joining us for a morning   s light soldiering .  on your feet .  and where   s that bloody igor .         here  thur     said igor  from three inches behind strappi   s backbone .  the corporal spun around .      how did you get there .     he bellowed .      it   th a gift  thur     said igor .      don   t you ever get behind me again .  fall in with the rest of them .  now   attention .     strappi sighed theatrically .     that means    stand up straight .     got it .  once more with feeling .  attention .  ah  i see the problem .  you   ve got trousers that are permanently at ease .  i think i shall have to write to the duchess and tell her she should ask for her money back .  what are you smiling about  mr .  vampire sir .      strappi positioned himself in front of maladict  who stood faultlessly to attention .      happy to be in the regiment  corporal .         yeah  right     mumbled strappi .     well  you won   t be so           everything all right  corporal .     asked sergeant jackrum  appearing in the doorway .      best we could expect  sergeant     sighed the corporal .     we ought to throw    em back  oh dear me  yes .  useless  useless  useless           okay  lads .  stand easy     said jackrum  glancing at strappi in a less than friendly way .     today we   re heading on down toward plotz  where we   ll meet up with the other recruiting parties and you   ll be issued with your uniforms and weapons  you lucky lads .  any of you ever used a weapon .  you have  perks .      polly lowered her hand .      a bit  sarge .  my brother taught me a bit when he was home on leave  and some of the old men in the bar at home gave me some  er  tips       they had  too .  it was funny to watch a girl waving a sword around  and they   d been kind enough when they weren   t laughing .  she was a quick learner  but she   d made a point of staying clumsy long after she   d got the feel for the blade  because using a sword was also    the work of a man     and a woman doing it was an abomination unto nuggan .  old soldiers  on the whole  were on the easygoing side when it came to abominations .  she   d be funny just as long as she was useless  and safe as long as she was funny .      expert  are yer .     said strappi  grinning nastily .     a real fencin    genius  are yer .         no  corporal     said polly meekly .      all right     said jackrum .     anyone else           hang on  sarge  i reckon we   d all like a bit of instruction from swordmeister parts     said strappi .     ain   t that right  lads .     there was a general murmuring and shrugging from the squad  who recognized a right little bullying bastard when they saw one but  treacherously  were glad he hadn   t picked on them .   strappi drew his own sword .      lend him one of yours  sarge     he said .     go on .  just a little bit of fun  eh .      jackrum hesitated  and glanced at polly .      how about it  lad .  you don   t have to     he said .   i   ll have to sooner or later  polly thought .  the world was full of strappis .  if you backed away from them  they only kept on coming .  you had to stop them at the start .   she sighed .     okay  sarge .      jackrum pulled one of his cutlasses out of his sash and handed it to polly .  it looked amazingly sharp .      he won   t hurt you  perks     he said  while looking at the smirking strappi .      i   ll try not to hurt him either  sarge     said polly  and then cursed herself for the idiot bravado .  it must have been the socks talking .      oh  good     said strappi  stepping back .     we   ll just see what you   re made of  parts .      flesh  thought polly .  blood .  easily cut things .  oh  well     strappi waved his saber like the old boys had done  down low  in case she was one of those people who thought the whole idea was to hit the other man   s sword .  she ignored it  and watched his eyes  which was no great treat .   he wouldn   t stick her  not mortally  not with jackrum watching .  he   d try for something that   d hurt and make everyone laugh at her .  that was the strappi type through and through .  every inn counted one or two among its regulars .   the corporal tested her more aggressively a couple of times  and twice  by luck  she managed to knock the blade out of the way .  luck would run out  though  and if she looked like putting up a decent show  strappi would sort her out good and proper .   then she remembered the cackled advice of old gummy abbens  a retired sergeant who   d lost his left arm to a broadsword and all his teeth to cider     a good swordsman    ates comin    up against a newbie  gel .  the reason bein     he don   t know what the bugger   s gonna do .      she swung the saber wildly .  strappi had to block it  and for a moment the swords locked .      that the best you can do  parts .     the corporal jeered .   polly reached out and grabbed his shirt .      no  corporal     she said     but this is .      she pulled hard and lowered her head .   the collision hurt more than she   d hoped  but she heard something crunch and it didn   t belong to her .  she stepped back quickly  slightly dizzy  with the saber at the ready .   strappi had sunk to his knees  blood gushing from his nose .  when he got up  someone was going to die     panting  polly appealed wordlessly to sergeant jackrum  who had folded his arms and was looking innocently at the ceiling .      i bet you didn   t learn that from your brother  perks     he said .      no  sarge .  got that from gummy abbens  sarge .      jackrum suddenly looked down at her  grinning .     what  old sergeant abbens .         yes  sarge .         there   s a name from the past .  he   s still alive .  how is the evil old sot .         er   well preserved  sarge     polly said  still trying to get her breath .   jackrum laughed .     yeah  i   ll bet .  did his best fighting in bars  he did .  and i   ll bet that   s not the only trick he told you about  eh .         no  sir .     and the other men had scolded the old boy for telling her  and gummy had chuckled into his cider mug  and anyway it had taken polly a long time to find out what    family jewels    meant .      hear that  strappi .     said the sergeant to the cursing man dribbling blood onto the floor .     looks like you was lucky .  but there   s no prizes for fighting fair in a melee  lads  as you shall learn .  all right  fun over .  go and put some cold water on that  corporal  it always looks worse than it is .  and that   s the end of it  the pair of you .  that is an order .  a word to the wise .  understood .         yes  sarge     said polly meekly .  strappi grunted .   jackrum looked at the rest of the recruits .     okay .  any of the rest of you boys ever held a stick .  right .  i can see we   re going to have to start slow and work up        there was another grunt from strappi .  you had to admire the man .  on his knees  with blood bubbling through the hand cupping his injured nose  he could find time to make life difficult for someone in some small way .      private bloodfnucker hnas a fnord  fnargeant     he said accusingly .      any good with it .     said the sergeant to maladict .      not really  sir     said maladict .     never had training .  i carry it for protection  sir .         how can you protect yourself by carrying a sword if you don   t know how to use it .         not me  sir .  other people .  they see the sword and don   t attack me     said maladict patiently .      yes  but if they did  lad  you wouldn   t be any good with it     said the sergeant .      no  sir .  i   d probably settle for just ripping their head off  sir .  that   s what i mean by protection  sir .  theirs  not mine .  and i   d get hell from the league if i did that  sir .      the sergeant stared at him for a while .      well thought out     he mumbled .   there was a thud behind them and a table overturned .   carborundum the troll sat upright  groaned  and crashed back down again .  at the second attempt  he managed to stay upright  both hands clutching his head .   corporal strappi  now on his feet  must have been made fearless by fury .  he headed for the troll in a high speed strut and stood in front of him  vibrating with rage and still oozing blood in sticky strings .      you    orrible little man .     he screamed .     you        carborundum reached down and  with care and no apparent effort  picked the corporal up by his head .  he brought him to one crusted eye and turned him this way and that .      did i join th    army .     he rumbled .     oh  coprolith           this is affnualt on a fnuperior officer .     screamed the corporal in a muffled voice .      put corporal strappi down  please     said sergeant jackrum .  the troll grunted and lowered the man to the floor .      sorry about dat     he said .     thought you was a dwarf .         i dnemand this man is affrested for       strappi began .      no you don   t  corporal  no you don   t     said the sergeant .     this is not the time .  on your feet  carborundum  and get in line .  upon my oath  you try that little trick one more time and there will be trouble  understand .         yes  sergeant     growled the troll and knuckled himself to his feet .      right  then     said the sergeant  stepping back .     now today  my lucky lads  we   re goin    to learn about something we call marching        they left pl  n to the wind and rain .  about an hour after they   d vanished around a bend in the valley  the shed they   d slept in mysteriously burned down .      there have been better attempts at marching  and they have been made by penguins .  sergeant jackrum brought up the rear in the cart  shouting instructions  but the recruits moved as if they   d never before had to get from place to place .  the sergeant yelled the swagger out of their steps  stopped the cart  held an impromptu lesson in the concepts of    right    and    left    for a few of them  and  by degrees  they left the mountains .   polly remembered those first few days with mixed feelings .  all they did was march  but she was used to long walks and her boots were good .  the trousers ceased to chafe .  a watery sun took the trouble to shine .  it wasn   t cold .  it would have been fine  if it hadn   t been for the corporal .   she wondered how strappi  whose nose was now about the same color as a plum  was going to handle the situation between them .  it turned out that he intended to deal with it by pretending it hadn   t happened  and also by having as little as possible to do with polly .   he didn   t spare the others  although he was selective .  maladict was left strictly alone  as was carborundum  whatever else strappi was  he wasn   t suicidal .  and he was bewildered by igor .  the little man did whatever stupid chore strappi found for him  and he did them quickly  competently  and with every impression of someone happy in his work  and that left the corporal completely mystified .   he   d pick on the others for no reason at all  harangue them until they made some trivial mistake  and then bawl them out .  his target of choice was private goom  better known as wazzer  who was stick thin and round eyed and nervous and said grace loudly before meals .  by the end of the first day  strappi could make him throw up just by shouting .  and then he   d laugh .   only he never really laughed  polly noted .  what you got instead was a sort of harsh gargling of spit at the back of the throat  a noise like ghnssssh .   the presence of the man cast a damper on everything .  jackrum seldom interfered .  he often watched strappi  though  and once  when polly caught his eye  he winked .   on the first night  a tent was shouted by strappi off the cart and shouted up and  after a supper of stale bread and sausage had been shouted  they were shouted in front of a blackboard  to be shouted at .   across the top of the board  strappi had written      what we are fighting for     and down the side had written         .     .     .        right  pay attention .     he said  slapping the board with a stick .     there   s some who think that you boys ought to know why we are fighting this war  okay .  well  here it comes .  point one  remember the town of lipz .  it was viciously attacked by zlobenian troops a year ago .  they           sorry  but i thought we attacked lipz  didn   t we  corporal .  last year  they said       shufti began .      are you trying to be smart  private manickle .     strappi demanded  naming the biggest sin in his personal list .      just want to know  corporal     said shufti .  he was stocky  running to plump  and one of those people who bustled about being helpful in a mildly annoying way  taking over small jobs that you wouldn   t have minded doing for yourself .  there was something odd about him  although you had to bear in mind he was currently sitting next to wazzer  who had enough odd for everybody and was probably contagious        and had caught strappi   s eye .  there was no fun in having a go at shufti  but wazzer  now  wazzer was always worth a shout .      are you listening  private goom .     he screamed .   wazzer  who had been sitting and looking up with his eyes closed  jerked awake .      corporal .     he quavered  as strappi advanced .      i said  are you listening  goom .         yes  corporal .     moaned wazzer  shaking with fear .      really .  and what did you hear  may i ask .     said strappi in a voice of treacle and acid .      nothing  corporal .  she   s not speaking .      strappi took a deep  delighted breath of evil air .      you are a useless  worthless pile of        there was a sound .  it was a small  nondescript sound  one that you heard every day  a noise that did its job but never expected to be  for example  whistled or part of an interesting sonata .  it was simply the sound of stone scraping on metal .   on the other side of the fire  jackrum lowered his cutlass .  he had a sharpening stone in his other hand .  he returned their group stare .      what .  oh .  just maintaining the edge     he said innocently .     sorry if i interrupted your flow there  corporal .  carry on .      a basic animal survival instinct came to the corporal   s aid .  he left the trembling wazzer alone  and turned back to shufti .      yes  yes  we attacked lipz  too       said strappi .      was that before the zlobenians did .     said maladict .      will you listen .     strappi demanded .     we valiantly attacked lipz to reclaim what is borogravian territory .  and then the treacherous swede eaters stole it back        polly tuned out a little at this point  now that there was no immediate prospect of seeing strappi decapitated .  she knew about lipz .  half the old men who came and drank with her father had attacked the place .  but no one had expected them to want to do it .  someone had just shouted    attack .     .   the trouble was the kneck river .  it wandered across the wide  rich  silty plain like a piece of dropped string  but sometimes a flash flood or even a big fallen tree would cause it to crack like a whip  throwing coils of river around areas of land miles from its previous bed .  and the river was the international border     she surfaced to hear        but this time  everyone   s on their side  the bastards .  and you know why .  it   s    cos of ankh morpork .  because we stopped the mail coaches going over our country and tore down their clacks towers  which are an abomination unto nuggan .  ankh morpork is a godless city           i thought it had more than three hundred places of worship .     said maladict .   strappi stared at him in a rage that was incoherent until he managed to touch bottom again .      ankh morpork is a godawful city     he said .     poisonous  just like its river .  barely fit for humans now  they let everything in   zombies  werewolves  dwarfs  vampires  trolls        he remembered his audience  faltered and recovered        which in some cases can be a good thing  of course .  but it is a foul  lewd  lawless  overcrowded mess of a place  which is why prince heinrich loves it so much .  he   s been taken over by it  bought by cheap toys  because that   s the way ankh morpork plays it  men .  they buy you  they will you stop interrupting .  what   s the good of me trying to teach you stuff if you   re going to keep on asking questions .         i was just wondering why it   s so crowded  corp     said tonker .     if it   s so bad  i mean .         that   s because they are a degraded people  private .  and they   ve sent a regiment up here to help heinrich take over our beloved motherland .  he has turned aside from the ways of nuggan and embraced ankh morpork   s godlessn   godawfulness .     strappi looked pleased at having spotted that one  and went on     point two  in addition to its soldiers  ankh morpork has sent vimes the butcher  the most evil man in that evil city .  they are bent on nothing less than our destruction .         i heard that ankh morpork was just angry that we cut the clacks towers down     said polly .      they were on our sovereign territory .         well  it was zlobenian until       polly began .   strappi waved an angry finger at her .      you listen to me  parts .  you can   t get to be a great country like borogravia without making enemies .  which leads me on to point three  parts  who   s sitting there thinking he   s so smart .  you all are .  i can see it .  well  be smart about this  you might not like everything about your country  eh .  it might not be the perfect place  but it   s ours .  you might think we don   t have the best laws  but they   re ours .  the mountains might not be the prettiest ones or the tallest ones  but they   re ours .  we   re fighting for what   s ours  men .      strappi slammed his hand over his heart .       awake  ye sons of the motherland .   taste no more the wine of the sour apples       they joined in  with various levels of drone .  you had to .  even if you just opened and shut your mouth  you had to .  even if you just went    ner  ner  ner     you had to .  polly  who was exactly the kind of person who looks around surreptitiously at times like these  saw that shufti was singing it word perfectly and strappi actually did have tears in his eyes .  wazzer wasn   t singing at all .  he was praying .  that was a good wheeze  said one of the more treacherous areas at the back of polly   s mind .   to the bewilderment of all  strappi continued   alone   all through the second verse  which nobody ever remembered  and then gave them a smug  i   m more patriotic than you smile .   afterwards  they tried to sleep on as much softness as two blankets could provide .   they lay there in silence for some time .  jackrum and strappi had tents of their own  but instinctively they knew that strappi at least would be a sneaker and a listener at tent flaps .   after about an hour  when rain was drumming on the canvas  carborundum said     okay  den  i fink i   ve worked it out .  if people are groophar stupid  then we   ll fight for groophar stupidity     cos it   s our stupidity .  and dat   s good  yeah .      several of the squad sat up in the darkness  amazed at this .      i realize i ought to know these things  but what does groophar mean .     said the voice of maladict in the damp darkness .      ah  well   when  right  a daddy troll an    a mummy troll           good  right  yes  i think i   ve got it  thank you     said maladict .     and what you   ve got there  my friend  is patriotism .  my country  right or wrong .         you should love your country     said shufti .      okay  what part .     the voice of tonker demanded  from the far corner of the tent .     the morning sunlight on the mountains .  the horrible food .  the damn mad abominations .  all of my country except whatever bit strappi is standing on .         but we are at war .         yes  that   s where they   ve got you     sighed polly .      well  i   m not buying into it .  it   s all trickery .  they keep you down and when they piss off some other country  you have to fight for them .  it   s only your country when they want you to get killed .     said tonker .      all the good bits in this country are in this tent     said the voice of wazzer .   embarrassed silence descended .   the rain settled in .  after a while  the tent began to leak .   eventually someone said     what happens  um  if you join up but then you decide you don   t want to .      that was shufti .      i think it   s called deserting and they cut your head off     said the voice of maladict .     in my case  that would be a drawback but you  dear shufti  would find it simply puts a big crimp in your social life .         i never kissed their damn picture     said tonker .     i swiveled it round when strappi wasn   t looking and kissed it on the back .         they   ll still say you kissed the duchess  though     said maladict .      you k kissed the d duchess on the b bottom .     said wazzer  horrified .      it was the back of the picture  okay .     said tonker .     it wasn   t her real backside .  huh  wouldn   t have kissed it if it was .     there was some unidentified sniggering from various corners and just a hint of giggle .      that was w wicked .     hissed wazzer .     nuggan in heaven saw you d do that .         it was just a picture  all right .     muttered tonker .     anyway  what   s the difference .  front or back  we   re all here together and i don   t see any steak and bacon .      something rumbled overhead .     i joined t    see exciting forrin places and meet erotic people     said carborundum .   that caused a moment   s thought .     i think you mean exotic .     said igor .      yeah  that kind of stuff     agreed the troll .      but they always lie     said someone  and then polly realized it was her .     they lie all the time .  about everything .         amen to that     said tonker .     we fight for liars .         ah  they may be liars .     snapped polly  in a passable imitation of strappi   s yap .     but they   re our liars .         now  now  children     said maladict .     let   s try to get some sleep  shall we .  but here   s a happy little dream from your uncle maladict .  dream that when we go into battle  corporal strappi is leading us .  wouldn   t that be fun .      after a while  tonker said     in front of us  you mean .         oh  yes .  i can see you   re with me  tonk .  right in front of you .  on the noisy  frantic  confusing battlefield  where oh so much can go wrong .         and we   ll have weapons .     said shufti wistfully .      of course you   ll have weapons .  you   re soldiers .  and there   s the enemy  right in front of you           that   s a good dream  mal .         sleep on it  kid .      polly turned over  and tried to make herself comfortable .   it   s all lies  she though muzzily .  some of them are just prettier than others  that   s all .  people see what they think is there .  even i   m a lie .  but i   m getting away with it .      a warm autumnal wind was blowing leaves off the rowan trees as the recruits marched among the foothills .  it was the morning of the next day  and the mountains were behind them .   polly passed the time identifying the birds in the hedgerows .  it was a habit .  she knew most of them .   she hadn   t set out to be an ornithologist .  but birds brought paul alive .  all the   slowness in the rest of his thinking became a flash of lightning in the presence of birds .  suddenly he knew their names  habits  and habitats  could whistle their songs  and  after polly had saved up for a box of paints off a traveler at the inn  had painted a picture of a wren so real you could hear it .   their mother had been alive then .  the row had gone on for days .  pictures of living creatures were an abomination in the eyes of nuggan .  polly had asked why there were pictures of the duchess everywhere  and had been thrashed for it .  the picture had been burned  the paints thrown away .   it was a terrible thing .  her mother had been a kind woman  or as kind as a devout woman could be while trying to keep up with the whims of nuggan  and she   d died slowly and painfully  amid pictures of the duchess and among the echoes of unanswered prayers  but that was the memory that crawled treacherously into polly   s mind every time  the fury and the scolding  while the little bird seemed to flutter in the flames .   in the fields  women and old men were getting in the spoiled wheat after last night   s rain  hoping to save what they could .  there weren   t any young men visible .  polly saw some of the other recruits steal a glance at the scavenging parties  and wondered if they were thinking the same thing .   they saw no one else on the road until midday  when the party was marching through a landscape of low hills  the sun had boiled away some of the clouds and  for a moment at least  summer was back   moist and sticky and mildly unpleasant  like a party guest who won   t go home .   a red blob in the distance became a rather larger blob and resolved itself into a loose knot of men .  polly knew what to expect as soon as she saw it .  by the reaction of some of the others  they did not .  there was a moment of collision and confusion as people walked into one another  and then the party stopped and stared .   it took the wounded men some time to draw level  and some time to pass .  two able bodied men  as far as polly could tell  were trundling a handcart on which a third man lay .  others were limping on crutches  or had arms in slings  or wore red jackets with an empty sleeve .  perhaps worse were the ones like the man in the inn  gray faced  staring straight ahead  jackets buttoned tight despite the heat .   one or two of the injured glanced at the recruits as they lurched past  but there was no expression in their eyes beyond a terrible determination .   jackrum reined in the horse .      all right  twenty minutes breather     he muttered .   igor turned  nodded to the party of wounded heading grimly onward  and said     permithion to thee if i can do anything for them  tharge .         you   ll get your chance soon enough  lad     said the sergeant .      tharge .     said igor  looking hurt .      oh  all right .  if you must .  d   you want someone to give you a hand .      there was a nasty laugh from corporal strappi .      some athithtance would be a help  yeth  thargeant     said igor with dignity .   the sergeant looked at the squad  and nodded .      private halter  step forward .  know anything about doctorin    .      the red headed tonker stepped forward smartly .      i   ve butchered pigs for me mam  sarge     he said .      capital .  better than an army surgeon  upon my oath .  off you go .  twenty minutes  remember .         and don   t let igor bring back any souvenirs .     said strappi  and laughed his scraping laugh again .   the rest of the boys sat down on the grass by the road  and one or two of them disappeared into the bushes .  polly went on the same errand  but pushed in a lot further  and took the opportunity to make a little sock adjustment .  they had a tendency to creep if she wasn   t careful .   she froze at a rustling behind her  and then relaxed .  she   d been careful .  no one would have seen anything .  so what if someone else was taking a leak .  she   d just push her way back to the road and take no notice     lofty sprang up as polly parted the bushes  breeches around one ankle  face red as a beetroot .   polly couldn   t help herself .  maybe it was the socks .  maybe it was the pleading expression on lofty   s face .  when someone   s broadcasting    don   t look .      the eyes have a mind of their own and go where they   re not wanted .   lofty jumped up  dragging at her clothes .      no  look  it   s all right       polly began  but it was too late .  the girl had gone .   polly stared at the bushes and thought  blast .  there   s two of us .  but what would i have said next .  it   s okay  i   m a girl too .  you can trust me .  we could be friends .  oh  and here   s a good tip about socks .      igor and tonker arrived back late  without saying anything .  nor did sergeant jackrum .   the squad moved off .   polly marched at the back  with carborundum .  this meant she could keep a wary eye on lofty  whoever she was .   for the first time  polly really looked at her .  she was easy to miss  because she was always  as it were  in tonker   s shadow .  she was short  although now polly knew she was female  the word    petite    could be decently used  and was dark and dark haired and had a strange  self absorbed look  and she was always marching with tonker .   come to think of it  she always slept close to him  too .   ah  so that was it .  she   s following her boy  polly thought .  it was kind of romantic  and very  very dumb .  now she knew to look beyond the clothes and haircut  she could see all the little clues that lofty was a girl  and a girl who hadn   t planned enough .   she saw lofty whisper something to tonker  who half turned and gave polly a look of instant hatred and a hint of threat .   i can   t tell her  she thought .  she would tell him .  i can   t afford to let them know .  i   ve put too much into this .  i didn   t just cut my hair and wear trousers .  i planned     ah  yes   the plans .   it had begun as a sudden strange fancy  but it had continued as a plan .   at first  polly had started to watch boys closely .  this had been reciprocated hopefully by a few of them  to their subsequent disappointment .  she watched how they moved  she listened to the rhythm of what passed  among boys  for conversation  she   d noted how they punched one another in greeting .  it was a new world .   she had good muscles for a girl  because running a large inn was all about moving heavy things  and she took over a number of the grittier chores  which coarsened her hands nicely .  she   d even worn a pair of her brother   s old breeches under her long skirt  to get the feel of them .   a woman could be beaten for that sort of thing .  men dressed like men and women like women  doing it the other way around was    a blasphemous abomination unto nuggan     according to father jupe .   and that was probably the secret of her success so far  she thought as she trudged through a puddle .  people didn   t look for a woman in trousers .  to the casual observer  men   s clothes and short hair and a bit of swagger were what it took to be a man .   oh  and a second pair of socks .   that had been gnawing at her  too .  someone knew about her  just like she knew about lofty .  and he hadn   t given her away .  she   d feared it was eyebrow  but doubted it  he   d have told the sergeant about her  he was that sort .  right now she was guessing it was maladict  but perhaps that was just because he seemed so knowing all the time .   carbor   no  he   d been out cold  and in any case   no  not the troll .  and igor lisped .  tonker .  after all  he   d know about lofty so maybe   no  because why would he want to help polly .  no  there was nothing but danger in owning up to lofty .  the best she could do was try and see to it that the girl didn   t give both of them away .   she could hear tonker whispering to his girl .         had just died so he cut off one of his legs and an arm and sewed    em on men who needed    em  just like i   d darn a tear .  you should   ve seen it .  you couldn   t see his fingers move .  and he has all these ointments that just        tonker   s voice died away .  strappi was haranguing wazzer again .      dat strappi really gets on my crags     muttered carborundum .     you want i should pull the head off   f him .  i c   d make it look like a accident .         better not     said polly  but she did entertain the thought for a moment .   they   d reached a road junction  where the road down from the mountains joined what passed for a main highway .  it was crowded .  there were carts and wheelbarrows  people driving herds of cows  grandmothers carrying all the household possessions on their backs  a general excitement of pigs and children   and it was all heading one way .   it was the opposite way to the way the squad was going .  the people and animals flowed around it like a stream around an inconvenient rock .   the recruits bunched up .  it was that or be separated by cows .   sergeant jackrum stood up in the cart .      private carborundum .         yes  sergeant .     rumbled the troll .      to the front .      that helped .  the stream still flowed  but at least the crowds parted some distance further along the road and gave the squad a wide berth .  no one wants to barge up against even a slow moving troll .   but faces stared as the people hurried by .  an old lady darted out for a moment  pressed a loaf of stale bread into tonker   s hands  and said    you poor boys .     before being swept away in the throng .      what   s this all about  sarge .     said maladict .     these look like refugees .         talk like that spreads alarm and despondency .     shouted corporal strappi .      oh  you mean they   re just people getting away early for the holidays to avoid the rush .     said maladict .     sorry  i got confused .  it must be that woman carrying a whole haystack we just passed .         d   you know what can happen to you for cheeking a superior officer .     screamed strappi .      no .  tell me  is it worse than whatever it is these people are running away from .         you signed up  mr .  bloodsucker .  you obey orders .         right .  but i don   t remember anyone ordering me not to think .         enough of that .     snapped jackrum .     less shouting down there .  move on .  carborundum  you give people a push if they don   t make way  y   hear .      they moved on .  after a while  the press of people abated a little  so that what had been a torrent became a trickle .  occasionally  there would be a family group  or just one hurrying woman  burdened with bags .  one old man was struggling with a wheelbarrow full of turnips .   they   re even taking the crops out of the fields  polly noted .  and everyone moved at a kind of half run  as if things would be a little better when they   d caught up with the mass of people ahead .  or merely overtook them  perhaps .   the squad was passed by an old woman bent double under the weight of a black and white pig .   and then there was just the road  rutted and muddy .  an afternoon mist was rising from the fields on either side  quiet and clammy .  after the noise of the refugees  the silence of the low countryside was suddenly oppressive .  the only sound was the trudge and splash of the recruits    boots .      permission to speak  sarge .     said polly .      yes  private .     said jackrum .      how far is it to plotz .         you don   t have to tell    em  sarge .     said strappi .      about five miles     said sergeant jackrum .     you   ll get your uniforms and weapons at the depot there .         that   s a milit   ry secret  sarge     strappi whined .      we could shut our eyes so   s we don   t see what we   re wearing  how about that .     said maladict .      stop that  private maladict     said jackrum .     just keep moving  and guard that tongue .      they plodded on .  the road grew muddier .  a breeze sprang up  but instead of carrying the mist away it merely streamed it across the damn fields in twisty  clammy  unpleasant shapes .  the sun became an orange ball .   polly saw something large and white flutter across the field  blown by the wind .  at first she thought it was a migratory lesser egret that had left things a little late  but it was clearly being blown by the wind .   it flopped down once or twice and then  as a gust caught it  blew across the road and wrapped itself across corporal strappi   s face .   he screamed .   lofty grabbed at the fluttering thing  which was damp .  in tore in his   her   hands  and most of it dropped away from the struggling corporal .      it   s just a bit of paper     she said .   strappi flailed at it .     i knew that     he said .     i never asked you .      polly picked up one of the torn scraps .  the paper was thin and muddy  although she recognized the words    ankh morpork .     the godawful city .  and the genius of strappi was that anything he was against automatically sounded attractive .      ankh morpork times       she read aloud  before the corporal snatched it out of her hand .      you can   t just read anything you see  parts .     he shouted .     you don   t know who wrote it .      he dropped the damp scrap onto the mud and stamped on it .      now let   s move on .     he said .   they moved on .  when the squad was more or less in rhythm  and staring at nothing more than its boots or the mist ahead of it  polly raised her right hand to chest height and carefully turned it palm up so that she could see the fragment of paper that had soggily stayed behind when the rest had been pulled away .         no surrender     to alliance says  duchess          from william de worde  valley of the kneck  sektober   .       borogravian troops assisted by lord v  light infantry took kneck keep this mo  after fierce hand to hand fig  i write its armaments which  are being turned on the remn  borogravian forces acr      his grace commander sir s  told the times that  surrender had been rej  view the enemy commande  load of stiff neck fools  don     in the paper .          it is understoo  desperate situ   spread fami  across t  no altern  invas    they were winning  weren   t they .  so where did the word    surrender    come from .  and what was the alliance .   and then there was the problem of strappi  which had been growing on her .  she could see he got on jackrum   s nerves as well  and he had a struttiness about him  a certain   er   sockiness  as if he was really the one in charge .  perhaps it was just general unpleasantness  but        corporal .     she said .      yes  parts .     said strappi .  his nose was still very red .      we are winning this war  aren   t we .     said polly .  she   d given up correcting him .   suddenly  every ear in the squad was listening .      don   t you bother yourself about that  parts .     snapped the corporal .     your job is to fight .         right  corp .  so   i   ll be fighting on the winning side  will i .         oho  we   ve got someone who asks too many questions here  sarge .     said strappi .      yeah  don   t ask questions  perks     said jackrum  absentmindedly .      so we   re losing  then .     said tonker .  strappi turned on him .      that   s spreading alarm and despondency again  that is .     he shrieked .     that   s aiding the enemy .         year  knock it off  private halter     said jackrum .     okay .  now  get a           halter  i   m placing you under arrest for       strappi began .      corporal strappi  a word in your shell like ear  please .  you men  you stop here .     growled the sergeant  clambering down from the cart .   jackrum walked back down the road about fifty feet .  glaring around at the squad  the corporal strutted after him .      are we in trouble .     said tonker .      you guess     said maladict .      bound to be     said shufti .     strappi can always get you for something .         they   re having an argument     said maladict .     which is odd  don   t you think .  a sergeant is supposed to give orders to a corporal .         we are winning  aren   t we .     said shufti .     i mean  i know there   s a war  but   i mean  we get weapons  don   t we  and we   ll   well they   ve got to train us  right .  it   ll probably be all over by then  right .  everyone says we   re winning .         i will ask the duchess in my prayers tonight     said wazzer .   the rest of the squad looked at one another with a shared expression .      yeah  right  wazz     said tonker kindly .     you do that .      the sun was setting fast  half hidden in the mist .  here  on the muddy road between damp fields  it suddenly felt as cold as it could be .      no one says we   re winning  except maybe strappi     said polly .     they just say that everyone says we   re winning .         the men igor   repaired didn   t even say that     said tonker .     they said    you poor bastards  you   ll leg it if you   ve any sense .            thank you for sharing     said maladict .      it looks at though everyone   s feeling sorry for us     said polly .      yeah  well  so am i  and i am uth     said igor .     thome of thothe men           all right  all right  stop lollygagging  you lot .     shouted strappi  marching up .      corporal .     said the sergeant quietly  hauling himself back onto the cart .  strappi paused  and then in a voice dripping with syrup and sarcasm went on     excuse me .  the sergeant and myself would be obleejed if you brave heroes to be would join us in a little light marching .  jolly good .  and there will be embroidery later on .  best foot forward  ladies .      she heard tonker gasp .  strappi turned  eyes glinting with sinister anticipation .      oh  someone doesn   t like being called a lady  eh .     he said .     dear me  private halter  you   ve got a lot to learn  haven   t you .  you   re a sissy little lady until we make a man of you  right .  and i dread to think how long that   s going to take .  move .      i know  thought polly as they set off .  it takes about ten seconds and a pair of socks .  one sock  and you could make strappi .      plotz turned out to be like pl  n  but it was worse because it was bigger .  the rain started again as they marched into the cobbled square .  it looked as though it always rained here .  the buildings were gray and mud spattered near the ground .  roof gutters overflowed  pouring rain onto the cobbles and sending a spray over the recruits .  there was no one about .  polly saw open doors banging in the wind  and bits of debris in the streets  and remembered the lines of hurrying people on the road .   there was no one here .   sergeant jackrum climbed down from the cart as strappi bawled them into line .  then the sergeant took over  leaving the corporal to glower from the sidelines .      this is wonderful plotz .     he said .     have a look round  so that if you is killed and goes to hell  it won   t come as a shock .  you   ll be bivvying in that barracks over there  what is milit   ry property .     he waved a hand toward a crumbling stone building that looked about as military as a barn .     you will be issued with your equipment .  and tomorrow it   s a nice long march to crotz  where you will arrive as boys and leave as men did i just say something funny  perks .  no  i thought so  too .  attention .  that means stand up straight .         that   s straight .     yelled strappi .   a young man was riding across the square on a tired  skinny brown horse  which was quite suitable  because he was a tired  skinny man .  the skinniness was helped by the fact that he wore a tunic that had clearly been made for someone a couple of sizes larger .  the same applied to his helmet .  he must have padded it  polly thought .  one cough and it   ll be over his eyes .   sergeant jackrum snapped off a salute as the officer approached .      jackrum  sir .  you   ll be lieutenant blouse  sir .         well done  sergeant .         these are the recruits from upriver  sir .  fine body of men  sir .      the rider peered at the squad .  he actually leaned forward over the horse   s neck  causing rain to pour off his helmet .      this is all  sergeant .         yessir .         most of them look very young     said the lieutenant  who didn   t look very old .      yessir .         and isn   t that one a troll .         yessir .  well spotted  sir .         and the one with stitches all around his head .         he   s an igor  sir .  sort of like a special clan up in the mountains  sir .         do they fight .         can take a man apart very quickly  sir  as i understand it     said jackrum  his expression not changing .   the young lieutenant sighed .      well  i   m sure they   re all good fellows     he said .     now then  er   men  i           pay attention and listen to what the lieutenant has to say .     bawled strappi .   the lieutenant shuddered .         thank you  corporal     he said .     men  i have good news     he added  but in the voice of one who hasn   t .     you were probably expecting a week or two in the training camp in crotz  yes .  but i   m glad to be able to tell you that the  the war is progressing so  so  so well that you are to go directly to the front .      polly heard one or two gasps  and a snigger from corporal strappi .      all of you are to go to the lines     said the lieutenant .     that includes you too  corporal .  your time for action has come at last .      the snigger stopped .      sorry  sir .     said strappi .     the front .  but you know that i   m   well  you know about the special duties           my orders said all able bodied men  corporal     said blouse .     i expect that you   ll be itching for the fray after all these years  eh  a young man like you .      strappi said nothing .      however     said the lieutenant  fumbling under his soaking cloak     i do have a package here for you  sergeant jackrum .  a very welcome one  i   ve no doubt .      jackrum took the packet gingerly .      thank you  sir  i   ll look at this later on       he began .      on the contrary  sergeant jackrum .     said blouse .     your last recruits should see this  since you are a soldier  and  as it were  a    father of soldiers    .  and so it   s only right that they see a fine soldier get his reward  an honorable discharge  sergeant .      blouse spoke the words as if they had cream and a little cherry on top .   apart from the rain  the only sound now was jackrum   s pudgy finger slowly ripping open the package .      oh     he said  like a man in shock .     good .  a picture of the duchess .  that   s eighteen i have now .  oh  and  ooh  a piece of paper saying it   s a medal  so it looks like we   ve even run out of pot metal now .  oh  and my discharge with a printing of the duchess   s very own signature itself .     he turned the packet over and shook it .     not my three months back pay  though .         three loud hurrahs for sergeant jackrum .     said the lieutenant to the rain and wind .     hip hip           but i thought we needed every man  sir .     said jackrum .      judging by all the notes pinned on that packet  it has been following you around for years  sergeant     said blouse .     you know the military .  that is your official discharge  i am afraid .  i cannot rescind it .  i am sorry .         but       jackrum began .      it bears the duchess   s signature  sergeant .  will you argue with that .  i said i am sorry .  in any case  what would you do .  we will not be sending out any more recruiting parties .         what .  but we always need men  sir .     jackrum protested .     and i   m fit and well again  got the stamina of a horse           you are the only man to return with recruits  sergeant .  that is how the matter is .      the sergeant hesitated for a moment  and then saluted .     yessir .  very good  sir .  will see the new lads settled in  sir .  pleasure to have served  sir .         can i ask something .     said maladict .      you do not address an officer directly  private     snapped jackrum .      no  let the man speak  sergeant     said the lieutenant .     these are   unusual times  after all .  yes  my man .         did i hear you say we   re going into battle without training  sir .         oh  well  most of you will almost certainly be pikemen  haha     said the lieutenant nervously .     not a lot of training there  eh .  you just need to know which end is which  haha .     the lieutenant looked as though he wanted to die .      pikemen .     said maladict  looking puzzled .      you heard the lieutenant  private maladict     snapped the sergeant .      yes  sir .  thank you  sir     said maladict  stepping back into the ranks .      are there any more questions .     said blouse  looking along the line .     jolly good  then .  we leave by the last boat  at midnight .  carry on  sergeant   for now .  what was the other thing   oh  yes .  and i shall need a batman .         volunteers to be the lieutenant   s batman step forward .  not you  private maladict .     snapped the sergeant .   no one moved .      oh  come now     said the lieutenant .   polly slowly raised a hand .      what   s a batman  sir .      the sergeant grinned mirthlessly .      fair question     he said .     a batman is  like  a personal servant who takes care of the officer .  fetches his meals to him  sees he   s smartly turned out  that style of thing .  so   s he is free to perform his duties more adequatelier .      igor stepped forward .      igorth are uthed to thervice  thargeant     he said .   using the amazing powers of deafness and restricted vision sometimes available even to the most nervous officers  the lieutenant appeared not to notice him .  he looked fixedly at polly .      what about you  private .     he said .      private perks used to work in a bar  sir     the sergeant volunteered .      capital .  report to my quarters in the inn at six  private perks .  carry on  sergeant .      as the horse staggered away  sergeant jackrum directed his glare at the squad  but there was no real fire to it .  he appeared to be operating on automatic  with his mind elsewhere .      don   t just stand there trying to look pretty .  there   s uniforms and weapons inside .  get kitted up .  if you want grub  cook it yerself .  at the double .  disssssssmiss .      the squad dashed for the barracks  propelled by sheer volume .  but polly hesitated .  corporal strappi hadn   t moved since the snigger had been cut short .  he was staring blankly at the ground .      you all right  corporal .     she said .      you go away  parts     said the corporal in a low voice that was much worse that his normal petulant shout .     just go away  all right .      she shrugged and followed the others .  but she had noticed the steaming dampness round the corporal   s feet .      there was chaos inside .  the barracks was really just one big room which did duty as mess  assembly room  and kitchen  with big bunk rooms beyond it .  it was empty  and well on the way to decay .  the roof leaked  the high windows were broken  dead leaves had blown in and lay around on the floor  among the rat droppings .   there were no pickets  no sentries  no people .  there was a big pot boiling on the sooty hearth  though  and its hiss and seethe were the only liveliness in the place .   at some point  part of the room had been set up as a kind of quartermaster   s store  but most of the shelves were empty .  polly had expected some sort of a queue  some kind of order  possibly someone handing out little piles of clothes .   what there was  instead  was a rummage stall .  very much like a rummage stall  in fact  because nothing on it appeared to be new and little on it appeared to be worth having .  the rest of the squad were already pawing through what might have been called merchandise if there was any possibility that anyone could be persuaded to buy it .      what   s this .  one size  doesn   t fit anyone .         this tunic   s got blood on it .  blood .         well  it ith one of the thtubborn thtainth  it   s alwayth very hard to get it out without           where   s the proper armor .         oh  no .  there   s an arrow hole in this one .         what dis .  nuffin fits a troll .      a small  leathery old man was at bay behind the table  cowing under the ferocity of maladict   s glare .  he wore a red uniform jacket  done up badly  with a corporal   s stripes  stained and faded  on the sleeve .  the left breast was covered in medals .   one arm ended in a hook .  one eye was covered in a patch .      we   re going to be pikemen  the lieutenant said .     said the vampire .     that means a sword and a pike per man  right .  and a shield if there   s an arrow storm  right .  and a heavy helmet  right .         wrong .  you can   t yell at me like that .     said the man .     see these medals .  i   m a        a hand descended from above and lifted him over the table .  carborundum held the man close to his face and nodded .      yah  can see    em  mister     he rumbled .     and    .      the recruits had fallen silent .      put him down  carborundum     said polly .     gently .         why .         he   s got no legs .      the troll focused .  then  with exaggerated care  he lowered the old soldier to the ground .  there were a couple of little tapping sounds as the two wooden peg legs touched the planking .      sorry about dat     he said .   the little man steadied himself against the table and shuffled his arms around a couple of crutches .      all right     he said gruffly .     no harm done .  but watch it  another time .         but this is ridiculous .     said maladict  turning to polly and waving a hand at the heap of rags and bent metal .     you couldn   t equip three men out of this mess .  there   re not even any decent boots .      polly looked along the length of the table .      we   re supposed to be well equipped     she said to the one eyed man .     we   re supposed to be the finest army in the world .  that   s what we   re told .  and aren   t we winning .      the man looked at her .  inside  she stared at herself .  she hadn   t meant to speak out like that .      so they say     he said in a blank kind of way .      and w at do you say .     said wazzer .  he   d picked up one of the few swords .  it was stained and notched .   the corporal glanced up at carborundum  and then at maladict .      i   m not s stupid  you know .     wazzer went on  red in the face and trembling .     all this stuff is off d dead men .         well  it   s a shame to waste good boots       the man began .      we   re the last o ones  aren   t we .     said wazzer .     the last r recruits .      the peg legged coporal eyed the distant doorway  and saw no relief heading in his direction .      we   ve got to stay here all night     said maladict .     night .     he went on  causing the old corporal to wobble on his crutches     where who know what evil flits through the shadows  dealing death on silent wings  seeking a hapless victim who           yeah  all right  all right  i did see your ribbon     said the corporal .     look  i   m closing up after you   ve gone .  i just run the stores  that   s all .  that   s all i do  honest .  i   m on one tenth pay  me  on account of the leg situation  and i don   t want trouble .         and this is all you   ve got .     said maladict .     don   t you have a little something   put by           are you saying i   m dishonest .     said the corporal hotly .      let   s say i   m open to the idea that you might not be     said the vampire .     c   mon  corporal  you said we   re the last to go .  what are you saving up .  what   ve you got .      the corporal sighed and swung with surprising speed over to a door  which he unlocked .      you   re better come and look     he said .     but it   s not good        it was worse .  they found a few more breastplates  but one was sliced in half and the other was one big dent .  a shield was in two pieces  too .  there were bent swords and crushed helmets  battered hats and torn shirts .      i done what i can     sighed the corporal .     i hammered stuff out and washed out the clothes but it   s been weeks since i had any coal for the forge and you can   t do nothin    about the swords without a forge .  it   s been months since i got any new weapons and  let me tell you  since the dwarfs buggered off  the steel we   ve been getting is crap anyway .     he rubbed his nose .     i know you think quartermasters are a thieving bunch and i won   t say we might not skim a bit off the top when things are going well  but this stuff .  a beetle couldn   t make a living off this .     he sniffed again .     ain   t been paid in three months  neither .  i guess one tenth of nothing is not as bad as nothing  but i was never that good at philosophy .      then he brightened up .     got plenty to eat  at least     he said .     if you like horse  that is .  personally i prefer rat  but there   s no accounting for taste .         i can   t eat horse .     said shufti .      ah  you   d be a rat man .     said the corporal  leading the way out into the big room .      no .         you   ll learn to be one .  you   ll all learn     said the little one tenth corporal  with an evil grin .     ever eaten scubbo .  no .  nothing like a bowl of scubbo when you   re hungry .  you can put anything in scubbo .  pork  beef  mutton  rabbit  chicken  duck   anything .  even rats  if you   ve got    em .  it   s food for the marching man  scubbo .  got some on the boil out there right now .  you can have some of that  if you like .      the squad brightened up .      soundth good     said igor .     what   th in it .         boiling water     said the corporal .     it   s what we call    blind scubbo .     but there   s going to be old horse in a minute unless you   ve got something better .  could do with some seasonings  at least .  who   s looking after the rupert .      they looked at one another .   the corporal sighed .     the officer     he explained .     they   re all called rupert or rodney or tristram or something .  they get better grub than you do .  you could try scrounging something at the inn .         scrounge .     said polly .   the old man rolled his one eye .      yeah .  scrounge .  scrounge  nick  have a lend of  borrow  thieve  lift  acquire  purrrr loin .  that   s what you   ll learn  if you   re gonna survive this war .  which they say we   re winnin     o   course .  always remember that .     he spat vaguely in the direction of the fire  possibly missing the cooking pot only by accident .     yeah  an    all the lads i see coming back down the road walking hand in hand with death  they probably overdid the celebrating  eh .  so easy to take your hand right off if you open a bottle of champ pag nee the wrong way  eh .  i see you   ve got an igor with you  you lucky devils .  wish we   d had one when i went off to battle .  i wouldn   t be kept awake by woodworm if we had .         we have to steal our food .     said maladict .      no  you can starve if that takes your fancy     said the corporal .     i   ve starved a few times .  there   s no future in it .  ate a man   s leg when we were snowed up in the ibblestarn campaign but  fair   s fair  he ate mine .     he looked at their faces .     well  it   s not on  is it  eating your own leg .  you   d probably go blind .         you swapped legs .     said polly  horrified .      yeah  me an    sergeant hausegerda .  it was his idea .  sensible man  the sergeant .  that kept us alive for the week and by then the relief got through .  we were certainly relieved about that .  oh  dear .  where   s my manners .  how d   yer do  lads  my name   s corporal scallot .  they call me threeparts .      he held out his hook .      but that   s cannibalism .     said tonker  backing away .      no it   s not  not officially  not unless you eat a whole person     said threeparts scallot levelly .     milit   ry rules .      all eyes turned to the big pot bubbling on the fire .      horse     said scallot .     ain   t got nothing but horse .  i told you .  i wouldn   t lie to you  boys .  now kit yerselves up with the best yer can find .  what   s your name  stone man .         carborundum     said the troll .      got a wee bit o    decent snacking anthracite saved up out the back  then  and some official red paint for you    cos i never met a troll yet that wanted to wear a jacket .  the rest of you  mark what i   m telling yer  fill up with grub .  fill yer pack with grub .  fill yer hat with grub .  fill yer boots with soup .  if any of you run across a pot of mustard  you hang on to it  it   s amazin    what mustard   ll help down .  and look after your mates .  and keep out of the way of officers     cos they ain   t healthy .  that   s what you learn in the army .  the enemy dun   t really want to fight you     cos the enemy is mostly blokes like you who want to go home with all their bits still on .  but officers   ll get you killed .     scallot looked around at them .     there .  i   ve said it .  and if there   s a political amongst you  mister  you can go an    tell tales and to hell with you .      after a few moments of embarrassed silence  polly said     what   s a political .         like a spy  only on your own side     said maladict .      that   s right     said scallot .     there   s one in every battalion these days  snitching on their mates .  get promotion that way  see .  don   t want dissent in the ranks  eh .  don   t want loose talk about losing battles  right .  which is a load of bloody cludgies     cos the infantry grumbles all the time .  moaning is part of bein    a soldier .     he sighed .     anyway  there   s a bunkhouse out the back  i beats the pallyarses regular so   s there probably not too many fleas .     once again he looked at blank faces .     that   s straw mattresses to you .  go on  help yourselves .  take what you like .  i   m closing up after you   ve gone  anyway .  we must be winning now you rattling lads are joining  right .         the clouds had broken when polly stepped out into the night  and a half moon filled the world with cold silver and black .   the inn opposite was another rubbishy alehouse for selling bad beer to soldiers .  it stank of ancient slops  even before she opened the door .  the sign was flaked and unrecognizable  but she could read the name  the world turned upside down .   she pushed open the door .  the smell got worse .  there were no customers and no sign of strappi or jackrum  but polly did see a servant methodically spreading the inn   s dirt evenly across the floor with a mop .      excuse m       she began  and then remembered the socks  raised her voice  and tried to sound angry .     hey  where   s the lieutenant .      the servant looked at her and gestured up the stairs with a thumb .  there was only one candle alight up there  and she knocked on the nearest door .      enter        she entered .  lieutenant blouse was standing in the middle of the floor in his breeches and shirtsleeves  holding a saber .  polly was no expert in these matters  but she thought she recognized the stylish  flamboyant pose as the one beginners tend to use just before they   re stabbed through the heart by a more experienced fighter .      ah  perks  isn   t it .     he said  lowering the blade .     just  er  limbering up .         yes  sir .         there   s some laundry in the bag over there .  i expect someone in the inn will do it .  what   s for supper .         i   ll check  sir .         what are the men having .         scubbo  sir     said polly .     possibly with hor           then bring me some  will you .  we are at war  after all  and i must show an example to my men     said blouse  sheathing the sword at the third attempt .     that would be good for morale .      polly glanced at the table .  a book lay open on top of a pile of others .  it looked like a manual of swordsmanship  and the page it was open at was page five .  beside it was a thick lensed pair of spectacles .      are you a reading man  perks .     said blouse  closing the book .   polly hesitated .  but  then  what did ozzer care .      a bit  sir     she admitted .      i suspect i shall have to leave most of these behind     he said .     do take one if you want it .     he waved a hand at the books .  polly read the titles .  the craft of war .  principles of engagement .  battle studies .  tactical defense .      all a bit heavy for me  sir     she said .     thanks all the same .         tell me  perks     said blouse     are the recruits in  er  good spirits .      he gave her a look of apparently genuine concern .  he really did have no chin  she noticed .  his face just eased its way into his neck without much to disturb it on the way  but his adam   s apple  now  that was a champion .  it went up and down his neck like a ball on a spring .   polly had been soldiering for only a couple of days  but already an instinct had developed .  in summary  it was this  lie to officers .      yes  sir     she said .      getting everything they need .      the aforesaid instinct weighed the chances of them getting anything more than they   d got already as a result of a complaint  and polly said     yes  sir .         of course  it is not up to us to question our orders     said blouse .      wasn   t doing so  sir     said polly  momentarily perplexed .      even though at times we might feel       the lieutenant began  and started again .     obvious warfare is a very volatile thing  and the tide of battle can change in a moment .         yessir     said polly  still staring .  the man had a small spot where his spectacles had rubbed on his nose .   the lieutenant seemed to have something on his mind  too .      why did you join up  perks .     he said  groping on the table and finding his spectacles at the third attempt .  he had woollen gloves on  with the fingers cut out .      patriotic duty  sir .     said polly promptly .      you lied about your age .         nosir .         just patriotic duty  perks .      there were lies  and then there were lies .  polly shifted awkwardly .      would quite like to find out what   s happened to my brother  paul  sir     she said .      ah  yes .     lieutenant blouse   s face  not a picture of happiness to begin with  suddenly bore a hunted look .      paul perks  sir     polly prompted .      i   m  er  not really in a position to know  perks     said blouse .     i was working as a  i was  er  in charge of  er  i was engaged in special work back at headquarters  er   obviously i don   t know all the soldiers  perks .  older brother  w   is he .         yessir .  joined the ins and outs last year  sir .         and  er  have you any younger brothers .     said the lieutenant .      no  sir .         ah  well .  that   s something to be thankful for  at any rate     said blouse .  it was a strange thing to say .  polly   s brow wrinkled in puzzlement .      sir .     she said .   and then she felt an unpleasant sensation of movement .  something was slipping slowly down the inside of her thigh .      anything the matter  perks .     said the lieutenant  catching her expression .      nosir .  just a   a bit of cramp  sir .  all the marching  sir .     she clamped both hands around one knee and edged backwards toward the door .     i   ll just go and   go and see to your supper  sir .         yes  yes     said blouse  staring at her leg .     yes   please        polly paused outside the door to pull her socks up  re tucked the end of one under her belt as an anchor  and hurried down to the inn   s kitchens .  a look told her all she wanted to know .  food hygiene here consisted of making a half hearted effort not to gob in the stew .      i want onions  salt  pepper       she began .   the maid who was stirring the soot black pot on the soot black stove glanced up  realized she had been addressed by a man  and hastily pushed her damp hair our of her eyes .      it   s stoo  sir     she announced .      i don   t want any .  i just want the stuff     said polly .     for the officer     she added .   the kitchen maid pointed a soot blackened thumb to a nearby door and gave polly what she probably thought was a saucy grin .      i   m sure you can have anything that takes your fancy  sir     she said .   polly glanced at the couple of shelves that had been dignified by the name of pantry  and grabbed a couple of large onions  one in each hand .      may i .     she said .      oh  sir .     giggled the maid .     i do hope you   re not one of them coarse soldiers who   d take advantage of a helpless maiden  sir .         no  er   no .  i   m not one of them     said polly .      oh .     this didn   t seem to be the right answer .  the maid put her head on one side .     have you had much to do with young women  sir .     she asked .      er   yes .  quite a lot     said polly .     er   lots  really .         really .      the maid drew closer .  she smelled mostly of sweat  tinged with soot .  polly raised the onions as a kind of barrier .      i   m sure there   s things you   d like to learn     the maid purred .      i   m sure there   s something you wouldn   t .     said polly  and turned and ran .  as she made it out into the cold night air  a plaintive voice behind her called out     i   m off at eight o   clock .         ten minutes later  corporal scallot was impressed .  polly got the feeling this did not happen often .   shufti had wedged an old breastplate beside the fire  had hammered some slabs of horsemeat until they were tender  dipped them in some flour  and was frying them .  the sliced onions sizzled next to them .      i always just boil    em     said scallot  watching him with interest .      you just lose all the flavor if you do that     said shufti .      hey  lad  the stuff i   ve ate  you wouldn   t want to taste it .         saut   things first  especially the onions     shufti went on .     improves the flavor .  anyway  when you boil you ought to boil slow .  that   s what me mam always says .  roast fast  boil slow  okay .  this isn   t bad meat  for horse .  shame to boil it  anyway .         amazin        said scallot .     we could   ve done with you in ibblestarn .  the sarge was a good man but a bit  you know  tough in the leg .         a marinade would probably have helped     said shufti absently  flipping a slice of meat with a broken sword .  he turned to polly .     was there any more stuff in the larder  ozz .  i can make up some stock for tomorrow if we can           i   m not going in that kitchen again .     said polly .      ah  that   d be roundheels molly .     said corporal scallot  looking up and grinning .     she   s sent many a lad on his way rejoicing .      he dipped a ladle in the boiling scubbo pot next to the pan .  disintegrated gray meat seethed in a few inches of water .      that   ll do for the rupert     he said and picked up a stained bowl .      well  he did say he wanted to eat what the men eat     said polly .      oh  that kind of officer     said scallot uncharitably .     yeah  some young ones try that stuff  ifn    they   ve been readin    the wrong books .  some of    em tries to be friends  the bastards .     he spat expertly between the two pans .     wait    til he tries what the men eat .         but if we   ve having steak and onions           no thanks to the likes o    him     said the corporal  ladling the slurry into the bowl .     the zlobenian troops get one pound of beef and a pound of flour a day minimum  plus fat pork or butter and half a pound of peas .  a pint o    molasses sometimes  too .  we get stale horse bread and what we scrounge .  he   ll have scubbo and like it .         no fresh vegetables  no fruit     said shufti .     that   s a very binding diet  corp .         yeah  well  once battle commences i reckon you   ll find constipation   s the last thing on your mind     said scallot .  he reached up  pushed some rags aside  and pulled down a dusty bottle from a shelf .      rupert   s not having none o    this  neither     he said .     got it off   f the baggage of the last officer that went through  but i   ll share it with you     cos you   s good lads .     he casually knocked the top of the bottle off against the edge of the chimney .        s only sherry  but it   ll make you drunk .         thanks  corp     said shufti and took the bottle .  he sloshed a lot over the sizzling meat .      hey  that   s good drink you   re wastin    .     said scallot  making a grab for it .      no  it   ll spice up the meat a fair treat     said shufti  trying to hang on to the bottle .     it   ll   sugar .      half the liquid had gone on the fire as the two hands fought for it  but that wasn   t what had felt like a small steel rod shooting through polly   s head .  she looked around at the rest of the squad  who didn   t appear to have     maladict winked at her and made a tiny gesture with his head toward the other end of the room  and strolled in that direction .  polly followed .       maladict always found something to lounge against .  he relaxed in the shadows  looked up at the rafters  and said     now  i say a man who knows how to cook is no less of a man for that .  but a man who says    sugar .     when he swears .  have you ever heard a man say that .  you haven   t .  i can tell .      so it was you who gave me the socks  thought polly .  you know about me  i can tell you do  but do you know about lofty .  and maybe shufti was very politely brought up   but one look at maladict   s knowing smile made her decide not to try that road .  besides  the moment you looked at shufti with the idea that maybe he was a girl  you saw that he was .  no man would say    sugar .     three girls now        and i   m pretty sure about lofty  too     said maladict .      what   re you going to do about   them .     she said .      do .  why should i do anything about anyone .     said maladict .     i   m a vampire officially pretending not to be one  right .  i   m the last person who   ll say anyone has to play the hand they were dealt .  so good luck to   him  say i .  but you might like to take him aside later on and have a word with him .  you know   man to man .      polly nodded .  was there a knowingness to that comment .      i   d better go and take the lieutenant his scubbo     she said .     and   blast it  i forgot about his laundry .         oh  i wouldn   t worry about that  old chap     said maladict and flashed a little smile .     the way things are going around here  igor   s probably a washerwoman in disguise .         polly did the laundry  in the end .  she wasn   t sure that she   d be able to dodge molly a second time  and there wasn   t that much of it .  afterwards  she hung it in front of the fire  which was roaring .   the horse had been surprisingly good  but not as surprising as blouse   s reaction to the scubbo .  he had sat there in his evening dress uniform   wearing special clothes just to sit down and eat all by yourself was a new one on polly   and had yummed it up and sent her back with the bowl for more .   the meat had been boiled white and there was scum on the top .  the squad wondered what kind of a life an officer could have led that inclined him to like scubbo .      dun   t know much about him     said scallot upon questioning .     he   s been here two weeks  frettin    to get to the war .  brought a whole cartload of books with him  i heard .  looks like a typical rupert to me .  they were all behind the door when the chins were handed out .  a sergeant who went through said he   s not really a soldier at all  just some wonk from headquarters that   s good at sums .         oh  great     said maladict  who was brewing his coffee by the fire .  the little engine gurgled and hissed .      i don   t think he can see very well without his glasses     said polly .     but he   s very  er  polite .         not been a rupert for long  then     said scallot .     they   re more    hey there .  you .  damn your eyes  fwah fwah fwah .     i seen your sergeant before  though  old jackrum .  been everywhere  he has .  everyone knows old jackrum .  he was with us in the snow up at ibblestarn .            how many people did he eat .     said maladict  to general laughter .  the dinner had been good  and there had still been enough sherry for a glass each .      let   s just say i heard he didn   t come down much thinner than when he went up     said scallot .      and corporal strappi .     said polly .      never seen him before  either     said scallot .     cross grained little bugger .  political  i   d say .  why   s he gone and left you here .  got a nice cushy bed in the inn  has he .         i hope he   s not g going to be our sergeant     said wazzer .      him .  why .     said scallot .   polly volunteered the events earlier in the evening .  to her surprise  scallot laughed .      they   re trying to get rid of the old bugger again  are they .     he said .     that   s a laugh .  bless you  it   ll take more   n a bunch of gawains and rodneys to lever jackrum out of his own army .  why  he   s been court martialed twice .  he got off both times .  and d   you know he once saved general froc   s life .  he   s been everywhere  got the goods on everyone  knows more strings than me and i know a good few  mark my words .  if he wants to march with you tomorrow he will  and no skinny little rupert   ll get in his way .         so what was a man like that doing as a recruiting officer .     said maladict sharply .         cos he got his leg cut open in zlobenia and bit the sawbones who tried to look at it when the wound went bad  cleverdick     retorted scallot .     cleaned it out himself with maggots and honey  then drank a pint of brandy and sewed himself up and lay on his bed with a fever for a week .  but the general got him  i heard  came and visited him while he was too weak  and told him he was going on the drumming for a year and no argument .  not even froc hisself would hand him his papers  not after jackrum   d carried him on his back for fourteen miles through enemy lines        the door swung open  and sergeant jackrum walked in  tucking his hands into his belt .      don   t bother to salute  lads     he said as they turned guiltily .     evening  threeparts  nice to see nearly all of you again  you artful ol    god dodger .  where   s corporalstrappi .         haven   t seen him all evening  sarge     said maladict .      didn   t he come in here with you .         no  sarge .  we thought he was with you .      not a muscle moved on jackrum   s face .      i see     he said .     well  you heard the lieutenant .  the boat leaves at midnight .  we should be well down the kneck by wednesday   s dawn .  get a few hours sleep if you can .  tomorrow   s going to be a long day  if you   re lucky .      and with that  he turned and went out again .  wind howled outside  and was cut off when the door shut .  we   ll be well down the kneck  polly noted .  well done  threeparts .      missing a corporal .     said scallot .     now there   s a thing .  usually it   s a recruit that goes ay wole .  well  you heard the sergeant  boys .  time to wash up and turn in .      there was a washroom and latrine  in a rough and ready fashion .  polly found a moment when she and shufti were in it alone .  she   d racked her brains about how best to raise the subject  but as it turned out  just a look was all it took .      it was when i volunteered to do the supper  wasn   t it     shufti mumbled  staring into the stone sink  which had moss growing in it .      that was a clue  yes     said polly .      a lot of men cook  you know .     said shufti hotly .      yes  but not soldiers  and not enthusiastically     said polly .     they don   t do marinades .         have you told anybody .     mumbled shufti  red in the face .      no     said polly  which was  after all  strictly true .     look  you were good  you had me fooled right up until    sugar .            yes  yes  i know     shufti whispered .     i can do the  the belching and the walking stupidly and even the nosepicking  but i wasn   t brought up to swear like you men .      us men  thought polly .  oh  boy .      we   re the coarse and licentious soldiery .  i   m afraid it   s shit or bust     she said .     er   why are you doing this .      shufti stared into the dank stone sink as if strange green slime was really interesting  and mumbled something .      sorry  what was that .     said polly .      going to find my husband     said shufti only a little bit louder .      oh  dear .  how long have you been married .     said polly  without thinking .         not married yet       said shufti in a voice as tall as an ant .   polly glanced down at the plumpness of shufti .  oh  dear .  oh  dear .   she tried to sound reasonable .     don   t you think that you should           don   t you tell me to go home .     said shufti  rounding on her .     there   s nothing for me back home except disgrace .  i   m not going home .  i   m going to the war and i   m going to find him .  no one   s going to tell me not to  ozzer .  no one .  this has happened before  anyway .  and it ended right .  there   s a song about it and everything .         oh  that     said polly .     yes .  i know .     folk singers should be shot .     what i was going to say was that you might find this helps the disguise       she produced a soft cylinder of woolly socks from her pack and wordlessly handed it over .  it was a dangerous thing to do  she knew  but now she was feeling a kind of responsibility to those whose sudden strange fancy hadn   t been followed by a plan .   on the way back to her palliasse she caught sight of wazzer hanging his little picture of the duchess on a handy hook in the crumbling wall above his mattress .  he looked around furtively  failed to spot polly in the shadows of the doorway  and bobbed a very quick curtsy to the picture .  a curtsy  not a bow .   polly frowned .  four .  she was barely surprised now .  and she had one pair of clean socks left .  this was soon going to be a barefoot army .      polly could tell time by the fire .  you got a feel for how long a fire burned  and the logs on this one were gray with ash over the glow beneath .  it was gone eleven  she decided .   by the sound of it  no one was getting any sleep .  she   d got up after an hour or two of lying on the crackling straw mattress  staring at darkness and listening to things move about underneath her  she   d have stayed on it for longer  but something in the straw seemed to want to push her leg out of the way .  besides  she didn   t have any dry blankets .  there were blankets in the barracks  but threeparts had advised against them on account of them carrying  as he put it     the itch .      the corporal had left a candle alight .  polly had read paul   s letter again  and took another look at the piece of printed paper rescued from the muddy road .  the words were fractured and she wasn   t sure about all of them  but she didn   t like the sound of any of them .     invas    had a particularly unpleasant ring to it .   and then there was the third piece of paper .  she couldn   t help that .  it had been a complete accident .  she   d done blouse   s laundry  and of course you went through the pockets before you washed things  because anyone who   d ever tried to unroll a soggy  bleached sausage that   d once been a banknote never wanted to do it twice .  and there had been this folded piece of paper .  admittedly  she needn   t have unfolded it and  having unfolded it  needn   t have read it .  but there are some things that you just do .   it was a letter .  presumably blouse had shoved it in a pocket and forgot about it when he   d changed his shirt .   she didn   t need to read it again but  by candlelight  she did .       my dearest emmeline   fame and fortune await .  after only eight years as a  nd lieutenant  i have now been promoted and am to have a command .  of course this will mean that there will be no officer left in the adjutant general   s blankets  bedding  and horse fodder department  but i have explained my new filing system to cpl .  drebb and i believe he is sound .   you know i cannot go into matters of detail  but i believe this will be a very exciting prospect and i am anxious to be    at the foe .     i am bold enough to hope that the name of blouse will go down in military history .  in the meantime  i am brushing up my sword drill and it is definitely all    coming back    to me .  of course  the promotion brings with it no less than one shilling extra    per diem     plus three pence fodder allowance .  to this end i have purchased a    charger    from mr .     honest    jack slacker  a most entertaining gentleman  although i fear that his description of my steed   s    prowess    may have been prone to some exaggeration .  nevertheless  i am    moving up    at last and if fate smiles on me  this will hurry forward the day when i can    and that was it  fortunately .  after some thought  polly went and carefully damped the letter  then dried it quickly over the remains of the fire and slipped it into the pocket of the washed shirt .  blouse might scold her for not removing it before washing  but she doubted it .   a blanket counter with a new filing system .  an ensign for eight years  in a war where promotion could be rather fast .  a man who put quotes around any word or phrase he thought of as even slightly    racy .     brushing up on his    sword drill .     and so near sighted he   d bought a horse from jack slacker  who went around all the horse fairs    bargain bins and sold winded old screws that dropped a leg before you   d got home .   our leader .   they were losing the war .  everyone knew that  but nobody would say it .  it was as if they felt that if the words weren   t said out loud then it wasn   t really happening .  they were losing the war and this squad  untrained and untried  fighting in dead men   s boots  could only help them lose it faster .  half of them were girls .  and because of some bloody stupid song  shufti was wandering off into a war to look for the father of her child  and that was a desperate errand for a girl even in peacetime .  and lofty was trailing after her boy  which would probably be romantic right up until five minutes into a battle .  and she        well  yes .  she   d heard the song  too .  so what .  paul was her brother .  she   d always kept an eye on him  even when she was small .  mother was always busy  everyone was always busy at the duchess  so polly had become a big sister to a brother fifteen months older than she .  she   d taught him to blow his nose  taught him how to form letters  went and found him when crueler boys had got him lost in the woods .  running after paul was a duty that had become a habit .   and then   well  it wasn   t the only reason .  when her father died  the duchess would be lost to her side of the family if there was no male to inherit .  that was the law  plain and simple .  nugganatic law said the men could inherit    the things of men     such as land  buildings  money  and all domestic animals except cats .  women could inherit    the things of women     which were mostly small items of personal jewelry and spinning wheels and cats passed from mothers to daughters .  they certainly couldn   t inherit a large  famous tavern .   so the duchess would go to paul if he was alive  or  if he was dead  it was allowable for it to go to polly   s husband if she was married .  and since polly saw no prospect of that  she needed a brother .  paul could happily carry barrels around for the rest of his life  she would run the duchess .  but if she was left alone  a woman with no man  then at best all she   d get would be maybe the chance to go on living there while the deeds went to cousin vlopo  who was a drunkard .   of course  all that wasn   t the reason .  certainly not .  but it was a reason  all the same .  the reason was  simply  paul .  she   d always found him and brought him home .   she looked at the shako in her hands .  there had been helmets  but since they all had arrow holes or gaping rips in them  the squad had wordlessly gone for the softer hats .  you   d die anyway  and at least you wouldn   t have a headache .   the shako   s badge showed the regimental symbol of a flaming cheese .  maybe one day she   d find out why .   polly put it on  picked up her pack and the small bag of laundry  and stepped out into the night .  the moon was gone  the clouds had come back .  she was drenched by the time she   d crossed the square  the rain was coming horizontally .   she shoved open the inn door and saw  by the light of one guttering candle   chaos .  clothing was strewn across the flagstones  cupboards were hanging open .   jackrum was coming down the stairs  cutlass in one hand  lantern in the other .      oh  it   s you  perks     he said .     they   ve cleaned out the place and buggered off .  even molly .  i heard    em go .  pushing a cart  by the sound of it .  what   re you doing here .         batman  sarge     said polly  shaking water off her hat .      oh  yeah .  right .  go and wake him up  then .  he   s snoring like a sawmill .  i hope to hell the boat   s still there .         why   d they bug   scarper  sarge .     said polly and thought  sugar .  if it comes to it  i don   t swear  either .  but the sergeant didn   t appear to notice .   he gave her what is known as an old fashioned look  this one had dinosaurs in it .      got wind of something  i don   t doubt     he said .     of course  we   re winning the war  you know     he said .      ah .  oh .  and we   re not going to be invaded at all  i expect     said polly  with equally exaggerated care .      quite right .  i detest those treacherous devils who   d have us believe that a vast army is about to sweep right across the country any day now     said jackrum .      er   no sign of corporal strappi  sarge .         no  but i haven   t turned over every stone yet   shsh .      polly froze and strained to listen .   there were hoofbeats  getting louder as they approached  and changing from thuds into the ringing sound of horseshoes on cobbles .      cavalry patrol     jackrum whispered  putting the lantern down on the bar .     six or seven horses .         ours .         i bleedin    doubt it .      the clattering slowed and came to a stop outside .      keep    em talking     said jackrum reaching down and sliding the door   s bolt across .  he turned and headed toward the rear of the inn .      what .  what about .     whispered polly .     sarge .      jackrum had vanished .   polly heard murmuring outside the door  followed by a couple of sharp knocks .   she threw off her jacket .  she wrenched the shako off her head and tossed it behind the bar .  now she wasn   t a soldier  at least .  and  as the door was shaken against the bolt  she saw something white lying in the debris .   it was a terrible temptation     the door burst open at the second blow  but the soldiers didn   t immediately enter .  lying under the bar  struggling to put the petticoat on over rolled up trousers  polly tried to make sense of the sounds .   as far as she could tell from the rustles and thuds  anyone waiting inside the doorway with ambush in mind would have been briefly and terminally sorry .   she tried to count the invaders  it sounded as though there were at least three .  in the tense silence  the sound of a voice speaking in normal tones came as a shock .      we heard the bolt slide across .  that means you   re in here somewhere .  make it easy on yourself .  we don   t want to have to come and find you .      i don   t want you to either  polly thought .  i   m not a soldier .  go away .  and then the next thought was  what do you mean  you   re not a soldier .  you took the shilling and kissed the picture  didn   t you .   and suddenly an arm had reached over the bar and grabbed her .  at least  she didn   t have to act .      no .  please  sir .  don   t hurt me .  i just got frightened .  please .      but inside there was a certain   sock ness that felt ashamed and wanted to kick out .      ye gods  what are you .     said the cavalryman  pulling her upright and looking at her as if she was some kind of exhibit .      polly  sir .  barmaid  sir .  only they cleared out and left me .         keep the noise down  girl .      polly nodded .  the last thing she needed now was blouse to run down the stairs with his saber and fencing for beginners .      yes  sir     she squeaked .      barmaid  eh .  three pints of what you   d probably call your finest ale  then .      that at least could happen on automatic .  she   d seen the mugs under the bar  and the barrels were behind her .  the beer was thin and sharp but probably wouldn   t dissolve a penny .   the cavalryman watched her closely as she filled the mugs .      what happened to your hair .     he said .   polly had been ready for this .      oh  sir  they cut it off  sir .     cos i smiled at a zlobenian trooper  sir .         here .         in drok  sir .     it was a town much nearer the border .     and me mam said it was shaming to the family and i got sent here  sir .      her hands shook as she put the mugs on the bar  and she was hardly exaggerating .  hardly   but a bit  nevertheless .  you   re acting like a girl  she thought .  keep it up .   now she could take stock of the invaders .  they wore dark blue uniforms  and big boots  and heavy calvary helmets .  one of them was standing by the shuttered windows .  the other two were watching her .  one had a sergeant   s stripes and an expression of deep suspicion .  the one who   d grabbed her was a captain .      this is terrible beer  girl     he said  sniffing the mug .      yes  sir  i know  sir     polly gabbled .     they wouldn   t listen to me  sir  and said you have to put a damp sheet over the barrels in this thundery weather  sir  and molly never cleans the spigot and           this town   s empty  you know that .         they all scarpered  sir     said polly earnestly .     gonna be a invasion  sir .  everybody says .  they   re frightened of you  sir .         except you  eh .     said the sergeant .      what   s your name  girl who smiles at zlobenian troopers .     said the captain  smiling .      polly  sir     said polly .  her questing hand found what it was seeking under the bar .  it was the barman   s friend .  there was always one .      and are you frightened of me  polly .     said the captain .  there was a snigger from the soldier by the window .   the captain had a well trimmed moustache that had been waxed to points  and was over six feet tall  polly reckoned .  he had a pretty smile  too  which was somehow improved by the scar on his face .  a circle of glass covered one eye .   her hand gripped the hidden cudgel .      no  sir     she said  looking back into one eye and one glass .     er   what that glass for  sir .         it   s a monocle     said the captain .     it helps me see you  for which i am eternally grateful .  i always say that if i had two i   d make a spectacle of myself .      that got a dutiful laugh from the sergeant .  polly looked blank .      and are you going to tell me where the recruits are .     said the captain .   she forced her expression not to change .      no .      the captain smiled .  he had good teeth  but there was  now  no warmth in his eyes .      you are in no position to be ignorant     he said .     we won   t hurt them  i assure you .      there was a scream in the distance .      much     said the sergeant with more satisfaction than necessary .  there was another yell .  the captain nodded to the man by the door  who slipped out .   polly pulled the shako out from under the bar and put it on .      one of them gave you his cap  did he .     said the sergeant  and his teeth were nowhere near as good as the officer   s .     well  i like a girl who   ll smile at a soldier        the cudgel hit him alongside the head .  it was old blackthorn  and he went down like a tree .   the captain backed away as polly came out from behind the bar with the club readied again .  but he hadn   t drawn his sword  and he was laughing .      now  girl  if you want       he caught her arm as she swung  dragged her toward him in a tight grip  still laughing  and folded up with a gasp as her knee connected with his sock drawer .  thank you  gummy .   as he sagged  she stepped back and brought the cudgel down on his helmet  making it ring .   she was shaking .  she felt sick .  her stomach was a small  red hot lump .   what else could she have done .  was she supposed to think we have met the enemy and he is nice .  anyway  he wasn   t .  he was smug .   she tugged a saber from a scabbard and crept out into the night .  it was still raining  and waist deep mist was drifting up from the river .  half a dozen or so were outside  but not tied up .  a trooper was waiting with them .   faintly  against the rustle of the rain  she heard him making soothing noises to comfort one of them .  she wished she hadn   t heard that .   well  she   d taken the shilling .  polly gripped the cudgel .   she   d gone a step when the mist between her and the man fountained up slowly as something rose out of it .  the horses shifted uneasily .  the man turned  a shadow moved  the man fell        oi .     whispered polly .   the shadow turned .      ozzer .  it   s me  maladict     it said .     sarge sent me to see if you needed help           bloody jackrum left me surrounded by armed men .     polly hissed .      and .         well  i   knocked two of them out     she said  feeling as she said it that this rather spoiled her case as a victim .     another one went over the road  though .         i think we got that one     said maladict .     well  i said    got      tonker nearly gutted him .  there   s a girl with what i   d call unresolved issues .     he turned around .     let   s see   seven horses  seven men .  yep .         tonker .     said polly .      oh  yes .  hadn   t you spotted her .  she went mad when the man charged at lofty .  now  let   s have a look at your gentlemen  shall we .     said maladict  heading for the door .      but lofty and tonker       polly began  running to keep up .     i mean  the way they act  they   i thought she was his girl   but i thought tonker   i mean  i know lofty is a gi        even in the dark  maladict   s teeth gleamed as he smiled .      the world   s certainly unfolding itself for you  eh .  ozzer .  every day  something new .  cross dressing now  i see .         what .         you are wearing a petticoat  ozzer     said maladict  stepping into the bar .  polly looked down guiltily and started to tug it off  and then thought  hang on a moment     the sergeant had managed to pull himself up against the bar  where he was being sick .  the captain was groaning on the floor .      good evening  gentlemen .     said the vampire .     please pay attention .  i am a reformed vampire  which is to say  i am a bundle of suppressed instincts held together with spit and coffee .  it would be wrong to say that violent  tearing carnage does not come easily to me .  it   s not tearing your throats out that doesn   t come easily to me .  please don   t make it any harder .      the sergeant pushed himself away from the bar top and took a muzzy swing at maladict .  almost absentmindedly  maladict leaned away from it and then returned a roundhouse blow that knocked him over .      the captain looks bad     he said .     what did he try to do to poor little you .         patronize me     said polly  glaring at maladict .      ah     said the vampire .      maladict knocked softly on the barracks door .  it opened a fraction  and then all the way .  carborundum lowered his club .   wordlessly  polly and maladict dragged the two cavalry men inside .   sergeant jackrum was sitting on a stool by the fire  drinking a mug of beer .      well done  lads     he said .     put    em with the others .     he waved the mug vaguely toward the far wall  where four of the soldiers cowered under the gaze of tonker .  they had been manacled together .   the last soldier was lying on a table  with igor at work on him with a needle and thread .      how   s he coming along  private .     said jackrum .      he   ll be fine  tharge     said igor .     it looked worthe than it wath  really .  jutht ath well  because until we get to the battlefield i won   t get any thpareth .         got a couple of legs for ol    threeparts .     said jackrum .      now then sarge  none of that     said scallot evenly .  he was sitting on the other side of the fireplace .     you just leave me their horses and saddles .  your lads could do with their sabers  i   ve no doubt .         they were looking for us  sarge     said polly .     we   re just a bunch of untrained recruits and they were looking for us .  i could   ve been killed  sarge .         no  i know talent when i sees it     said jackrum .     well done  lad .  had to piss off myself  on account of a big man in full enemy uniform isn   t easy to miss .  besides  you lads needed to be woke up .  that   s milit   ry thinking  that is .         but if i hadn   t       polly hesitated .     if i hadn   t tricked them  they might   ve killed the lieutenant .         see .  there   s always a positive side  any way you look at it     said scallot .   the sergeant stood up  wiped his mouth on the back of his hand  and hitched up his belt .  he ambled over to the captain  reached down  and lifted him up by his jacket .      why were you looking for these boys  sir .     he enquired .   the captain opened his eye and focused on the fat man .      i am an officer and a gentleman  sergeant     he muttered .     there are rules .         not many gentlemen around here at this moment  sir     said the sergeant .      damn right     whispered maladict .  polly  feeling drunk with relief and released tension  had to put her hand over her mouth to stop giggling .      oh  yeah .  the rules .  prisoners of war and that     jackrum went on .     that means you even have to eat the same things as us  you poor devils .  so you   re not going to talk to me .         i am   captain horentz of the first heavy dragoons .  i   ll say nothing more .     and something about the way he said it elbowed polly in the brain .  he   s lying .   jackrum stared at him blankly for a moment  and then said     well  now   it looks like what we have here is an embuggerance which  my lads of the cheesemongers  is defined as an obstruction in the way of progress .  i propose to deal with it in this wise .      he let go of the man   s jacket and the captain fell back .   sergeant jackrum removed his hat .  then he removed his jacket  too  revealing a stained shirt and bright red suspenders .  he was still almost spherical  from his neck  folds of skin lapped their way down to the tropical regions .  the belt must have been there just to conform to regulations  polly thought .   he reached up and undid a piece of string from around his neck .  it was looped through a hole in a tarnished coin .      corporal scallot .     he said .      yes  sarge .     said scallot  saluting .      you will note i am divestering myself of my insignia and am handing you my official shilling  which means  since last time i signed up it was for twelve years and that was sixteen years ago  i am now fully and legally a damn civilian .         yes  mister jackrum     said scallop cheerfully .   among the prisoners  heads jerked up at the sound of the name .      and that being the case  and since you  captain  are invading our country by night  under the cover of darkness  and i am a humble civilian  i think there   s no rule to stop me beating seven kinds of crap out of you until you tell me why you came here and when the rest of your mates are going to arrive .  and that may take me some time  sir  because up until now i   ve only ever discovered five types of crap .     he rolled up his sleeves  hauled up the captain again  and drew back a fist        we just had to take the recruits into custody     said a voice .     we weren   t going to hurt them .  now put him down  jackrum  damn you .  he   s still seeing stars .      it was the sergeant from the inn .  polly looked at the other prisoners .  even with carborundum and maladict watching them  and tonker glowering at them  there was a definite sense that the first blow landed on the captain was going to start a riot .  and polly thought  they are very protective  aren   t they     jackrum must have picked it up  too .      ah  now we   re talking     he said  lowering the captain gently but still holding his coat .     your men speak up for you well  captain .         that   s because we   re not slaves  you bloody beeteater     growled one of the troopers .      slaves .  all my lads joined up of their own free will  turniphead .         maybe they thought they did     said the sergeant .     you just lied to    em .  lied to    em for years .  they   re all gonna die because of your stupid lies .  lies and your raddled  rotting  lying old whore of a duchess .         private goom  as you were .  that is an order .  as you were  i said .  private maladict  take that sword off   f private goom .  that is another order .  sergeant  order your men to ease back slowly .  slowly .  do it now .  upon my oath  i am not a violent man  but any man  any man who disobeys me  bigod  that man is lookin   at a broken rib .      jackrum screamed all that in one long explosion of sound without taking his eyes off the captain .   reaction  order  and breathless stillness had taken just a few seconds .  polly stared at the sudden tableau as her muscles untensed .   the zlobenian troopers were settling back .  carborundum   s raised club began to lower itself gently .  little wazzer was held off the ground by maladict  who   d wrenched a sword from her hand  possibly only a vampire could have moved faster than wazzer as she   d charged the prisoners .      custody     said jackrum in a quiet voice .     that   s a funny word .  look at my little lads  will you .  not a whisker between them yet  save for the troll  and lichen don   t count .  still wet behind the ears  they are .  what   s dangerous about a harmless bunch of farm boys that   d concern a fine bunch of horse wallopers like yourselves .         can thomeone pleathe come and put their finger on thith knot .     said igor from his makeshift operating table .     i   ve jutht about done .         harmless .     said the sergeant  staring at the struggling wazzer .     they   re a bunch of bloody madmen .         i want to speak to your officer  damn you     said the captain  who looked a little less unfocused now .     you do have an officer  don   t you .         yeah  we   ve got one somewhere  as i recall     said jackrum .     perks  go and fetch the rupert  will you .  best if you take that dress off first  too .  you never know  with ruperts .      he carefully lowered the captain onto a bench  and straightened up .      carborundum  maladict  chop something off any prisoner who moves  and any man who tries to attack a prisoner .     he said .     now then   oh  yes .  threeparts scallot  i wish to enlist in your wonderful army  with its many opportunities for a young man willing to apply himself .         any previous soldierin    .     said scallot  grinning .      forty years fighting every bleeder within a hundred miles of borogravia  corporal .         special skills .         stayin    alive  corporal  come what may .         then allow me to present you with one shilling and immediate acceleration to the rank of sergeant     said scallot  handing back the coat and the shilling .     want to osculate the doxie .         not at my time o    life     said jackrum  putting on his jacket again .      there     he said .     all smart  all neat  all legal .  go on  perks  i gave you an order .         blouse was snoring .  his candle had burned down .  a book was open on his blanket .   polly gently pulled it out from under his fingers .  the title  almost invisible on the stained cover  was tacticus  the campaigns .      sir .     she whispered .   blouse opened his eyes  saw her  and then turned and frantically scrabbled by the bed .      here they are  sir     said polly  handing him his spectacles .      ah  perks  thank you     said the lieutenant  sitting up .     midnight  is it .         a bit after  sir .         oh  dear .  then we must hurry .  quick  pass me my breeches .  have the men had a good night .         we were attacked by zlobenian troops  sir .  first heavy dragoons .  we took them prisoner  sir .  no casualties  sir .         because they didn   t expect us to fight .  they wanted to take us alive .  and they walked in on carborundum and maladict and   me .   it had been hard  very hard  to force herself to swing that cudgel .  but once she had done it  it had felt easy .  and then she   d felt embarrassed about being caught in a petticoat  even though she had her breeches on underneath .  she   d gone from boy to girl just by thinking it  and it had been so   easy .   she needed some time to consider this .  she needed time to think about a lot of things .  she suspected that time was going to be in short supply .   blouse was still sitting there with his breeches half on  staring at her .      run that past me again one more time  will you  perks .     he said .     you have captured some of the enemy .         not just me  sir  i only got two of    em     said polly .     we all  er  piled in  sir .         heavy dragoons .         yessir .         that   s the prince   s personal regiment .  they   ve invaded .         i think it was more of a patrol  sir .  seven men .         and none of you are hurt .         nosir .         pass me my shirt .  oh  blast .      it was then that polly noticed the bandage around his right hand .  it was red with blood .  he saw her expression .      bit of a self inflicted wound  perks     he said nervously .        brushing up    on my sword drill after supper .  nothing serious .  just a bit    rusty     you know .  can   t quite manage buttons .  if you would be so good        polly helped the lieutenant struggle into the rest of his clothes  and threw his few other possessions in a bag .  it took a special kind of man  she reflected  to cut his sword hand with his own sword .      i should pay my bill       the lieutenant muttered as they hurried down the darkened stairs .      can   t  sir .  everyone   s fled  sir .         perhaps i should leave them a note  do you think .  i wouldn   t like them to think that i had    done a runner    without           they   ve all gone  sir .     said polly  pushing him toward the front door .   she stopped outside the barracks  straightened his coat  and stared at his face .      did you wash last night  sir .         there was no       blouse began .   the response was automatic .  even though she was fifteen months younger  she   d mothered paul for too long .      handkerchief .     she demanded .  and  since some things get programmed into the brain at an early age  one was obediently produced .      spit .     polly commanded .  then she used the damp hanky to wipe a mark off blouse   s face and realized  as she was doing it  that she was doing it .  there was no going back .  the only way out was ahead .      all right     she said brusquely .     have you got everything .         yes  perks .         have you been to the privy this morning .     her mouth went on  while her brain cowered in fear of a court martial .  i   m in shock  she thought  and so   s he .  so you cling to what you know .  and you can   t stop        no  perks     said the lieutenant .      then you must go properly before we get on the boat  all right .         yes  perks .         in you go  then  there   s a good lieutenant .      she leaned against the wall and got her breath back in a few hurried gulps as blouse stepped into the building  then slipped in after him .      officer present .     jackrum barked .  the squad  already lined up  stood to varying degrees of attention .   the sergeant crashed to attention in front of blouse  causing the young man to sway backward .      apprehended enemy scouting party  sir .  dangerous business all round  sir .  in view of the emergency nature of the emergency  sir  and seeing as how you have no nco what with corporal strappi having scarpered  and seeing as how i   m an old soldier in good standing  you are allowed to conscript me as an auxiliary under duchess   s regulations  rule      section   a   paragraph ii  sir  thank you  sir .         what .     said blouse  staring around blearily and becoming aware that in a world of sudden turmoil there was a big red coat that seemed to know what it was doing .     oh  yes .  fine .  rule      you say .  absolutely .  well done .  carry on  sergeant .         are you in command here .     barked horentz  standing .      indeed i am  captain     said blouse .   horentz looked him up and down .      you .     he said  disdain oozing from the word .      indeed  sir     said blouse  his eyes narrowing .      oh well  we shall have to do what we can .  i am captain horentz and that fat bastard     said horentz  pointing a threatening finger at jackrum     that bastard offered me violence .  as a prisoner .  in chains .  and that    boy     the captain added  spitting the word toward polly     kicked me in the privates and almost clubbed me to death .  i demand that you let us go .      blouse turned to polly .      did you kick captain horentz in the    privates     parts .         er   yessir .  kneed  actually .  and it   s perks  actually  sir  although i can see why you made the mistake .         what was he doing at the time .         er   embracing me  sir .     polly saw blouse   s eyebrows rise  and plunged on .     i was temporarily disguised as a girl  sir  in order to allay suspicion .         and then you   clubbed him .         yessir .  once  sir .         what in the world possessed you to stop at once .     said blouse .      sir .     said polly as horentz gasped .  blouse turned with an almost seraphic look of pleasure on his face .      and you  sergeant     he went on     did you  in fact  lay a hand on the captain .      jackrum took a step forward and saluted smartly .     not as in fact per se and such  sir  no     he said  keeping his eyes fixed on a point some twelve feet high on the far wall .     i just considered  since he had invaded our country to capture our lads  sir  that it wouldn   t hurt if he experienced temporary feelings of shock and awe  sir .  on my oath  sir  i am not a violent man .         of course not  sergeant     said blouse .  and now  while he still smiled  the smile was edged with a kind of malevolent glee .      for heavens    sake  you fool  you can   t believe these ignorant yokels  they   re the dregs of       horentz began .      i do believe them  indeed i do     said blouse  shaking with nervous defiance .     i would believe their testimony against yours  sir  if they told me the sky was green .  and it would appear that  untrained as they are  they have bested some of zlobenia   s finest soldiers by wit and daring .  i have every confidence that they have further surprises in store for us           dropping your drawers would do it     whispered maladict .      shutup .     hissed polly  and then had to cram a fist into her mouth again .      i know you  captain horentz     said blouse  and  just for a moment  the captain looked worried .     i mean i know your sort .  i   ve had to put up with you all my life .  big jovial bullies  with your brains in your breeches .  you dare to come riding into our country and think we   re going to be frightened of you .  you think you can appeal to me over the heads of my men .  you demand .  on the soil of my country .         captain .     murmured the cavalry sergeant  as horentz stared open mouthed at the lieutenant .     they   ll be here soon           ah     said horentz uncertainly .  then he seemed  with some effort  to regain his composure .     reinforcements are coming     he snapped .     free us now  you idiot  and i might just put this down to native stupidity .  otherwise i shall see to it that things go very  very badly for you and your   ha   men .         seven cavalrymen were considered not enough to deal with farm boys .     said blouse .     you   re sweating  captain .  you are worried .  and yet you have reinforcements coming .         permission to speak  sir .     barked jackrum and went straight on to     cheesemongers .  get bleedin    armed again right now .  maladict  you give private goom his sword back an    wish him luck .  carborundum  you grab a handful of them twelve foot pikes .  the rest of           there   s these as well  sarge     said maladict .     lots of them .  i got them off our friends    saddles .     he held up what looked to polly like a couple of large pistol crossbows  steely and sleek .      horsebows .     said jackrum  like a child opening a wonderful hogswatch present .     that   s what you gets for leading a honest and sober life  my lads .  dreadful little engines they are .  let   s have two each .         i don   t want unnecessary violence  sergeant     said blouse .      right you are  sir .     said the sergeant .     carborundum .  first man comes through that door runnin     i want him nailed to the pub wall .     he caught the lieutenant   s eye  and added     but not too hard .         and someone did knock at the door .   maladict leveled two bows at it .  carborundum lifted a couple of pikes in either hand .  polly raised her cudgel  a weapon she at least knew how to use .  the other boys  and girls  raised whatever weapon threeparts scallot had been able to procure .   there was silence .  polly looked around .      come in .     she suggested .      yeah  right  that should do it     said jackrum  rolling his eyes .   the door was pushed open and a small  dapper man stepped through carefully .  in build  coloring  and hairstyle he looked rather like mala        a vampire .     said polly softly .      oh  damn     said maladict .   the newcomer   s clothing  however  was unusual .  it was an old fashioned evening dress coat with the sleeves removed and many  many pockets sewn all over it .  in front of him  slung around his neck  was a large black box .   against all common sense  he beamed at the sight of a dozen weapons poised to deliver perforated death .      vonderful .     he said  lifting up the box and unfolding three legs to form a tripod for it .     but   could zer troll move a little to his left please .         huh .     said carborundum .  the squad looked at one another .      yes  and if the sergeant would be so kind as to move into ze center more  und raise zose swords a little bit higher .     the vampire went on .     great .  and you  sir  if you could give me a grrrrh    .         grrrrh .     said blouse .      very good .  really fierce now        there was a blinding flash and a brief cry of    oh  sh        followed by the tinkle of breaking glass .   where the vampire had been standing was a little cone of dust .  blinking  polly watched it fountain up into a human shape that coalesced  once more  into the vampire .      oh dear  i really thought ze new filter vould do it     he said .     oh vell  ve live und learn .     he gave them a bright smile  and added .     now   vhich vun of you is captain horentz  please .         half an hour had passed .  polly was still bewildered .   the trouble was not that she didn   t understand what was going on .  the trouble was that before she could understand that  she had to understand a lot of other things .  one of them was the concept of a newspaper .   blouse was looking proud and worried by turns  but nervous all the time .  polly watched him carefully  not least because he was talking to the man who had come in with the iconographer .  he wore a big leather coat and jodhpurs  and spent most of the time writing things down in a notebook  with occasional puzzled glances at the squad .   finally  maladict  who had good hearing  sauntered over to the recruits from his lounging spot by the wall .      okay     he said  lowering his voice .     it   s all a bit complicated  but   d   you any of you know about newspapers .         yeth  my thecond couthin igor in ankh morpork told me about them     said igor .     they   re like a kind of government announcement .         um   sort of .  except they   re not written by the government .  they   re written by ordinary people who write things down     said maladict .      like a diary .     said tonker .      um   no        maladict tried to explain .  the squad tried to understand .  it still made no sense .   it sounded to polly like some kind of punch and judy show .  anyway  why would you trust anything written down .  she certainly didn   t trust    mothers of borogravia .  .     and that was from the government .  and if you couldn   t trust the government  who could you trust .   very nearly everyone  come to think of it        mr .  de worde works for a newspaper in ankh morpork     said maladict .     he says we   re losing .  he says casualties are mounting and troops are deserting and all the civilians are heading for the mountains .         w why should we believe him .     wazzer demanded .      well  we   ve seen a lot of casualties and refugees  and corporal strappi hasn   t been around since he heard he was going to the front     said maladict .     sorry  but it   s true .  we   ve all seen it .         yeah  but he   s just some man from a foreign country .  why w would the duchess lie to us .  i mean  why would she send us out just to die .     said wazzer .     she w watches over us .         everyone says we   re winning     said tonker doubtfully  after that moment of embarrassment .  tears were running down wazzer   s face .      no  they don   t     said polly .     i don   t think we are  either .         does anyone think we are .     said maladict .  polly looked from face to face .      but saying so   it   s like treachery against the duchess  isn   t it .     said wazzer .     it   s spreading alarm and despondency  isn   t it .         maybe we ought to be alarmed     said maladict .     do you know how he came to be here .  he travels around writing down things about the war for his paper of news .  he met those cavalry just up the road .  in our country .  and they told him they   d just heard that the very last recruits from borogravia were here and they were nothing but  er     a wet little bunch of squeaking boys .     they said they   d capture us for our own good and he could get a picture of us for his paper .  he could show everybody how dreadful things were  they said  because we were scraping the bottom of the barrel .         yeah  but we beat    em so that   s foxed him .     said tonker  grinning nastily .     nothing for him to write down now  eh .         um   not really .  he says that this is even better .         better .  whose side is he on .         bit of a puzzler  really .  he comes from ankh morpork  but he   s not exactly on their side .  er   otto chriek  who makes the pictures for him           the vampire .  he crumbled to dust when the light flashed .     said polly .     then he   came back .         well  i was standing behind carborundum at the time     said maladict     but i know the technique .  he probably carries a thin glass vial of b   bl   blur   no  wait  i cansay this   blood .     he sighed .     there .  no problem .  a thin vial of   what i said   which smashed on the ground and brought the dust back to life again .  it   s a great idea .     maladict gave them a wan smile .     i think he really cares a lot about what he does  you know .  anyway  he told me de worde just tries to find out the truth .  and then he writes it down and sells it to anyone who wants it .         and people let him do that .     said polly .      apparently .  otto says he makes commander vimes livid with rage about once a week  but nothing ever happens .         vimes .  the butcher .     said polly .      he   s a duke  otto says .  but not like ours .  otto says he   s never seen him butcher anybody .  otto   s a black ribboner  like me .  he wouldn   t lie to a fellow ribboner .  and he says that picture he took is going on the clacks from the nearest tower tonight .  it will be in the paper of news tomorrow .  and they print a copy here .         how can you send a picture on the clacks .     said polly .     i know people who   ve seen them .  it   s just a lot of boxes on a tower that go clack clack .         ah  otto explained that to me  too     said maladict .     it   s very ingenious .         how does it work  then .         oh  i didn   t understand what he said .  it was all about   numbers .  but it certainly sounded very clever .  anyway  de worde just told the lieu   the rupert that news about a bunch of boys beating up experienced soldiers would certainly make people sit up and take notice .      the squad looked at one another sheepishly .      it was a bit of a fluke  and anyway we had carborundum     said tonker .      and i used trickery     said polly .     i mean  i couldn   t do it twice .         so what .     said maladict .     we did it .  the squad did it .  next time we   ll do it differently .         yeah .     said tonker .  and there was a shared moment of exhilaration in which they were capable of anything .  it lasted all of   a moment .      but it won   t work     said shufti .     we   ve just been lucky .  you know it won   t work  maladict .  you all know it won   t work  right .         well  i   m not saying we could  you know  take on a regiment all at once     said maladict .     and the lieu   rupert might be a bit wet .  but we could help make a difference .  old jackrum knows what he   s doing           upon my oath  i am not a violent man   whack .     sniggered tonker  and there were a few   yes  giggles  they were giggles  polly knew  from the squad .      no  you   re not     said shufti flatly .     none of us are  right .  because we   re girls .      there was a dead silence .      well  not carborundum and ozzer  okay     shufti went on  as if the silence was sucking unwilling words out of her .     and i   m not sure about maladict and igor .  but i know the rest of us are  right .  i   ve got eyes  i   ve got ears  i   ve got a brain .  right .      in the silence  there was the slow rumble that preceded a pronouncement from carborundum .      if it any help     she said  in a voice suddenly more sandy that gravelly     my real name   s jade .      polly felt questing eyes boring into her .  she was embarrassed  of course .  but not for the obvious reason .  it was for the other one  the little lesson that life sometimes rams home with a stick  you are not the only one watching the world  other people are also people  while you watch them they watch you  and they think about you while you think about them .  the world isn   t just about you .   there was going to be no possibility of getting out of this .  and  in a way  it was a relief .      polly     she said  almost in a whisper .   she looked questioningly at maladict  who smiled in a distinctly noncommittal way .      is this the time .     he said .      all right  you lot  what   re you standing about for .     bawled jackrum six inches from the back of maladict   s head .  no one saw him arrive there  he moved with an nco   s stealth  which sometimes mystifies even igors .   maladict   s smile didn   t change .      why  we   re awaiting your orders  sergeant     he said  turning around .      d   you think you   re clever  maladict .         um   yes  sarge .  quite clever     the vampire conceded .   there wasn   t a lot of humor in jackrum   s smile .      good .  glad to hear it .  don   t want another stupid corporal .  yeah  i know you ain   t even a proper private yet  but glory be  you   re a corporal now     cos i need one and you   re the snappiest dresser .  get some stripes from threeparts .  the rest of you   this isn   t a bleedin    mothers    meeting  we   re leaving in five minutes .  move .         but the prisoners  sarge       polly began  still trying to digest the revelation .      we   re goin    to drag    em over to the inn an    leave    em in tied up in the nood and shackled together     said jackrum .     vicious little devil when he   s roused  our rupert  eh .  and threeparts is having their boots and horses .  they won   t be going too far for a while  not in the nood .         won   t the writing man let them out .     said tonker .      don   t care     said jackrum .     he could probably cut the ropes  but i   m dropping the shackle key in the privy  and that   ll take a bit of fishing out .         whose side is he on  sarge .     said polly .      dunno .  i don   t trust    em .  ignore    em .  don   t talk to    em .  never talk to people who writes things down .  milit   ry rule .  now  i know i just gave you lot an order    cos i heard the bleedin    echo .  get on with it .  we are leaving .         road to perdition  lad  promotion     said scallot to maladict  swinging up with two stripes hanging from his hook .  he grinned .     that   s threepence extra a day you   re due now  only you won   t get it    cos they ain   t payin    us  but to look on the bright side  you won   t get stoppages  and they   re a devil for stoppages .  the way i see it  march backwards and yer pockets   ll overflow .         the rain had stopped .   most of the squad were parading outside the barracks where there was  now  a small covered wagon belonging to the writer of the paper of news .  a large flag hung from a pole attached to it  but polly couldn   t make out the design by moonlight .  beside the wagon  maladict was deep in conversation with otto .   the center of attention  though  was the line of cavalry horses .  one had been offered to blouse  but he   d waved it away with a look of alarm and muttering something about    being loyal to his steed     which  to polly   s eye  looked like a self propelled toast rack with a bad attitude .  but he   d probably made the right decision  at that  because they were big beasts  broad  battle hardened and bright eyed  sitting astride one of them would have strained the crotch in blouse   s trousers and an attempt at reining one of them in would have pulled his arms off at the shoulder .  now each horse had a pair of boots hanging from its saddle  except for the leading horse  a truly magnificent beast upon which corporal scallot sat like an afterthought .      i   m no donkey walloper  as you know  threeparts     said jackrum as he finished lashing the crutches behind the saddle     but this is a hell of a good horse you   ve got here .         damn right  sarge .  you could feed a platoon for a week off   f it .     said the corporal .      sure you won   t come with us .     jackrum added  standing back .     i reckon you still must   ve one or two things left for the bastards to cut off  eh .         thank you  sarge  it is a kind offer     said threeparts .     but fast horses are going to be at a real premium soon  and i   ll be in on the ground floor  as you might say .  this lot   ll be worth three years    pay .     he turned in the saddle and nodded at the squad .      best of luck  lads     he added cheerfully .     you   ll walk with death every day  but i   ve seen    im and he   s been known to wink .  and remember  fill your boots with soup .      he urged the horses into a walk  and disappeared with his trophies into the gloom .   jackrum watched him go  shook his head  and turned to the recruits .      all right  ladies   what   s funny  private halter .         er  nothing  sarge  i just   thought of something       said tonker  almost choking .      you ain   t paid to think of things  you   re paid to march .  do it .      the squad marched away .  the rain slackened to nothing  but the wind rose a little  rattling windows  blowing through the deserted houses  opening and shutting doors like someone looking for something they could have sworn they put down here only a moment ago .  that was all that moved in plotz  except for one candle flame  down near the floor in the back room of the deserted barracks .   the candle had been tilted so that it leaned against a cotton thread fastened between the legs of a stool .  this meant that when the candle burned low enough  it would burn through the thread and fall all the way to the floor and into a ragged trail of straw that led to a pile of palliasses on which had been stood two ancient cans of lamp oil .   it took about an hour  in the wet  dejected night for this to happen  and then all the windows blew out .      tomorrow dawned on borogravia like a great big fish .   a pigeon rose over the forests  banked slightly  and headed straight for the valley of the kneck .   even from here  the black stone bulk of the keep was visible  rising above the sea of trees .  the pigeon sped on  one spark of purpose in the fresh new morning        and squawked as darkness dropped from the sky  gripping it in talons of steel .  buzzard and pigeon tumbled for a moment  and then the buzzard gained a little height and flapped onwards .   the pigeon thought            .  but had it been more capable of coherent thought  and knew something about how birds of prey catch pigeons   it might have wondered why it was being gripped so   kindly .  it was being held  not squeezed .  as it was  all it could think was          .   the buzzard reached the valley and began to circle low over the keep .  as it gyred  a tiny figure detached itself from the leather harness on its back and  with great care  inched itself around the body and down to the talons .  it reached the imprisoned pigeon  knelt on it and put its arms round the bird   s neck .   the buzzard skimmed low over a stone balcony  reared in the air  and let the pigeon go .   bird and tiny man rolled and bounced across the flagstone in a trail of feathers  and lay still .   eventually a voice from somewhere under the pigeon said     bugger        urgent footsteps ran across the stones and the pigeon was lifted off corporal buggy swires .  he was a gnome  and barely six inches tall .  on the other hand  as the head and only member of ankh morpork city watch   s airborne section  he spent most of his time so high that everyone looked small .      are you all right  buggy .     said commander vimes .      not too bad  sir     said buggy  spitting out a feather .     but it wasn   t elegant  was it .  i   ll do better next time .  trouble is  pigeons are too stupid to be steered           what   ve you got me .         the times sent this up from their cart  sir .  i tracked it all the way .         well done  buggy .      there was a flurry of wings and the buzzard landed on the battlements .      and  er   what is his name .     vimes added .  the buzzard gave him the mad  distant look of all birds .      she   s morag  sir .  trained by the pictsies .  wonderful bird .         was she the one we paid a crate of whiskey for .         yes  sir  and worth every dram .      the pigeon struggled in vimes   s hand .      you wait there  then  buggy  and i   ll get reg to come out with some raw rabbit     he said  and walked into his tower .   sergeant angua was waiting by his desk  reading the living testament of nuggan .      is that a carrier pigeon  sir .     she said as vimes sat down .      no     said vimes .     hold it a minute  will you .  i want to have a look inside the message capsule .         it does look like a carrier pigeon     said angua  putting down the book .      ah  but messages flying through the air are an abomination unto nuggan     said vimes .     the prayers of the faithful bounce off them  apparently .  no  i think i   ve found someone   s lost pet and i   m looking in this little tube here to see if i can find the owner   s name and address  because i am a kind man .         so you are not actually waylaying field reports from the times  then  sir .     said angua  grinning .      not as such  no .  i   m just such a keen reader that i want to see tomorrow   s news today .  and mr .  de worde seems to have a knack for finding things out .  angua  i want to stop these stupid people fighting so that we can all go home  and if that means allowing the occasional pigeon to have a crap on my desk  so be it .         oh  sorry  sir  i didn   t notice .  i expect it   ll wipe off .         go and get reg to find some rabbit for the buzzard  will you .      when she   d gone  vimes carefully unscrewed the end of the tube and pulled out a roll of very thin paper .  he unfolded it  smoothed it out  and read the tiny writing  smiling as he did so .  then he turned the paper over and looked at the picture .   he was still staring at it when angua returned with reg and half a bucket of crunchy rabbit bits .      anything interesting  sir .     said angua ingenuously .      well  yes .  you could say that .  all plans are changed  all bets are off .  ha .  oh  mr .  de worde  you poor fool        he handed her the paper .  she read the story carefully .      good for them  sir     she said .     most of them look fifteen years old  and when you see the size of those dragoons  well  you   ve got to be impressed .         yes  yes  you could say that  you could say that     said vimes  his face gleaming like a man with a joke to share .     tell me  did de worde interview any borogravian high ups when he arrived .         no  sir .  i understand he was turned away .  they don   t really know what a reporter is  so i gather the adjutant threw him out and said he was a nuisance .         dear me  the poor man     said vimes  still grinning .     you met prince heinrich the other day .  describe him to me        angua cleared her throat .     well  sir  he was   largely green  shading to blue  with overtones of grllss and trail of           i meant describe him to me on the assumption that i   m not a werewolf who sees with his nose     said vimes .      oh  yes     said angua .     sorry  sir .  six foot two      pounds  fair hair  green blue eyes  saber scar on his left cheek  wears a monocle in his right eye  waxed moustache           good  well observed .  and now look at    captain horentz    in the picture  will you .      she looked again  and said  very quietly     oh dear .  they didn   t know .         he wasn   t going to tell them  was he .  would they have seen a picture .      angua shrugged .     i doubt it  sir .  i mean  where would they see it .  there   s never been a newspaper here until the times carts turned up last week .         some woodcut  maybe .         no  they   re an abomination  unless they   re of the duchess .         so they really didn   t know .  and de worde has never seen him     said vimes .     but you saw him when we arrived the other day .  what did you think of him .  just between ourselves .         an arrogant son of a bitch  sir  and i know what i   m talking about .  the kind of man who thinks he knows what a woman likes and it   s himself .  all very friendly right up until they say no .         stupid .         i don   t think so .  but not as clever as he thinks he is .         right     cos he didn   t tell our writer friend his real name .  did you read the bit at the end .      angua read  at the end of the text     perry  the captain threatened and harangued me after the recruits had gone .  alas  i had no time to fish for the manacle key in the privy .  please let the prince know where they are soonest .  wdw .         looks like william didn   t take to him  either     she said .     i wonder why the prince was out with a scouting party .         you said he was an arrogant son of a bitch     said vimes .     maybe he just wanted to pop across and see if his auntie was still breathing        his voice trailed off .  angua looked at vimes   s face  which was staring through her .  she knew her boss .  he thought war was simply another crime  like murder .  he didn   t much like people with titles  and regarded being a duke as a job description rather than a lever to greatness .  he had an odd sense of humor .  and he had a sense for what she thought of as harbingers  those little straws in the wind that said there was a storm coming .      in the nuddy     he chuckled .     could have slit their throats .  didn   t .  they took their boots away and left them to hop home in the nood .     the squad  it seemed  had found a friend .   she waited .      i feel sorry for the borogravians     he said .      me too  sir     said angua .      oh .  why .         their religion   s gone bad on them .  have you seen the latest abominations .  they abominate the smell of beets and people with red hair .  in rather shaky writing  sir .  and root vegetables are a staple here .  three years ago it was abominable to grow root crops on ground which had grown grain or peas .      vimes looked blank  and she remembered that he was a city boy .     it means no real crop rotation  sir     she explained .     the ground sours .  diseases build up .  you were right when you said they were going mad .  these   commandments are dumb  and any farmer can see that .  i imagine people go along with them as best they can  but sooner or later you either have to break them and feel guilty  or keep them and suffer .  for no reason  sir .  i   ve had a look around .  they   re very religious here  but their god   s let them down .  no wonder they mostly pray to their royal family .      she watched him stare at the piece of pigeon post for a while .  then he said      how far is it to plotz .         about fifty miles     said angua  adding     as the wolf runs  maybe six hours .  i can leave right away .         good .  buggy   ll keep an eye on you .  little henry is going to hop home  or meet one of his patrols  or an enemy patrol   whatever .  but the midden is going to hit the windmill when everyone sees that picture .  i bet de worde would have let him out if he   d been nice and polite .  that   ll teach him to meddle with the awesome power of a fair and free press  haha .     he sat upright and rubbed his hands together like a man who meant business .     now  let   s get that pigeon on its way again before it gets missed  eh .  get reg to lurch along to where the times people are staying and tell them their pigeon flew in the wrong window .  again .         that was a good time  polly remembered .   they didn   t go down to the river docks .  they could see there was no boat there .  they hadn   t turned up and the boatman had left without them .   instead  they crossed the bridge and headed up into the forests  with blouse leading the way on his ancient horse .  maladict went on ahead and   jade brought up the rear .  you didn   t need a light at night when a vampire led the way  and a troll at the rear would certainly discourage hangers on .   no one mentioned the boat .  no one spoke at all .  the thing was   the thing was  polly realized  that they were no longer marching alone .  they shared the secret .   that was a huge relief  and right now they didn   t need to talk about it .  nevertheless  it was probably a good idea to keep up a regular output of farts  belches  nosepickings  and groin scratchings  just in case .   polly didn   t know whether to be proud that they   d taken her for a boy .  i mean  she thought  i   d worked hard to get it right  i mastered the walk  except i suppose what i really did was mistress the walk  haha  i invented the fake shaving routine and the others didn   t even think of that  i haven   t cleaned my fingernails for days and i pride myself on being able to belch with the best of them .  so  i mean  i was trying .   it was just slightly annoying to find that she   d succeeded so well .   after a few hours of this  when true dawn was breaking  they smelled smoke .  there was a faint pall of it among the trees .  lieutenant blouse raised a hand for them to halt  and jackrum joined him in whispered conversation .   polly stepped forward .      permission to whisper too  sarge .  i think i know what this is .      jackrum and blouse stared at her .  then the sergeant said     all right  perks .  go and find out if you   re right  then .      that was an aspect that hadn   t occurred to polly  but she   d left herself open .  jackrum relented when he saw her expression  nodded to maladict  and said     go with him  corporal .      they left the squad behind and walked forward carefully  over the beds of new fallen leaves .   the smoke was heavy and fragrant and  above all  reminiscent .  polly headed to where thicker undergrowth was taking advantage of the extra light of a clearing  and pushed through into an airy thicket of hazel trees .  the smoke was denser here  and barely moving .   the thicket ended .  a few yards away  in a wide patch of cleared ground  a mound like a small volcano was spewing flame and smoke into the air .      charcoal oven     whispered polly .     just clay plastered on a stack of hazel .  should sit there smoldering for days .  the wind probably caught it last night and the fire   s broken out .  won   t make good charcoal now  it   s burning too fast .      they edged around it  keeping to the bushes .  other clay domes were dotted around the clearing  with faint wisps of steam and smoke coming from their tops .  there were a couple of ovens in the process of being built  the fresh clay stacked alongside some bundles of hazel sticks .   there was a hut  and the domes  and nothing else but silence  apart from the crackle of the runaway fire .      the charcoal burner is dead  or nearly dead     said polly .      he   s dead     said maladict .     there   s a smell of death here .         you can smell it above the smoke .         sure     said maladict .     some things we   re good at smelling .  but how did you know .         they watch the burns like hawks     said polly  staring at the hut .     he wouldn   t let it go out of control like that if he was alive .  is he in the hut .         they are in the hut     said maladict flatly .  he set off across the smoky ground .   polly ran after him .      man and woman .     she said .     their wives often live out with           can   t tell  not if they   re old     said maladict shortly .   the hut was only a temporary thing  made of woven hazel and roofed with tarpaulin  the charcoal burners moved around a lot  from coppice to coppice .  it didn   t have windows  but it did have a doorway  with a rag for a door .  the rag had been pulled away  the doorway was dark .   i   ve got to be a man about this  she thought .   there was a woman on the bed  and a man lying on the floor .  there were other details  which the eye saw but the brain did not focus on .  there was a great deal of blood .  the couple had been old .  they would not grow older .   back outside  polly took frantic mouthfuls of air .      do you think those cavalrymen did it .     she said at last  and then realized that maladict was shaking .     oh   the blood       she said .      i can deal with it .  it   s okay .  i just have to get my mind right  it   s okay .      he leaned against the hut  breathing heavily .      okay  i   m fine     he said .     and i can   t smell horses .  why don   t you use your eyes .  nice soft mud everywhere after the rain  but no hoofprints .  plenty of footprints  though .  we did it .         don   t be silly  we were        the vampire had reached down and pulled something out of the fallen leaves .  he rubbed the mud off it with a thumb .   in thin pressed brass  it was the flaming cheese badge of the ins and outs .      but   i thought we were the good guys     said polly weakly .     if we were guys  i mean .         i think i need a coffee     said the vampire .         deserters     said sergeant jackrum ten minutes later .     it happens .     he tossed the badge into the fire .      but they were on our side .     said shufti .      so .  not everyone   s a nice gennelman like you  private manickle     said jackrum .     not after a few years of gettin    shot at and eatin    rat scubbo .  on the retreat from khrusk i had no water for three days and then fell on my face in a puddle of horse piss  a circumstance which did nothing for my feelin   s of goodwill toward my fellow man or horse .  something the matter  corporal .      maladict was on his knees  going through his pack with a distracted air .      my coffee   s gone  sarge .         should   ve packed it properly  then     said jackrum unsympathetically .      i did  sarge .  i washed out the engine and packed it up with the bean bag after supper last night .  i know i did .  i don   t take coffee lightly .         if someone else did  they   re going to wish i   d never been born     growled jackrum  looking around at the rest of the squad .     anyone else lost anything .         er   i wasn   t going to say anything     cos i wasn   t sure     shufti volunteered     but my stuff looked as if it had been pulled about when i opened my pack just now           oh ho .     said jackrum .     well  well  well .  i   ll say this once  lads .  pinching from yer mates is a hanging offence  understood .  nothing breaks down morale faster   n some sneaky little sod dipping into people   s packs .  and if i find out someone   s been at it  i   ll swing on their heels .     he glared at the squad .     i ain   t gonna demand that you all empty out your packs as if you   s criminals     he said     but you   d better check that nothing   s missing .  o   course  one of you might have packed something that wasn   t theirs by accident  okay .  packing in a rush  poor light  easy to do .  in which case  you sort it out amongst yourselves  understand .  now  i   m off to have a shave .  lieutenant blouse is having a throw up behind the shelter after a viewin    of the corpses  poor chap .      polly rummaged desperately in her pack .  she   d thrown things in any old how last night  but what she was frantically searching for was        not there .   despite the heat from the charcoal mounds  she shivered .   the ringlets had gone .  feverishly  she tried to remember the events of yesterday evening .  they   d just dumped their packs as soon as they were in the barracks  right .   and maladict had made himself some coffee at suppertime .  he   d washed and dried the little machine     there was a thin little wail .  wazzer  the meager contents of her pack spread around her  held up the coffee engine .  it had been stamped almost flat .      b b b       she began .   polly   s mind worked faster  like a millwheel in a flood .  then everyone took their packs into the back room with all the mattresses  didn   t they .  and so they   d still be there when the squad fought the troopers        oh  wazz     said shufti .     oh  dear        so who might have sneaked in through the back door .  there was no one around except the squad and the cavalrymen .  perhaps someone wanted to watch  and cause a little trouble on the way        strappi .     she said aloud .     it must have been him .  the little weasel ran into the cavalry and then snuck back to watch .  he was dar   damn well going through our packs out the back .  oh  come on     she added as they stared at her .     can you see wazzer stealing from anyone .  anyway  when did she have the chance .         wouldn   t they have taken him prisoner .     said tonker  staring at the crushed machine in wazzer   s shaking hands .      if he   d whipped off his shako and jacket he   d just be another stupid civilian  wouldn   t he .  or he could just say he was a deserter .  he could make up some story     said polly .     you know how he was with wazzer .  he went through my pack  too .  stole   something of mine .         what was it .     said shufti .      just something  okay .  he just wanted to   make trouble .      she watched them thinking .      sounds convincing     said maladict  nodding abruptly .     little weasel .  okay  wazz  just fish out the beans and i   ll do the best i can           t theres no b b b        maladict put a hand over his eyes .      no beans .     he said .     please  has anyone got the beans .      there was a general rummaging  and a general lack of a result .      no beans     moaned maladict .     he threw away the beans           come on  lads  we   ve got to get sentries posted     said jackrum  approaching .     sorted it all out  have you .         yes  sarge  ozz thinks       shufti began .      it was all a bit of mispacking  sarge .     said polly quickly  anxious to keep away from anything connected with missing ringlets .     nothing to worry about .  all sorted  sarge .  no problem .  nothing to worry anyone .  not   a   thing  sarge .      jackrum looked from the startled squad to polly  and back  and back again .  she felt his gaze bore into her  daring her to change her expression of mad  tense honesty .      ye es     he said slowly .     right .  sorted out  eh .  well done  perks .  attention .  officer present .         yes  yes  sergeant  thank you  but i don   t think we need to be too formal     said blouse  who looked rather pale .     a word with you when you have finished  if you please .  and i think we should bury the  er  bodies .      jackrum saluted .     right you are  sir .  two volunteers t    dig a grave for those poor souls .  goom and tewt   what   s he doing .      lofty was over by the blazing charcoal oven .  she was holding a burning branch a foot or two from her face  and turning it this way and that  watching the flames .      i   ll do it  sarge     said tonker  stepping beside wazzer .      what are you  married .     said jackrum .     you are on guard  halter .  i doubt whoever did it   ll come back  but if they do  you sing out  right .  you and igor come with me  and i   ll show you your stations .         no coffee     moaned maladict .      foul muck  anyway     said jackrum  walking away .     a cup of hot sweet tea is the soldier   s friend .      polly grabbed the kettle for blouse   s shaving water and hurried away .  that was another thing you learned in the milit   ry  look busy .  look busy and no one worried too much about what you were busy at .   bloody  bloody strappi .  he   d got her hair .  he   d try and use it against her if he could  that was certain .  that   d be his style .  what would he do now .  well  he   d want to keep away from jackrum  that   d be another certainty .  he   d wait  somewhere .  she   d have to  too .   the squad had made camp upwind of the smoke .  it was supposed to be a rest stop  since no one had got much sleep last night  but as jackrum handed out tasks  he reminded them     there is an old milit   ry saying  which is     hard luck for you .         there was no question of using the woven hut  but there were a few tarpaulin covered frames built to keep the coppiced wood dry .  those not given jobs to do lay down on the stacked piles of twigs  which were yielding and didn   t smell and were in any case better than the inhabited palliasses back at the barracks .   blouse  as an officer  had a shelter to himself .  polly had stacked bundles of twigs to make a chair that was at least springy .  now she laid out his shaving things and turned to go        could you shave me  perks .     said the lieutenant .   fortunately  polly   s back was turned and he didn   t see her expression .      this damn hand is quite swollen  i   m afraid     blouse went on .     i would not normally ask  but           yes  of course  sir     said polly  because there was no alternative .  well now  let   s see   she   d got quite good at scraping a blunt razor across a face bare of hair  yes .  oh  and she   d shaved a few dead pigs in the kitchens at the duchess  but that was only because nobody likes hairy bacon .  they didn   t real count  did they .  panic rose  and rose faster at the sight of jackrum approaching .  she was going to cut an officer   s throat in the presence of a sergeant .   well  when in doubt  bustle .  milit   ry rule .  bustle  and hope there   s a surprise attack .      are you not being a little strict with the men  sergeant .     said blouse  as polly flapped a towel around his neck .      not  sir .  keep    em occupied  that   s the bunny .  otherwise they   ll mope     said jackrum confidently .      yes  but they have just seen a couple of badly mutilated bodies     said blouse and shuddered .      good practice for    em  sir .  they   ll see plenty more .      polly turned to the shaving gear she   d laid out on a towel .  let   s see   cutthroat razor  oh dear  the gray stone for coarse sharpening  the red stone for fine sharpening  the soap  the brush  the bowl   well  at least she knew how to make foam        deserters  sergeant .  bad business     blouse went on .      you always get    em  sir .  that   s why the pay is always late .  walking away from three months back pay makes a man think twice .         mr .  de worde  the newspaper man  said there had been a great many desertions  sergeant .  it is very strange that so many men would desert from a winning side .      polly whirled the brush vigorously .  jackrum  for the first time since maladict had joined  looked uncomfortable .      but whose side   s he on  sir .     he said .      sergeant  i am sure you are not a stupid man     said blouse as  behind him  foam poured over the edge of the bowl and flopped onto the floor .     there are desperate deserters abroad .  our borders appear to be sufficiently unguarded that enemy cavalry operate forty miles inside    our fair country .     and high command appears to be so desperate  yes  desperate  sergeant  that even half a dozen untrained and  frankly  very young men must go to the front .      the foam had a life of its own now .  polly hesitated .      hot towel first  please  perks     said blouse .      yessir .  sorry  sir .  forgot  sir     said polly  panic rising .  she had a vague recollection of walking past the barber shop in munz .  hot towel on face .  right .   she grabbed a small towel  tipped boiling water onto it  wrung it out  and dropped it on the lieutenant   s face .  he did not actually scream  as such .      aaaaagh something else worries me  sergeant .         yessir .         the cavalry must have apprehended corporal strappi .  i cannot see how else they found out about our men .         good thinking  sir     said the sergeant  watching polly apply the lather across blouse   s mouth and nose .      i do hope they didn   t pff torture the poor man     said the lieutenant .  jackrum was silent on that issue  but meaningfully so .  polly wished he wouldn   t keep glancing at her .      but why would a deserter pff head straight for the pff front .     said blouse .      makes sense  sir  for an old soldier .  especially a political .         really .         trust me on that  sir     said jackrum .  behind blouse  polly brushed the razor up and down the red stone .  it was already as slick as ice .      but our boys  sergeant  are not old    soldiers .     it takes pff two weeks to turn a recruit into a    fighting man        said the lieutenant .      they   re promising material  sir .  i could do it in a couple of days  sir     said jackrum .     perks .      polly nearly sliced her thumb off .     yes  sarge     she quavered .      do you think you could kill a man today .      polly glanced at the razor .  the edge glowed .      i   m sorry to say i think i could  sir .         there you have it  sir     said jackrum with a lopsided grin .     there   s something about these lads  sir .  they   re quick .     he walked behind blouse  took the razor from polly   s grateful hand without a word  and said     there   s a few matters we ought to discuss  sir  private like .  i think perks here ought to get some rest .         of course  sergeant .     pas devant les soldat jeune     eh .         and them too  sir     said jackrum .     you   re dismissed  perks .      polly walked away  her right hand still trembling .  behind her  she heard blouse sigh and say     these are tricky times  sergeant .  command has never been so burdensome .  the great general tacticus says that in dangerous times the commander must be like the eagle and see the whole  and yet still be like the hawk and see every detail .         yessir     said jackrum  gliding the razor down a cheek .     and if he acts like a common tit  sir  he can hang upside down all day and eat fat bacon .         er   well said  sergeant .         the charcoal burner and his wife were buried to the accompaniment of  to polly   s lack of surprise  a small prayer from wazzer .  it asked the duchess to intercede with the god nuggan to give eternal rest and similar items to the departed .  polly had heard it many times before  she   d wondered how the process worked .   she   d never prayed since the day the bird burned  not even when her mother was dying .  a god that burned painted birds would not save a mother .  a god like that was not worth a prayer .   but wazzer prayed for everyone .  wazzer prayed like a child  eyes screwed up and hands clenched until they were white .  the reedy little voice trembled with such belief that polly felt embarrassed  and then ashamed  and  finally  after the ringing    amen     amazed that the world appeared no different than before .  for a minute or two  it had been a better place     there was a cat in the hut .  it cowered under the crude bed and spat at anyone who came close .      all the food   s been taken but there   s carrots and parsnips in a little garden down the hill a bit     shufti said as they walked away .      it   d be s stealing from the dead     said wazzer .      well  if they object they can hold on  can   t they .     said shufti .     they   re underground already .      for some reason that was  at this time  funny .  they   d have laughed at anything .   now there was jade  lofty  shufti  and polly .  everyone else was on guard duty .  they sat by a fire  on which a small pot seethed .  lofty tended the fire .  she always seemed more animated near a fire  polly noticed .      i   m doing horse scubbo for the rupert     said shufti  easily dropping into a slang learned all of twenty hours ago .     he specifically asked for it .  got lots of dry horse jerky from threeparts  but tonker says she can knock over some pheasants while she   s on duty .         i hope she spends some time watching for enemies too     said polly .      she   ll be careful     said lofty  prodding the fire with a stick .      you know  if we   re found out  we   ll be beaten and sent back     said shufti .      who by .     said polly so suddenly she surprised herself .     by whom .  who   s going to try  out here .  who cares out here .         well  er  wearing men   s clothes is an abomination unto nuggan           why .         it just is     said shufti firmly .  but              you   re wearing them     said polly .      well  it was the only way     said shufti .     and i tried them on and they didn   t seem all that abominable to me .         have you noticed men talk to you differently .     said lofty shyly .      talk .     said polly .     they listen to you differently  too .         they don   t keep looking at you all the time     said shufti .     you know what i mean .  you   re just a   another person .  if a girl walked down the street wearing a sword  a man would try to take it off her .         wi    trolls  we ain   t allowed to carry clubs     said jade .     only large rocks .  an    it ain   t right for a girl to wear lichen     cos der boys say bald is modest .  had to rub bird doin   s inna my head to grow this lot .      that was quite a long speech for a troll .      we didn   t know that     said polly .     er   trolls all look the same to us  more or less .         i   m nat   rally craggy     said jade .     i don   t see why i should polish .         there is a difference     said shufti .     i think it   s the socks .  it   s like they pull you forward all the time .  it   s like the whole world spins around your socks .      she sighed and looked at the horsemeat  which had been boiled almost white .      it   s done     she said .     you   d better go and give it to the rupert  polly   i mean  ozzer .  i told the sarge i could do something better but he said the lieutenant said how good it was last night        a small wild turkey  a brace of pheasants  and a couple of rabbits  all tied together  landed in front of shufti .      good job we were guarding you  eh .     said tonker  grinning and whirring an empty sling around in one hand .     one rock  one lunch .  maladict   s staying on guard  he said he   ll smell anyone before they see him and he   s too edgy to eat .  what can you do with that lot .         casserole of game     said shufti firmly .     we   ve got the veg and i   ve still got half an onion .   i   m sure i can make an oven out of one of those           on your feet .  attention .     snapped the silently moving jackrum behind them .   he stood back with a faint smile on his face as they scrambled to their feet .      private halter  i must have bleedin    amazin    eyesight     he said when they were approximately upright .      yes  sarge     said tonker  staring straight ahead .      can you guess why  private halter .         no  sarge .         it   s because i knows you are on perimeter guard  halter  but i can see you as clear as if you was standing right here in front of me  halter .  can   t i  halter .         yes  sarge .         it   s just as well you are still on perimeter duty  halter  because the penalty for absenting yourself from your post in time of war is death  halter .         i only           no    onlys    .  i don   t want to hear no    onlys    .  i don   t want you to think that i am a shouty man  halter .  corporal strappi was a shouty man  but he was a damn political .  upon my oath i am not a shouty man but if you ain   t back at your post inside of thirty seconds i   ll rip yer tongue out .      tonker fled .  sergeant jackrum cleared his throat and continued in a level voice      this  my lads  is what we call a real orientation lectchoor  not one of the fancy political ones like strappi gave yer .     he cleared his throat again .     the purpose of this lectchoor is to let you know where we are .  we are in the deep cack .  it couldn   t be worse if it was raining arseholes .  any questions .      since there were none from the bemused recruits  he continued  while beginning a slow stroll around the squad .      we know enemy forces are in the area .  currently they have no boots .  but there will be others  with boots aplenty .  also  there may be deserters in the area .  they will not be nice people .  they will be impolite .  therefore lieutenant blouse has decreed that we will travel off the roads and by night .  yes  we have met the enemy  and we have prevailed .  that was a fluke .  they weren   t expecting you to be rough  tough soldiers .  nor were you  so i don   t want you to feel cocky about it .     he leaned forward until his face was inches from polly   s .     are you feeling cocky  private perks .         no  sarge .         good .  good .     jackrum stepped back .     we are heading for the front  lads .  the war .  and in a nasty war  where   s the best place to be .  apart from on the moon  o   course .  no one .      slowly  jade raised a hand .      go on  then     said the sergeant .      in the army  sarge     said the troll .        cos       she began to count on her fingers .     one  you got weapons an    armor an    dat .  two  you are surrounded by other armed men .  er   many  youse gettin    paid and gettin    better grub than the people in civilian street .  er   lots  if   n you gives up  you getting taken pri   sner and dere   s rules about that like not kicking pris   ners inna head and stuff     cos if you kick their pris   ners inna head they   ll kick your pris   ners inna head so dat   s  like  you   re kickin    your own head  but there   s no rule say you can   t kick enemy civilians inna head .  there   s other stuff too  but i ran outa numbers .      she gave them a diamond grin .      we may be slow but we ain   t stoopid     she added .      i am impressed  private     said jackrum .     and you are right .  the only wasp in the jam is that you ain   t soldiers .  but i can help you there .  bein    a soldier is not hard .  if it was  soldiers would not be able to do it .  there is only three things you need to remember  which are  viz  one obey orders two give it to the enemy good and hard three don   t die .  got that .  right .  you   re nearly there .  well done .  i propose to assist you in the execution of all three .  you are my little lads and i will look after you .  in the meantime  you got duties .  shufti  get cooking .  private perks  see to the rupert .  and after that  practice your shaving .  i will now visit those on guard and deliver unto them the holy word .  dismissed .      they remained at something like attention until he was probably out of earshot  and then sagged .      why does he always shout .     said shufti .     i mean  he only has to ask        polly upended the horrible scubbo into a tin bowl  and almost ran to the lieutenant   s shelter .  he looked up from a map and smiled at her as if she was delivering a feast .      ah  scubbo     he said .      we are actually having other stuff  sir     polly volunteered .     i   m sure there   s enough to go around           good heavens  no  it   s been years since i   ve had food like this     said blouse  picking up the spoon .     of course  at school we didn   t appreciate it so much .         you had food like this at school  sir .     said polly .      yes .  most days     said blouse happily .   polly couldn   t quite fit this in her head .  blouse was a nob .  nobs ate nobby food  didn   t they .     had you done something bad  sir .         i can   t imagine what you mean  perks     said blouse  slurping at the horrible thin gruel .     are the men rested .         yes  sir .  the dead people were a bit of a shock           yes .  bad business     sighed the lieutenant .     such is war  alas .  i am only sorry you had to learn so fast .  such a terrible waste all the time .  i am sure things can be sorted out when we reach kneck  though .  no general can expect young men like yourselves to be instant soldiers .  i shall have something to say about that .      his rabbitty features looked unusually determined  as if a hamster had spotted a gap in its treadmill .      do you require me for anything else  sir .     said polly .      er   do the men talk about me  perks .         not really  sir  no .      the lieutenant looked disappointed .     oh .  oh  well .  thank you  perks .         polly wondered if jackrum ever slept .  she did a spell of guard duty  and he stepped out from behind her with    guess who  perks .  you   re on lookout .  you should see the dreadful enemy before they see you .  what   re the four s   s .         shape  shadow  silhouette  and shine  sarge .     said polly  snapping to attention .  she   d been expecting this .   that caused a moment   s pause from the sergeant before he said     just knew that  did yer .         nosir .  a little bird told me when we changed guard  sir .  said you   d asked him  sir .         oh  so jackrum   s little lads are gangin   up on their kindly ol    sergeant  are they .     said jackrum .      nosir .  sharing information important to the squad in a vital survival situation  sarge .         you   ve got a quick mouth on you  perks  i   ll grant you that .         thank you  sarge .         but i see you   re not standing in a bleedin    shadow  perks  nor have you done anything to change your bleedin    shape  you   re silhouetted against the bleedin    light  and your saber   s shining like a diamond in a chimney sweep   s bleedin    ear   ole .  explain .         it   s because of the one c  sarge .     said polly  still staring straight ahead .      and that is .         color  sarge .  i   m wearing bleedin    red and white in a bleedin    gray forest  sarge .      she risked a sideways glance .  in jackrum   s little piggy eyes there gleamed a gleam .  it was the one they had when he was secretly pleased .      ashamed of your lovely  lovely uniform  perks .     he said .      don   t want to be seen dead in it  sarge     said polly .      hah .  as you were  perks .      polly smiled  straight ahead .   when she came off guard for a bowl of game casserole  jackrum was teaching basic sword craft to lofty and tonker  using hazel sticks as swords .  by the time polly had finished  he was teaching wazzer some of the finer points of using a high performance pistol crossbow  especially the one about not turning around with it cocked and saying    w what is this bit for  sarge .     wazzer handled weapons like a houseproud woman disposing of a dead mouse   at arm   s length and trying not to look .  but even she was better with them than igor  who just didn   t seem at home with the idea of what was  to him  randomized surgery .   jade was dozing .  maladict was hanging by his knees under the roof of one of the sheds  with his arms folded across his chest  he must have been telling the truth when he said there were some aspects of being a vampire that were hard to give up .   igor and maladict     she still wasn   t sure about maladict  but igor had to be a boy  with those stitches around the head  and that face that could only be called homely .   he was quiet  and neat  but maybe that   s how igors behaved     she woke up with shufti shaking her .      we   re moving .  better go and see to the rupert .         what .  huh .  oh   right .      there was a bustle all around her .  polly staggered to her feet and hurried over to lieutenant blouse   s shed  where he was standing in front on his wretched horse and holding the bridle with a lost expression .      ah  perks     he said .     i   m not at all sure i   m doing this right           no  sir .  you   ve got the waffles twisted and the snoffles are upside down     said polly  who   d often helped in the inn   s yard .      ah  that would be why he was so difficult last night     said blouse .     i suppose i ought to know this sort of thing  but at home we had a man to do it           let me  sir     said polly .  she untwisted the bridle with a few careful movements .     what   s his name  sir .         thalacephalos     said blouse sheepishly .     that was the legendary stallion of general tacticus  you know .         i didn   t know that  sir     said polly .  she leaned back and glanced between the horse   s rear legs .  wow  blouse really was short sighted  wasn   t he     the mare looked at her partly with its eyes  which were small and evil  but mostly with its yellowing teeth  of which it had an enormous amount .  she had the impression that it was thinking about sniggering .      i   ll hold him for you while you mount  sir     she said .      thank you .  he certainly moves about a bit when i try .         i expect he does  sir     said polly .  she knew about difficult horses  this one had all the hallmarks of a right bastard  one of those not cowed at all by the obvious superiority of the human race .   the mare eyeballed and yellowtoothed her as blouse mounted  but polly had positioned herself carefully away from the uprights of the shelter .  thalacephalos wasn   t the sort to buck and kick .  she was the sneaky kind  polly could see  the sort that stepped on your foot     she moved her foot just as the hoof came down .  but thalacephalos  angry at being thwarted  turned  twisted  lowered her head  and bit polly sharply on the rolled up socks .      bad horse .     said blouse severely .     sorry about that  perks .  i think he   s anxious to get to the fray .  oh  my word .     he added  looking down .     are you all right  perks .         well  he   s pulling a bit  sir       said polly  being dragged sideways .  blouse had gone white again .      but he   s bitten   he   s caught you by the   right on the        the penny dropped .  polly looked down  and hastily remembered what she   d heard during numerous rule free bar fights .      oh   ooo   argh   blimey .  right inna fruit .  aargh .     she lamented  and then  since it seemed a good idea at the time  brought both fists down heavily on the mare   s nose .   the lieutenant fainted .      it took some time to bring blouse around  but at least it gave polly time to think .   he opened his eyes and focused on her .      er  you fell off your horse  sir     polly volunteered .      perks .  are you all right .  dear boy  he had you by the           only needs a few stitches  sir .     said polly cheerfully .      what .  from igor .         nosir .  just the cloth  sir     said polly .     the trousers are a bit big for me  sir .         ah  right .  too big  eh .  phew  eh .  near miss there  eh .  well  i mustn   t lie around here all day        the squad helped him onto thalacephalos  who was still sniggering unrepentantly .  on the subject of    too big     polly made a mental note to see about his jacket next time they stopped .  she wasn   t much good with a needle  but if igor couldn   t do something to make it look better then he wasn   t the man she thought he was .  and that was a sentence that begged a question .   jackrum bellowed them into order .  they were better at that now .  neater  too .      all right  ins and outs .  tonight we        a set of huge yellow teeth removed his cap .      oh  i do apologize  sergeant .     said blouse behind him  trying to rein back the mare .      no bother  sir  these things happen .     said jackrum  furiously tugging his hat back .      i should like to address my men  sergeant .         oh .  er   yes  sir     said jackrum  looking worried .     of course  sir .  ins and outs .  attenwaitforitshun .      blouse coughed .      er   men     he said .     as you know  we must make all speed to the kneck valley where  apparently  we are needed .  traveling by night will prevent   entanglements .  er   i        he stared at them  his face contorted by some inner struggle .      er   i have to say i don   t think we are   that is  all the evidence is   er   it doesn   t seem to me that   er   i think i should tell you   er           permission to speak  sir .     said polly .     are you feeling all right .         we just have to hope that those put in power over us are making right decisions     mumbled blouse .     but i have every confidence in you and i am sure you will do your best .  long live the duchess .  carry on  sergeant jackrum .         ins and outs .  form up .  march .      and they headed into the dusk and off to war .      about half an hour after the squad had left  the charcoal burners    cat ventured very cautiously back into the hut .  it liked the hut .  it got fed there .   it watched  with suspicion  a stub of candle that had been lit and put very carefully on a pile of straw and dried bracken between the makeshift beds .  its ears flattened as the shrinking candle flared and the waxy straw around it began to crackle .  by the time the hut was a mass of flame  the cat was on the other side of the clearing  moving fast .      the order of march was as last night  with maladict going on ahead .  the clouds were holding in some heat  and were thin enough to hint at moonlight here and there .  forests by night held no problems for polly  anyway  and this wasn   t true wild forest in any case .  nor was it  in truth  a march that they were doing .  it was more like a high speed creep  in ones and twos .   she   d acquired two of the horsebows  now stuck awkwardly between the straps of her pack .  they were horrible things  rather like a cross between a small crossbow and a clock .  there were mechanisms in the thick shaft  and the bow itself was barely six inches across  somehow  if you leaned your weight on it  you could cock it with enough stored energy to fire a nasty little metal arrow through an inch thick plank .  they were blued metal  sleek and evil .  but there is an old milit   ry say  better me firing it at you than you firing it at me  you bastard .   polly eased her way along the line until she was walking alongside igor .  he nodded to her in the gloom  and then turned his attention to walking .  he needed to  because his pack was twice the size of the rest of them .  no one felt inclined to ask him what was in it  sometimes  you thought you could hear liquid sloshing .   igors sometimes passed through munz  although technically they were an abomination in the eyes of nuggan .  it had seemed to polly that using bits of someone who was dead to help three or four other people stay alive was a sensible idea  but  in the pulpit  father jupe had argued that nuggan didn   t want people to live  he wanted them to live properly .  there had been general murmurs of agreement from the congregation  but polly knew for a fact that there were a couple of people sitting there with a hand or arm or leg that was a little less tanned or a little more hairy than the other one .  there were lumberjacks everywhere in the mountains .  accidents happened  fast  sudden accidents .  and  since there were not many jobs for a one armed lumberjack  men went off and found an igor to do what no amount of prayer could manage .   the igors had a motto  what goes around  comes around .  you didn   t have to pay them back .  you had to pay them forward  and that  frankly  was the bit where people got worried .  when you were dying  an igor would mysteriously arrive on the doorstep and request that he be allowed to take away any bits urgently needed by others on his    little litht .     he   d be quite happy to wait until the priest had gone  and  it was said  when the time came  he   d do very neat work .  however  it happened quite often that when an igor turned up  the prospective donor took fright and turned to nuggan  who liked whole people .   in which case the igor would quietly and politely leave and never come back .  he   d never come back to the whole village  or the whole lumber camp .  nor would other igors .  what goes around comes around   or stops .   as far as polly could tell  igors believed that the body was nothing more than a more complicated kind of clothing .  oddly enough  that   s what nugganites thought  too .      glad you joined  igor .     said polly as they jogged along .      yeth  ozz .         could you take a look at the rupert   s hand next time we stop  please .  he cut it badly .         yeth  ozz .         can i ask you something  igor .         yeth  ozz .         what   re female igors called  igor .      igor stumbled and kept moving .  he was silent for a while  and then said      all right  what did i do wrong .         sometimes you forget to lisp     said polly .     but mostly   it   s just a feeling .  little things about the way you move  maybe .         the word you   re looking for is    igorina        said igorina .     we don   t lisp as much as the boys .  it   s a style thing .      they continued in more silence until polly said     i thought it was bad enough cutting my hair           the stitches .     said igorina .     i can have them out in five minuteth .  they   re just for show .      polly hesitated .  but  after all  igors had to be trustworthy  didn   t they .      you didn   t cut your hair .         actually  i just removed it     said igorina .      i put mine in my pack     polly went on  trying not to look at the stitches around igorina   s head .      so did i     said igorina .     in a jar .  it   s thtill growing .      polly swallowed .  you needed a lack of graphic imagination to talk about personal issues with an igor .      mine was stolen back at the barracks .  i   m sure it was strappi     she said .      oh dear .         i hate to think of him with it .         why did you bring it .      and that was the question .  she   d planned  and she   d been good at planning .  she   d fooled the rest of them  even .  she   d been cool and sensible and she hadn   t felt more than a faint pang at cutting off her hair        and she   d brought it with her .  why .  she could have thrown it away .  it wasn   t magic .  it was just hair .  she could have thrown it away  just like that .  easily .  but   but   ah  right  the maids could have found it .  that was it .  she had to get it out of the house quickly .  right .  and then she could bury it somewhere when she was a long way away .  right .   but she hadn   t  had she     she   d been very busy .  right  said the little voice in inner treachery .  she had been very busy fooling everyone but herself  right .      what could strappi do .     said igorina .     jackrum   d knock him over the moment he thaw him .  he   s a deserter  and a thief .         yeas  but he could tell someone     said polly .      okay  then say it   s a lock of hair from the sweetheart you left behind you .  lots of soldiers carry a locket or something like that .  you know     her golden hair in ringleth fair     like the song says .         it was all my hair .  a locket .  you couldn   t hold it all in your hat .         ah     said igorina .     then you could thay you loved her very much .      despite everything  polly started to laugh  and couldn   t stop herself .  she bit her sleeve and tried to keep going  with her shoulders shaking .   something that felt like a small tree prodded her in the back .      youse two oughta keep der noise down     rumbled jade .      sorry .  sorry     hissed polly .   igorina started to hum .  polly knew the song .       i   m lonesome since i crossed the hill  and o   er the moor and valley       and she vowed  not that one  too .  one song is enough .  and i want to leave the girl behind me  but it seems i brought her with me instead     at which point they emerged from the trees and saw the red glow .   the rest of the squad were already gathered around  watching it .  it covered quite a lot of the horizon  and brightened and faded in places as they watched .      is that hell .     said wazzer .      no  but men have made it so  i fear     said the lieutenant .     that is the kneck valley .         it   s on fire  sir .     said polly .      bless you  that   s just the light of cooking fires reflected off the clouds     said sergeant jackrum .     always looks bad by night  a battlefield .  not to worry  lads .         what   re they cooking  elephants .     said maladict .      and what   s that .     said polly  pointing to a nearby hill  darker still against the night .  on it  a little light was flickering on and off  very fast .  there was a whoosh and a metallic    pop    as blouse pulled out a small telescope and opened it up .      it   s a light clacks  the devils .     he said .      dere   s another one over dere     rumbled jade  pointing to a hill a lot further away .     twinkle  twinkle .      polly stared at the redness in the sky  and then at the cold little light  winking on and off .  quiet  soft light .  harmless light .  and behind it  a burning sky        it   ll be in code     said blouse .     spies  i   ll be bound .         a light clacks .     said tonker .     what   s that .         an abomination in the eyes of nuggan     said blouse .     unfortunately  because they   d be damn useful if we could have    em too  eh  sergeant .         yessir     said jackrum automatically .      the only messages passing through the air should be the prayers of the faithful .  praise nuggan  praise the duchess  and so on and so forth     said blouse  squinting .  he sighed .     such a shame .  how far to that hill  would you say  sergeant .         two miles  sir     said jackrum .     worth trying to sneak up .         they must know people will see them and come looking  so i expect they won   t    hang around    for long     mused blouse .     in any case  ah  those things would be highly directional .  you   d lose it once you got down in the valley .         permission to speak  sir .     said polly .      of course     said blouse .      how do they get the light so bright  sir .  it   s pure white .         some kind of firework thingy  i believe .  why .         and they send messages with light .         yes  perks .  and your point is    .         and the people who get those messages send messages back the same way .     polly persevered .      yes  perks  that is the whole idea .         then   maybe we don   t have to go all the way to that hill  sir .  the light is being aimed towards us  sir .      they all turned .  the hill they were skirting loomed above them .      well done  perks .     blouse whispered .     let   s go  sergeant .     he swung himself off the horse  which automatically stepped sideways to make sure that he fell over when he landed .      right you are  sir .     said jackrum  helping him up .     maladict  you take goom and halter and circle round to the left  the rest go round to the right   not you  carborundum  no offense  but this has got to be quiet  okay .  you stay here .  perks  you come with me           i shall come too  sergeant     said blouse  and only polly saw jackrum grimace .      good idea  sir .     said the sergeant .     i suggest you   i suggest perks and i come with you .  everyone got that .  get to the top neat and quiet and no one  no one moves until you hear my signal           my signal     said blouse firmly .      that   s what i meant  sir .  quick and quiet .  hit    em hard but i want at least one left alive .  go .      the two teams fanned out to right and left and disappeared .  the sergeant gave them a minute or two   s start  and then set off with unusual speed for a man of his girth  so that for a moment polly and the lieutenant were left standing .   behind them  a dejected jade watched them go .   the trees thinned out on the steep slope  but not enough for much underbrush to get a hold .  polly found it easier to go on all fours  grabbing at tufts and saplings to steady herself .   after a while she caught a whiff of smoke  chemical and acrid .  she was sure  too  that she could hear a faint clicking noise .   a tree extended a hand and pulled her into its shadow .      don   t you say a bleedin    word     hissed jackrum .     where   s the rupert .         don   t know  sarge .         damn .  you can   t let a rupert run around loose  there   s no tellin    what he might take it into his little head to do  now he   s got the idea he   s in charge .  you   re    is minder .  find    im .      polly slithered back down the slope and found blouse steadying himself against a tree  wheezing gently .      ah   perks     he panted .     my asthma seems to   be   coming back           i   ll help you up  sir     said polly  grabbing his hand and tugging him forward .     could you wheeze a little quieter  sir .      by degrees  dragging and pushing  she bundled the man up to jackrum   s tree .      glad you could join us  sir .     hissed the sergeant  face contorted into an expression of maddened affability .     if you   d care to wait here  perks and me will crawl up the           i   m coming too  sergeant     blouse insisted .   jackrum hesitated .     yessir     he said .     but with respect  sir  i know about skirmishing           let   s go  sergeant     said blouse  dropping flat and beginning to drag himself forward .      yessir     muttered jackrum darkly .   polly eased her way forward  too .  the grass here was shorter  rabbit nibbled  with small bushes here and there .  she concentrated on keeping the noise down  and aimed for the clicking .   the smell of chemical smoke grew stronger .  it hung in the air around her .  and  as she moved forward  she saw light  little specks of it .  she raised her head .   there were three men a few feet away  silhouetted against the night .  one of them was holding a large pipe  about five feet long  balanced on his shoulder at one end and on a tripod at the other .  that end was aimed at the distant hill .  on the other end  a foot or so behind the man   s head  was a big square box .  light was leaking from joints in this  from a little stovepipe chimney on the top of it  heavy smoke poured out .      perks  on the count of three     said jackrum  on polly   s right .     one           as you were  sergeant     said blouse quietly  on her left .   polly saw jackrum   s big florid face turn with an expression of astonishment .      sir .         hold position     said blouse .  above them  the clicking continued .   milit   ry secrets  thought polly .  spies .  enemies .  and we   re just watching .  it was like seeing blood drain from an artery .      sir .     hissed jackrum  rage smoking off him .      hold position  sergeant .  that is an order     said blouse calmly .   jackrum subsided  but only into the deceptive calm of a volcano waiting to explode .   the relentless chatter of the clacks went on .  it seemed to go on forever .  beside polly  sergeant jackrum seethed and fretted like a dog on a leash .   the clicking stopped .  polly heard a distant murmur of conversation .      sergeant jackrum     whispered blouse     you may    get them    with all speed .      jackrum exploded out of the grass like a partridge .      all right  my lads .  up  boys  and at    em .      polly   s first thought  as she leaped up and ran  was that the distance was suddenly a lot wider than it had appeared .   all three men had turned at the sound of jackrum   s cry .  the one with the clacks tube was already dropping it and reaching for a sword  but jackrum was bearing down on him like a landslide .  the man made the mistake of standing his ground .  there was a brief clash of swords and then a melee  and sergeant jackrum was a sufficiently deadly melee all by himself .   the second man flew past polly but she was running for the third one .  he backed away from her  reaching up to his mouth  then turned to run and found himself face to face with maladict .      don   t let him swallow .     polly yelled .   maladict   s arm shot up and lifted the struggling man aloft by his throat .   it would have been a perfect operation had not the rest of the squad arrived  having put all their effort into running and leaving none to spare for slowing down .  there were collisions .   maladict went down as his captive kicked him in the chest  and the man tried to scramble away  cannoning into tonker .  polly leaped over igorina  was almost tripped by a fallen wazzer  and threw herself desperately toward the quarry  now on his knees .   he had a dagger out and waved it wildly in front of her while he grasped his throat with his other hand and made choking noises .   she knocked the knife away  ran behind him  and slapped him on the back as hard as she could .  he fell forward .   before she could grab him  a hand lifted him bodily and jackrum   s voice roared     can   t have the poor man chokin    to death  perks .      his other hand punched the man in the stomach with a noise like meat hitting a slab .   the man   s eyes crossed and something large and white flew out of his mouth and shot over jackrum   s shoulder .   jackrum dropped him and turned on blouse .      sir  i protest  sir .     he said  quivering with anger .     we lay there and watched these devils sending who knows what messages  sir .  spies  sir .  we could   ve got    em right there and then  sir .         and then  sergeant .     said blouse .      what .         don   t you think the people they were talking to would wonder what had happened if the messages had stopped in midflow .     said the lieutenant .      even so  sir           whereas now we have their device  sergeant  and their masters don   t know we have it     said blouse .      yeah  well  but you said they was sending messages in code  sir  and           er  i think we have their cypher book as well  sarge     said maladict  stepping forward with the white object in his hand .     that man tried to eat it  sarge .  rice paper .  but he rushed his food  you might say .         and you dislodged it  sergeant  and probably saved his life .  well done .     said blouse .      but one of    em got away  sir     said jackrum .     he   ll soon get to           sergeant .      jade was rising over the grass .  as she plodded nearer  they saw she was dragging a man by one foot .  when she got closer  it became obvious that the man was dead .  living people have more head .      i heard the shoutin    and he come runnin    and i jumped up and he come straight into me  headfirst .     jade complained .     i didn   t even get a chance to hit him .         well  private  at least we can definitely say he was stopped     said blouse .      thir  thith man is dying     said igorina  who was kneeling by the man sergeant jackrum had so positively saved from choking .     he hath been poithoned .         hath he .  by whom .     said blouse .     are you sure .         the green foam coming out of hith mouth ith a definite clue  thir .         what   s funny  private maladict .     said blouse .   the vampire chuckled .     oh  sorry  sir .  they say to spies     if you   re caught  eat the documents     don   t they .  a good way of making sure they don   t give away any secrets .         but you   ve got the   soggy book in your hands  private .         vampires can   t be poisoned that easily  sir     said maladict calmly .      it wath probably only fatal by mouth in any case  thir     said igorina .     terrible stuff .  thtuff .  he   th dead  thir .  nothing i can do .         poor fellow .  well  we have the codes  anyway     said blouse .     this is a great discovery  men .         and a prisoner  sir  and a prisoner     said jackrum .   the one surviving man  who had been operating the clacks  groaned and tried to move .      a bit bruised  i expect     jackrum added with some satisfaction .     when i land on someone  sir  they stay landed on .         two of you  bring him with us     said blouse .     sergeant  there   s a few hours to dawn  and i want to be well away from here .  i want the other two buried somewhere down in the woods  and           you just have to say    carry on  sergeant     sir     said jackrum  and it was almost a wail .     that   s how it works  sir .  you tell me what you want  i give    em the orders .         times are changing  sergeant     said blouse .      messages  flying across the sky .  they were an abomination unto nuggan .   the logic sounded impeccable to polly as she helped wazzer to dig two graves .  prayers from the faithful ascended unto nuggan  going upwards .  a variety of unseen things  such as sanctity and grace and a list of this week   s abominations  descended from nuggan to the faithful  going downwards .  what was forbidden was messages from one human to another going  as it were  sideways .  there could be collisions .  if you believe in nuggan  that is .  if you believed in prayer .   wazzer   s real name was alice  she confided as she dug  but it was hard to apply the name to a small  stick thin lad with a bad haircut and not much skill with a shovel  who had a habit of standing just slightly too close to you and stared just slightly to the left of your face when she talked to you .  wazzer believed in prayer .  she believed in everything .  that made her kind of   awkward to talk to  if you didn   t .  but polly felt she should make the effort .      how old are you  wazz .     she said  shoveling dirt .      n n nineteen  polly     said wazzer .      why   d you join .         the duchess told me to     said wazzer .   that was why people didn   t talk to wazzer much .      wazz  you do know that wearing men   s clothes is an abomination  don   t you .         thank you for reminding me  polly     said wazzer without a trace of irony .     but the duchess told me that nothing i do will be held abominable in pursuit of my quest .         a quest  eh     said polly  trying to sound jovial .     and what kind of quest is that .         i am to take command of the army     said wazzer .   hairs rose on the back of polly   s neck .      yes .     she said .      yes  the duchess stepped out of her picture when i was asleep and she told me to go at once to kneck     said wazzer .     the little mother spoke to me  ozz .  she commanded me .  she guides my steps .  she led me out of vile slavery .  how can that be an abomination .      she   s got a sword  thought polly .  and a shovel .  this needs careful handling .      that   s nice     she said .      and   and i must tell you that   i   never in my life have i felt such love and camaraderie     wazzer went on earnestly .     these few days have been the happiest of my life .  you have all shown me such kindness  such gentleness .  the little mother guides me .  she guides us all  ozz .  you believe that  too .  don   t you .      the moonlight revealed the tracks of tears in the grime on wazzer   s cheeks .      um     said polly and sought wildly for a way to avoid lying .  she found it .     er   you know i want to find paul .     she said .      yes  and that does you credit  the duchess knows     said wazzer quickly .      yes  well   yes  i   m also doing it for the duchess     said polly  feeling wretched .     i think about the duchess all the time  i must admit .     well  that was true .  it just wasn   t honest .      i   m so very glad to hear that  ozz  because i had thought you were a backslider     said wazzer .     but you said that with such conviction .  perhaps this would be the time for us to get down on our knees and           wazz  you   re standing in another man   s grave     said polly .     there   s a time and place  you know .  let   s get back to the others  eh .      the happiest days of her life had been spent tramping through forests  digging graves  and trying to dodge soldiers on both sides .  and the trouble with polly was that she had a mind that asked questions even when she really  really didn   t want to know the answers .      so   the duchess is still talking to you  is she .     she said as they made their way among the dark trees .      oh  yes .  when we were in plotz  sleeping in the barracks     said wazzer .     she said it was all working .      don   t  don   t ask another question  said part of polly   s mind  but she ignored it out of sheer horrible curiosity .  wazzer was nice   well  sort of nice  in as lightly scary way   but talking to her was like picking at a scab  you knew what was likely to be under the crust  but you picked anyway .      so   what did you used to do back in the world .     she said .   wazzer gave her a haunting smile .     i used to be beaten .         tea was brewing in a small hollow near the track .  several of the squad were standing guard .  no one liked the idea of men in dark clothes sneaking round .      mug of saloop .     said shufti  holding one up .  a few days ago  they   d have called it    sweet milky tea     but even if they couldn   t walk the walk yet they were determined to talk the talk as soon as possible .      what   s happening .     said polly .      dunno     said shufti .     sarge and the rupert went off over that way with the prisoner  but no one tells us groans anything .         it   s    grunts     i think     said wazzer  taking the tea .      i   ve done them a couple of mugs  anyway .  see what you can find out  eh .      polly gulped her tea down  grabbed the mugs  and hurried away .   on the edge of the hollow  maladict was lounging against a tree .  there was this about vampires  they could never look scruffy .  instead  they were   what was the word   dishabille .  it meant untidy  but with bags and bags of style .  in this case  maladict   s jacket was open and he   d stuck his packet of cigarettes in the band of his shako .  he saluted her with his crossbow as she went past .      ozz .     he said .      yes  corp .         any coffee in their packs .         sorry  corp .  only tea .         damn .     maladict thumped the tree behind him .     hey  you went straight for the man who was swallowing the cypher .  straight for him .  how come .         just luck     said polly .      yeah  right .  try again .  i have very good night vision .         oh  all right .  well  the one on the left started to run  and the one in the middle was dropping the clacks tube and reaching for his sword  but the one on the right thought that putting something into this mouth was more important even than fighting or running away .  satisfied .         you worked out all that in a couple of seconds .  that was smart .         yeah  right .  now please forget it  okay .  i don   t want to be noticed .  i don   t particularly want to be here .  i just want to find my brother .  okay .         fine .  i just thought that you   d like to know someone saw you .  and you   d better get that tea to    em before they try to kill one another .      at least i was someone watching the enemy  polly thought furiously as she walked away .  i wasn   t someone watching another soldier .  who does he think he is .  or she is .   she heard the raised voices as she pushed through a thicket .      you can   t torture an unarmed man .     that was blouse   s voice .      well  i   m not waiting for him to arm himself  sir .  he knows stuff .  and he   s a spy .         don   t you dare kick him in the ribs again .  that is an order  sergeant .             asking nicely didn   t work  did it  sir .     pretty please with sprinkles on top    is not a recognized method of interrogation .  you shouldn   t be here  sir .  you should say     sergeant  find out what you can from the prisoner .     and then go somewhere and wait until i tell you what i got out of him  sir .         you did it again .         what .  what .         you kicked him again .         no  i didn   t .         sergeant  i gave you an order .         and .         tea   s up .     said polly cheerfully .   both men turned .  their expression changed .  if they had been birds  their feathers would have gently settled back .      ah  perks     said blouse .     well done .         yeah   good lad     said sergeant jackrum .   polly   s presence seemed to lower the temperature .  the two men drank their tea and eyed one another warily .      you   ll have noticed  sergeant  that the men were wearing the dark green uniform of the first battalion of the zlobenian fifty ninth bowmen .  a skirmishing battalion     said blouse with cold politeness .     that is not the uniform of a spy  sergeant .         yessir .  but they   d let their uniforms get very dirty  then .  no shine on the buttons  sir .         patrolling behind enemy lines is not spying  sergeant .  you must have done it in your time .         more times that you could count  sir     said jackrum .     and i knew full well that if i got caught i was due a good kicking in the nadgers .  but skirmishers is the worst  sir .  you think you   re safe in the lines  next moment it turns out that some bastard sitting in the bushes on a hill had been working out windage and yardage and has dropped an arrow right through your mate   s head .     he picked up a strange looking longbow .      see these things they   ve got .  burleigh and strongin thearm no .    recurved  made in bloody ankh morpork .  a real killing weapon .  i say we give him a choice  sir .  he can tell us what he knows  and go out easy .  or keep mum  and go out hard .         no  sergeant .  he is an enemy officer taken in battle and entitled to fair treatment .         no  sir .  he   s a sergeant  and they don   t deserve no respect at all  sir .  i should know .  they   re cunning and artful  if they   re any good .  i wouldn   t mind if he was an officer  sir .  but sergeants are clever .      there was a grunt from the bound prisoner .      loosen his gag  perks     said blouse .  instinctively  even if the instinct was only a couple of days old  polly glanced at jackrum .  the sergeant shrugged .   she pulled the rag down .      i   ll talk     said the prisoner  spitting out cotton fluff .     but not to that tub of lard .  i   ll talk to the officer .  you keep that man away from me .         you   re in no position to negotiate  soldier boy .     snarled jackrum .      sergeant     said the lieutenant     i   m sure you have things to see to .  please do so .  send a couple of men back here .  he can   t do anything against four of us .         but           that was another order  sergeant     said blouse .  he turned to the prisoner as jackrum stumped off .     what is your name  man .         sergeant towering  lieutenant .  and if you are a sensible man  you will release me and surrender .         surrender .     said blouse  as igorina and wazzer ran into the clearing  armed and bewildered .      yep .  i   ll put in a good word for you when the boys catch up with us .  you don   t want to know how many men are looking for you .  could i have a drink  please .         what .  oh  yes .  of course     said blouse as if caught out in a display of bad manners .     perks  fetch some tea for the sergeant .  why are people looking for us  pray .      towering gave him a cockeyed grin .     you don   t know .         no     said blouse coldly .      you really don   t know .     now towering was laughing .  he was far too relaxed for a bound man  and blouse sounded far too much like a nice but worried man trying to appear firm and determined .  to polly  it was like watching a child bluffing in poker against a man called doc .      i don   t wish to play games  man .  out with it .     he said .      everyone knows about you  lieutenant .  you   re the monstrous regiment  you are .     he said .     no offense meant  of course .  they say you   ve got a troll and a vampire and an igor and a werewolf .  they say you       he began to chuckle       they say you overpowered prince heinrich and his guard and stole his boots and made him hop away in the altogether .      in a thicket  some way off  a nightingale sang .  for quite a while  uninterrupted .   then blouse said     hah  no  you are in fact wrong .  the man was captain horentz           yeah  right  like he   d tell you who he was with you pointing swords at him .     said towering .     i heard from one of my mates that one of you kicked him in the meat and two veg  but i haven   t seen the picture yet .         someone took a picture of him getting kicked .     squeaked polly  drenched in a sudden horror .      not of that  no .  but there   s copies all over the place of him in chains and i hear it   s been sent by the clacks to ankh morpork .         is   is he annoyed .     polly quavered  cursing otto chriek and his picture making .      well  now  let me see     said towering sarcastically .     annoyed .  no  i shouldn   t think he   s annoyed .     livid    is the word  i think .  or    raging    .  yeah  i think    raging    is the word .  there   s a lot of people looking for you lads now .  well done .      even blouse could see polly   s distress .      er   perks     he said .     it was you  wasn   t it  who        over and over  in polly   s head  the words ogodikickedtheprinceinthefruitandveg .  were going around and around like a hamster in a runaway treadmill until  suddenly  it ran up against something solid .      yessir     she snapped .     he was forcing himself upon a young woman  sir .  if you recall .      blouse   s frown faded and became a grin of childlike duplicity .     ah  yes  indeed .  he was    pressing his suit    in no small way  was he not .         he didn   t have ironing in mind  sir .     said polly fervently .   towering looked up at wazzer  grimly clutching a crossbow that polly knew for a fact she was scared of  and igorina  who   d much rather be holding a surgeon   s knife than the saber in her hand .  polly saw his brief smile .      and there you have it  sergeant towering     said the lieutenant  turning to the prisoner .     of course  we all know there is some atrocious behavior in times of war  but it is not the sort of thing we would expect of a royal prince .   if we are to be pursued because a gallant young soldier prevented matters from becoming even more disgusting  then so be it .         now i am impressed     said towering .     a real knight errant  eh .  he   s a credit to you  lieutenant .  any chance of that tea .      blouse   s skinny chest visibly swelled at the compliment .      yes  perks  the tea  if you would be so good .      leaving the three of you with this man who   s positively radiating an intention to escape  polly thought .      could perhaps private goom go and fetch       she began .      a word in private  perks .     snapped blouse .  he drew her closer  but polly kept her eye on sergeant towering .  he might be bound hand and foot  but she wouldn   t have trusted a man who grinned like that if he   d been nailed to the ceiling .      perks  you are making a great contribution but i really will not have my orders continually questioned     said blouse .     you are my batman  after all .  i think i run a    happy ship    here  but i will be obeyed .  please .      it was like being savaged by a goldfish  but she had to admit he had a point .      er   sorry  sir     said polly  backing away as long as possible so as not to miss the end of the tragedy .  then she turned and ran .   jackrum was sitting by the fire  with the prisoner   s bow across his huge knees  and slicing some sort of black sausage with a big clasp knife .  he was chewing .      where   s the rest of us  sir .     said polly  scrabbling for amug .      i sent    em to scout a wide perimeter  perks .  can   t be too careful if matey boy   s got pals out there .         which was perfectly sensible .  it just happened to mean that half the squad had been sent away        sarge  you know that captain back at the barracks .  that was           i   ve got good hearing  perks .  kicked him in the royal prerogative  eh .  hah .  make it all more interestin     eh .         it   s going to go wrong  sarge  i just know it     said polly  dragging the kettle off the hob and spilling half the water as she topped up the teapot .      d   you chew at all  perks .     said jackrum .      what  sarge .     said polly distractedly .   the sergeant held out a small piece of sticky  black   stuff .      tobacco .  chewing tobacco     said jackrum .     i favor blackheart to jolly sailor     cos it   s rum dipped  but others say           sarge  that man   s going to escape  sarge .  i know he is .  the lieutenant isn   t in charge  he is .  he   s all friendly and everything  but i can tell by his eyes  sarge .         i   m sure lieutenant blouse knows what he   s doing  perks     he said primly .     you   re not telling me a bound man can overcome four of you  are you .         oh  sugar .     said polly .      just down there  in the old black tin     said jackrum .  polly tipped some into the worst cup of tea ever made by a serving soldier and ran back to the clearing .   amazing  the man was still in a sitting position  and still bound hand and foot .  her fellow cheesemongers were watching him warily .  polly relaxed  but only a little .         nd there you have it  lieutenant     he was saying .     no disgrace in calling it quits  eh .  he   ll hunt you down soon enough     cos it   s personal now .  but if you were to come along with me  i   d do my best to see it goes easy with you .  you don   t want to get caught by the heavy dragoons right now .  they ain   t got much of a sense of humor           tea   s up     said polly .      oh  thank you  perks     said blouse dejectedly .     i think we can at least cut sergeant towering   s hands free  don   t you .         yes  sir     said polly  meaning    no  sir .     the man offered his bound wrists  and polly reached out gingerly with her knife while holding the mug like a weapon .      artful lad you   ve got here  lieutenant     said towering .     he reckons i   m going to grab his knife off of him .  good lad .      polly sliced the rope  brought her knife hand back quickly  and then carefully proffered the mug .      and he   s made the tea lukewarm so   s it won   t hurt when i splashes it in his face     towering went on .  he gave polly the steady  honest gaze of the born bastard .   polly held it  lie for lie .      oh  yeah .  the ankh morpork people   ve got a little printing press on a cart  over on the other side of the river     said towering  still watching polly .     for morale  they say .  and they sent the picture back to the city  too  on the clacks .  don   t ask me how .  oh yeah  a good picture .     plucky rookies trounce zlobenia   s finest     they wrote .  funny thing  but it looks like the writer man didn   t spot it was the prince .  but we all did .      his voice became even more friendly .     now look  mates  as a foot soldier like yourselves  i   m all for seeing the bloody donkey boys made to look fools  so you come along with me and i   ll see to it that at least you don   t sleep in chains tomorrow .  that   s my best offer .     he took a sip of tea  and added     it   s a better one than most of the tenth got  i   ll tell you .  i heard your regiment got wiped out .      polly   s expression didn   t change  but she felt herself curl up into a tiny ball behind it .  look at the eyes  look at the eyes .  liar .  liar .      wiped out .     said blouse .   towering dropped his mug of tea .  he smacked the crossbow out of wazzer   s grip with his left hand  grabbed the saber from igorina with his right hand  and brought the curved blade down on the rope between his legs .  it happened fast  before any of them could quite focus on the change in the situation  and then the sergeant was on his feet  slapping blouse across the face and grabbing him in an armlock .      and you were right  kiddo     he said to polly  over blouse   s shoulder .     cryin    shame you ain   t an officer  eh .      the last of the fallen tea dribbled into the soil .  polly reached slowly for her crossbow .      don   t .  one step  one move from any of you  and i   ll cut him     said the sergeant .     won   t be the first officer i   ve killed  believe me           the difference between them and me is  i don   t care .      five heads turned .  there was jackrum  outlined against the distant firelight .  he had the man   s own bow  drawn taut  and aimed directly at the sergeant in complete disregard of the fact that the lieutenant   s head was in the way .  blouse closed his eyes .      you   d shoot your own officer .     said towering .      yep .  won   t be the first officer i   ve killed  neither     said jackrum .     you ain   t going nowhere  friend  except down .  easy or hard   i don   t care .     the bow creaked .      you   re just bluffing  mister .         upon my oath  i am not a bluffing man .  i don   t think we was ever introduced  by the way .  jackrum   s the name .      the change in the man was a whole body event .  he seemed to get smaller  as if every cell had said    oh dear    very quietly to itself .  he sagged  and blouse slumped a little .      can i           too late     said jackrum .   polly never forgot the sound the arrow made .   jackrum laid the bow aside carefully .     found out who he was messing with     he said as if nothing much had happened .     shame  really .  seemed like a decent sort .  any saloop left  perks .      there was silence  and then a thump as towering   s body finally overbalanced and hit the ground .   very slowly  lieutenant blouse raised his hand to his ear  which the arrow had perforated en route to its target  and then looked with strange detachment at the blood on his fingers .      oh  sorry about that  sir     said jackrum jovially .     just saw the one chance and i thought  well  it   s the fleshy part .  get yourself a gold earring  sir  and you   ll be the height of fashion .  quite a large gold earring  maybe .         don   t you all believe that stuff about the ins and outs     jackrum went on .     that was just lies .  so what we do now is   can anyone tell me what we do now .         er   bury the body .     hazarded igorina .      yeah  but check his boots .  he   s got small feet and the zlobenians have much better boots than us .         steal the boots off a dead man  sarge .     said wazzer  still in shock .      easier that getting    em off a live one .      jackrum softened his voice a little when he saw their expressions .     lads  this is war  understand .  he was a soldier  they were soldiers  you are soldiers   more or less .  no soldier will see grub or good boots go to waste .  bury    em decent and say what prayers you can remember  and hope they   ve gone where there   s no fighting .     he raised his voice back to the normal bellow .     perks  round up the others .  igor  cover the fire  try to make it look like we were never here .  we are moving out in number ten minutes .  can make a few miles before full daylight .  that   s right  eh  lieutenant .      blouse was still transfixed  but seemed to wake up now .      what .  oh .  yes .  right .  yes  indeed .  er   yes .  carry on  sergeant .      the fire gleamed off jackrum   s triumphal face .  in the red glow  his little dark eyes were like holes in space  his grinning mouth the gateway to a hell  his bulk some monster from the abyss .   he let it happen  polly knew .  he obeyed orders .  he didn   t do anything wrong .  but he could have sent maladict and jade to help us  instead of wazzer and igorina  who aren   t quick with weapons .  he sent the others away .  he had the bow ready .  he played a game with us as pieces  and won     poor old soldier .  her father and his friends had sung while frost formed on the window panes .  poor old soldier .  if ever i    list for a soldier again   the devil shall be my sergeant .   in the firelight  the grin of sergeant jackrum was a crescent of blood  his coat the color of a battlefield sky .      you are my little lads     he roared .     and i will look after you .         they made more than six miles before jackrum called a halt  and already the land was changing .  there were more rocks  fewer trees .  the kneck valley was rich and fertile and it was from here that the fertility had been washed  it was a land cape of ravines and thick scrub woodland  with a few small communities scratching a living from the poverty stricken soil .   it was a good place to hide .  and  in here  someone had already hidden .  it was a stream carved gully  but  at the end of summer  the stream here was just a trickle between the rocks .  jackrum must have found it by smell  because you couldn   t see it from the track .   the ashes of the fire in the small gully were still warm .  the sergeant got up  awkwardly  after inspecting them .      some lads like our pals from last night     he said .      couldn   t it just be a hunter  sarge .     said maladict .      it could  corporal  but it ain   t     said jackrum .     i brought you in here    cos it looks like a blind gully and there   s water and there   s good vantages points up there and over there     he pointed     and there   s a decent overhang to keep the weather off and it   s hard for anyone to creep up on us .  milit   ry  in other words .  and someone else thought the same as me last night .  so while they   re out there looking for us  we   ll sit snug here  where they   ve already looked .  get a couple of lads up on guard right now .      polly drew first watch  atop the small cliff at the edge of the gully .  it was a good site  no doubt about it .  a regiment could hide here .  no one could get near without being seen  too .  and she was pulling her weight like a proper member of the squad  so  with any luck  blouse would find someone else to shave him before she was off duty .   through a gap in the treetops below she could see a road of sorts running though the woodland .  she kept an eye on it .   eventually  tonker relieved her with a cup of soup .  on the far side of the gully  wazzer was being replaced by lofty .      where   re you from  ozz .     said tonker  while polly savored the soup .   there couldn   t be any harm in telling .     munz     said polly .      really .  someone said you worked in a bar .  what was the inn called .      ah   there was the harm  right there .  but she could hardly lie  now .      the duchess     she said .      that big place .  very nobby .  did they treat you okay .         what .  oh   yes .  yes .  pretty fair .         hit you at all .         eh .  no .  never     said polly  nervous of where this was going .      work you hard .      polly had to consider this .  in truth  she worked harder than both maids  and they at least had an afternoon off every week .      i was usually the first one up and the last one to bed  if that   s what you mean     she said .  and  to change the subject quickly  she went on     what about you .  you know munz .         we both lived there  me and tilda   i mean lofty     said tonker .      oh .  whereabouts .         the girls    working school     said tonker and looked away .   and that   s the kind of trap small talk can get you in  polly thought .      not a nice place  i think     she said  feeling stupid .      it was not a nice place  yes .  a very nasty place     said tonker .     wazzer was there  we think .  we think it was her .  used to be sent out a lot on work hire .     polly nodded .  once  a girl from the school came and worked as a maid at the duchess .  she   d arrive every morning  scrubbed raw in a clean pinafore  peeling off from a line of very similar girls led by a teacher and flanked by a couple of large men with long sticks .  she was skinny  polite in a dull  trained sort of way  worked very hard and never talked to anybody .  she was gone in three months  and polly never found out why .   tonker stared into polly   s eyes  almost mocking her innocence .     we think she was the one they used to lock up sometimes in the special room .  that   s the thing about the school .  if you don   t toughen up you go funny in the head .         i expect you were glad to leave     was all polly could say .      the basement window was unlocked     said tonker .     but i promised tilda we   d go back one day next summer .         oh  so it wasn   t that bad  then .     said polly  grateful for some relief .      no  it   ll burn better     said tonker .     ever run across someone called father jupe .         oh  yes     said polly  and  feeling that something more was expected of her  added     he used to come to dinner when my mother   he used to come to dinner .  a bit pompous  but he seemed okay .         yes     said tonker .     he was good at seeming .      once again there was a dark chasm in the conversation that not even a troll could bridge  and all you could do was draw back from the edge .      i   d better go and see to the lieu   to the rupert     polly said  standing up .     thank you very much for the soup .      she worked her way down through the scree and birch thickets until she emerged by the little stream that ran through the gully .   and there  like some awful river god  was sergeant jackrum .   his red coat  a tent for lesser men  was draped carefully over a bush .  he himself was sitting on a rock with his shirt off and his huge suspenders dangling  so that only a yellowing woolen undershirt saved the world from a sight of the man   s bare chest .  for some reason  though  he   d kept his shako on .   his shaving kit  with a razor like a small machete and a shaving brush you could use to hang wallpaper  was on the rock beside him .   jackrum was bathing his feet in the stream .  he glanced up when polly approached  and nodded amiably .         morning  perks     he said .     don   t rush .  never rush for ruperts .  sit down for a spell .  get yer boots off .  let yer feet feel the fresh air .  look after your feet  and your feet will look after you .     he pulled out his big clasp knife and the rope of chewing tobacco .     sure you won   t join me .         no thanks  sarge .     polly sat down on a rock on the opposite side of the stream  which was only a few feet wide  and started to tug at her boots .  she felt as though she   d been given an order .  besides  right now she felt she needed the shock of clean  cold water .      good lad .  filthy habit .  worse   n the smokes     said jackrum  carving off a lump .     got started on it when i was but a lad .  better   n striking a light at night  see .  don   t want to give away your position .     course  you gotta gob a bundle every so often  but gobbin    in the dark don   t show up .      polly dabbled her feet .  the icy water did indeed feel refreshing .  it seemed to jolt her alive .  in the trees around the gully  birds sang .      say it  perks     said jackrum  after a while .      say what  sarge .         oh  bleedin    hell  perks  it   s a nice day  don   t muck me around .  i seen the way you   ve been looking at me .         all right  sarge .  you murdered that man last night .         really .  prove it     said jackrum calmly .      well  i can   t  can i .  but you set it up .  you even sent igor and wazzer to guard him .  they   re not good with weapons .         how good would they have to be  d   you think .  four of you against a man tied up .     said jackrum .     nah .  that sergeant was dead the moment we got    im  and he knew it .  it took a bloody genius like your rupert to make him think he   s got a chance .  we   re out in the woods  lad .  what was blouse gonna do with him .  who   d we hand him over to .  would the lieutenant cart him around with us .  or tie him to a tree and leave him to kick wolves away until he gets too tired .  much more gentlemanly than giving him a quiet cigarette and a swift chop where you go quick  which is what he was expecting and what i   d have given him .      jackrum popped the tobacco into his mouth .     you know what most of the milit   ry training is  perks .     he went on .     all that yelling from little spitbubs like strappi .  it   s to turn you into a man who will  on the word of command  stick his blade into some poor sod just like him who happens to be wearing the wrong uniform .  he   s like you  you   re like him .  he doesn   t really want to kill you  you don   t really want to kill him .  but if you don   t kill him first  he   ll kill you .  that   s the start and finish of it .  it don   t come easy without trainin    .  ruperts don   t get that trainin        cos they are gentlemen .  well  upon my oath  i am no gentleman  and i   ll kill when i have to  and i said i   d keep you safe and no damn rupert   s going to stop me .  he gave me my discharge papers .     jackrum added  radiating indignance .     me .  and expected me to thank him .  every other rupert i   ve served under has had the sense to write    not posted here    or    on extended patrol    or something and shove it back in the mail  but not him .         what was it you said to corporal strappi that made him run away .     said polly before she could stop herself .   jackrum looked at her for a while  with no expression in his eyes .  then he gave a strange little chuckle .      now why would a little lad like you say a little thing like that .     he said .      because he just vanished and suddenly some old rule means you   re back on the strength  sarge     said polly .     that   s why i said that little thing .         hah .  and there   s no such rule  either  not like that one     said jackrum  splashing his feet .     but ruperts never read the book of rules unless they   re trying to find a reason to hang you  so i was safe there .  strappi was scared shitless  you know that .         yes  but he could have slipped away later on     said polly .     he wasn   t stupid .  rushing off into the night .  he must   ve had something real close to run from  right .         cor  that   s an evil brain you have there  perks     said jackrum happily .  once again polly had the definite feeling that jackrum was enjoying this  just as he   d seemed pleased when she   d argued about the uniform .  he wasn   t a bully like strappi   he treated igorina and wazzer with something approaching fatherly concern   but with polly and maladict and tonker he pushed all the time  wanting you to push back .      it does the job  sarge     she said .      i just had a little tate ah tate with him  as it were .  quiet  like .  explained all the nasty things that can happen vees ah vee the confusion o    war .         like being found with his throat cut .     said polly .      has been known to happen     said jackrum innocently .     you know  lad  you   re going to make a damn good sergeant one day .  any fool can use his eyes and ears  but you uses that brain to connect    em up .         i   m not going to be a sergeant .  i   m going to get the job done and go home .     said polly vehemently .      yes  i said that once  too     grinned jackrum .     perks  i don   t need no clacky thing .  i don   t need newsy paper .  sergeant jackrum knows what   s going on .  he talks to them men coming back  the ones that won   t talk to anyone else .  i know more than the rupert  for all that he gets little letters from hq that worry him so much .  everyone talks to sergeant jackrum .  and in his big fat head  sergeant jackrum puts it all together .  sergeant jackrum knows what   s going on .         and what   s that  sarge .     said polly innocently .   jackrum didn   t reply immediately .  instead  he reached down with a grunt and rubbed one of his feet .  the corroded shilling on a string  which had lain innocently on the woolen undershirt  swung forward .  but there was something else .  for a moment  something golden slipped out of the undershirt   s open neck .  something oval and golden  on a golden chain  flashed in the sunlight .  then he straightened up and it was dragged back out of sight .      this is a bloody odd war  lad     he said .     it   s true there   s not just zlobenian soldiers out there .  lads say there is uniforms they   d never seen before .  we   ve kicked a lot of backsides over the years  so maybe they really have ganged up and it   s gonna be our turn .  but what i reckon is  they   re stuck .  they took the keep .  oh  yes  i know .  but they   ve got to hold on to it .  and winter   s coming home and all those lads from ankh morpork and everywhere are a long way from home .  we might have a chance yet .  hah  especially now the prince is dead set on finding the young soldier that kneed him in the wedding tackle .  that means he   s angry .  he   ll make mistakes .         well  sarge  i think           i   m glad you do  private perks     said jackrum  suddenly becoming a sergeant again .     and i think that after you   ve seen to the rupert and had a nap  you and me is going to show the lads some swordsmanship .  whatever bleedin    war this is  sooner or later young wazzer is going to have to use that blade he waggles about .  get going .      polly found lieutenant blouse sitting with his back to the cliff  eating scubbo out of a bowl .  igorina was packing away her medical kit  and blouse   s ear was bandaged .      everything all right  sir .     she said .     sorry i wasn   t           i quite understand  perks  you must stand your turn like the other    lads        said blouse  and polly heard the quotes clank into place .     i had a refreshing nap  and the bleeding and  indeed  the shaking has quite stopped .  however   i do still need a shave .         you want me to shave you     said polly  her heart sinking .      i must set an example  perks  but i have to say  you    lads    make such an effort it puts me to shame .  you all seem to have faces    as smooth as a baby   s bottom     i must say .         yes  sir .     polly pulled out the shaving gear and walked over to the fire  where the kettle was permanently boiling .  most of the squad was dozing  but maladict was sitting cross legged by the fire  doing something to his hat .      heard about the prisoner last night     he said  without looking up .     i don   t think the el tee is going to last very long  what do you think .         the who .         the lieutenant .  from what i hear  blouse   s probably going to have a nasty accident .  jackrum thinks he   s dangerous .         he   s learning  just like us .         yes  but the el tee   s supposed to know what to do .  do you think he does .         jackrum   s stuck  too     said polly  topping up the kettle with cold water .     i think we just keep going .         if there   s anything there to get to     said maladict .  he held up the shako .     what do you think .      the words born to die had been chalked on the side of the hat  next to the packet of cigarettes .      very   individual     said polly .     why do you smoke .  it   s not very   vampire  really .         well  i   m not supposed to be very vampire     said maladict  lighting up with a shaking hand .     it   s the sucking .  i need it .  i   m on edge .  i   m getting the no coffee jitters .  i   m not good with woods in any case .         but you   re a vam           yeah  yeah  if this was crypts  no problem  but i keep thinking i   m surrounded by lots of pointy stakes .  truth is   i   m beginning to hurt .  it   s like going cold bat all over again .  i   m getting the voices and the sweats           shssh     said polly  as shufti grunted in her sleep .     you can   t be     she hissed .     you said you   d been going straight for two years .         oh  bl   blur   blood .     said maladict .     who said anything about blood .  i   m talking about coffee  dammit .         we   ve got plenty of tea       polly began .      you don   t understand .  this is about   craving .  you never stop craving  you just switch it to something that doesn   t cause people to turn you into a short kebab .  i need coffee .      why me .  polly thought .  do i have this little sign on me saying    tell me your troubles    .      i   ll see what i can do     she said and hastily filled the shaving mug .   polly hurried back with the water  ushered blouse to a rock  and stirred up some foam .  she sharpened the razor  taking as long as she dared .  when he coughed impatiently  she took up position  raised the razor  and prayed        but not to nuggan .  never to nuggan  since her mother died     and then lofty was running across the ground  trying to shout a whisper .      movement .      blouse nearly lost another earlobe .   out from nowhere came jackrum  boots on but suspenders dangling .  he grabbed lofty by the shoulder and swung her around .      where .     he demanded .      there   s a track down there .  troopers .  carts .  what do we do  sarge .         we keep the noise down .     muttered jackrum .     are they heading up here .         no  they went right past  sarge .      jackrum turned and gave the rest of the squad a satisfied look .      o kay .  corporal  take carborundum and perks and go and take a look .  the rest of you  tool up and try to be brave .  eh  lieutenant .      blouse bemusedly dabbed foam off his face .      what .  oh .  yes .  see to it  sergeant .      twenty seconds later  polly was running after maladict  down the slope .  here and there the bottom of a valley could be seen through the trees  and as she glanced down  she saw sunlight flash off something metal .  at least the trees had coated the woodland floor with a thick layer of needles  and  contrary to popular opinion  most woods aren   t littered with branches that snap loudly .   they reached the edge of the woods  where bushes fought one another for their place in the sun  and found a spot with a view .   there were only four troopers  in an unfamiliar uniform  riding in pairs ahead and behind a cart .  it was small  and had a canvas cover .      what   s in a little cart that four men have to protect .     said maladict .     it must be valuable .      polly pointed to the huge flag that hung limply from a pole on the wagon .      i think it   s the newspaper man     she said .     it   s the same cart .  same flag  too .         then it   s a good thing they   ve gone right past     hissed maladict .     let   s just see them out of sight and creep away like good little mice  okay .      the party was traveling at the speed of the cart and  at this point  the two riders in the lead stopped and turned in their saddles  waiting for it to catch up .  then one of them pointed back  past the hidden watchers .  there was a shout  too far away to be understood .  the troopers in the rear trotted up to the cart  met with their comrades  and all four turned to look up .  there was some discussion  and two riders trotted back along the road .      oh  darn     said polly .     what have they spotted .      the horsemen went past their hiding place .  a few moments latter  they heard the horses enter the woods .      do we run an    get    em .     said jade .      let jackrum do that     said maladict .      but if he does  and the men don   t come back       polly began .      when they don   t come back     maladict corrected her .         then those other two will get suspicious  won   t they .  one will probably stay here  the other will go to get help .         then we   ll sneak up and wait     said maladict .     look  they   ve dismounted .  the cart   s pulled in  too .  if they look as though they   re worried  we   ll move in .         and do what  exactly .     said polly .      threaten to shoot them     said maladict firmly .      and if they don   t believe us .         then we   ll threaten to shoot them in a much louder voice     said maladict .     happy .  and i hope to hell they   ve got some coffee .         there are three things a soldier wants to do when there   s a respite on the road .  one involves lighting a cigarette  one involves lighting a fire  and the other one involves no flames at all but does  generally  require a tree .    the two troopers had a fire going and a billycan steaming  when a young man jumped down from the cart  stretched his arms  looked around  yawned  and sauntered a little way into the forest .   he found a convenient tree and  a moment later  was apparently examining the bark at eye height with studied enthusiasm .   the tip of a steel crossbow bolt pressed against the back of his neck  and a voice said     raise you hands and turn around slowly .         what  right now .         um   all right  no .  you can finish what you   re doing .         actually i think that   s going to be quite impossible .  let me just  er   right .  okay .     the man raised his hands again .     you realize i just have to shout .         so .     said polly .     i just have to pull this trigger .  shall we have a race .      the man turned around .      see .     said polly  stepping back .     it   s him again .  de worde .  the writer man .         you   re them .     he said .      dem who .     said jade .      oh dear     said maladict .      look  i   d give anything to talk to you .     said de worde .     please .         you   re with the enemy .     hissed polly .      what .  them .  no .  they   re from lord rust   s regiment .  from ankh morpork .  they   ve been sent to protect us .         troops to protect you in borogravia .     said maladict .     who from .         you mean from whom .  er   well   you  in theory .      jade leaned down .     efficient  aren   t dey           look  i must talk to you     said the man urgently .     this is astounding .  everyone   s looking for you .  did you kill that old couple in the woods .      birds sang .  far off  there was the call of the female blue capped woodpecker .      a patrol found the fresh graves     said de worde .   high above  an ice heron  a winter migrant from the hub  gave an ugly honk as it searched for lakes .      i take it you didn   t  then     said de worde .      we buried them     said maladict coldly .     we don   t know who killed them .         we did take some vegetables     said polly .  she remembered laughing about it .  admittedly  it was only because it was that or start crying  but even so        you   ve been living off the land .     he   d tugged a notebook out of his pocket and was scribbling in it with a pencil .      we don   t have to talk to you     said maladict .      no  no  you must .  there   s so much you need to know .  you   re in the   ups and downs  right .         ins and outs     said polly .      and you       the man began .      i   ve had enough of this     said maladict and marched away from the tree and into the clearing .  the two cavalrymen looked up from their fire  and there was a moment of immobility before one reached for his sword .   maladict swung the bow quickly from one to the other  its point hypnotizing them like a swinging watch .     i   ve got only one shot but there   s two of you     he said .     who shall i shoot .  you chose .  now  listen very carefully  where   s your coffee .  you   ve got coffee  haven   t you .  c   mon  everyone   s got coffee .  spill the beans .      they stared at the crossbow and slowly shook their heads .      what about you  writer man .     snarled maladict .     where   re you hiding the coffee .         we only have cocoa     said the writer  raising his hands quickly as maladict turned on him .     you   re welcome to        maladict dropped his crossbow  which fired straight up into the air   and sat down with his head in his hands .      we   re all gonna die     he said .  the troopers shifted as though to stand up  and jade raised her sapling .      don   t even fink about it     she said .   polly turned to the writer man .     you want us to talk to you  sir .  then you talk to us .  is this about   prince heinrich   s   socks .      maladict stood up in one mad movement .     i say we grease the lot of them and go home .     he said to no one in particular .     one  two  three .  what we are fighting for .         socks .     said the writer  looking nervously at the vampire .     what   ve socks got to do with it .         i just gave you an order  polly     said maladict .      what is it you think we don   t know .     polly insisted  glaring at de worde .      well  to start with  you   re just about all that   s left of the ins and outs           that   s not true .         oh  there   s prisoners and wounded  i think .  but why should i lie to you .  why did he call you polly .         because i know a lot about birds     said polly  mentally cursing .     how do you know what   s been happening to the regiment .         because it   s my job to know things     said the man .     what   s that bird up there .      polly glanced up .     i don   t have time for stupid games     she said .     and that   s a        she stopped .  something was wheeling high above  in the forbidden blue .      you don   t know .     said de worde .      yes  of course i know     said polly irritably .     it   s a white necked buzzard .  but i thought they never came this far into the mountains .  i only ever saw one in a book       she raised her bow again  and tried to take control .     am i right  mr .  it   s my job to know things .      de worde raised his hands again and gave her a sickly smile .     probably     he said .     i live in a city .  i know sparrows from starlings .  after that  everything   s a duck  as far as i   m concerned .      polly glared at him .      look  please     said the man .     you need to listen to me .  you need to know things .  before it   s too late .      polly lowered the bow .      if you want to talk to us  wait here     she said .     corporal  we are leaving .  carborundum  pick up those troopers .         hold it     said maladict .     who   s the corporal in this squad .         you are     said polly .     and you   re drooling  and swaying  and your eyes look weird .  so what was your point  please .      maladict considered this .  polly was tired and frightened  and  somewhere inside  this was all being transmuted into anger .  hers was not an expression you wanted to see at the far end of a crossbow .  an arrow couldn   t kill a vampire  but that didn   t mean it didn   t hurt .      right  yeah     he said .     carborundum  pick up those troopers .  we are leaving .         there was a bird whistle as polly neared the hiding place .  she identified this one as the sound of the very bad bird impersonator  and made a note to teach the girls some bird calls that at least sounded real .  they were harder to do than most people thought .   the squad were in the gully  armed and at at least looking dangerous .  there was a certain amount of relaxation when they saw jade carrying the two bound troopers .   two more were sitting disconsolately against the cliff  hands tied behind them .   maladict walked smartly up to blouse and saluted .      two prisoners  el tee  and perks thinks there   s someone down there you ought to talk to .     he leaned forward .     the newspaper man  sir .         then we   ll jolly well keep well away from him  then     said blouse .     eh  sergeant .         right  sir .     said jackrum .     nothing but trouble  sir .      polly saluted madly .     please  sir .  permission to speak  sir .         yes  perks .     said blouse .   polly saw there was one chance  and one only .  she had to find out about paul .  now her mind worked as fast as it had on the hill last night  when she   d gone for the man with the code book .      sir  i don   t know if he   s worth talking to  sir  but he may be worth listening to .  even if you think he   ll only tell us lies .  because sometimes  sir  the way people tell you lies  if they tell you enough lies  well  they sort of   show you what shape the truth is  sir .  and we don   t have to tell him the truth  sir .  we could lie to him  too .         i am not by nature an untruthful man  perks     said blouse coldly .      glad to hear it  sir .  are we winning the war  sir .         you stop that right now  perks .     jackrum roared .      it was only a question  sarge     said polly reproachfully .   around the clearing the squad waited  ears sucking up every sound .  everyone knew the answer .  they waited for it to be said aloud .      perks  this kind of talk spreads despondency     blouse began  but he said it as if he didn   t believe it and didn   t care who knew .      no  sir .  it doesn   t really .  it   s better than being lied to     said polly .  she changed her voice  gave it that edge her mother used to use on her when she was being scolded .     it   s evil to lie .  no one likes a liar .  tell me the truth  please .      some harmonic of that must had found a home in an old part of blouse   s brain .  as jackrum opened his mouth to roar  the lieutenant held up a hand .      we are not winning  perks .  but we have not lost yet .         i think we all know that  sir  but it   s good to hear you say it     said polly  giving him an encouraging smile .   that seemed to work  too .     i suppose there is no harm in at least being civil to the wretched fellow     said blouse  as if thinking aloud .     he may give away valuable information under cunning questioning .      polly looked at sergeant jackrum  who was staring upwards like a man in prayer .      permission to be the man to interrogate the gentleman  sir     said the sergeant .      permission denied  sergeant     said blouse .     i   d like him to live and don   t want to lose another lobe .  however  you may take perks back to the cart and drive it up here .      jackrum gave him the smart salute .  polly had already learned to recognize it  it meant that jackrum had already made plans .      very good  sir     he said .     come on  perks .      jackrum was quiet as they walked back down over the needle carpeted slope .  then  after a while  he said     d   you know why them troopers found our little nook  perks .         no  sarge .         the lieutenant ordered shufti to put the fire out immediately .  there wasn   t as if there was even any smoke .  so shufti goes and pours the kettle on it .      polly gave this a few seconds    thought .      steam  sarge .         right .  in a bloody great rising cloud .  not shufti   s fault .  the gallopers weren   t any trouble  though .  bright enough not to try to outrun half a dozen crossbows  at least .  that   s clever  for a cavalryman .         well done  sarge .         don   t talk to me as if i was rupert  lad     said jackrum easily .      sorry  sarge .         i see you   re learnin    how to steer an officer  though .  you gotta make sure they gives you the right orders  see .  you   ll make a good sergeant  perks .         don   t want to  sarge .         yeah  right     said jackrum .  it could have meant anything .   after watching the track for a minute or two they stepped out and headed toward the cart .  de worde was sitting on a stool beside it  writing in a notebook  but he stood up hurriedly when he saw them .      it   d be a good idea to get off the track     he said as soon as they approached .     there are a lot of patrols  i understand .         zlobenian patrols  sir .     said jackrum .      yes .  in theory  this       he pointed to the flag that hung limply from the cart      should keep us safe  but everyone   s a bit jumpy at the moment .  aren   t you sergeant jack ram .         jackrum  sir .  and i   ll thank you for not writing my name down in your little book  sir .         sorry  sergeant  but that   s my job     said de worde breezily .     i have to write things down .         well  sir  soldierin    is my job     said jackrum  climbing onto the cart and gathering up the reins .     but you   ll note how at this moment in time i am not killin    you .  let   s go  eh .      polly climbed into the back of the cart as it lumbered off .  it was full of boxes and equipment  and while it may once have been neatly organized  that organization was now but a distant memory  a clear indication that this cart was the property of a man .  next to her  half a dozen of the largest pigeons she had ever seen dozed on a perch in their wire cage  and she wondered if they were a living larder .  one of them opened one eye and lazily went    lollollop .     which is pigeon for    duh .      most of the rest of the boxes had labels like   she leaned closer      capt .  horace calumney   s patent field biscuits     and    dried stew .     as she was musing that shufti would have very much liked to get her hands on one or two of these boxes  a bundle of clothes hanging from the ceiling of the rocking cart moved slightly and a face appeared .      good mornink     it said  upside down .   william de worde turned around on the seat in front .      it   s only otto  private     he said .     don   t be afraid .         yes  i vill not bite     said the face cheerfully .  it smiled .  a vampire   s face does not look any better upside down  and a smile in these circumstances does nothing to improve matters .     that is guaranteed .      polly lowered the crossbow .  jackrum would have been impressed at how quickly she had raised it .  so was she  and embarrassed too .  the socks were doing the thinking again .   otto very elegantly lowered himself to the bed of the cart .      vere are ve goink .     he said  steadying himself as they bounced over a rut .      a little place i know  sir     said jackrum .     nice and quiet .         goot  i need to exercise the imps     said the vampire .     zey get fretful if they are cooped up for too long .     otto pushed aside a stack of paper and revealed his large picture making box .  he lifted a small hatch .      rise und shine  lads     he said .  there was a chorus of high pitched voices from inside .      i   d better just give you the heads up re tiger  mr .  de worde     said jackrum as the cart rolled up an old logging track .      tiger .  who   s tiger .         oops     said jackrum .     sorry  that   s what we call the lieutenant  sir  on account of him being so brave .  forget i said that  will you .         brave  is he .     said de worde .      and clever  sir .  don   t let him fool you  sir .  he is one of the great milit   ry minds of his generation  sir .      polly   s mouth dropped open .  she   d suggested they lie to the man  but   this .      really .  then why is he just a lieutenant .     said the writer .      ah  i can see there   s no fooling you  sir     said jackrum  oozing knowingness .     yes  it   s a puzzler  sir  why he calls himself a lieutenant .  still  i daresay he has his reasons  eh .  just like heinrich calling himself a captain  right .     he tapped the side of his nose .     i see everything  sir  and i don   t say a word .         all i could find out was that he did some kind of desk job at your hq  sergeant     said de worde .  polly saw him taking his notebook out  slowly and carefully .      yes  i expect that   s what you would find out  sir     said jackrum with a huge conspiratorial wink .     and then  when things are at their worst  they let him out  sir .  they unleash him  sir .  me  i don   t know a thing  sir .         what does he do  explode .     said de worde .      haha  nice one  sir .     said jackrum .     no  sir .  what he does  sir  is assess situations  sir .  i don   t understand it myself  sir  not being a big thinker  but the proof of the pudding  sir  is in the eating of same  and last night we were jumped by eight   twenty zlobenian troopers  sir  and the lieutenant just assessed the situation in a flash and skewered five of the buggers  sir .  like a kebab  sir .  mild as milk to look at  but rouse him and he   s a whirlwind of death .  of course  you did not hear it from me  sir .         and he   s in charge of a bunch of recruits  sergeant .     said de worde .     that doesn   t sound very likely to me .         recruits who captured some crack cavalrymen  sir     said jackrum  looking pained .     that   s leadership for you .  comes the hour  comes the man  sir .  i   m just a simple old soldier  sir  seen    em come and seen    em go .  upon my oath  i am not a lying man  sir  but i look at lieutenant blouse in wonderment .         he just seemed confused  to me     said de worde  but there was a hint of uncertainty in his voice .      that was a bit of concussion  sir .  he took a wallop that would have felled a lesser man  and still got back onto his feet .  amazing  sir .         hmm     said de worde  making a note .   the cart splashed across the shallow little stream and rocked into the gully .   lieutenant blouse was sitting on a rock .  he   d made an effort  but his tunic was grubby  his boots were muddy  his hand was swollen  and one ear  despite igorina   s attentions  was still inflamed .  he had his sword on his knees .   jackrum carefully brought the cart to a halt by a thicket of birch trees .  all four of the enemy troopers were tied up against the cliff .  apart from them  the camp appeared to be deserted .      where are the rest of the men  sergeant .     whispered de worde  as he slid down off the cart .      oh  they   re around  sir     said jackrum .     watching you .  probably not a good idea to make any sudden moves  sir .      no one else was visible   and then maladict faded into view .   people never really looked at things  polly knew .  they glanced .  and what had been a patch of scrub was now corporal maladict .  polly stared .  he   d cut a hole in the center of his old blanket  and the mud and grass stains on the mildewed grayness had turned him into part of the landscape until he   d saluted .  he   d also stuck leafy twigs all over his hat .   sergeant jackrum goggled .  polly had never really seen proper goggling before  but the sergeant had the face to do it at a championship level .  she could feel him drawing breath while at the same time assembling cusswords for a right royal thundering   and then he remembered he was playing sergeant big jolly fat man  and this was not the time to segue into sergeant incandescent .      lads  eh .     he chuckled to de worde .     what will they think of next .      de worde nodded nervously  pulled a wad of newspapers from under his seat  and advanced on the lieutenant .      mr .  de worde  isn   t it .     said blouse  standing up .     perks  can we manage a cup of  er     saloop    for mr .  de worde .  there   s a good chap .  do take a rock  sir .         good of you to see me  lieutenant     said de worde .     it looks as though you   ve been in the wars .     he added with an attempt at joviality .      no  only this one     said blouse  looking puzzled .      i meant that you have been wounded  sir     said de worde .      these .  oh  they   re nothing  sir .  i   m afraid the one on my hand was self inflicted .  sword drill  you know .         you   re left handed then  sir .         oh  no .      polly  washing out a mug  heard jackrum say out of the corner of his mouth     should   ve seen the other two fellows  sir .         are you aware of the progress of the war  lieutenant .     said de worde .      you tell me  sir     said blouse .      all your army is bottled up in the kneck valley .  dug in  mostly  just beyond the reach of the keep   s weaponry .  your forts elsewhere along the border have been captured .  the garrisons at drerp and glitz and arblatt have been overwhelmed .  as far as i can tell  lieutenant  your squad are the only soldiers still at large .  at least     he added     the only ones still fighting .         and my regiment .     said blouse quietly .      the remnant of the tenth took part in a brave but  frankly  suicidal attempt to retake kneck keep a few days ago  sir .  most of the survivors are prisoners of war  and i have to tell you that almost all your high command have been captured .  they were in the keep when it was taken .  there are big dungeons in that fort  sir  and they   re pretty full .         why should i believe you .      i do  thought polly .  so paul is either dead  wounded  or captured .  and it doesn   t help much to think of it as two chances in three that he is alive .   de worde threw his newspapers at the lieutenant   s feet .      it   s all there  sir .  i didn   t make it up .  it   s the truth .  it will remain true whether you believe it or not .  there are more than six countries ranged against you  including genua and mouldavia and ankh morpork .  there is no one on your side .  you are alone .  the only reason you   re not beaten yet is because you won   t admit it .  i   ve seen your generals  sir .  great leaders  and your men fight like demons  but they won   t surrender .         borogravia doesn   t know the meaning of the word    surrender     mr .  de worde     said the lieutenant .      may i loan you a dictionary  sir .     snapped de worde  going red in the face .     it   s very similar to the meaning of the word    making some kind of peace while you   ve got a chance     sir .  it   s rather like the word    quitting while you   ve still got a head     sir .  good heavens  sir  don   t you understand .  the reason that there still is an army in kneck valley is that the allies haven   t yet decided what to do with it .  they   re fed up with the slaughter .         ah  so we still fight back .     said blouse .   de worde sighed .      you don   t understand  sir .  they are fed up with slaughtering you .  they   ve got the keep now .  there   s some big war engines up there .  they   frankly  sir  some of the alliance would just as soon wipe out the remains of your army .  it   d be like shooting rats in a barrel .  they have you at their mercy .  and yet you keep on attacking .  you attack the keep .  it   s on sheer rock and it   s got walls a hundred feet high .  you make salients across the river .  you   re bottled up and you   ve got nowhere to go and the allies could simply massacre you any time they want  and you act as if you   re just facing some kind of temporary setback .  that   s what   s really happening  lieutenant .  you are just a last little detail .         have a care  please     blouse warned .      excuse me  sir  but do you know anything about recent history .  in the past thirty years you have declared war on every single one of your neighbors at least once .  all countries fight  but you brawl .  and then last year you invaded zlobenia again .         they invaded us  mr .  de worde .         you have been misinformed  lieutenant .  you invaded the kneck province .         that was confirmed as borogravian by the treaty of lint  more than a hundred years ago .         signed at swordpoint  sir .  and no one cares now  in any case .  it   s all got beyond your stupid little royal scuffles .  because your men tore down the grand trunk  you see .  the clacks towers .  and tore up the coach road .  ankh morpork regards that as bandit activity .         have a care  i said .     said blouse .     i note you are displaying the ankh morpork flag with evident pride on your wagon .         civis morporkias sum  sir .  i am an ankh morpork citizen .  you could say that ankh morpork shelters me under her wide and rather greasy wing  although  i agree  the metaphor could use some work .         your ankh morpork soldiers aren   t in a position to protect you  however .         sir  you are right .  you could have me killed right now     said de worde simply .     you know that .  i know that .  but you won   t  for three reasons .  the officers of borogravia tend towards honor .  everyone says that .  that   s why they don   t surrender .  and i bleed most distressingly .  and you don   t need to  because everyone   s interested in you .  suddenly  it   s all changed .         interested in us .         sir  in a sense you could help a lot right now .  apparently  people back in ankh morpork were amazed when   look  have you heard about what we call    human interest     sir .         no .      de worde tried to explain .  blouse listened with his mouth open and  at the end  said      have i got this right .  although many people have been killed and wounded in this wretched war  it   s not been of much    interest    to your readers .  but it is now  just because of us .  because of a little skirmish in a town they   ve never heard of .  and because of it  we   re suddenly a    plucky little country    and people are telling your newspaper that your great city should be on our side .         yes  lieutenant .  we put out a second edition last night  you see .  after i   d found out that    captain horentz    was really prince heinrich .  did you know this at the time  sir .         of course not .     snapped blouse .      and you  private  er  perks  would you have kicked him in the   would you have kicked him had you known .      polly dropped a mug in her nervousness  and looked at blouse .      you may answer  of course  perks     said the lieutenant .      well  yes  sir .  i would have kicked him .  harder  probably .  i was defending myself  sir     polly said  carefully avoiding further details .  you couldn   t be sure what someone like de worde would do with them .      right  good  yes .     said de worde .     then you might be pleased with this .  our cartoonist fizz drew this for the special edition .  it was on the front page .  we   ve sold a record number of copies .      he handed her a flimsy piece of paper  which  by the look of the creases  had been folded many times .   it was a line drawing  with lots of shading .  it showed a huge figure with a large sword  a monstrous monocle  and a moustache as wide as a coat hanger  menacing a much smaller figure armed with nothing more than an instrument for lifting beets   in fact  there was a beet stuck on the end of it .  at least  that was clearly what had been happening right up to the point when the smaller figure  wearing not a bad attempt at an ins and outs shako and a face that slightly looked like polly   s  had kicked the other one squarely in the groinal regions .   a sort of balloon was coming out of polly   s mouth  containing the words     that for your royal prerogative  you blaggard .     the balloon issuing from the mouth of the ogre  who could only be prince heinrich  said     oh my succession .  that such a small thing could hurt so much .      and in the background  a fat woman in a rumpled ball gown and a huge old fashioned helmet was clasping her hands to an unbelievably large bosom  staring at the fight with a mixture of concern and admiration  and ballooning     oh  my swain .  i fear our liaison is cut short .      since no one else was saying much  but was simply staring  de worde said  rather nervously     fizz is rather  er  direct in these matters  but amazingly popular .  ahem .  you see  the curious thing is that although ankh morpork is probably the biggest bully around  in a subtle kind of way  we nevertheless have a soft spot for people who stand up to bullies .  especially royal ones .  we tend to be on their side  provided it doesn   t cost us too much .      blouse cleared his throat .      it   s quite a good likeness of you  perks     he said hoarsely .      i only used my knee  sir .     polly protested .     and that fat lady certainly wasn   t there .         that   s morporkia     said de worde .     she   s a sort of representation of the city  except that  in her case  she   s not covered in mud and soot .         and i have to add  for my part     said blouse in his talking to a meeting voice     that borogravia is in fact larger than zlobenia  although most of the country is little more than barren mountainside           that doesn   t actually matter     said de worde .      it doesn   t .     said blouse .      no  sir .  it   s just a fact .  it   s not politics .  in politics  sir  pictures like this are powerful .  sir  even the alliance commanders are talking about you  and the zlobenians are angry and bewildered .  if you  the heroes of the hour  could make a plea for a little common sense        the lieutenant took a long  deep breath .      this is a foolish war  mr .  de worde .  but i am a soldier .  i have    kissed the duchess     as we say .  it   s an oath of loyalty .  don   t tempt me to break it .  i must fight for my country .  we will repel all invaders .  if there are deserters  we will find them and rally them again .  we know the country .  while we are free  borogravia will be free .  you have    had your say .     thank you .  where is that tea  perks .         what .  oh  nearly done  sir .     said polly  turning back to the fire .   it had been a sudden strange fancy  but a stupid plan .  now  out here  all the drawbacks were visible .  how would she have got paul home .  would he have wanted to come .  could she have managed it .  even if he was still alive  how could she hope to get him out of a prison .      so you   ll be guerrilla fighters  eh .     said mr .  de worde  behind her .     madmen  all of you .         no  we are not irregulars     said blouse .     we kissed the duchess .  we are soldiers .         oh  well     said de worde .     then i admire your spirit  at least .  ah  otto        the vampire iconographer ambled up  and gave them a shy smile .      do not be afraid  i am a black ribboner  just like your corporal     he said .     light is mine passion now .         oh .  er   well done     said blouse .      take the pictures  otto     said de worde .     these gentlemen have a war to fight .         out of interest  mr .  de worde        blouse interrupted     how did you get the pictures back to your city so quickly .  magic  i assume .         what .     de worde looked momentarily off balance .     oh no  sir .  wizards are expensive and commander vimes has said that there is going to be no first use of magic in this war .  we send things by pigeon to our office in the keep and then by clacks from the nearest trunk tower .         oh  really .     said blouse  showing rather more animation than polly had seen up until now .     using numbers to indicate a scale of gray shades  perhaps .         mein gots .     said otto .      well  yes  as a matter of fact we do     said de worde .     i   m very impressed that you           i have seen the clacks towers on the far bank of the kneck     said blouse  his eyes lighting up .     very clever idea  using big shuttered boxes rather than the old fashioned semaphore arms .  and would i be right in my surmise that the box on the top  which opens its shutters once a second  is a kind of system  er  clock that makes certain the whole clacks line keeps in step .  oh  good .  i thought so .  one beat a second is probably the limit of the mechanisms  so no doubt all your efforts now are concentrated on maximizing the information content per shutter operation .  yes  i imagined that would be the case .  as for sending pictures  well  sooner or later all things are numbers  yes .  of course  you would use each of the two columns of four boxes to send a gray code  but it must be very slow .  have you considered a squeezing algorithm .      de worde and chriek exchanged a glance .      are you sure you haven   t been talking to anyone about this  sir .     said the writer .      oh  it   s all very elementary     said blouse  smiling happily .     i had thought about it in the context of military maps  which are  of course  mostly white space .  so i wondered if it would be possible to indicate a required shade on one column and  on the other side  indicate how far along that rank that shade would persist .  and a delightful bonus here is that if your map was simply in black and white  then you have even more           you haven   t seen inside a clacks tower  have you .     said de worde .      alas  no     said blouse .     this is simply    thinking aloud    based on the de facto existence of your picture .  i believe i can see a number of other little mathematical  ahem  tricks to make the passage of information even swifter  but i   m sure these have already occurred to you .  and  of course  a fairly minor modification could potentially double the information burden of the whole system at a stroke .  and  of course  that is without using colored filters at night  which i   m certain even with the overhead of extra mechanical effort would surely increase throughput by   i   m sorry  did i say something wrong .      the two men both wore a glazed expression .  de worde shook himself .      oh   er  no .  nothing     he said .     er   you seem to have got the grasp of things very   quickly .         oh  it was quite straightforward once i started thinking about it     said blouse .     it was exactly the same when i had to redesign the department   s filing system  you see .  people build something that works .  then circumstances change  and they have to tinker with it to make it continue to work  and they are so busy tinkering that they cannot see that a much better idea would be to build a whole new system to deal with the new circumstances .  but to an outsider  the idea is obvious .         in politics as well as  er  filing systems and clackses  do you think .     said de worde .   blouse   s brow wrinkled .      i   m sorry  i don   t think i follow       he said .      would you agree that sometimes a country   s system is so out of date that it   s only the outsiders that can see the need for wholesale change .     said de worde .   he smiled .  lieutenant blouse did not .      just a point to ponder  maybe     said de worde .     er   since you wish to tell the world of your defiance  would you object if my colleague takes your picture .      blouse shrugged .     if it gives you any satisfaction     he said .     it   s an abomination  of course  but these days it   s hard to find something that isn   t .  you must tell the world  mr .  de worde  that borogravia won   t lie down .  we will not give in .  we will fight on .  write that down in your little notebook  please .  while we can stand  we will kick .         yes  but  once again  may i implore you to           mr .  de worde  you have i am sure heard the saying that the pen is mightier than the sword .      de worde preened a little .     of course  and i           do you want to test it .  take your picture  sir  and then my men will escort you back to your road .      otto chriek stood up and bowed to blouse .  he unslung his picture box .      zis vill only take vun minute     he said .   it never does .  but polly watched in horrified fascination as otto took picture after picture of lieutenant blouse in a variety of what the lieutenant thought were heroic poses .  it is a terrible thing to see a man trying to jut out a chin he does not  in fact  have .      very impressive     said de worde .     i just hope you live to see it in my paper  sir .         i shall look forward to it with the keenest anticipation     said blouse .     and now  perks  please go along with the sergeant and put these two gentlemen back on their way .      otto sidled up to polly as they walked back to the cart .      i need to tell you somezing about your vampire     he said .      oh yes .         you are a friend of his .     said otto .      yes     said polly .     is something wrong .         zere is a problem           he   s got twitchy because he has run out of coffee .         alas  if only it was zat simple .     otto looked awkward .     you have to understand zat ven a vampire forgoes   the bvord  zere is a process zat ve call transference .  zey force zemselves to desire somesing else .  for me zis was not painful .  i crave the perfection of light and shade .  pictures are my life .  but your friend chose   coffee .  and now he has none .         oh .  i see .         i vunder if you do .  it probably seemed so sensible to him .  it is a human craving  and no one minds if you say  as it might be     i am dying for a cup of coffee     or    i   d kill for a cup of coffee .     but vizout coffee  he vill  i am afraid   revert .  you understand  zis is very difficult for me to talk about       otto trailed off .      by    revert    you mean    .         first vill come mild delusions  i zink .  a psychic susceptibility to all kinds of influences from who knows vhere  and vampires can hallucinate so stronkly zat zey can be contagious .  i zink zat is happening already .  he vill become   erratic .  zis may last for several days .  and zen his conditioning vill break and he vill be  vunce again  a true vampire .  no more mr .  nice coffee drinker guy .         can   t i do anything to help him .      otto reverentially laid his picture box in the back of the cart  and turned to her .      you can find him some coffee  or   you can keep a vooden stake and a big knife ready .  you vould be doink him a favor  believe me .         i can   t do that .      otto shrugged .     find someone who vill .            he is amazing .     said de worde as the cart rocked back down through the trees .     i know the clacks is against your religion  but he seems to understand all about it .         like i said  sir  he assesses stuff     said jackrum  beaming .     mind like a razor .         he was talking about clacks algorithms that the companies are only just now investigating .     said de worde .     that department he was talking about           ah  i can see nothing gets past you  sir     said jackrum .     very hush hush .  can   t talk about it .         to be frank  sergeant  i   d always assumed that borogravia was  well   backward .      jackrum   s smile was waxy and bright .     if we seem to be a long way back  sir  it   s only so   s we can get a good runup .         you know  sergeant  it   s a great shame to see a mind like that wasted     said de worde as the cart lurched in a rut .     this is not an age of heroes and famous last stands and death or glory charges .  do your men a favor and try to tell him that  will you .         wouldn   t dream of it  sir     said jackrum .     here is your road  sir .  where will you be heading now .         to kneck valley  sergeant .  this is a good story  sergeant .  thank you .  allow me to shake you by the hand .         glad to hear you think that  sir     said jackrum  extending his hand .  polly heard the faint clink of coins in their passage from palm to palm .  de worde took the reins .      but i must tell you  sergeant  that we   ll probably send off our stuff by pigeon within the hour     he said .     we will have to say you have prisoners .         don   t worry about that  sir     said jackrum .     by the time their mates come out here to rescue those gallopers  we   ll be halfway back to the mountains .  our mountains .      they parted .  jackrum watched them out of sight and turned to polly .      him with his airs and graces     he said .     did you see that .  he insulted me by giving me a tip .     he glanced at his palm .     hmm  five morpork dollars .  well  at least he   s a man who knows how to insult you handsomely     he added  and the coins disappeared into his jacket with remarkable speed .      i think he wants to help us  sarge     said polly .   jackrum ignored that .     i hate bloody ankh morpork     he said .     who   re they to tell us what to do .  who cares what they think .         do you think we can really join up with deserters  sarge .         nope .  they deserted once  what   s to stop    em a second time .  they spat on the duchess when they deserted  they can   t kiss and make up now .  you get one kiss  that   s all .         but lieutenant blouse           the rupert should stick to sums .  he thinks he   s a soldier .  never walked on a battlefield in his life .  all that rubbish he gave your man was death or glory stuff .  and i   ll tell you  perks  i   ve seen death more often than i care to remember  but i   ve never clapped eyes on glory .  i   m all for sending the fools to look for us where we ain   t  though .         he   s not my man  sarge     said polly .      yeah  well  you   re at home with the writin    and readin        grumbled jackrum .     you can   t trust the people who do that stuff .  they mess around with the world  and it turns out everything you know is wrong .      they reached the gully again .  the squad had come back from their various hiding places  and most were clustered around one of the newspapers .   for the first time  polly saw the picture .   it was actually quite good  especially of shufti and wazzer .  she was mostly hidden by the bulk of jackrum .  but you could see the sullen cavalrymen behind them  and their expressions were a picture in themselves .      it   s a good one of tonker     said igorina  who didn   t lisp so much when there were no officers to hear .      do you think having a picture like this is an abomination unto nuggan .     said shufti nervously .      probably     said polly absentmindedly .     most things are .      she ran her eye down the text next to the picture .  it was full of phrases like    plucky farm boys    and    humiliation of some of zlobenia   s best troops    and    sting in the tail .     she could see why it had caused trouble .   she rustled through the other pages .  they were crammed with strange stories about places she   d never heard of  and pictures of people she didn   t recognize .  but one page was a mass of gray text  under a line of much bigger printing  which read       why this mad state must be stopped  bewildered  her eye picked up phrases from the sea of letters     disgraceful invasions of neighboring states        deluded worshippers of a mad god        a strutting bully        outrage after outrage        flying in the face of international opinion           don   t you lads read that rubbish  you don   t know where it   s been     said sergeant jackrum jovially  arriving behind them .     it   ll all be lies .  we are leaving right   corporal maladict .      maladict  emerging from the trees  gave a lazy salute .  he was still wearing his blanket .      what are you doing out of uniform .         i   m in uniform underneath  sarge .  we don   t want to be seen  right .  like this  we become part of the jungle .         it   s a forest  corporal .  and without bloody uniforms  how the hell will we know our friends from our enemies .      maladict lit a cigarette before he replied .     the way i see it  sarge     he said     the enemy is everyone but us .         just one moment  sergeant     said blouse  who had looked up from a newspaper and had been watching the apparition with considerable interest .     there are precedents in antiquity  you know .  general song sung lo moved his army disguised as a field of sunflowers  and general tacticus once commanded a battalion to dress as spruces .         sunflowers .     said jackrum  his voice oozing with disdain .      both actions were successful  sergeant .         no uniforms .  no badges .  no stripes  sir .         possibly you could be an extra large bloom .     said blouse  and his face betrayed no hint of amusement .     and you have surely carried out actions at night  when all markings are invisible .         yessir  but night is night  sir  while sunflowers is   is sunflowers  sir .  i   ve worn this uniform for more   n fift   all my life  sir  and sneaking around without a uniform is downright dishonorable .  it   s for spies  sir .     jackrum   s face had gone beyond red into crimson  and polly was amazed to see tears in the corners of his eyes .      how can we be spies  sergeant  in our own country .     said blouse calmly .      the el tee   s got a point  sarge     said maladict .   jackrum turned like a bull at bay  and then  to polly   s amazement  he sagged .  but she wasn   t amazed for long .  she knew the man .  she didn   t know why  but there was something about jackrum that she could read .  it was in the eyes .  he could lie with eyes as honest and tranquil as those of an angel .  and if he appeared to be backing away  it was indeed only to get a runup later on .      all right  all right     the sergeant said .     upon my oath  i am not a man to disobey orders .     and his eyes twinkled .      well done  sergeant     said blouse .   jackrum pulled himself together .      i don   t want to be a sunflower  though     he said .      happily  there are only fir trees in this area  sergeant .         point well made  sir .     jackrum turned to the awed squad .      all right  last detail     he bellowed .     you heard the man .  spruce up .         it was an hour later .  as far as polly could tell  they   d started out for the mountains but had traveled in a wide semicircle so that they ended up facing back the way they had come  but a few miles away .  was blouse leading  or had he left it to jackrum .  neither man was complaining .   the lieutenant called a halt in a thicket of birch  thus doubling the size of the thicket .  you could say that the camouflage effects were effective  because bright red and white show up against greens and grays .  beyond that  though  language tended to run out .   jade had scraped off her paint  and was green and gray anyway .  igor looked like a walking brush .  wazzer quivered like an aspen all the time  so her needles rustled permanently .  the others had made more or less reasonable attempts  and polly was pretty proud of her own efforts .  jackrum was about as treelike as a big red rubber ball  polly suspected that he   d surreptitiously shined up his brasswork  too .   every tree held a mug of tea in limb or hand .  after all  they   d stopped for five minutes .      men     said blouse  as if he   d only just reached that conclusion .     you may have gathered that we are heading back toward the mountains to raise a deserters    army there .  this story is  in fact  a ruse for the benefit of mr .  de worde .     he paused  as if expecting some reaction .  they stared at him .  he went on      we are  in fact  continuing our journey to the kneck valley .  this is the last thing the enemy will be expecting .      polly glanced at the sergeant .  he was grinning .      it is an established fact that a small  light force can get into places that a battalion cannot penetrate     blouse went on .     men  we will be that force .  is that not right  sergeant jackrum .         yessir .         we will come down like a hammer on those forces smaller than us     said blouse happily .      yessir .         and from those that outnumber us  we will merge silently into the forest           yessir .         we will slip past their sentries           that   s right  sir     said jackrum .         and take kneck keep from under their noses .      jackrum   s tea sprayed across the clearing .      i daresay our enemy feels impregnable just become he commands a heavily armed fort on a rocky crag with walls a hundred feet high and twenty feet thick     blouse continued  as if half the trees weren   t now dripping tea .     but he is in for a surprise .         you all right  sarge .     whispered polly .  jackrum was making strange little noises in his throat .      does anyone have any questions .     said blouse .   igorina raised a branch .      how will we get in  thur .     she said .      ah .  good question     said blouse .     and all will become apparent in due time .         aerial cavalry     said maladict .      pardon  corporal .         flying machines  sir .     said maladict .     they won   t know where to expect us .  we touch down in a handy lz  take them out  and then dust off .      blouse   s clear brow wrinkled a little .      flying machine .     he said .      i saw a picture of one by someone called leonard of quirm .  a sort of   flying windmill .  it   s just like a big screw up in the sky           i don   t think we need one of those  although the advice is welcome     said blouse .      not when we   ve got a big screw up down here  sir .     jackrum managed .     sir  this is just a bunch of recruits  sir .  all that stuff about honor and freedom and that  that was just for the writer man  right .  good idea  sir .  yeah  let   s get to kneck valley  and let   s sneak in and join the rest of the lads .  that   s where we ought to be  sir .  you can   t be serious about taking the keep  sir .  i wouldn   t try that with a thousand men .         i might try it with half a dozen  sergeant .      jackrum   s eyes bulged .      really  sir .  what   ll private goom do .  tremble at them .  young igor will stitch    em up  will he .  private halter will give    em a nasty look .  they   re promising lads  sir  but they   re not men .         general tacticus said the fate of a battle may depend upon the actions of one man in the right place  sergeant     said blouse calmly .      and having a lot more soldiers than the other bugger  sir     jackrum insisted .     sir  we should get to the rest of the army .  maybe it   s trapped  maybe it isn   t .  all that stuff about them not wanting to slaughter us  sir  that makes no sense .  the idea is to win  sir .  if the rest of    em have stopped attacking  it   s because they   re frightened of us .  we should be down there .  that   s the place for young recruits  sir  where they can learn .  the enemy is looking for    em  sir .         if general froc is among those captured  the keep will be where he is held     said blouse .     i believe he was the first officer you served under as sergeant  am i right .      jackrum hesitated .     that   s right  sir     he said eventually .     and he was the dumbest lieutenant i   ve ever met  bar one .         i am positive there is a secret entrance into the keep  sergeant .      polly   s memory nudged her .  if paul was alive  he was in the keep .   she caught shufti   s eye .  the girl nodded .  she   d been thinking along the same lines .  she didn   t talk much about her   fianc    and polly wondered how official the arrangement was .      permission to speak  sarge .     she said .      okay  perks .         i   d like to try to find a way into the keep  sarge .         perks  are you volunteering to attack the biggest  strongest castle within five hundred miles .  single handed .         i   ll go  too     said shufti .      oh  two of you .     said jackrum .     oh  well  that   s all right then .         i   ll go     said wazzer .     the duchess has told me that i should .      jackrum looked down at wazzer   s thin little face and watery eyes  and sighed .  he turned back to blouse .      let   s get a move on  sir  shall we .  we can talk about this later .  at least we   re headed to kneck  first stop on the road to hell .  perks and igor  you take point .  maladict .         yo .         er   you scout on ahead .         i hear ya .         good .      as the vampire walked past polly  the world  just for a moment  changed  the forest became greener  the sky grayer  and she heard a noise overhead  like    whopwhopwhop .     and then it was gone .   vampire hallucinations are contagious  she thought .  what   s going on in his head .   she hurried forward with igorina  and they set off again through the forest .   birds sang .  the effect was peaceful  if you didn   t know about birdsong  but polly could recognize the alarm calls close by and the territorial threats far off and  everywhere  the preoccupation with sex .  that took the edge off the pleasure .       polly .     said igorina .      hmm .         could you kill someone if you had to .      polly came right back to the here and now .     what sort of question is that to ask anyone .         i think it   s the sort you   d ask a tholdier     said igorina .      i don   t know .  if they were attacking me  i suppose .  hurt them hard enough to keep them lying down  anyway .  and you .         we have a great respect for life  polly     said igorina solemnly .     it   s easy to kill thomeone  and almost impossible to bring them back again .         almost .         well  if you don   t have a really good lightning rod .  and even if you have  they   re never quite the same .  cutlery tends to stick to them .         igorina  why are you here .         the clan isn   t very   keen on girls getting too involved in the great work     said igorina  looking downcast .        thtick to your needlework     my mother keeps saying .  well  that   s all very fine  but i know i   m good at the actual incisions as well .  especially the fiddly bits .  and i think a woman on the slab would feel a lot better about things if she knew there was a female hand on the we belong dead switch .  tho  i thought some battlefield experience would convince my father .  soldiers aren   t choosy about who saves their lives .         i suppose men are the same the world over     said polly .      on the inside  certainly .         and   er   you really can put your hair back .     polly had seen it in its jar when they   d been breaking camp  it had spun gently in its bottle of green liquid  like some fine  rare seaweed .      oh  yes .  scalp transplants are easy .  it stings a bit for a couple of minutes  that   s all        there was movement between the trees  and then the blur resolved itself into maladict .  he held a finger to his lips as he drew closer  and then whispered urgently     charlie   s tracking us .      polly and igorina looked at one another .      who   s charlie .      maladict stared at them  and then rubbed his face distractedly .      i   m   sorry  er   sorry  it   s   look  we   re being followed .  i know it .         the sun was setting .  polly peered over the rocky ledge  back the way they had come .  she could make out the track  golden and red in the late afternoon light .  nothing was moving .   the outcrop was near the top of another rounded hill  the rear of it became the floor of a little enclosed space  surrounded by bushes .  it made a good lookout for people who wanted to see without being seen  and it had done so in the recent past  by the look of the old fires .   maladict was sitting with his head in his hands  with jackrum and blouse on either side of him .  they were trying to understand  and not making much progress .      so you can   t hear anything .     said blouse .      no .         and you didn   t see anything and can   t smell anything .     said jackrum .      no .  i told you .  but there is something after us .  watching us .         but if you can   t       blouse began .      look  i   m a vampire     panted maladict .     just trust me  okay .         i thould  tharge     said igorina from behind jackrum .     we igorth often therve vampireth .  in timeth of strethth their perthonal thpace can extend ath much ath ten mileth from their body .      there was the usual pause that followed an extended lisp .  people need time to think .      streth th .     said blouse .      you know how you can feel that someone   s looking at you .     mumbled maladict .     well  it   s like that  times a thousand .  and it   s not a   a feeling  it   s something i know .         lots of people are looking for us  corporal     said blouse  patting him kindly on the shoulder .     it doesn   t mean that they   ll find us .      polly  looking down on the gold lit woodland  opened her mouth to speak .  it was dry .  nothing came out  maladict shook the lieutenant   s hand away .     this   person isn   t looking for us .  they know where we are .      polly forced saliva into her mouth  and tried again .      movement .      and then it wasn   t there anymore .  she   d have sworn there had been something on the path  something that merged with the light  revealing itself only by the changing  wavering pattern of shadows as it moved .      er   perhaps not     she muttered .      look  we   ve all lost sleep and we   re all a little    strung out        said blouse .     let   s just keep things down  shall we .         i need coffee .     moaned maladict  rocking back and forth .   polly squinted at the distant pathway .  the breeze was shaking the trees  and red gold leaves were drifting down .  for a moment there was just a suggestion     she got to her feet .  stare at shadows and waving branches for long enough and you could see anything .  it was like looking at pictures in the fire .      o kay     said shufti  who   d been working over the fire .     this might do it .  it smells like coffee  anyway .  well   quite like coffee .  well   quite like coffee if coffee was made from acorns  anyway .      she   d roasted some acorns .  as least the woods had plenty of them at this time of year  and everyone knew that roasted  ground acorns could be substituted for coffee  didn   t they .  polly had agreed that it was a worth a try  but  as far as she could recall  no one had ever  given the choice  said     no  i will not touch horrible coffee anymore .  it   s a long black ground acorn substitute for me  with extra floating gritty bits .      she took the mug from shufti and carried it over to the vampire .  as she bent down   the world changed .      whopwhopwhop     the sky was a haze of dust  turning the sun into a blood red disc .  for a moment  polly saw them in the sky  giant fat screws spinning in the air  hovering in the air but drifting slowly toward her        he   s having flashsides     whispered igorina at her elbow .      flashsides .         like   someone else   s flashbackth .  we don   t know anything about them .  they could come from anywhere .  a vampire at this stage is open to all sorts of influences .  give him the coffee  please .      maladict grabbed the mug and tried to down the contents so quickly that they spilled down his chin .  they watched him swallow .      tastes like mud .     he said  putting down the mug .      yes  but is it working .      maladict looked up and blinked .      ye gods  but this stuff is gruesome .         are we in a forest or a jungle .  any flying screws .     igorina demanded .     how many fingers am i holding up .         you know  that   s something an igor should never say     said maladict  grimacing .     but   the   feelings aren   t so strong .  i can suck it down .  i can gut it out .      polly looked at igorina  who shrugged and said     that   s nice     and motioned to polly to joined her a little way off .      he  or possibly she  is right on the edge     she said .      well  we all are .     said polly .     we   re hardly getting any sleep .         you know what i mean .  i   ve  er   taken the liberty of  er   being prepared .     wordlessly  igorina let her jacket fall open  just for a moment .  polly saw a knife  a wooden stake  and a hammer  in neatly stitched little pockets .      it   s not going to come to that  is it .         i hope not     said igorina .     but if it doeth  i   m the only one who can reliably find the heart .  people always think it   s more to the left than           it   s not going to come to that     said polly firmly .      the sky was red .  the war was a day away .   polly crept along just below the ridge with the tea can .  it was tea that kept the army on its feet .   remember what   s real   well  that took some doing .  tonker and lofty  for example .  it didn   t matter which of them was on guard  the other one would be there as well .  and they were  sitting side by side on a fallen tree  staring down the slope .   they were holding hands .  they always held hands  when they thought they were alone .  but it seemed to polly that they didn   t hold hands like people who were  well  friends .  they held hands tightly  like someone who has slipped over a cliff would hold hands with a rescuer  fearing that to let go would be to fall away .      tea up .     she quavered .   the girls turned  and she dipped a couple of mugs into the scalding tea .      you know     she said quietly     no one would hate you if you ran away tonight           what do you mean  ozz .     said lofty .      well  what   s there in kneck for you .  you got away from the school .  you could go anywhere .  i bet the two of you could sneak           we   re staying     said tonker severely .     we talked about it .  where else would we go .  anyway  supposing something is following us .         probably just an animal     said polly  who didn   t believe it herself .      animals don   t do that     said tonker .     and i don   t think maladict would get so excited .  it   s probably more spies .  well  we   ll get them .         nobody is going to take us back     said lofty .      oh .  er   good     said polly  backing away .     well  must get on  no one likes cold tea  eh .      she hurried around the hill .  whenever lofty and tonker were together  she felt like a trespasser .   wazzer was on guard in a small dell  watching the land below with her usual expression of slightly worrying intensity .  she turned as polly approached .      oh  polly     said wazzer .     good news .         oh  good     said polly weakly .     i like good news .         she says it will be all right for us not to wear our dimity scarves     said wazzer .      what .  oh .  good     said polly .      but only because we are serving a higher purpose     said wazzer .  and  just as blouse could invert commas  wazzer could drop capital letters into a spoken sentence .      that   s good  then     said polly .      you know  polly     said wazzer     i think the world would be a lot better if it was run by women .  there wouldn   t be any wars .  of course  the book would consider such an idea a dire abomination unto nuggan .  it may be in error .  i shall consult the duchess .  bless this cup that i may drink of it     she added .      er  yes     said polly  and wondered what she should dread more  maladict suddenly turning into a ravening monster  or wazzer reaching the end of whatever mental journey she was taking .  she   d been a kitchen maid and now she was subjecting the book to critical analysis and talking to a religious icon .  that sort of thing led to friction .  the presence of those seeking the truth is infinitely to be preferred to the presence of those who think they   ve found it .   besides  she thought as she watched wazzer drink  you only thought the world would be better if it was run by women if you didn   t actually know many women .  or old women  at least .  take the whole thing about the dimity scarves .  women had to cover their hair on fridays  but there was nothing about this in the book  which was pretty dar   pretty damn rigorous about most things .  it was just a custom .  it was done because it had always been done .  and if you forgot  or didn   t want to  the old women got you .  they had eyes like hawks .  they could practically see through walls .  and the men took notice  because no man wanted to cross the crones in case they started watching him  so half hearted punishment would be dealt out .  whenever there was an execution  and especially when there was a whipping  you always found the grannies in the front row  sucking on peppermints .   polly had forgotten her dimity scarf .  she did wear it at home on fridays  for no other reason than that it was easier than not doing so .  she vowed that  if ever she got back  she   d never do it again        er   wazz .     she said .      yes  polly .         you   ve got a direct line to the duchess  have you .         we talk about things     said wazzer dreamily .      you  er  couldn   t raise the subject of coffee  could you .     said polly wretchedly .      the duchess can only move very  very small things     said wazzer .      a few beans  perhaps .  wazz  we really need some coffee .  i don   t think the acorns are that much of a substitute .         i will pray     said wazzer .      good .  you do that     said polly .  and  strangely enough  she felt a little more hopeful .  maladict had hallucinations  but wazzer had a certainty you could bend steel around .  it was the opposite of a hallucination  somehow .  it was as if she could see what was real and you couldn   t .      polly .     said wazzer .      yes .         you don   t believe in the duchess  do you .  i mean the real duchess  not your inn .      polly looked into the small  pinched  intense face .      well  i mean  they say she   s dead  and i prayed to her when i was small  but  since you ask  i don   t exactly  um  believe as       she gabbled .      she is standing just behind you .  just behind your right shoulder .      in the silence of the woods  polly turned .      i can   t see her     she said .      i am happy for you     said wazzer  handing her the empty mug .      but i didn   t see anything     said polly .      no     said wazzer .     but you turned around        polly had never asked too many questions about the girls    working school .  she was  by definition  a good girl .  her father was an influential man in the community  and she worked hard  she didn   t have much to do with men  and  most important  she was   well  smart .  she was bright enough to do what a lot of other people did in the chronic  reason free insanity that was everyday life in munz .  she knew what to see and what to ignore  when to obey and when to merely present the face of obedience  when to speak and when to keep her thoughts to herself .  she learned the ways of the survivor .  most people did .  but if you rebelled  or were merely dangerously honest  or had the wrong kind of illness  or were not wanted  or were a girl who liked the boys more than the old women thought you should and  worse  were not good at counting   then the school was your destination .   she didn   t know much about what went on in there  but imagination rushed to fill the gap .  and she wondered what happened to you in that hellish pressure cooker .  if you were tough  like tonker  it boiled you hard and gave you a shell .  lofty   it was hard to know .  she was quiet and shy until you saw firelight reflected in her eyes  and sometimes the flames were there in the absence of any fire to reflect .  but if you were wazzer  dealt a poor hand to start with  and locked up  and starved  and beaten  and mistreated nuggan knew how  and yes  polly thought  nuggan probably did know how   and pushed deeper and deeper into yourself  what would you find down there .  and then you   d look up from those depths into the only smile you ever saw .      the last man on guard duty was jackrum  because shufti was busy cooking .  he was sitting on a mossy rock  crossbow in one hand  staring at something in his hand .  he spun around as she approached  and polly caught the gleam of gold as something was shoved back in his jacket .   the sergeant lowered the bow .      you make enough noise for an elephant  perks     he said .      sorry  sarge     said polly  who knew she hadn   t .  he took the tea mug  and turned to point downhill .      see that bush down there  perks .     he said .     just to the right of that fallen log .      polly squinted .      yes  sarge     she said .      notice anything about it .      polly stared again .  there must be something wrong about it  she decided  otherwise he wouldn   t have asked her .  she concentrated .      the shadow   s wrong     she decided at last .      good lad .  the reason bein     our chum is behind the bush .  he   s been a watching of me  and i   ve been a watching of him .  nothing else for it .  he   ll have it away on his toes as soon as he sees anyone move  and he   s too far away to drop an arrow on him .         an enemy .         i don   t think so .         a friend .         cocky devil  at any rate .  he doesn   t care that i know he   s there .  you go on back up the hill  lad  and bring down that big bow we got off of the   there he goes .      the shadow had vanished .  polly stared into the woods  but the long light was getting crimson  and dusk was unfolding between the trees .      it   s a wolf     said jackrum .      a werewolf .     said polly .      now what makes you think that .         because sergeant towering said we   d got a werewolf in the squad .  i   m sure we haven   t .  i mean  we   d have found out by now  wouldn   t we .  but i wondered if they   d seen one .         can   t do anything about it  anyway     said jackrum .     a silver arrow would do the job  but we   ve got none .         what about our shilling  sarge .         oh  you think you can kill a werewolf with an iou .         oh  yeah .     then polly added     you   ve got a real shilling  sarge .  around your neck  with that gold medallion .      if you could have bent steel around wazzer   s certainty  you could have heated it with jackrum   s glare .      what   s round my neck is no business of yours  perks  and the only thing worse than a werewolf is me if anyone tries to take my shilling off me  understand .      he softened as he saw polly   s terrified expression .      we   ll move on after we   ve eaten     he said .     find a better place for a rest .  somewhere easier to defend .         we   re all pretty tired  sarge .         so i want us all to be upright and armed if our friend comes back with his chums     said jackrum .   he followed her gaze .  the gold locket had slipped out of his jacket and dangled guiltily on its chain .  he deftly tucked it away .      she was just a   girl i knew     said jackrum .     that   s all  right .  it was a long time ago .         i didn   t ask you  sarge     said polly  backing away .   jackrum   s shoulders settled .     that   s right  lad  you didn   t .  and i ain   t asking you about anything  neither .  but i reckon we   d better find the corporal some coffee  eh .         amen to that  sarge .         and our rupert   s dreaming of laurel wreaths all around his head  perks .  we   ve got ourselves a goddam hero here .  can   t think  can   t fight  no bloody use at all except for a famous last stand and a medal sent to his ol    mum .  and i   ve been in a few famous last stands  lad  and they   re butcher shops .  that   s what blouse   s leading you into  mark my words .  what   ll you lot do then  eh .  we   ve had a few scuffles  but that   s not war .  think you   ll be man enough to stand  when the metal meets the meat .         you did  sarge     said polly .     you said you were in a few last stands .         yeah  lad .  but i was holding the metal .         polly walked back up the slope .  all this  she thought  and we haven   t even got there .  sarge is thinking about the girl he left behind   well  that   s normal .  and tonker and lofty only think about one another  but i suppose after you   ve been in that school   and as for wazzer     polly wondered how she would have survived the school .  would she have grown hard  like tonker .  would she have just folded up inside  like the maids who came and went and worked hard and never had a name .  or perhaps she would have become like wazzer  and found some door in her own head   i may be lowly  but i talk to gods .      wazzer had said    not your inn .     had she ever told wazzer about the duchess .  surely not .  surely she   but  no  she had told tonker  hadn   t she .   that was it  then .  all explained .  tonker must have mentioned it to wazzer at some point .  nothing weird about it at all  even if practically no one ever had a conversation with wazz .  it was so hard .  she was so intense  so coiled up .  but that had to be the only explanation .  yes .   she wasn   t going to let there be any other .   polly shivered  and was aware that someone was walking beside her .  she looked up and groaned .  it was a tall robed figure  with a scythe .      you   re a hallucination  right .      oh  yes .  you are all in a state of heightened sensibility caused by mental contagion and lack of sleep .      if you   re a hallucination  how do you know that .      i know it because you know it .  i am simply better at articulating it  said death .      i   m not going to die  am i .  i mean  right now .      no .  but you were told that you would walk with death every day .      oh   yes .  corporal scallot said that .      he is an old friend .  you might say he is on the installment plan .      do you mind walking a bit more   invisibly .      of course .  how   s this .      and quietly  too .      there was silence  which was presumably the answer .      and polish yourself up a bit     said polly to the empty air .     and that robe needs a wash .      there was no reply  but she felt better for saying it .      shufti had cooked beef stew with dumplings and herbs .  it was magnificent .  it was also a mystery .      i don   t recall us passing a cow  private     said blouse as he handed his tin plate along for a second helping .      er   no  sir .         and yet you have acquired beef .         er   yes  sir .  er   when that writer man came up in his cart  well  when you were talking  er  i crept around and took a look inside           there   s a name for someone who does that sort of thing  private     said blouse severely .      yeah  it   s quartermaster  shufti .  well done     said jackrum .     if that writer man gets hungry  he can always eat his words  eh  lieutenant .         er   yes     said blouse carefully .     yes .  of course .  good initiative  private .         oh  i didn   t think it up  sir     said shufti brightly .     sarge told me to .      polly stopped  spoon halfway to her mouth  and swiveled her eyes from sergeant to lieutenant .      you teach looting  sergeant .     said blouse .  there was a joint gasp from the squad .  if this was the bar back at the duchess  the regulars would have been hurrying out of the doors and polly would have been helping her father get the bottles off the shelf .      not looting  sir  not looting     said jackrum calmly  licking his spoon .     under duchess   s regulations  rule      section   c   paragraph i  sir  it would be plundering  said cart being the property of bloody ankh morpork  sir  which is aiding and abetting the enemy .  plundering is allowed  sir .      the two men held eye contact for a moment  and then blouse reached behind him and into his pack .  polly saw him draw out a small yet thick book .      rule         he murmured .  blouse glanced up at the sergeant and thumbed through the thin  shiny pages .         .  pillaging  plundering and looting .  ah  yes .  and   let me see   you are with us  sergeant jackrum  owing to rule      i think you reminded me at the time        there was another silence broken only by the riffle of the pages .                   said blouse softly .     ah       he stared at the page  and jackrum stared at him .  and polly watched jackrum and knew  knew that there was no rule     .   blouse closed the book with a leathery flwap .      absolutely correct  sergeant .     he said brightly .     i commend you on your encyclopedic knowledge of the regulations .      jackrum looked astounded .     what .         you were practically word perfect  sergeant .     said blouse .  and there was a gleam in his eye .   polly remembered blouse looking at the captured cavalry captain .  this was that same look  the look which said  now i have the upper hand .   jackrum   s chins wobbled .      you had something to add  sergeant .     said blouse .      er  no   sir     said jackrum  his face an open declaration of war .      we   ll leave at moonrise     said blouse .     i suggest we all get some rest until then .  and then   may we prevail .      he nodded to the group  and walked over to where polly had spread his blanket in the lee of the bushes .  after a few moments  there were some snores  which polly refused to believe .   jackrum certainly didn   t .  he got up and strode out of the firelight .  polly hurried after him .      did you hear that .     snarled the sergeant  staring out at the darkening hills .     the little yoyo .  what right has he got  checking up in the book o    words .         well  you did quote chapter and verse  sarge     said polly .      so .  officers are s   posed believe what they   re told .  and then he smiled .  did you see .  caught me out and smiled at me .  thinks he   s got one over on me  just because he caught me out .         you did lie  sarge .         i did not  perks .  it   s not lying when you do it to officers .  it   s presentin    them with the world the way they think it ought to be .  you can   t let    em start checkin    up for themselves .  they get the wrong ideas .  i told you  he   ll be the death of all of us .  invading the bloody keep .  the man   s wrong in the head .         sarge .     said polly urgently      yes  what .         we   re being signaled  sarge .      on a distant hilltop  twinkling like an early evening star  a white light was flashing .      blouse lowered his telescope .      they   re repeating    cq        he said .     and i believe those longer pauses are when they   re aiming their tube in different directions .  they   re looking for their spies .     seek you     see .  private igor .         thur .         you know how that tube works  don   t you .         oh  yeth  thur .  you jutht light a flare in the box  and then it   th just point and click .         you   re not going to answer it  are you  sir .     said jackrum  horrified .      i am indeed  sergeant     said blouse briskly .     private carborundum  please assemble the tube .  manickle  please bring the lantern .  i shall need to read the code book .         but that   ll give away our position .     said jackrum .      no  sergeant  because although this term may be unfamiliar to you  i intend to what we call    lie        said blouse .     igor  i   m sure you have some scissors  although i   d rather you didn   t attempt to repeat the word .         i have some of the applianthetheth you mention  thir     said igorina stiffly .      good .     blouse looked around .     it   s almost pitch dark now .  ideal .  take my blanket and cut  oh  a three inch circle out of it  then tie the blanket over the front of the tube .         that will cut off motht of the light  thur .         indeed it will .  my plan depends upon it     said blouse proudly .      sir  they will see the light  they   ll know we   re here     said jackrum  as though repeating things to a child .      i explained  sergeant .  i will lie     said blouse .      you can   t lie when           thank you for your input  sergeant  that will be all for now     said blouse .     are we ready  igor .         jutht about  thur     said igorina  tying the blanket across the end of the tube .     okay  thur .  i   ll light the flare when you thay .      blouse unfolded the little book .      ready  private .     he said .      yup     said jade .      on the word    long    you will hold the trigger for the count of two  and then let go .  on the word    short    you will hold it down for the count of one  and likewise let go .  got that .         yup  el tee .  could hold it down for lots  if you like     said jade .     one  two  many  lots .  i   m good at countin    .  high as you like .  jus    say der word .         two will suffice     said blouse .     and you  private goom  i want you to take my telescope and look for long and short flashes from that light over there  understand .      polly saw wazzer   s face and said quickly     i   ll do that  sir .      a small white hand was laid on her arm .  in the miserly glimmer of the dark lantern  wazzer   s eyes glowed with the light of certainty .      the duchess guides our footsteps now     she said and took the telescope from the lieutenant .     what we are doing is her work  sir .         is it .  oh .  well   that   s good     said blouse .      she will bless this instrument of far seeing that i may use it     said wazzer .      indeed .     said blouse  nervously .     well done .  now   are we ready .  send as follows   long   long   short        the shutter in the tube clicked and rattled as the message flashed out across the sky .  when the troll lowered the tube  there was half a minute of darkness .  and then      short   long       wazzer began .   blouse held the code book up to his face  his lips moving as he read by the pinpoints of light escaping from the joints of the box .      w   r   u     he said .     and m   s   g   p   r           that   s not a message .     said jackrum .      on the contrary  they want to know where we are  because they   re having trouble seeing our light     said blouse .     send as follows   short           i protest  sir .      blouse lowered the book .     sergeant  i am about to tell our spy that we are seven miles further away than we really are  do you understand .  and i am certain they will believe us  because i have artificially reduced the light output from our device  do you understand .  and i will tell them that their spies have encountered a very large party of recruits and deserters heading for the mountains and are in pursuit  do you understand .  i am making us invisible  do you understand .  do you understand  sergeant jackrum .      the squad held their breath .   jack drew himself stiffly to attention .      fully understood  sir .     he said .      very well .      jackrum stood to attention as the messages were exchanged  like a naughty pupil forced to stand by the teacher   s desk .   messages flashed across the sky  from hilltop to hilltop .  lights flickered .  the clacks tube rattled .  wazzer called out the longs and shorts .  blouse scribbled in the book .      s   p   p         he said aloud .     hah .  that   s an order to remain where we are .         more flashes  sir     said wazzer .      t   y   e           said blouse  still making notes .     that   s    be ready to give aid .     n   v   a   s   n   that   s           that   s not a code  sir .     said polly .      private  send as follows right now .     blouse croaked .     long   long        the message went .  they watched while the dew fell and  overhead  the stars came out and twinkled messages no one ever tried to read .   the clacks went silent .      now we leave as soon as possible     said blouse .  he gave a little cough .     i believe the phrase is    let us get the heck out of here .            close  sir     said polly .     quite   close .         there was an old  very old borogravian song with more zs and vs in it than any lowlander could pronounce .  it was called    plogviehze .     it meant    the sun has risen .  let   s make war .     you needed a special kind of history to get all that in one word .   sam vimes sighed .  the little countries here fought because of the river  because of idiot treaties  because of royal rows  but mostly they fought because they had always fought .  they made war  in fact  because the sun came up .   this war had tied itself in a knot .   downriver  the valley narrowed to a canyon before the kneck plunged over a waterfall a quarter of a mile high .  anyone trying to get up through the jagged mountains there would find themselves in a world of gorges  knife edged ridges  permanent ice  and even more permanent death .  anyone trying to cross the kneck into zlobenia now would be butchered on the shore .  the only way out of the valley was back along the kneck  which would put an army under the shadow of the keep .  that had been fine when the keep was in borogravian hands .  now that it had been captured  they   d be passing in range of their own weapons .      and such weapons .  vimes had seen catapults that would throw a stone ball three miles .  when it landed  it would crack into needle sharp shards .  or there was the other machine  which sent six foot steel discs skimming through the air .  once they   d hit the ground and leaped up again  they were unreliable as hell  but that only made them more terrifying .  vimes had been told that the edged disc would probably keep going for several hundred yards  no matter how many men or horses it encountered on the way .   and they were only the latest ideas .  there were plenty of conventional weapons  if by that you meant giant bows  catapults  and mangonels that hurled balls of ephebian fire  which clung while it burned .   from up here  in his drafty tower  he could see the fires of the dug in army all across the plain .   they couldn   t retreat  and the alliance  if that   s what you could call the petulant hubbub  didn   t dare head up the valley into the heart of the country with that army at their back  yet didn   t have enough men to hold the keep and corral the enemy .   and in a few weeks it would start to snow .  the passes would fill up .  nothing would be able to get though .  and every day  thousands of men and horses would need feeding .  of course  the men could  eventually  eat the horses  thus settling two feeding problems at a stroke .  after that  there would have to be the good ol    leg rota  which  vimes understood from one of the friendlier zlobenians  was a common feature of winter warfare up here .  since he was captain    hopalong    splatzer  vimes believed him .   and then it would rain  and then the rain and the snowmelt together would turn the damn river into a flood .  but  before that  the alliance would have bickered itself apart and gone home .  all the borogravians had to do  in fact  was hold their ground to score a draw .   he swore under his breath .  prince heinrich had inherited the throne in a country where the chief export was a kind of hand painted wooden clog  but in ten years  he vowed  his capital city of rigour would be    the ankh morpork of the mountains .      for some reason  he thought ankh morpork would be pleased about this .   he was anxious  he said  to learn the ankh morpork way of doing things  the kind of innocent ambition that could well lead to an aspiring ruler   well  finding out the ankh morpork way of doing things .  heinrich had a reputation locally for cunning  but ankh morpork had overtaken cunning a thousand years ago  had sped past devious  had left artful far behind  and had now  by a roundabout route  arrived at straightforward .   vimes leafed through the papers on his desk  and looked up  where he heard a shrill  harsh cry outside .   a buzzard came in a long  shallow swoop through the open window and alighted on a makeshift perch at the far end of the room .   vimes strolled over as the little figure on the bird   s back raised his flying goggles .      how   s it going  buggy .     he said .      they   re getting suspicious  mister vimes .  and sergeant angua says it   s getting a bit risky now they   re so close .         tell her to come on in  then .         right  sir .  and they still need coffee .         oh  damn .  haven   t they found any .         no  sir  and it   s getting tricky with the vampire .         well  if they   re suspicious now then they   ll be certain if we drop a flask of coffee on them .         sergeant angua says we   ll probably get away with it  sir .  she didn   t say why .     the gnome looked expectantly at vimes .  so did his buzzard .     they   ve come a long way  sir .  for a bunch of girls .  well   mostly girls .      vimes reached out absentmindedly to pet the bird .      don   t  sir .  she   ll have your thumb off .     buggy yelled .   there was a knock on the door  and reg came in with a tray of raw meat .      saw buggy overhead  so i thought i   d nip down to the kitchens  sir .         well done  reg .  don   t they ask why you want raw meat .         yes  sir .  i tell them you eat it  sir .      vimes paused before answering .  reg meant well  after all .      well  it probably can   t do my reputation any harm     he said .     by the way  what was going down in the crypt .         oh  they   re not what i   d call proper zombies  sir     said reg  selecting a piece of meat and dangling it in front of morag .     more like dead men walking .         er   yes .     said vimes .      i mean there   s no real thinking going on     the zombie went on  picking up another lump of raw rabbit .     no embracing the opportunities of a life beyond the grave  sir .  they   re just a lot of old memories on legs .  that sort of thing gives zombies a bad name  mister vimes .  it makes me so angry .     morag tried to snap at another lump of bloody rabbit fur that reg  oblivious for the moment  was waving aimlessly .      er   reg .     said buggy .      how hard can it be  sir  to move with the times .  now take me  for example .  one day i woke up dead .  did i           reg .     vimes warned as morag   s head bobbed back and forth .         take it lying down .  no .  and i didn   t           reg  be careful .  she   s just had two of your fingers off .         what .  oh .     reg held up a denuded hand and stared at it .     oh  now  will you look at that .     he peered down at the floor  with a hope that was quickly dashed .     blast .  any chance we can make her throw up .         only by sticking your remaining fingers down her throat  reg .  sorry .  buggy  do the best you can  please .  and you  reg  go back downstairs and see if they   ve got any coffee  will you .            oh dear     murmured shufti .      it   s big     said tonker .   blouse said nothing .      not seen it before  sir .     said jackrum cheerfully as they stared at the distant keep .  if there is a fairy tale scale for castles  where the top end is occupied by those white  spire encrusted castles with the blue pointy roofs  then kneck keep was low  black  and clung to its outcrop like a storm cloud .  a bed of the kneck ran around it  along the peninsula on which it was built  the approach road was wide  and bereft of cover  and an ideal stroll for those who were tired of life .  blouse took all this in .      er  no  sergeant     said blouse .     i   ve seen pictures  of course  but   they don   t do it justice .         any of them books you read tell you what to do  sir .     said jackrum .  they were lying in some bushes half a mile away from the keep .      possibly  sergeant .  in the craft of war  song sung lo said  to win without fighting is the greatest victory .  the enemy wishes us to attack where he is strongest .  therefore  we will disappoint him .  a way will present itself  sergeant .         well  it   s never presented itself to me  and i   ve been here dozens of times     said jackrum  still grinning .     hah  even the rats   d have to disguise themselves as washerwomen to get in that place .  even if you get up that road  you   ve got narrow entrances  holes in the ceiling to pour hot oil through  gates everywhere that a troll couldn   t smash through  coupla mazes  a hundred little ways you can be shot at  oh  it   s a wonderful place to attack .         i wonder how the alliance got in .     said blouse .      treachery  probably  sir .  the world   s full of traitors .  or perhaps they discovered the secret entrance  sir .  you know  sir .  the one you   re sure is there .  or p   raps you   ve forgotten .  it   s the sort of thing that can slip your mind when you   re busy  i expect .         we shall reconnoiter  sergeant     said blouse coldly as they crawled out of the bushes .  he brushed leaves off his uniform .  thalacephalos or  as blouse referred to her     the faithful steed     had been turned loose miles back .  you couldn   t sneak around on horseback and  as jackrum had pointed out  the creature was too skinny for anyone to want to eat and too vicious for anyone to want to ride .      right  sir  yes  we might as well do that  sir     said jackrum now  all gloating helpfulness .     where would you like us to reconnoiter  sir .         there must be a secret entrance  sergeant .  no one would build a place like that with only one entrance .  agreed .         yessir .  only perhaps they kept it a secret  sir .  only trying to help  sir .      they turned at the sound of urgent praying .  wazzer had fallen to her knees  hands clasped together .  the rest of the squad edged away slowly .  piety is a wonderful thing .      what is he doing  sergeant .     said blouse .      praying  sir     said jackrum .      i   ve noticed he does it a lot .  is that  er  within regulations  sergeant .     the lieutenant whispered .      always a difficult one  sir  that one     said jackrum .     i have  myself  prayed many times on the field of battle .  many times have i said the soldier   s prayer  sir  and i don   t mind admitting it .         er   i don   t think i know that one     said blouse .      oh  i reckon the words   ll come to you soon enough  sir  once you   re up against the foe .  gen   rally  though  they   re on the lines of    oh god  let me kill this bastard before he kills me .        jackrum grinned at blouse   s expression .     that   s what i call the authorized version  sir .         yes  sergeant  but where would we be if we all prayed all the time .     said the lieutenant .      in heaven  sir  sitting at nuggan   s right hand     said jackrum promptly .     that   s what i was taught as a little nipper  sir .  of course  it   d be a bit crowded  so it   s just as well we don   t .      at which point  wazzer stopped praying and stood up  brushing dust off her knees .  she gave the squad her bright  worrying smile .      the duchess will guide our steps     she said .      oh .  good     said blouse weakly .      she will show us the way .         wonderful .  er   did she mention a map reference at all .     said the lieutenant .      she will give us eyes that we might see .         ah .  good .  well  jolly good     said blouse .     i definitely feel a lot better for knowing that .  don   t you  sergeant .         yessir     said jackrum .        cos before this  sir  we didn   t have a prayer .          they scouted in threes  while the rest of the squad lay up in a deep hollow among the bushes .  there were enemy patrols  but it   s not hard to avoid half a dozen men who stick to the tracks and aren   t being careful not to make noise .  the troops were zlobenian  and acted as though they owned the place .   for some reason  polly ended up patrolling with maladict and wazzer  or  to put it another way  a vampire on the edge and a girl who was possibly so far over it that she   d found a new edge out beyond the horizon .  she was changing every day  that was a fact .  on the day they   d all joined up  a lifetime ago  she   d been this shivering little waif who flinched at shadows .  now  sometimes  she seemed taller  full of some ethereal certainty  and shadows fled before her .  well  not in actual fact  polly would admit .  but she walked as if they should .   and then there had been the miracle of the turkey .  that was hard to explain .   the three of them had been moving along the cliffs .  they   d circled a couple of zlobenian lookout posts  forewarned by the smell of cooking fires but  alas  not by the smell of any coffee .  maladict seemed to be mostly in control  except for a tendency to mutter to himself in letters and numbers  but polly had stopped that by threatening to hit him with a stick the very next time he did it .   they   d reached a cliff edge that gave yet another view of the keep  and once again polly raised the telescope and scanned the sheer walls and jumbled rocks for any sign of another entrance .      look down at the river     said wazzer .   the circle of view blurred upwards as polly shifted the scope  when it stopped moving she saw whiteness .  she had to lower the instrument to see what she   d been looking at .      oh my     she said .     there   s blouse   s secret entrance  right where anyone can see it .         makes sense  though     said maladict .     and there   s a path all along the river  see .  there   s a couple more women on it .         tiny gateway  though     said polly .     and it   d be so easy to search people for weapons .         soldiers couldn   t get through though     said the vampire .      we could     said polly .     and we   re soldiers .  aren   t we .      there was a pause before maladict said     soldiers need weapons .  swords and crossbows get noticed .         there will be weapons inside     said wazzer .     the duchess has told me .  the castle is full of weapons .         did she tell you how to make the enemy let go of them .     said maladict .      all right  all right     said polly quickly .     we ought to tell the rupert as soon as possible  okay .  let   s get back .         hold on  i   m the corporal     said maladict .      well .     said polly .     and .         let   s get back .     said maladict .      good idea .      she should have listened to the birdsong  she realized later .  the shrill calls in the distance would have told her the news  if only she   d been calm enough to listen .   they hadn   t gone more than thirty yards before they saw the soldiers .  someone in the zlobenian army was dangerously clever .  he   d realized that the way to spot interlopers was not to march noisily along the beaten paths  but to sneak quietly between the trees .   the soldier had a crossbow  it was sheer luck   probably sheer luck that he was looking the other way when polly came around a holly bush .   she flung herself behind a tree and gestured madly at maladict further down the path  who had the sense to take cover .   polly drew her sword and held it clutched to her chest in both hands .  she could hear the man .  he was some way away  but he was moving toward her .  probably the little lookout they had just found was a regular point on the patrol route .  after all  she thought bitterly  it was just the sort of thing some untrained idiots might come across  maybe a quiet patrol could even surprise them there     she shut her eyes and tried to breathe normally .  this was it this was it this was it .  this was where she found out .   what to remember what to remember what to remember   when the metal meets the meat   be holding the metal .   she could taste metal in her mouth .   the man would walk right past her .  he   d be alert  but not that alert .  a slash would be better than a stab .  yes  a good swipe at head height would kill        some mother   s son  some sister   s brother  some lad who   d followed the drum for a shilling and his first new suit .  if only she   d been trained  if only she   d had a few weeks stabbing straw men until she could believe that all men were made of straw     she froze .  down the angle of the path  still as a tree  head bowed  stood wazzer .  as soon as the scout reached polly   s tree  she   d be seen .   she   d have to do it now .  perhaps that   s why men did it .  you didn   t do it to save duchesses  or countries .  you killed the enemy to stop him killing your mates  that they in turn might save you     she could hear the cautious tread close to the tree .  she raised the saber  saw the light flash along its edge     a wild turkey rose from the scrub on the other side of the path in one rocketing tower of wings and feathers and echoing noise .  half flying  half running  it bounded off into the woods .   there was the thud of a bow and a last squawk .      oh  good shot  woody     said a voice nearby .     looks like a big   n .         did you see that .     said another voice .     another step and i   d have tripped over it .      behind her tree  polly breathed out .   a third voice  some way off  called out     let   s head back  eh  corp .  the way that went off  the tiger   s probably run a mile .         yeah  and i   m so scared     said the closest voice .     the tiger   s behind every tree  right .         okay  let   s call it a day .  my wife   ll cook him a treat        gradually  the voices of the soldiers got lost among the trees .   polly lowered the sword .  she saw maladict peer out of his bush and stare at her .  she raised a finger to her lips .  he nodded .   she waited until the birdsong had settled down a little before stepping out .  wazzer seemed to be lost in thought  polly took her very carefully by the hand .  quietly  dodging from tree to tree  they headed back to the hollow .  most particularly  polly and maladict didn   t talk .  but they looked one another in the eye once or twice .   of course a turkey would lie low until a hunter almost trod on it .  of course that one must   ve been there all the time  and only lost its bird nerve when the scout crept up .  it had been an unusually large bird  one that no hungry soldier could resist  but   well .   since the brain treacherously does not stop thinking just because you want it to  polly   s added  she said the duchess could move small things .  how small is a thought in the mind of a bird .   only jade and igorina were waiting for them in the hollow .  the others had found a better base a mile away  they said .      we found the secret entrance     said polly quietly  as they headed away .      can we get in .     said igorina .      it   s the washerwomen   s entrance     said maladict .     it   s right down by the river .  but there   s a path .         washerwomen .     said igor .     but this is a war .         clothes still get dirty  i suppose     said polly .      dirtier  i should think     said maladict .      but   our countrywomen .  washing clothes for the enemy .     said igorina  looking shocked .      if it   s that or starve  yes     said polly .     i saw a woman come out carrying a basket of loaves .  they say the keep is full of granaries .  anyway  you sewed up an enemy officer  didn   t you .         that   s different     said igorina .     we are duty bound to thave our fellow ma   person .  nothing has ever been said about his   their underwear .         we could get in     said polly     if we disguised ourselves as women .      silence greeted this .  then      disguised .     said igorina .      you know what i mean .     said polly .      as washerwomen .     said igorina .     these are thurgeon   s hands .         really .  where did you get them .     said maladict .  igorina stuck out her tongue at him .      anyway  i don   t intend that we should do any washing     said polly .      then what do you intend .     said igorina .   polly hesitated .      you know i want to get my brother out if he   s in there     she said .     and if we could stop the invasion  that would be a good idea .         that might take extra starch     said maladict .     i don   t want to  you know  spoil the spirit of the moment  but that is a really awful idea .  the el tee won   t agree to something as wild as that .         no  he won   t     said polly .     but he   ll suggest it .            hmm     said blouse a little later .     washerwomen .  is that usual  sergeant jackrum .         oh  yes  sir .  i expect the women in the villages round here do it  just like they did when we held the keep     said jackrum .      you mean they provide aid and comfort to the enemy .  why .         better than starving  sir .  fact of life .  it doesn   t always stop at washing  neither .         sergeant  there are young men here .     snapped blouse  blushing .      they   ll have to find out about ironing and darning sooner or later  sir     said jackrum innocently .   blouse opened his mouth .  blouse shut his mouth .      tea   s up  sir     said polly .  tea was an amazingly useful thing .  it gave you an excuse to talk to anyone .   they settled in what remained of a half ruined farmhouse .  by the look of it  not even patrols bothered to come here   there were no signs of lit fires or even the most temporary occupation .  it stank of decay  and half the roof was gone .      do the women just come and go  perks .     said the lieutenant .      yes  sir     said polly .     and i had an idea  sir .  permission to tell you my idea  sir .     she saw jackrum raise an eyebrow .  she was laying it on thick  she had to admit  but time was pressing .      please do  perks     said blouse .     else i fear you may explode .         they could be spies for us  sir .  we could even get them to open the gates for us .         well done  private .     said blouse .     i do like a soldier to think .         yeah  right     growled jackrum .     any sharper   n he   ll cut hisself .  sir  they   re washerwomen  sir  basically .  no offense to young perks  keen lad that he is  but your average guard pays attention when old mother riley tries to open the gates .  there   s not just a pair of gates  neither .  there   s six pairs  and nice little courtyards between    em for the guards to have a squint at you to see if you   s a wrong    un  and drawbridges  and spiky ceilings that drop down if someone doesn   t like the look of you .  try opening that lot with soapy hands .         i   m afraid the sergeant has a point  perks     said blouse sadly .      well  supposing a couple of women managed to knock out a few guards  sir  they could let us in through their little door .     said polly .     we might even be able to capture the commander of the fort  sir .  i bet there   s plenty of women in the keep  sir .  in the kitchens and so on .  they could   open doors for us .         oh  come on  perks       jackrum began .      no  sergeant .  wait .     said blouse .     astonishingly enough  perks  in your boyish enthusiasm you have  although you haven   t realized it  given me a very interesting idea           have i  sir .     said polly  who in her boyish enthusiasm had considered trying to tattoo the idea on blouse   s head .  for someone so clever  he really was slow .      indeed you have  perks     said blouse .     because  of course  we only need one    washerwoman    to get us inside  do we not .      the quotes sounded promising .     well  yes  sir     said polly .      and  if one as it were thinks    outside of the box     the    woman    does not in fact need to be a woman .      blouse beamed .  polly allowed her brow to wrinkle in honest puzzlement .      doesn   t she  sir .     she said .     i don   t think i quite understand  sir .  i am perplexed  sir .            she    could be a man  perks .     said blouse  almost exploding with delight .     one of us .  in disguise .      polly breathed a sigh of relief .  sergeant jackrum laughed .      bless you  sir  dressing up as washerwomen is for gettin    out of places .  milit   ry rules .         if a man gets inside  he could disable any guards near the door  spy out the situation from a military perspective  and let the rest of the troops in .     said blouse .     if this was done at night  men  we could be holding key positions by the morning .         but these aren   t men  sir     said jackrum .  polly turned .  the sergeant was looking right at her  right through her .  oh darn  i mean damn   he knows        i beg your pardon .         they are   my little lads  sir     jackrum went on  winking at polly .     keen lads  full of mustard  but they ain   t ones for cuttin    throats and stabbin    hearts .  they signed up to be pikemen in the press  sir  in a proper army .  you are my little lads  i says to    em when i signed    em up  and i will look after you .  i can   t stand by and let you take    em to certain death .         it   s my decision to make  sergeant     said blouse .     we are at    the hinge of destiny .     who  in the pinch  is not ready to lay down his life for his country .         in a proper stand up fight  sir  not getting beaten over the head by a bunch of nasty men for creeping around their fort .  you know i   ve never been one for spies an    hidin    your colors  sir  never .         sergeant  we have no choice .  we must take advantage of the    tide of fortune    .         i know about tides  sir .  they leave little fish gaspin    .     the sergeant stood up  fists clenching .      your concern for your men does you credit  sergeant  but it falls to us           a famous last stand  sir .     said jackrum .  he spat expertly into the fire in the tumbledown hearth .     to hell with them  sir .  that   s just a way of dyin    famous .         sergeant  your insubordination is getting           i   ll go     said polly quietly .   both men stopped  turned  and stared .      i   ll go     polly repeated louder .     someone ought to .         don   t be daft  perks .     snapped jackrum .     you don   t know what   s in there  you don   t know what guards are waitin    just inside the door  you don   t know           i   ll find out  then  sarge  won   t i     said polly  smiling desperately .     maybe i can get to somewhere where you can see and send signals  or           on this issue  at least  the sergeant and i are of one mind  perks     said blouse .     really  private  it would simply not work .  oh  you   re brave  certainly  but what makes you think you stand a chance of passing yourself off as a woman .         well  sir   what .         your keenness will not go unrecorded  perks .     said blouse  smiling .     but  y   know  a good officer keeps an eye on his men and i have to say that i   ve noticed in you  in all of you  little   habits  perfectly normal  nothing to worry about  like the occasional deep exploration of a nostril maybe  and a tendency to grin after passing wind  a natural boyish inclination to  ahem  scratch your   your selves in public   that sort of thing .  these are the kind of little details that   d give you away in a trice and tell any observer that you were a man in women   s clothing  believe me .         i   m sure i could pull it off  sir     said polly weakly .  she could sense jackrum   s eyes on her .  you bloomi   you bloody well know  don   t you .  how long have you known .   blouse shook his head .     no  they would see through you in a flash .  you are a fine bunch of lads  but there is only one man here who   d stand a change of getting away with it .  manickle .         yessir .     said shufti  rigid with instant panic .      can you find me a dress  do you think .      maladict was the first to break the silence .      sir  are you telling us   you   re going to try to get in dressed as a woman .         well  i   m clearly the only one who   s had any practice     said blouse  rubbing his hands together .     at my old school  we were in and out of skirts all the time .      he looked around at the circle of absolutely expressionless faces .      theatricals  you see .     he said brightly .     no gels at our boarding school  of course .  but we didn   t let that stop us .  why  my lady spritely in a comedy of cuckolds is still talked about  i understand  and as for my yumyum is   is sergeant jackrum all right .      the sergeant had folded up  but  with his face still level with his knees  he managed to croak     old war wound  sir .  come upon me sudden  like .         please help him  private igor .  where was i   i can see you all look puzzled  but there   s nothing strange about this .  fine old tradition  men dressing up as gels .  in the sixth form  the chaps used to do it for a jape all the time .     he paused for a moment  and added thoughtfully     especially wrigglesworth  for some reason       he shook his head as if dislodging a thought and went on     anyway  i have some experience in this field  d   ye see .         and   what would you do if   i mean when you got in  sir .     said polly .     you won   t just have to fool the guards .  there   d be other women in there .         that will not present a problem  perks     said blouse .     i shall act in a feminine way and i have this stage trick  d   ye see  where i make my voice sound quite high pitched  like this .     the falsetto could have scratched glass .     see .     he said .     no  if we need a woman  i   m your man .         amazing  sir     said maladict .     for a moment i could have sworn there was a woman in the room .         and i could certainly find out if there are any other badly guarded entrances     blouse went on .     who knows  i might even be able to procure a key off one of the guards by means of feminine wiles .  in any case  if things are all clear i shall send a signal .  a towel hanging from a window  perhaps .  something clearly unusual  anyway .      there was some more silence .  several of the squad were staring at the ceiling .      ye es     said polly .     i can see you   ve thought this out carefully  sir .      blouse sighed .     if only wrigglesworth were here     he said .      why  sir .         amazingly clever chap at layin    his hands on a dress  young wrigglesworth     said the lieutenant .   polly caught maladict   s eye .  the vampire made a face and shrugged .      um       said shufti .      yes  manickle .         i do have a petticoat in my pack  sir .         good heavens .  why .      shufti went red .  she hadn   t worked out an answer .      bandageth  thur     igorina cut in smoothly .      yes .  yes .  that   s right .     said shufti .     i   found it in the inn  back in pl  n           i athked the lads to acquire any thuitable linen they might find  thur .  jutht in cathe .         very sound thinking  that man .     said blouse .     anyone else got anything .         i wouldn   t be at all thurprithed  thur     said igor  staring around the room .   glances were exchanged .  packs were unslung .  everyone except polly and maladict had something  produced with downcast eyes .  a shift  a petticoat  and  in most cases  a dimity scarf  carried out of some sort of residual  unexplainable need .      you obviously must   ve thought we   d take serious damage     said blouse .      can   t be too careful  thur     said igorina .  she grinned at polly .      of course  i have rather short hair at present       blouse mused .   polly thought of her ringlets  now lost and probably stroked by strappi .  but desperation spooled through her memory .      they looked like older women  mostly     she said quickly .     they wore headscarves and wimples .  i   m sure igori   sure igor can make up something  sir .         we igorth are very rethorthful  thur     igorina agreed .  she pulled a black leather wallet out of her jacket .     ten minuteth with a needle  thur  tha   th all i need .         oh  i can do old women wonderfully well     said blouse .  with a speed that made lofty jump  he suddenly thrust out both hands twisted like claws  contorted his face into an expression of mad imbecility and screeched     oh deary me .  my poor old feet .  things today aren   t like they used to be .  lawks .      behind him  sergeant jackrum put his head in his hands .      amazing  sir     said maladict .     i   ve never seen a transformation like it .         perhaps just a wee bit less old  sir .     polly suggested  although in truth blouse had reminded her of her aunt hattie two thirds of the way through a glass of sherry .      you think so .     said blouse .     oh  well  if you   re really sure .         and  er  if you do meet a guard  er  old women don   t usually try to  try to              canoodle       cut in maladict  whose mind had clearly being hurtling down the same horrible slope .         canoodle with them     polly added  blushing  and then  after a second   s thought  added     unless she   s had a glass of sherry  anyway .         and i do thuggetht you go and have a thhave  thur           thhave .     said blouse .      shave  sir     said polly .     i   ll lay out the kit  sir .         ooh  yes .  of course .  don   t see many old women with beards  eh .  except my auntie parthenope  as i recall .  and   er   no one   s got a couple of balloons  have they .     asked the lieutenant .      er  why  sir .     said tonker .      a big bosom always gets a laugh     said blouse .  he looked around the row of faces .     not a good idea  perhaps .  i got a huge round of applause as the widow trembler in    tis pity she   s a tree .  no .         i think igor could sew something a bit more  er  realistic  sir     said polly .      really .  oh  well  if you really think so     said blouse dejectedly .     i   ll just go and get myself into character .      he disappeared into the building   s only other room .  after a few seconds  the rest of them heard him reciting    lawks  my poor feet .     in varying tones of fingernail screech .   the squad went into a huddle .      what was all that about .     said tonker .      he was talking about the theater     said maladict .      what   s that .         an abomination unto nuggan  of course     said the vampire .     it   d take too long to explain  dear child .  people pretending to be other people to tell a story in a huge room where the world is a different place .  other people sitting and watching them and eating chocolate .  very  very abominable .         i would like to eat chocolates in a great big room where the world is a different place     mumbled lofty sadly .      i saw a punch and judy show in the town once     said shufti .     then they dragged the man away and it became an abomination .         i remember that     said polly .  crocodiles should not be seen to eat figures of authority  apparently  although until the puppet show no one in the town knew what a crocodile was .  the bit where the clown had beaten his wife had also contravened abomination  because he   d used a stick thicker than the regulation one inch .      the lieutenant won   t last a minute  you know     she said .      yes  but he won   t listen  will he     said igorina .     i   ll do the best with my scissorth and needle to make a woman of him but           igorina  when it   s you talking about this sort of thing  some very strange pictures turn up in my head     said maladict .      sorry     said igorina .      can you pray for him  wazzer .     said polly .     i think we   re going to need a miracle here .      wazzer obediently closed her eyes and folded her hands for a moment and then said shyly     i   m afraid she says it will take more than a turkey .         wazz .     said polly     do you really       then she stopped  with the bright little face watching her .      yes  i do     said wazzer .     i really talk to the duchess .         yeah  well  i used to  too     snapped tonker .     i used to beg her  once upon a time .  that stupid face just stared and did nothing .  she never stopped anything .  all that stuff  all that stupid       the girl stopped  too many words blocking her brain .     anyway  why should she talk to you .         because i listen     said wazzer quietly .      and what does she say .         sometimes she just cries .         she cries .         because there are so many things that people want  and she can   t give them anything .      wazzer gave them all one of her smiles that lit up the room .      but everything will be fine when i am in the right place     she said .      well  that   s all right  then       polly began  in that cloud of deep embarrassment that wazzer called up within her .      yeah  right     said tonker .     but i   m not praying to anyone  okay .  ever again .  i don   t like this  wazz .  you   re a decent kid  but i don   t like the way you smile       she stopped .     oh  no        polly stared at wazzer .  her face was thin and all angles  and the duchess in the painting had looked  well  like an overfed turbot  but now the smile  the actual smile        i   m not putting up with that .     tonker snarled .     you stop that right now .  i mean it .  you   re giving me the creeps .  ozz  you stop her   him smiling like that .         just calm down  all of you       polly began .      bleedin    well shut up .     said jackrum .     a man can   t hear himself chew .  look  you   re all edgy .  that happens .  and wazzer here   s just got a bit of religion before the fight .  that happens  too .  and what you do is  you save it all up for the enemy .  quieten down .  that is what we in the milit   ry call a order  okay .         perks .     it was blouse .      you   d better hurry     said maladict .     his corset probably wants lacing           in fact  blouse was sitting on what remained of a chair .      ah  perks .  a shave  please     he said .      oh  i thought your hand was better  sir           er   yes .     blouse looked awkward .     the problem  perks  is   i have never actually shaved myself at all  to be honest .  i had a man to do it for me at school  and then  of course  in the army i shared a batman with blitherskite and  er  those attempts i made on my own behalf have been somewhat bloody .  i never really thought about it until i got to plotz and  er   suddenly it was embarrassing           sorry about that  sir     said polly .  it was a strange old world .      later on  perhaps you could give me a few tips     blouse went on .     you keep yourself beautifully shaven  i can   t help noticing .  general froc would be pleased .  he   s very anti whiskers  they say .         if you like  sir     said polly .  there was no getting out of it .  she made a show of sharpening the razor .  perhaps she could manage it with only a few small cuts        do you think i should have a reddened nose .     said blouse .      probably  sir     said polly .  sarge knows about me  i   m sure  she thought .  i know he does .  why   s he keeping quiet .      probably  perks .         what .  oh .  no   why a red nose  sir .     said polly  applying the lather with vigor .      it would look more pfh amusing  perhaps .         not sure that   s the purpose of the exercise  sir .  now  if you   d just  er  lie back  sir           there   s something you should know about young perks  sir .      polly actually yelped .   walking as silently as only a sergeant can  jackrum had stolen into the room .      pfh  sergeant .     said blouse .      perks doesn   t know how to shave a man  sir     said jackrum .     give me the razor  perks .         doesn   t know how to shave .     said blouse .      nosir .  perks lied to us  right  perks .         all right  sarge  no need to drag it out     sighed polly .     lieutenant  i   m              under age     said jackrum .     right  perks .  only fourteen  aren   t you .      jackrum looked at polly over the top of the lieutenant   s head  and winked .      er   i told a lie to get enlisted  sir  yes     said polly .      i don   t think a lad like that ought to be dragged into the keep  however game he is     said jackrum .     and i don   t think he   s the only one .  right  perks .      oh  so that   s the game .  blackmail  polly thought .      yes  sarge     she said wearily .      can   t have a massacre of little lads  sir  now can we .     said jackrum .      i see your pfh point  sergeant     said the lieutenant  as jackrum gently drove the blade down his cheek .     that is a tricky one .         best to call it a day  then .     said jackrum .      on the other hand  sergeant  i do know that you pfh yourself joined up as a child     said blouse .  the blade stopped moving .      well  it was all different in those       jackrum began .      you were five years old  apparently     the lieutenant went on .     you see  when i heard that i would be meeting you  a legend in the army  of course i had a look at our files so that i could  perhaps  make a few timely jokes in presenting you with your honorable discharge .  you know  humorous little reminiscences about times gone by .  imagine how puzzled i was  therefore  to find that you appear to have been drawing actual wages for  well  it was a little hard to be certain  but possibly as much as sixty years .      polly had put a keen edge on the razor .  it rested against the lieutenant   s cheek .  polly thought about the murder   oh  all right  the killing of an escaping prisoner   in the woods .  it won   t be the first officer i   ve killed        probably one of them clerical errors  sir     said jackrum coldly .  in the gloomy room  with moss now colonizing the walls  the sergeant loomed large .   an owl  perched on the chimney  gave a screech .  it echoed down into the room .      in fact  no  sergeant     said blouse  apparently oblivious to the razor .     your package  sergeant  had been tampered with .  on numerous occasions .  once  even by general froc .  he deducted ten years from your age and signed the change .  and he wasn   t the only one .  frankly  sergeant  i   m forced to only one conclusion .         and what   s that  sir .     the razor halted again  still pressed against blouse   s neck .   the silence seemed to last for some time  sharp and drawn out .      that there was some other man called jackrum     said blouse slowly     whose records have   got mixed up with yours and   every attempt to sort it out by officers who were  er  not entirely at home with figures only made it more confusing .      the razor started to move again  with silky smoothness .      i think you   ve put your finger right on it  sir     said jackrum .      i am going to write an explanatory note and add it to the packet     blouse went on .     it seems to me the sensible thing to do would be to ask you here and now how old you are .  how old are you  sergeant .         forty three  sir     said jackrum instantly .  polly looked up  expecting the generic thunderclap that ought to accompany such a universe sized untruth .      are you sure .     said blouse .      forty five  sir .  the hardships of a soldier   s life shows up onna face  sir .         even so           ah  i recall a couple of extra birthdays what had slipped my memory  sir .  i   m forty seven  sir .     still no rumble of celestial disapproval  polly noticed .      er   yes .  very well .  after all  you should know  eh  sergeant .  i shall amend it .         thank you  sir .         just like general froc did .  and major galosh .  and colonel legin  sergeant .         yessir .  clerical error has followed me around all the days of my life  sir .  i   ve been a martyr to it .     jackrum stood back .     there we are  sir .  face as smooth as a baby   s bum .  smooth is how things should be  eh  sir .  i   ve always liked things smooth .         they watched lieutenant blouse walk down through the trees to the path .  they watched him join the erratic  straggling line of women on their way to the door .  they listened for screams  and heard none .      d does any woman sway that much .     said wazzer  peering through the bushes .      not legally  i think     said polly  scanning the keep with the lieutenant   s telescope .     well  we   ll just have to wait for some sort of signal that he   s okay .      somewhere overhead  a buzzard screamed .      no  they   ll have got him the moment he walked through the door     said maladict .     bet on it .      they left jade on watch .  with her paint scraped off  a troll could settle into rocky scenery so well that no one was likely to notice her before they walked into her  and by the time they   d walked into her it was too late .   they made their way back through the woods  and had almost reached the ruined farmhouse when it happened .      you are holding up well  mal     said polly .     maybe those acorns did the trick .  you haven   t mentioned coffee at all        maladict stopped and turned slowly .  to polly   s horror  his face was suddenly shiny with sweat .      you had to bring it up  didn   t you .     he said hoarsely .     oh  please  no .  i was holding on so tight .  i was doing so well .      he fell forward  but managed to get onto his hands and knees .  then he raised his head  and his eyes were glowing red .      fetch   igorina     he muttered  gasping .     i know she   s ready for this           wopwopwop     wazzer was praying furiously .  maladict tried to stand up again  fell back onto his knees  and raised his arms imploringly to the sky .      get out of here while you can     he mumbled as his teeth visibly lengthened .     i   ll        there was a shadow  a sense of movement  and the vampire slumped forward  stunned by an eight ounce sack of coffee beans that had dropped out of a clear sky .      polly arrived at the farmhouse carrying maladict on her shoulder .  she made him as comfortable as possible on some ancient straw  and the squad consulted .      do you think we ought to try to take the sack out of his mouth .     said shufti nervously .      i tried  but he fights     said polly .      but he   s unconscious .         he still won   t let go of it .  he   s sucking it .  i   d swear he was out cold  but he just sort of reached out and grabbed it and bit .  it dropped out of a clear sky .      tonker stared at wazzer .      the duchess does room service .     she said .      no .  she says she d didn   t .         you get freak rainth of fish     said igorina  kneeling down by maladict .     i suppose it   s possible that a whirlwind tore through a coffee plantation  and then possibly a lightning discharge in the upper ether           at what point did it blow through a factory making small coffee sacks .     said tonker .     ones with a jolly  turbaned man printed on them apparently saying    klatchian rare roasted .  when a pickax is not enough .            well  if you   re going to put it like that  it does seem a little far fetched       igorina admitted .   she stood up  adding     i think he   ll be fine when he wakes up .  possibly a little talkative  though .         okay  lads  get some rest     said jackrum  stamping in .     let   s give the rupert a couple of hours to muck things up  and then we can nip around the valley and slip down through and join the rest of the army .  good grub and proper blankets to sleep on  hey .  that   s the ticket .         we don   t know he   s going to mess up  sarge     said polly .      oh  yeah  right  maybe he   ll have married the commander of the garrison by now  eh .  stranger things have happened  although i can   t remember when .  perks and manickle  you   re on watch .  the rest of you  get some shut eye .         a zlobenian patrol went past in the distance .  polly watched it out of sight .  it was turning into a fine day  warm with a bit of wind .  good drying weather .  a good day to be a washerwoman .  and maybe blouse would succeed .  maybe all the guards were blind .      pol .     shufti whispered .      yes  shuf   look  what was your name back in the world .         betty .  it   s betty .  er   most of the ins and outs are in the keep  right .         apparently .         so that   s where i   m most likely to find my fianc    yes .     we   ve talked about that  polly thought .      could be .         might be quite hard if there   s a lot of men       said betty  a woman with something on her mind .      well  if we get as far as the prisoners and ask around  they   ll be bound to know his name .  what is it .         johnny     whispered betty .      just johnny .     said polly .      er   yes        ah  polly thought .  i think i know how this goes        he   s got fair hair and blue eyes  and i think he had one gold earring and  and a funny shaped   what d   you call it .  oh  yes   sort of carbuncle on his  his   bottom     betty went on .      right .  right .         um   now i come to tell someone  it doesn   t sound very helpful  i suppose .      not unless we   re in a position to have a very unusual identification parade  polly thought  and i can   t imagine what position that would be .      not as such     she said .      he said everyone in the regiment knows him     betty went on .      right .  oh  good     said polly .     all we need to do is ask .         and  er  we were going to break a sixpence in half  you know  like they do  so that if he had to be away for years we   d be sure we   d got the right person    cos the two halves would match           oh  that would be a bit of a help  i expect     said polly .      well  yes  except  well  i gave him the sixpence  and he said he   d get the blacksmith to break it in his vise  and he went off and  er  i think he got called away       betty   s voice trailed off .   well  that was about what i expected  polly thought .      i expect you think i   m a silly girl     mumbled betty after a while .      a foolish woman  perhaps     said polly  turning to watch the landscape intently .      it was  you know  a whirlwind romance           sounds more like a hurricane to me     said polly  and betty grinned .      yes  it was a bit like that     she said .   polly matched smile for smile .     betty  it   s daft to talk about silly and foolish at a time like this     she said .     where are we going to look for wisdom .  to a god who hates jigsaws and the color blue .  a fossil government led by a picture .  an army that thinks stubbornness is the same as courage .  compared to all that  all you   ve got wrong is timing .         i don   t want to end up in the school  though     said betty aka shufti .     they took away a girl from our village and she was kicking and screaming           then fight them .     said polly .     you   ve got a sword now  haven   t you .  fight back .     she saw the look of horror on betty   s face  and remembered that this wasn   t tonker she was talking to .     look  if we get out of this alive we   ll talk to the colonel .  he might be able to help .     after all  perhaps your boy really was called johnny  she thought  perhaps he really was called away suddenly .  hope is a wonderful thing .  she went on     if we get out of this  there   s going to be no school and no beatings .  not for you or any of us .  not if we   ve got brains .  not if we   re smart .      betty was almost in tears  but she managed another smile .     and wazzer   s talking to the duchess  too .  she   ll fix things .      polly stared out at the bright  unchanging landscape  empty except for a buzzard making wide circles in the forbidden blue .      i   m not sure about that     she said .     but someone up there likes us .         twilight was brief at this time of year .  there had been no sign from blouse .      i watched until i couldn   t see     said jade as they sat and watched shufti make stew .     some of der women dat came out was ones i saw goin    in dis mornin     too .         are you sure .     said jackrum .      we might be fick  sarge     said jade  looking hurt     but trolls have great   er   vis you all ack you it tee .  more women was going in dis evenin     too .         night shift     said tonker .      oh well  he tried     said jackrum .     with any luck he   s in a nice warm cell and they   ve found him a pair of long pants .  get your kit together  lads .  we   ll creep around and into our lines and you   ll be snug in bed by midnight .      polly remembered what she   d said  hours ago  about fighting .  you had to start somewhere .      i want to try the keep again     she said .      you do  perks  do you .     said jackrum  with mock interest .      my brother   s in there .         nice safe place for him  then .         he might be injured .  i vote for the keep .         vote .     said jackrum .     my word  that   s a new one .  voting in the army .  who wants to get killed  lads  let   s have a show of hands .  knock it off  perks .         i   m going to try it  sarge .         you are not .         try and stop me .     the words came out before she could stop them .  and that   s it  she thought  the shout heard round the world .  no going back after this .  i   ve run off the edge of the cliff and it   s all downhill from here .   jackrum   s expression stayed blank for a second or two  and then he said     anyone else voting for the keep .      polly looked at shufti  who blushed .   but      we are     said tonker .  beside her  lofty struck a match  and held it so that it flared .  that was pretty much a speech from lofty .      why  pray .     said jackrum .      we don   t want to sit around in a swamp     said tonker .     and we don   t like being ordered about .         should have thought of that before you joined an army  lad .         we aren   t lads  sarge .         you are if i says you are .      well  it   s not as though i wasn   t expecting it  polly thought .  i   ve played this out enough times in my head .  here goes        all right  sarge     she said .     it   s time to have it out  here and now .         ooo  er     said jackrum theatrically  fishing his screwed up paper of tobacco out of his pocket .      what .      jackrum sat down on the remains of a wall .     just injecting a little sauciness into the conversation     he said .     carry on  perks .  have your say .  i thought it   d come to this .         you know i   m a woman  sarge     said polly .      yup .  i wouldn   t trust you to shave cheese .      the squad stared .  jackrum opened his big knife and examined the chewing tobacco as though it was the most interesting thing present .      so   er   what are you going to do about it .     said polly  feeling derailed .      dunno .  can   t do anything  can i .  you were born like it .         you didn   t tell blouse .     said polly .      nope .      polly wanted to knock the wretched tobacco out of the sergeant   s hand .  now that she had got over the surprise  there was something offensive about this lack of reaction .  it was like someone opening a door just before your battering ram hit it  suddenly you were running through the building and not certain how to stop .      well  we   re all women  sarge     said tonker .     how about that .      jackrum sawed at the tobacco .      so .     he said  still paying attention to the job in hand .      what .     said polly .      think no one else ever tried it .  think you   re the only ones .  think your ol    sarge is deaf  blind  and stupid .  you could fool one another and anyone can fool a rupert  but you can   t fool jackrum .  weren   t sure about maladict and still ain   t  because with a vampire  who knows .  and not sure about you  carborundum  because with a troll  who cares .  no offense .         none taken     rumbled jade .  she caught polly   s eye and shrugged .      not so good at reading the signs  not knowing many trolls     said the sergeant .     i had you down pat in the first minute  ozz .  something in the eyes  i reckon .  like   you were watching to see how good you were .      oh hell  polly thought .     er   do i have a pair of socks belonging to you .         yep .  well washed  i might add .         you   ll have them back right now .     said polly  grabbing for her belt .      in your own time  perks  in your own time  no rush     said jackrum raising a hand .     well washed  please .         why  sarge .     said tonker .     why didn   t you give us away .  you could   ve given us away any time .      jackrum slewed his wad from cheek to cheek and sat chewing for a while  staring at nothing .      no  you ain   t the first     he said .     i   ve seen a few .  mostly by themselves  always frightened   and mostly they didn   t last long .  but one or two of them were bonny soldiers  very bonny soldiers indeed .  so i looked at you lot and i thought to myself  well now  i thought  i wonder how they   ll do when they find out they   re not alone .  you know about lions .     they nodded .     well  the lion is a big ol    coward  mostly .  if you want trouble  you want to tangle with the lioness .  they   re killers  and they hunt together .  it   s the same everywhere .  if you want big grief  look to the ladies .  even with insects  right .  there   s a kind of beetle where she bites his head off right while he   s exercisin    his conjugals  and that   s what i call serious grief .  on the other hand  from what i heard  he carries on regardless  so maybe it   s not the same for beetles .      he looked around at their blank expressions .      no .     he said .     well  maybe i thought  a whole bunch of girls all at once  that   s   strange .  maybe there   s a reason .     polly saw him glance briefly at wazzer .     anyway  i wasn   t goin    to shame you all in front of a little toad like strappi  and then there was all that business in plotz  and then  well  we was gallopin     as it were  caught up in things with no time to get off .  you did well  lads .  very well .  shaped up like good    uns .         i   m going into the keep     said polly .      oh  don   t worry about the rupert     said jackrum .     probably he   s enjoying a nice bowl of scubbo right now .  he went to a school for young gentlemen  so prison will be just like old times .         we   re still going  sarge .  sorry     said polly .      oh  don   t say sorry  perks  you were doing well up    til then     said jackrum bitterly .   shufti stood up .     i   m going  too     she said .     i think my   fianc   is in there .         i have to go     said wazzer .     the duchess guides my steps .         i   ll go  then     said igorina .     i   m probably going to be needed .         i shouldn   t fink i could get by as a washerwoman     rumbled jade .     i   ll stay here and watch over mal .  hah  if he   s still after blood when he wakes up he   s gonna have blunt teeth .      they looked at one another in silence  embarrassed but defiant .   then there was the sound of someone clapping slowly .      oh  very nice     said jackrum .     a band of brothers  eh .  sorry   sisters .  oh dear  oh dear .  look  blouse was a fool .  it was prob   ly all them books .  he read all that stuff about it being a noble thing to die for your country  i expect .  i was never that keen on readin     but i know the job is making some other poor devil die for his .      he slewed his black tobacco from side to side .     i wanted you to be safe  lads .  down in the press of men  i reckoned i could get you through this  no matter how many friends the prince has sent after you .  i look at you  lads  and i think  you poor boys  you don   t know nothin    about war .  what you goin    to do .  tonker  you are a crack shot  but after one shot  who   s backing you up while you reload .  perks  you know a trick or two  but the blokes in the castle will maybe know a trick or five .  you   re a good cook  shufti  too bad it   s going to be too hot in there .  will the duchess turn aside arrows  wazzer .         yes .  she will .         i hope you are right  my lad     said jackrum  giving the girl a long slow look .     pers   nally  i   ve found religion in battle is as much use as a chocolate helmet .  you   ll need more than a prayer if prince heinrich catches you  i might add .         we   re going to try it  sarge     said polly .     there   s nothing for us in the army .         will you come with us  sarge .     said shufti .      no  lad .  me as a washerwoman .  i doubt it .  don   t seem to have a skirt anywhere about me  for a start .  er   just one thing  lads .  how are you going to get in .         in the morning .  when we see the women going in again     said polly .      got it all planned  general .  and you   ll be dressed as women .         er   we are women  sarge     said polly .      yes  lad .  technical detail .  but you kitted out the rupert with all your little knickknacks  didn   t you .  what   re you going to do  tell the guards you opened the wrong cupboard in the dark .      another embarrassed silence descended .   jackrum sighed .      this ain   t proper war     he said .     still  i said i   d look after you .  you are my little lads  i said .     his eyes gleamed .     and you still are  even if the world   s turned upside down .  i   ll just have to hope  miss perks  that you picked up a few tricks from ol    sarge  although i reckon you can think of a few of your own .  and now i   d better get you kitted up  right .         perhaps we could sneak in and steal something from the villages where the servants come from .     said tonker .      from a bunch of poor women .     said polly  her heart sinking .     anyway  there   d be soldiers everywhere .         well  how do we get women   s clothes on a battlefield .     said lofty .   jackrum laughed  stood up  stuck his thumbs in his belt  and grinned .      i told you  lads  you don   t know nothin    about war .     he said .         and one of the things they didn   t know was that it had edges .   polly wasn   t certain what she   d expected .  men and horses  obviously .  in her mind   s eye  they were engaged in mortal combat  but obviously you couldn   t go on doing that all day .  so there would be tents .  and that was about as far as the mind   s eye had seen .   it hadn   t seen that an army on campaign is a sort of large  portable city .  it has only one employer  and it manufactures dead people  but  like all cities  it attracts   citizens .   what was unnerving was the sound of babies crying  off in the rows of tents .  she hadn   t expected that .  or the mud .  or the crowds .  everywhere there were fires  and the smell of cooking .  this was a siege  after all .  people had settled in .   getting down onto the plain in the dark had been easy .  there was only polly and shufti trailing after the sergeant  who   d said that more would be too many and in any case would attract too much attention .   there were patrols  but their edge had been dulled by sheer repetitiveness .  besides  the allies weren   t expecting anyone to make much effort to get into the valley  at least in small groups .  and men in the dark make noise  far more noise than a woman .  they   d located a borogravian sentry in the gloom by the noise of him trying to suck a morsel of dinner out of his teeth .   but another one had located them when they were a stone   s throw from the tents .  he was young  so he was still keen .      halt .  who goes there .  friend or foe .      the light from a cooking fire glinted off a crossbow .      see .     whispered jackrum .     this is where your uniform is your friend .  aren   t you glad you kept it .      he swaggered forwards  and spat tobacco between the young sentry   s boots .      my name   s jackrum     he said .     that   s sergeant jackrum .  as for the other bit   you choose .         sergeant jackrum .     said the boy  his mouth staying open .      yes  lad .         what  the one who killed sixteen men at the battle of zop .         there was only ten of    em  but good lad for knowin    it .         the jackrum who carried general froc through fourteen miles of enemy territory .         that   s right .      polly saw teeth in the gloom as the sentry grinned .      my dad told me he fought with you at blunderberg .         ah  that was a hot battle  that was .     said jackrum .      no  he meant in the pub afterwards .  he pinched your drink and you smacked him in the gob and he kicked you in the nadgers and you hit him in the guts and he blacked your eye and then you hit him with a table and when he came round his mates stood him beer for the evening for managing to lay nearly three punches on sergeant jackrum .  he tells the story every year  when it   s the anniversary and he   s pis   reminiscing .      jackrum thought for a moment  and then jabbed a finger at the young man .      joe hubukurk  right .     he said .   the smile broadened to the point where the top of the young man   s head was in danger of falling off .      he   ll be smirking all day when i tell him you remember him  sarge .     said the sentry .     he says that where you piss grass don   t grow .         well  what can a modest man say to that  eh .     said jackrum .  then the young man frowned .      funny  though  he thought you were dead  sarge     he said .      tell him i bet him a shilling i   m not     said jackrum .     and your name  lad .         lart  sarge .  lart hubukurk .         glad you joined  are you .         yes  sarge     said lart loyally .      we   re just having a stroll  lad .  tell your dad i asked after him .         i will  sarge .     the boy stood to attention like a one man guard of honor .     this is a proud moment for me  sarge .         does everyone know you  sarge .     whispered polly as they walked away .      aye  pretty much .  on our side  anyway .  i   ll make so bold as to declare that most of the enemy that meets me don   t know anything much afterwards .         i never thought it was going to be like this .     hissed shufti .      like what .     said jackrum .      there   s women and children .  shops .  i can smell bread baking .  it   s like a   a city .         yeah  but what we   re after isn   t going to be in the main streets .  follow me  lads .      sergeant jackrum  suddenly furtive  ducked between two big heaps of boxes and emerged beside a smithy  its forge glowing in the dusk .   here the tents were open sided .  armorers and saddlers worked by lantern light  shadows flickering across the mud .  polly and shufti had to step out of the way of a mule train  each animal carrying two casks on its back  the mules moved aside for jackrum .  maybe he   s met them before  too  thought polly  maybe he really does know everyone .   the sergeant walked like a man with the deeds to the world .  he acknowledged other sergeants with a nod  lazily saluted the few officers there were around here  and ignored everybody else .      you been here before  sarge .     said shufti .      no  lad .         but you know where you   re going .         correct .  i ain   t been here  but i know battlefields  especially when everyone   s had a chance to dig in .     jackrum sniffed the air .     ah  right .  that   s the stuff .  just you two wait here .      he disappeared between two stacks of lumber .  they heard a distant muttering and  after a moment or two  jackrum reappeared holding a small bottle .   polly grinned .     is that rum  sarge .         well done  my little bar steward .  and would be nice if it was rum  upon my word .  or whiskey or gin or brandy .  but this don   t have none of those fancy names .  this is the genuine stingo  this is .  pure hangman .         hangman .     said shufti .      one drop and you   re dead     said polly .  jackrum beamed  as a master to a keen pupil .      that   s right  shufti .  it   s rotgut .  wheresoever men are gathered together  someone will find something to ferment in a rubber boot  distill in an old kettle  and flog to his mates .  made from rats  by the smell of it .  ferments well  does your average rat .  fancy a taste .      shufti shied away from the proffered bottle .  the sergeant laughed .      good lad .  stick to beer     he said .      don   t the officers stop it .     said polly .      officers .  what do they know about anything .     said jackrum .     an    i bought this off of a sergeant  too .  anyone watching us .      polly peered into the gloom .     no  sarge .      jackrum poured some of the liquid into one pudgy hand and splashed it onto his face .      ye ouch     he hissed .     stings like the blazes .  and now to kill the tooth worms .  got to do the job properly .     he took a quick sip from the bottle  spat it out  and shoved the cork back in .      muck     he said .     okay  let   s go .         where are we going  sarge .     said shufti .     you can tell us now  can   t you .         a quiet little place where our needs will be met     said jackrum .     it   s around here somewhere .         you don   t half smell of drink  sarge     said shufti .     will they let you in if you smell drunk .         yes  shufti  lad  they will     said jackrum  setting off again .     the reason being  my pockets jingle and i smell of booze .  everyone likes a rich drunk .  ah   down this little valley here  that   ll be our   yeah  i was right .  this is the place .  tucked away  delicate like .  see any clothes hanging out to dry  boys .      there were a few washing lines strung behind the half a dozen or so drab tents in this side valley  which was little more than a wash gouged out by winter rains .  if there had been anything on them it had been taken in against the heavy dew .      shame     said jackrum .     okay  so we   ll have to do it the hard way .  remember  just act natural and listen to what i say .         i   m s shaking  sarge     shufti muttered .      good  good  very natural     said jackrum .     this is our place  i think .  nice and quiet  no one watching us  nice little path up there to the top of the wash         he stopped outside a very large tent and tapped on the board outside with his swagger stick .      the solid doves     polly read .      yeah  well  these ladies weren   t hired for their spelling     said jackrum  pushing open the flap of the tent of ill repute .   inside was a stuffy little area  a sort of canvas antechamber .  a lady  lumpy and crowlike in a black bombazine dress  rose from a chair and gave the trio the most calculating look polly had ever met .  it finished off by putting a price on her boots .   the sergeant doffed his cap and in a jovial  rotund voice that peed brandy and crapped plum pudding  said     good evening  madarm .  sergeant smith   s the name  yes indeed .  an    me and my bold lads here have been so fortunate as to acquire the spoils of war  if you catch my drift  and nothing would do for it but they were clamoring  clamoring to go to the nearest house of good repute for to have a man made of    em .      little beady eyes skewered polly again .  shufti  ears glowing like signal beacons  was staring fixedly at the ground .      looks like that   d be a job and a half     said the woman shortly .      you never spoke a truer word  madarm .     beamed jackrum .     two of your fair flowers apiece should do it  i reckon .     there was a clink as  staggering slightly  jackrum put several gold coins on the rickety little table .   something about the gleam of it thawed things no end .  the woman   s face cracked into a smile as glutinous as slug gravy .      well  now  we are always honored to entertain the ins and outs  sergeant     she said .     if you   gentlemen would like to step through to the  er  inner sanctum .      polly heard a very faint sound behind her  and turned .  she hadn   t noticed the man sitting on a chair just inside the door .  he had to be a man  because trolls weren   t pink  he made eyebrow back in pl  n look like some kind of weed .  he wore leather  which was what she   d heard creaking  and he had his eyes just slightly open .  when he saw her looking at him  he winked .  it wasn   t a friendly wink .   there are times when a plan suddenly isn   t going to work .  when you   re in the middle of it  is not the time to find this out .      er  sarge     she said .  the sergeant turned  saw her frantic grimace  and appeared to spot the guard for the first time .      oh dear  where   s my manners .     he said  lurching back and fumbling in his pocket .  he came up with a gold coin  which he folded in the astonished man   s hand .  then he turned around  tapping the side of his nose with an expression of idiot knowingness .      a word of advice  lads     he said .     always give the guard a tip .  he keeps the riffraff out  very important .  very important man .      he stumbled back to the lady in black and belched hugely .      and now  madarm  if we can meet these visions of loveliness you are hiding under this here bushel .     he said .   it depended  polly thought a few seconds later  on how and when and after drinking how much of what that you had those visions .  she knew about these places .  serving behind a bar can really broaden your education .  there were a number of ladies back home who were  as her mother put it     no better than they should be     and at twelve years old  polly had got a smack for asking how good they should have been  then .  they were an abomination unto nuggan  but men have always found space in their religion for a little sinning here and there .   the word to describe the four ladies seated in the room beyond  if you wanted to be kind  was    tired .     if you didn   t want to be kind  a whole range of words were just hanging in the air .   they looked up without much interest .      this is faith  prudence  grace  and comfort     said the lady of the house .     the night shift has not yet come on  i   m afraid .         i   m sure these beauties will be a great education for my roaring boys     said the sergeant .     but   may i be so bold as to inquire about your name  madarm .         i   m mrs .  smother  sergeant .         and you have a first name  may i ask .         dolores     said mrs .  smother     to my   special friends .         well now  dolores     said jackrum  and there was another jingle of coins in his pocket     i will come right out with it and be frank  because i can see you are a woman of the world .  these frail blossoms are all very well in their way  for i know the fashion these days is for ladies with less meat on    em than a butcher   s pencil  but a gentleman such as me  who has been around the world and seen a thing or two  well  he learns the value of   maturity .     he sighed .     not to mention hope and patience .     the coins jingled again .     perhaps you and i might retire to some suitable boodwah  madarm  and discuss the matter over a cordial or two .      mrs .  smother looked from the sergeant to the    lads     glanced back in the anteroom  and looked back at jackrum with her head on one side and a thin  calculating smile on her lips .      ye s     she said .     you   re a fine figure of a man  sergeant smith .  let us take a load off your   pockets  shall we .      she joined arm in arm with the sergeant  who winked roguishly at polly and shufti .      we   re well set  then  lads .     he chuckled .     now  just so   s you don   t get carried away  when it   s time to go i   ll blow my whistle and you   d better have finished what you   re doin     haha  and meet me sharpish .  duty calls .  remember the fine tradition of the ins and outs .      giggling and almost tripping up  he left the room on the arm of the proprietress .   shufti sidled hurriedly up to polly and whispered     is sarge all right  ozzer .         he   s just had a bit too much to drink     said polly loudly  as all four of the girls stood up .      but he       shufti got a nudge in the ribs before she could say anymore .  one of the girls carefully laid down her knitting  took polly   s arm  flashed her well crafted expression of interest  and said     you   re a well set up young man  aren   t you   what   s your name  dear .  i   m gracie .         oliver     said polly .  and what the hell is the fine tradition of the ins and outs .      ever seen a woman with no clothes on before  oliver .     the girls giggled .   polly   s brow wrinkled as  just for a moment  she was caught unawares .     yes     she said .     of course .         ooo  it looks like we   ve got ourselves a regular don joo ann  girls     said gracie  stepping back .     we may have to send out for reinforcements .  why don   t you an    me and prudence go off to a little nook i know  and your little friend will be the guest of faith and comfort .  comfort   s very good with young men  ain   t you  comfort .      sergeant jackrum had been wrong in his description of the girls .  three of them were indeed several meals short of a healthy weight  but when comfort got up out of her large armchair you realized that it had  in fact  been quite a small armchair and had mostly been comfort .  for a large woman  she had a small face  locked in a piggy eyed scowl .  there was a death   s head tattoo on one arm .      he   s young     said gracie .     he   ll heal .  come along  don joo ann        in a way  polly was relieved .  she didn   t take to the girls .  oh  the profession could bring anyone down  but she   d got to know some of the town   s ladies of uneasy virtue and they had an edge she couldn   t find here .      why do you work here .     she said as they entered a smaller  canvas walled room .  there was a rickety bed taking up most of the space .      you know  you look a bit too young to be that sort of customer     said gracie .      what sort .     said polly .      oh  a holy joe     said gracie .        what   s a girl like you doing in a place like this .     and all that stuff .  feel sorry for us  do you .  at least if someone cuts up rough we   ve got garry outside and after he   s finished with the bloke the colonel gets told and the bastard gets bunged in clink .         yeah     said prudence .     from what we hear  we   re the safest ladies within twenty five miles .  old smother   s not too bad .  we get money to keep and we get fed and she don   t beat us  which is more than can be said for husbands  and you can   t wander around loose  now  can you .      jackrum put up with blouse because you   ve got to have an officer  polly thought .  if you don   t have an officer  some other officer   ll take you over .  and a woman by herself is missing a man  while a man by himself is his own master .   trousers .  that   s the secret .  trousers and a pair of socks .  i never dreamed it was like this .  put on trousers and the world changes .  we walk different .  we act different .  i see these girls and i think  idiots .  get yourself some trousers .      can you please get your clothes off .     she said .     i think we   d better hurry .         one of the ins and outs  this one     said gracie  slipping her dress off her shoulders .     keep an eye on your cheeses  pru .         er   why does that mean we   re in the ins and outs .     said polly .  she made a show of unbuttoning her jacket  wishing that she believed in anyone there to pray to so that she could pray for the whistle .      that   s    cos you lads always have your eye on business     said gracie .   and maybe there was someone listening  at that .  the whistle blew .   polly grabbed the dresses and ran out  oblivious to the yells behind her .  she collided with shufti outside  tripped over the groaning form of garry  saw sergeant jackrum holding the tent flap open  and bulleted into the night .      this way .     the sergeant hissed  grabbing her by the collar before she   d gone a few feet and swinging her around .     you too  shufti .  move .      he ran up the side of the wash like a child   s balloon being blown by the wind  leaving them to scramble after him .  his arms were full of clothing  which snagged and danced behind him .   up above was knee deep scrub  treacherous in the gloom .  they tripped and staggered across it until they reached heavier growth  whereupon the sergeant got hold of both of them and pushed them into the bushes .  the shouts and screams were fainter now .      now we   ll just keep quiet  like     he whispered .     there   s patrols about .         they   ll be bound to find us     polly hissed  while shufti wheezed .      no  they won   t     said jackrum .     first  they   ll all be running towards the shoutin     because that   s natur   there they go        polly heard more shouts in the distance .      and bloody fools they are  too .  they   re supposed to be guarding the perimeter  and they   re running towards trouble in the camp .  and they   re running straight towards lamplight  so there goes their night eyes .  if i was their sergeant they   d be due a fizzer .  c   mon .     he stood up  and pulled shufti to her feet .     feeling all right  lad .         it w was horrible  sarge .  one of them put her hand   on   on my socks .         something that doesn   t often happen  i   ll bet any man     said jackrum .     but you did a good job .  now  we   ll walk nice and quiet  and no more talking    til i say  okay .      they plodded on for ten minutes  skirting the camp .  they heard several patrols  and saw a couple of others on the hilltops as the moon rose  but it dawned on polly that loud though the shouting had been  it was only part of the huge patchwork of sound that rose out of the camp .  the patrols this far away probably hadn   t heard it  or at least were commanded by the kind of soldiers who didn   t want to get put on a fizzer .   in the dark  she heard jackrum take a deep breath .      okay  that   s far enough .  not a bad job of work  lads .  you   re real ins and outs now .         that guard was out cold .     said polly .     did you hit him .         y   see  i   m fat     said jackrum .     people don   t think fat men can fight .  they think fat men are funny .  they think wrong .  gave    im a chop to the windpipe .         sarge .     said shufti  horrified .      what .  what .  he was coming at me with his club .     said jackrum .      why was he doing that  sarge .     said polly .      ooh  you cunning soldier  you     said jackrum .     all right  i grant you that i   d just given madarm the ol    quietus  but  to be fair  i know when someone   s just handed me a bleedin    drink full o    sleepy drops .         you hit a woman  sarge .     said polly .      yeah  and maybe when she wakes up in her corsets she   ll decide that next time a poor ol    drunk fat man wanders in it mightn   t be such a good idea to try to roll him for his wad     growled jackrum .     i   d be in a ditch wi   out my drawers on and a damned great headache if she   d had her way  and if you two was daft enough to complain to an officer  she   d swear black was blue that i didn   t have a penny on me when i came in and was drunk and disorderly .  and the colonel wouldn   t care a fig     cos he   d reckon a sergeant daft enough to get caught like that had it coming to him .  i know  you see .  i look after my lads .     there was a clink in the dark .     plus a few extra dollars won   t go amiss .         sarge  you didn   t steal the cashbox  did you .     said polly .      yeah .  got a good armful of her wardrobe  too .         good .     said shufti fervently .     it wasn   t a nice place .         it was mostly my money in any case     said jackrum .     business has been a bit slow today  by the feel of it .         but it   s immoral earnings .     said polly  and then felt a complete fool for saying it .      no     said jackrum .     it was immoral earnings  now it   s the proceeds of common theft .  life   s a lot easier when you learns to think straight .         polly was glad there was no mirror .  the best that could be said for the squad   s new clothing was that it covered them up .  but this was a war .  you seldom saw new clothes on anybody .   yet they felt awkward .  and there was no sense in that at all .  but they looked at one another in the chilly light of dawn and giggled in embarrassment .  wow  polly thought  look at us  dressed as women .   oddly enough  it was igorina who really looked the part .  she   d disappeared into the other tumbledown room carrying her pack .  for ten minutes the squad had heard the occasional grunt or    ouch     and then she   d returned with a full head of fair  shoulder length hair .  her face was the right shape  missing the lumps and bumps they   d come to know .  and the stitches on her forehead shrank and disappeared as polly watched in astonishment .      doesn   t that hurt .     she said .      it smarts a bit for a few minutes     said igorina .     you just have to have the knack .  and the special ointment  of course .         but why   s there a curved scar on your cheek now .     said tonker .     and those stitches are staying .      igorina looked down demurely .  she   d even restyled one of the dresses into a dirndl  and looked like a fresh young maid from the beercellar .  just to look at her was to mentally order a large pretzel .      you   ve got to have something to show     she said .     otherwise you   re letting down the clan .  and actually i think the stitches are rather fetching           well  okay     tonker conceded .     but lisp a bit  will you .  i know this is completely wrong  but now you look  oh  i don   t know   weird  i suppose .         okay  line up     said jackrum .   he stood back and gave them a look of theatrical disdain .     well  i   ve never seen such a lot of scrubb   washerwomen in all my life     he said .     i wish you all the luck you   re bleedin    well gonna need .  there   ll be someone watching the door for you to come out  and that   s all i can promise .  private perks  you   re acting  unpaid corporal on this one .  i hope you   ve picked up one or two little lessons on our stroll .  in and out  that   s what you should do .  no famous last stands  please .  when in doubt  kick    em in the nadgers and scarper .  mind you  if you frighten them like you frighten me  you should have no trouble .         are you sure you won   t join us  sarge .     said tonker  still trying not to laugh .      no  lad .  you won   t get me in skirts .  everyone has their place  right .  the place where they draw the line .  well  that   s mine .  i   m pretty steeped in sin  one way and another  but jackrum always shows his colors .  i   m an old soldier .  i   ll fight like a soldier does  in the ranks  on the battlefield .  besides  if i went in there simpering in petticoats i   d never hear the end of it .         the duchess says there is a d different path for sergeant jackrum     said wazzer .      and i don   t know if you don   t frighten me worst of all  private goom     said jackrum .  he hitched up his equatorial belt .     you   re right  though .  when you   re inside i shall nip down  nice and quiet  and slip into our lines .  if i can   t raise a little diversionary attack  my name   s not sergeant jackrum .  and since it is sergeant jackrum  that proves it .  hah  there   s plenty of men in this man   s army that owe me a favor     he gave a little sniff and added     or wouldn   t say no to my face .  and plenty of likely lads who   ll want to tell their grandchildren they fought alongside jackrum  too .  well  i   ll give    em their chance at real soldierin    .         sarge  it   ll be suicide to attack the main gates .     said polly .   jackrum slapped his belly .      see this lot .     he said .     it   s like having yer own armor .  bloke once stuck a blade in this up to the hilt and was surprised as hell when i nutted him .  anyway  you lads   ll be making so much fuss the guards will be distracted  right .  you   re relying on me  i   m relying on you .  that   s milit   ry  that is .  you give me a signal  any signal .  that   s all i   ll need .         the duchess says your path takes you further     said wazzer .      oh yeah .     said jackrum jovially .     and where   s that  then .  somewhere with a good pub  i hope .         the duchess says  um  it should lead to the town of scritz     said wazzer .  she said it quietly while the rest of the squad were laughing  not so much at jackrum   s comment as a way of losing some of the tension .  but polly heard it .   jackrum was really  really good  she thought .  the fleeting expression of terror was gone in an instant .      scritz .  nothing there     said jackrum .     dull town .         there was a sword     said wazzer .   jackrum was ready this time .  there was not a flicker of expression  just the blank face that he was so good at .  and that was odd  polly thought  because there should have been something  even if it was only puzzlement .      handled lots of swords in my time     he said dismissively .     yes  private halter .         there   s one thing you didn   t tell us  sarge     said tonker  lowering her hand .     why is the regiment called the ins and outs .         first into battle  last out of the fray     said jackrum automatically .      so why are we nicknamed the cheesemongers .         yes     said shufti .     why  sarge .  because the way those girls were talking  it sounded like it   s something we ought to know .      jackrum made a clicking noise of exasperation .     oh  tonker  why the hell did you wait    til you   d got your trousers off before asking me that .  i   ll feel embarrassed telling yer now .     and polly thought  that   s dangling bait  right .  you want to tell us .  you want to get any conversation away from scritz        ah     said tonker .     it   s about sex  then  is it .         not as such  no           well  tell me  then     said tonker .     i   d like to know before i die .  if it makes you feel any better i   ll nudge people and go gnher  gnher  gnher .      jackrum sighed .     there   s a song     he said .     it starts       twas on a monday morning  all in the month of may              then it is about sex     said polly flatly .     it   s a folk song  it starts with       twas     it takes place in may  qed  it   s about sex .  is a milkmaid involved .  i bet she is .         there could be     jackrum conceded .      going for to market .  for to sell her wares .     said polly .      very likely .         o kay .  that gives us the cheese .  and she meets  let   s see  a soldier  a sailor  a jolly ploughboy  or just possibly a man cloth  d all in leather  i expect .  no  since it   s about us  it   s a soldier  right .  and since it   s one of the ins and outs   oh dear  i feel a humorous double entendre coming on .  just one question  what item of her clothing fell down or came untied .         her garter     said jackrum .     you   ve heard it before  perks .         no  but i just know how folk songs go .  we had folk singers in the lower bar for six months back hom   where i worked .  in the end we had to get a man in with a ferret .  but you remember stuff   oh  no           was there canoodling  sarge .     said tonker  grinning .      kayaking  i expect     said igorina  to general sniggering .      no  he stole the cheese  didn   t he .     sighed polly .     as the poor girl was lying there  waiting for her garter to be tied  hem hem  he damn well made off with her cheese  right .         er   not damn .  not with the skirt on  ozz     tonker warned .      then it   s not ozz  either     said polly .     fill yer hat with bread  fill yer boots with soup .  and steal the cheese  eh  sarge .         that   s right .  we   ve always been a very practical regiment     said jackrum .     an army marches on its stomach  lads .  on mine  o   course  it could hold a parade .         it was her own fault  she should have been able to tie up her own garters     said lofty .      yeah .  probably wanted her cheese stolen     said tonker .      wise words     said jackrum .     off you go  then   cheesemongers .      the mist was still thick as they made their way down through the woods to the path by the river .   polly   s skirt kept catching in brambles .  it must have done so before she   d joined up  but she   d never noticed it so much .  now it was seriously hindering her .   she reached up and absentmindedly adjusted the socks  which she   d separated to use as padding elsewhere .  she was too skinny  that was the trouble .  the ringlets would have been useful there .  they would have said    girl .     in their absence  she had to rely on a scarf and a socks change .      all right     she whispered as the ground leveled out .     remember  no swearing .  giggle  don   t snigger .  no belching .  no weapons  either .  they can   t be that stupid in there .  anyone brought a weapon .      there was a shaking of heads .      did you bring a weapon  tonk   magda .         no  polly .         no item of any sort with a certain weaponlike quality .     polly insisted .      no  polly     said tonker demurely .      anything  perhaps  with an edge .         oh  you mean this .         yes  magda .         well  a woman can carry a knife  can   t she .         it   s a saber  magda .  you   re trying to hide it  but it   s a saber .         but i   m only using it like a knife  polly .         it   s three feet long  magda .         size isn   t important  polly .         no one believes that .  leave it behind a tree  please .  that is an order .         oh  all right .      after a while  shufti  who had appeared to be thinking deeply  said     i can   t understand why she didn   t just tie up her own garter            shuft  what the hell       tonker began .         heck     polly corrected her     and you   re talking to betty  remember .         what the heck are you talking about  betty .     said tonker  rolling her eyes .      well  the song  of course .  and you don   t have to lie down to tie a garter in any case .  it   d be more difficult     said shufti .     it   s all a bit silly .      no one said anything for a while .  it was  perhaps  easy to see why shufti was on her quest .      you   re right     said polly eventually .     it   s a silly song .         a very silly song     tonker agreed .   they all agreed .  it was a silly song .   they stepped out onto the river path .  ahead of them  a small group of women were hurrying around the bend in the cliff .   automatically  the squad looked up .  the keep grew out of the sheer cliff  it was hard to see where the unhewn rock ended and the ancient masonry began .  they could see no windows .  from here  it was just a wall extending to the sky .  no way in  it said .  no way out .  in this wall are few doors  and they close with finality .   this close to the deep  slow river  the air was bone chilling cold  and grew colder the higher they looked .   around the curve they could see the little rock shelf where the back door was  and the women ahead of them talking to a guard .      this is not going to work     said shufti under her breath .     they   re showing him some papers .  anyone brought theirs .  no .      the soldier had looked up and was watching the girls with that blank official expression of someone who was not looking for excitement or adventure in his life .      keep moving     murmured polly .     if it all gets really bad  burst into tears .         that   s disgusting     said tonker .   their treacherous feet were taking them closer all the time .  polly kept her eyes downwards  as was proper in an unmarried woman .  there would be others watching  she knew it .  they   d probably be bored  they might not be expecting any trouble  but up on those walls there were eyes fixed on her .   they reached the guard .  just inside the narrow stone doorway  there was another one  lounging in the shadow .      papers     said the guard .      oh  sir  i have none     said polly .  she   d been working out the speech on the way down through the wood .  war  fears of invasion  people fleeing  no food   you didn   t have to make things up  you just had to reassemble reality .     i had to leave           oh  right     the guard interrupted .     no papers .  no problem .  if you   d just step in and see my colleague .  nice of you to join us .     he stood aside and waved a hand toward the dark entrance .   mystified  polly stepped inside  with the others following .   behind them  the door swung shut .   inside  she saw that they were in a long passage with many slits in the wall to rooms on either side .  lamplight shone from the slits .  she could see shadows beyond them .  bowmen could turn anyone trapped in here into mince .   at the end of the corridor another door swung open .  it led into a small room in which there sat  at a desk  a young man in a uniform polly didn   t recognize  although it had a captain   s insignia .  standing to one side was a much  much larger man in the same uniform  or possibly two uniforms stitched together .  he had a sword .  there was that about him  when this man held a sword  it was clearly held  and held by him .  the eye was drawn to it .  even jade would have been impressed .      good morning  ladies     said the captain .     no papers  eh .  take off your scarves  please .      and that   s it  thought polly as the bottom of her stomach dropped away .  and we thought we were being clever .  there was nothing for it but to obey .      ah .  you   ll tell me your hair got shaved off as a punishment for fraternizing with the enemy  eh .     said man  barely looking up .     except for you     he added to igorina .     didn   t feel like fraternizing with any enemies .  something wrong with decent zlobenian boys .         er   no     said igorina .   now the captain gave them a bright little smile .      gentlemen  let   s not mess about  shall we .  you walk wrong .  we do watch  you know .  you walk wrong and you stand wrong .  you     he pointed to tonker     have got a bit of shaving soap under one ear .  and you  lad  are either deformed or you   ve tried the old trick of sticking a pair of socks down your undershirt .      crimson with humiliation  polly hung her head .      getting in or out disguised as washerwomen     said the captain  shaking his head .     everyone outside this stupid country knows that one  lads  and most of them make more effort than you boys .  well  for you war is over .  this place has got big  big dungeons and i don   t mind telling you you   re probably going to be better off in here than outside   yeah  what do you want .      shufti had raised a hand .      can i show you something .     she said .  polly didn   t turn  but watched the captain   s face as  beside polly  cloth rustled .  she couldn   t believe it .  shufti was raising her skirt        oh     said the captain .   there was an explosion from tonker  but it was an explosion of tears .  they came out accompanied by a long  mournful wail  as she threw herself onto the floor .      we walked so oo far .  we lay in ditches to hide from soldiers .  there   s no food .  we want to work .  you called us boys .  why are you so oo cruel .      polly knelt down and half picked her up  patting her on the back as tonker   s shoulders heaved with the force of her sobs .      it   s been very hard for all of us     she said to the red faced captain .     have you seen everything you wish to see .         if you can take him down i can garrote the other one with my apron string     whispered tonker in her ear  between howls .      no  please .     said the captain  giving the guard the agonized glance of a man who knows that he   s going to be the laughingstock of the whole fort inside the hour .     once was quite   i mean  i   ve seen   look  i   m completely satisfied .  private  go and fetch one of the women from the laundry .  i am so sorry  ladies  i   i have a job to do           do you enjoy it .     said polly  every syllable tinkling with ice .      yes .     said the captain hurriedly .     i mean  no .  no  yes .  we have to be careful   ah        the soldier had returned  trailing a woman .  polly stared .      ah  daphne  some new  er  volunteers for mrs .  enid     said the captain  waving vaguely toward the squad .     i   m sure she will have some use for them   er           certainly  captain     said the woman  curtsying demurely .  polly still stared .      off you go with daphne   ladies     said the captain .     and if you   re hard workers  mrs .  enid will  i am sure  give you a pass so   s we don   t have this trouble again   er        shufti put both hands on his desk  leaned toward him  and said    boo .     his chair hit the wall .      i may not be clever     she said to polly .     but i   m not stupid .      but polly was still staring at lieutenant blouse .  he   d curtsied surprisingly well .      the soldier escorted them along a tunnel  which opened onto a ledge overlooking what was either a cave or a room  it was at that level in the keep where there was not much difference .   this wasn   t a laundry  this was clearly some hot  damp afterlife for those who required punishment with extra scrubbing .  steam roiled across the ceiling  condensed  and dripped onto a floor that was already running with water .  and it went on forever  washtub after washtub .  women moved like ghosts through the drifting  tumbling clouds of fog .      there you go  ladies     he said and slapped blouse on the rump .     see you tonight  then  daphne .         oh  yes .     trilled blouse .      five o   clock  then     said the soldier and ambled off down the corridor .      daphne .     said polly when the man had gone .      my    nom de guerre        said blouse .     i still haven   t found a way out of the lower areas but the guards all have keys and i shall have his key in my hand by half past five .  pardon .         i think tonker  sorry  magda just bit her tongue     said polly .      her .  oh  yes .  well done for staying in character  er           polly     said polly .      good choice of name     said blouse  leading the way down some steps .     it   s a good  common  maidservanty sort of name .         yes  that   s what i thought     said polly gravely .      er   sergeant jackrum not with you  at all .     said the lieutenant with a trace of nervousness .      no  sir .  he said he was going to lead a charge on the main gates  sir  if we could send him a signal .  i hope he doesn   t try without one .         good heavens  the man   s mad     said blouse .     splendid effort from the lads  though .  well done .  you   d definitely pass for women to the casual observer .         coming from you  daphne  that is a big compliment     said polly  thinking  gosh  i   m really good at keeping a straight face .      but you didn   t need to come after me     said blouse .     i   m sorry i couldn   t get a signal to you  but mrs .  enid allowed me to stay overnight  you see .  the guards don   t do so many checks at night  so i made use of my time to look for ways into the upper keep .  all gated or really heavily guarded  i   m afraid .  however  private hauptfidel has taken rather a shine to me           well done  sir .     said polly .      sorry  i want to be clear  sir     said tonker .     you have a date with a guard .         yes  and i   ll suggest we go somewhere dark and then  when i   ve got what i want  i shall break his neck     said blouse .      isn   t that going a bit far on a first date .     said tonker .      sir  did you have any trouble getting in .     said polly .  this had been nagging at her .      no  not at all .  i just smiled and wiggled my hips and they waved me through .         didn   t they ask you for your papers .     said polly  horrified .      well  they did  but i just said i was such a silly girl i kept on losing them .  then i burst into tears  which is very feminine .  and then the captain lent me his handkerchief and said it was all right .     blouse beamed .     what about you .         oh  we had a little bit of trouble     said polly .     it was a bit hair   it was a bit awkward for a moment or two .     she fumed inside .  it seemed so unfair .      what did i tell you .     said blouse triumphantly .     it   s all down to thespian ability .  but you were plucky lads to try it .  come and meet mrs .  enid .  a very loyal lady .  the brave womenfolk of borogravia are on our side .      and  indeed  there was a picture of the duchess in the alcove that served the laundry mistress for an office .  mrs .  enid wasn   t a particularly large woman  but she had forearms like jade  a soaking wet apron  and the most mobile mouth polly had every seen .  her lips and tongue drew out every word like a big shape in the air  the laundresses  in a cavern full of hissing steam  echoes  falling water  and the thud of wet clothes on stone  watched lips when ears were overwhelmed .  when she was listening  her mouth moved all the time  too  like someone trying to dislodge a piece of nut from a tooth .  she wore her sleeves rolled up above her elbows .   she listened impassively as blouse introduced the squad .      i see     she said .     right .  you leave your lads here with me  sir .  you ought to get back to the pressing room .      when blouse has bounced and wobbled back through the steam  mrs .  enid looked them all up and down  and then straight through .      lads     she grunted .     hah .  that   s all he knows  eh .  for a woman to wear the clothes of a man is an abomination unto nuggan .         but we   re dressed as women  mrs .  enid     said polly meekly .   mrs .  enid   s mouth moved ferociously .  then she folded her arms .  it was like a barricade going up against all that was ungodly .      it   s not right     she said .     i   ve got a son and a husband prisoner in this place and i   m working mesself to the bone for the enemy just so   s i can keep an eye on    em .  they   re gonna invade  y   know .  it   s amazing what we hear down here .  so what good   s rescuing your men going to do    em when we   re all under the heel of the zlobenian hand painted clog  eh .         zlobenia will not invade     said wazzer confidently .     the duchess will see to it .  be not afraid .      wazzer got the sort of look she always got when someone heard her for the first time .      been praying     ave yer .     said mrs .  enid kindly .      no  just listening     said wazzer .      nuggan talks to you  does he .         no .  nuggan is dead  mrs .  enid     said wazzer .   polly took wazzer   s matchstick thin arm and said     excuse us a moment  mrs .  enid .      she hustled the girl behind a huge  water driven clothes mangle .  it heaved and clanked as a background to their conversation .      wazzer  this is getting       polly   s native tongue had no word for    freaky     but if she had known about the word she would have welcomed its inclusion       strange .  you   re worrying people .  you can   t just go around saying that a god is dead .         gone  then .  dwindled   i think     said wazzer  her brow furrowing .     no longer with us           we still get the abominations .      wazzer tried to concentrate .     no  they   re not real .  they   re like   echoes .  dead voices in an ancient cave  bouncing back and forth  the words changing  making nonsense   like flags that were used for signals but now just flap in the wind       wazzer   s eyes went unfocused and her voice altered  became more adult  more certain       and they come from no god .  there is no god here now .         so where do they come from .         from your fear   they come from the part that hates the other  that will not change .  they come from the sum of all your pettiness and stupidity and dullness .  you fear tomorrow  and you   ve made your fear your god .  the duchess knows this .      the mangle creaked onwards .  around polly the boilers hissed  water gushed in the runnels .  the air was loaded with the smells of soap and damp cloth .      i don   t believe in the duchess  either     said polly .     that was just trickery in the woods .  anyone   d look around .  it doesn   t mean i believe in her .         that doesn   t matter  polly .  she believes in you .         really .     polly glanced around the steaming  dripping cave .     is she here  then .  has she graced us with her presence .      wazzer had no concept of sarcasm .  she nodded .      yes .      yes .   polly looked behind her .      did you just say yes .     she demanded .      yes     said wazzer .   yes .   polly relaxed .     oh  it   s an echo .  this is a cave  after all .  uh           which doesn   t explain why my voice doesn   t come bouncing back        wazz   i mean  alice .     she said thoughtfully .      yes  polly .     said wazzer .      i think it would be a really good idea if you don   t talk too much about this to the others     she said .     people don   t mind believing in  you know  gods and so on  but they get very nervous if you tell them they   re showing up .  er   she   s not going to show up  is she .         the person you don   t believe in .     said wazzer  showing a flash of spirit .      i   m   not saying she doesn   t exist     said polly weakly .     i just don   t believe in her  that   s all .         she   s very weak     said wazzer .     i hear her crying in the night .      polly sought for further information in the pinched up face  hoping that in some way wazzer was making fun of her .  but nothing but puzzled innocence looked back .      why does she cry .     she said .      the prayers .  they hurt her .      polly spun around when something touched her shoulder .  it was tonker .      mrs .  enid says we   re to get to work     she said .     she says the guards come around and check           it was women   s work  and therefore monotonous  backbreaking  and social .  it had been a long time since polly had got her hands in a washtub  and the ones here were long wooden troughs  where twenty women could work at once .  arms on either side of her squeezed and pummelled  wrung out garments and slapped them into the rinsing trough behind them .  polly joined in  and listened to the buzz of conversation around her .   it was gossip  but bits of information floated in it like bubbles in the washtub .  a couple of guards had    taken liberties      that is  more than had already been taken   and had apparently been flogged for it .  this caused much comment along the tub .  apparently some big mi   lord from ankh morpork was in charge of things and had ordered it .  he was some kind of wizard  said the woman opposite .  they said he could see things happening everywhere  and lived on raw meat .  they said he had secret eyes .  of course  everyone knew that city was the home of abominations .   polly  industriously rubbing a shirt on a washboard  thought about this .  and thought about a lowland buzzard in this upland country  and some creature so fast and stealthy that it was only a suggestion of shadow     she took a spell on the copper boilers  ramming the stewing garments under the bubbling surface  and noted that in this place  without weapons of any sort  she was using a heavy stick about three feet long .   she enjoyed the work  in a dumb kind of way .  her muscles did all the necessary thinking  leaving her brain free .   no one knew for sure that the duchess was dead .  it more or less didn   t matter .  but polly was sure of one thing .  the duchess had been a woman .  just a woman  not a goddess .  oh  people prayed to her in the hope that their pleas would be gift wrapped and sent on to nuggan  but that gave her no right to mess with the heads of people like wazzer  who had enough trouble as it was .  gods could do miracles  duchesses posed for pictures .   out of the corner of her eye  polly saw a line of women taking large baskets from a platform at the end of the room and stepping out through another doorway .   she dragged igorina away from the wash trough and told her to join them .      and notice everything .     she added .      yes  corp     said igorina .      because i know one thing     said polly  waving at the piles of damp linen     and it   s that this lot will need the breeze        she went back to work  occasionally joining in the chatter for the look of the thing .  it wasn   t hard .  the washerwomen kept away from some subjects  particularly ones like    husbands    and    sons .     but polly picked up clues  here and there .  some were in the keep .  some were probably dead .  some were out there  somewhere .   some of the older women wore the motherhood medal  awarded to women whose sons had died for borogravia .  the bastard metal was corroding in the damp atmosphere  and polly wondered if the medals had arrived in a letter from the duchess  with her signature printed on the bottom and the son   s name squeezed up tight to fit the space .       we honor and congratulate you  mrs .  l .  lapchick of well lane  munz  on the death of your son otto piotrhanlapchic on june    at      the place was always censored in case it brought aid and comfort to the enemy .  it astonished polly to find that the cheap medals and thoughtless words did  in a way  bring aid and comfort to the mothers .  those in munz who had received them wore them with a sort of fierce  indignant pride .   she wasn   t sure she trusted mrs .  enid very much .  she had a son and a husband up in the cells  and she   d had a chance to size up blouse .  she   d be asking herself  what   s more likely  he gets them all out and keeps them safe  or that there   s going to be an almighty mess that might well harm us all .  and polly couldn   t blame her is she went with the evidence     she was aware of someone talking to her .      hmm .     she said .      look at this  will you .     said shufti  waving a sodden pair of men   s long pants at her .     they keep putting the colors in with the whites .         well .  so what .  these are enemy long johns     said polly .      yes  but there   s such a thing as doing it properly .  look  they put in this red pair and all the others are going pink .         and .  i used to love pink when i was about seven .          but pale pink .  on a man .      polly looked at the next tub for a moment and patted shufti on the shoulder .      yes .  it is very pale  isn   t it .  you   d better find a couple more red items     she said .      but that   ll make it even worse       shufti began .      that was an order  soldier     polly whispered in her ear .     and add some starch .         how much .         all you can find .      igorina returned .  igorina had good eyes .  polly wondered if they   ve ever belonged to someone else .  she gave polly a wink and held up a thumb .  it was  to polly   s relief  one of her own .      in the huge ironing room  only one person was working at the long boards when polly  taking advantage of the temporary absence of mrs .  enid  hurried in .   it was    daphne .     all the rest of the women were gathered around  as if they were watching a demonstration .  and they were .         the collar  d   you see     said lieutenant blouse  flourishing the big  steaming  charcoal filled iron .     then the cuffs and finally the sleeves .  do one front half at a time .  you should hang them immediately but  and here   s a useful tip  don   t iron them completely dry .  it   s really a matter of practice  but        polly stared in fascinated wonder .  she   d hated ironing .      daphne  could i have a word .     she said during a pause .   blouse looked up .      oh  p   polly     he said .     um  yes  of course .         it   s amazing what daphne knows about pleat lines     said a girl  in awe .     and press cloths .         i am amazed     said polly .   blouse handed the iron to the girl .     there you are  dympha     he said generously .     remember  always iron the wrong side first  and only ever do the wrong side on dark linens .  common mistake .  coming  polly .      polly cooled her heels for a while outside  and one of the girls came up with a big pile of fresh smelling ironed laundry .  she saw polly  and leaned close as she went past .      we all know he   s a man     she said .     but he   s having such fun and he irons like a demon .         you won   t tell the guards .         what .     said the girl  grinning .     and do the ironing ourselves .  anyway  we   re dying to find out what happens when daphne goes on her date           sir  how do you know about ironing .     said polly  when they were back in the washing room .      had to do my own laundry back at hq     said blouse .     couldn   t afford a gel and the batman was a strict nugganite and said it was girl   s work .  so i thought  well  it can   t be hard  otherwise we wouldn   t leave it to women .  they really aren   t very good here .  you know they put the colors and the whites together .         sir  you know you said you were going to steal a gate key off a guard and break his neck .     said polly .      indeed .         do you know how to break a man   s neck  sir .         i read a book on martial arts  perks     said blouse  a little severely .      but you haven   t actually done it  sir .         well  no .  i was at hq  and you are not allowed to practice on real people  perks .         you see  the person whose neck you want to break will have a weapon at that moment and you  sir  won   t     said polly .      i have tried out the basic principle on a rolled up blanket     said blouse reproachfully .     it seemed to work very well .         was the blanket struggling and making loud gurgling noises and kicking you in the socks  sir .         the socks .     said blouse  puzzled .      in fact  i think your other idea would be better  sir     said polly hurriedly .      yes   my  er   other idea   which one was that  exactly .         the one where we escape from the washhouse via the clothes drying area  sir  after silently disabling three guards  sir .  there   s a kind of moving room down the corridor  sir  which gets winched all the way to the roof .  two guards go up there with the women  sir  and there   s another guard up on the roof .  acting together  we   d take out each unsuspecting guard  which would be more certain than you against an armed man  with all due respect  sir  and that would leave us very well positioned to go anywhere in the keep via the rooftops  sir .  well done  sir .      there was a pause .      did i  er  go into all that detail .     said blouse .      oh  no  sir .  you shouldn   t have to  sir .  sergeants and corporals deal with the fine detail .  officers are there to see the big picture .         oh  absolutely .  and  er   how big was this particular picture .     said blouse  blinking .      oh  very big  sir .  a very big picture indeed  sir .         ah     said blouse  and straightened up and assumed what he considered to be the expression of one with panoramic vision .      some of the ladies here used to work in the upper keep  sir  when it was ours     polly went on quickly .     anticipating your order  sir  i had the squad engage them in light conversation about the layout of the place  sir .  being aware of the general thrust of your strategy  sir  i think i have found a route to the dungeons .      she paused .  it had been good flanneling  she knew .  it was almost worthy of jackrum .  she   d larded it with as many    sirs    as she dared .  and she was very proud of    anticipating your order .     she hadn   t heard jackrum use it  but with a certain amount of care it was an excuse to do almost anything .     general thrust    was pretty good  too .      dungeons     said blouse thoughtfully  momentarily losing sight of the big picture .     in fact  i thought i said           yessir .  because  sir  if we can get a lot of the lads out of the dungeons  sir  you   ll be in command inside the enemy   s citadel  sir .      blouse grew another inch  and then sagged again .     of course  there are some very senior officers here .  all of them senior to me           yessir .     said polly  well on the way to graduating from the sergeant jackrum school of outright rupert management .     perhaps we   d better try to let the enlisted men out first  sir .  we don   t want to expose the officers to enemy fire .      it was shameless and stupid  but now the light of battle was in blouse   s eyes .  polly decided to fan it  just in case .      your leadership has really been a great example to us  sir     she said .      has it .         oh  yes  sir .         no officer could have led a finer bunch of men  perks     said blouse .      probably they have  sir     said polly .      and what man could dare hope for such an opportunity  eh .     said blouse .     our names will go down in the history books .  well  mine will  obviously  and i shall jolly well see to it that you chaps get a mention  too .  and who knows .  perhaps i may win the highest accolade that a gallant officer may obtain .         what   s that  sir .     said polly dutifully .      having either a foodstuff or an item of clothing named after one     said blouse  his face radiant .     general froc got both  of course .  the frock coat and beef froc .  of course  i could never aspire that high .     he looked down bashfully .     but i have to say  perks  that i have devised several recipes  just in case .         so we   ll be eating a blouse one day  sir .     said polly .  she was watching the baskets being stacked .      possibly  possibly  if i may dare hope     said blouse .     er   my favorite is a sort of pastry ring  d   you see  soaked in rum           that   s a rum baba  sir     said polly absently .  tonker and the others were watching the stacked baskets  too .      it   s been done .            fraid so  sir .         how about   er   a dish of liver and onions .         it   s called liver and onions  sir .  sorry     said polly  trying not to lose concentration .      er  er  well  it has struck me that some dishes are named after people when really they just made a little change to a basic recipe           we must go now  sir .  now or never  sir .         what .  oh .  right .  yes .  we must go .      it was a military maneuver hitherto unrecorded .  the squad  coming from different directions on polly   s signal  arrived at the baskets just ahead of the women who   d proposed to take them up  grabbed the handles  and advanced .  only then did polly realize that probably no one else wanted the job  and were only too happy to let idiot newcomers take the strain .  the baskets were big and the wet washing was heavy .  wazzer and igorina could barely lift one basket between them .   a couple of soldiers were waiting by the door .  they looked bored  and paid little attention .   it was a long walk to the    elevator .      polly hadn   t been able to picture it when it had been described .  you had to see it .  it really was just a big open box of heavy timbers  attached to a thick rope  which ran up and down in a sort of chimney in the rock .  when they were aboard  one of the soldiers hauled on a much thinner rope that disappeared up into the darkness .  the other one lit a couple of candles  whose only apparent role was to make the darkness more gloomy .      no fainting now  girls .     he said .  his mate chuckled .   two of them and seven of us  polly thought .  the copper stick banged against her leg as she moved .  all the girls carried one somewhere  and she knew for a fact that tonker was limping because she had strapped a washing dolly under her dress .  that was for serious washerwomen  it was a long stick with what looked like a three legged milking stool on the end of it  the better for agitating clothes in a big cauldron of boiling water .  you could probably smash a skull with it .   the stone walls dropped past as the platform rose .      how thrilling .     trilled    daphne .        and this goes all the way up through your big castle  does it .         oh  no  miss .  gotta go up through the rock first  miss .  lots of old workings and everything before we get that high .         oh  i thought we were in the castle already .     blouse gave polly a worried look .      no  miss .  there   s just the washhouse down there     cos of the water .  hah  it   s a climb and a half even to the lower cellars .  lucky for you there   s this el   vator  eh .         wonderful  sergeant     said blouse  and allowed daphne back .     how does it work .         it   s    corporal     miss     said the string puller  touching his forelock .     it   s pulled up and down by pris   ners in a treadmill  miss .         oh  how horrid .         oh no  miss  it   s quite humane .  er   if you   re free after work  er  i could take you up and show you the mechanism           that would be lovely  sergeant .      polly put her hand over her eyes .  daphne was a disgrace to womanhood .   the elevator rumbled upwards  quite slowly .  mostly they passed raw rock  but sometimes there were ancient gratings or areas of masonry  suggestive of tunnels long ago blocked     there was a jerk  and the platform stopped moving .  one of the soldiers swore under his breath  but the corporal said     don   t be afraid  ladies .  this often happens .         why should we be afraid .     said polly .      well  because we   re hanging by a rope a hundred feet up the shaft and the lifting machinery   s thrown a cog .         again     said the other soldier .     nothing works properly here .         sounds like a good reason to me     said igorina .      how long will it take to repair .     said tonker .      hah .  last time it happened we were stuck for an hour .      too long  polly thought .  too many things could happen .  she looked up through the beams in the roof .  the square of daylight was a long way up .      we can   t wait     she said .      oh dear  who will save us .     blouse quavered .      we   ll have to find a way to pass the time  eh .     said one of the guards .  polly sighed .  that was one of those phrases  like    well  lookee what we have here .      that meant things were only going to get a lot worse .      we know how it is  ladies     the guard went on .     your menfolk away and all .  it   s as bad for us  too .  i can   t remember when i last kissed my wife .         and i can   t remember when i last kissed his wife  either     said the other guard .   tonker jumped up  caught a beam  and chinned herself on the top of the box .  the elevator shook and  somewhere  a piece of rock dislodged and crashed down the shaft .      hey  you can   t do that .     said the corporal .      where does it say .     said tonker .     polly  there   s one of those filled in tunnels here  only most of the stones have been knocked out .  we could get in easily .         you can   t get out .  we   ll get into trouble .     said the corporal .   polly pulled his sword out of his scabbard .  the space was too crowded to do much with it except threaten  but she had it  not him .  it made a huge difference .      you   re already in trouble     she said .     please don   t force me to make it worse .  let   s get out of here .  is that okay  daphne .         um   yes  of course     said blouse .   the other guard laid a hand on his own sword .      okay  girls  this has gone       he began  and then slumped .  shufti lowered her copper stick .      i hope i didn   t hit him too hard     she said .      who cares .  come on  i can give you all a hand up     said tonker .      igorina  could you have a look at him and       shufti began nervously .      he   s a man  and he   s groaning     said tonker from above .     that   s good enough for me .  come on .      the lone guard watched as the others were womanhandled onto the beams .      er  excuse me     he said to polly  as she helped blouse up .      yes .  what .         would you mind giving me a wallop on the back of the head .     he said  looking wretched .     so that it doesn   t look like i didn   t put up a fight against a bunch of women .         why don   t you put up a fight .     said polly  narrowing her eyes .     we   re only a bunch of women .         i   m not crazy .     said the guard .      here  let me     said igorina  producing her stick .     blows to the head are potentially harmful and should not be undertaken lightly .  turn around  sir .  remove your helmet  please .  would twenty minutes unconsciousness be okay .         yes  thanks very mu        the guard folded up .      i really hope i didn   t hurt the other one     moaned shufti from above .      he   s swearing     said polly  removing the sword .     that sounds like he   s okay .      she handed up the candles  and then was hauled onto the trembling roof of the elevator .  when she had a firm footing in the mouth of the tunnel  she found a sliver of stone and stamped it hard into the space between the shaft wall and the wooden frame  which shook .  it wasn   t going anywhere for a while .   tonker and lofty were already investigating the tunnel .  by candlelight  it looked like good masonry beyond the clumsy attempt at walling it up .      it must be cellars     said tonker .     i reckon they must   ve made the shaft not long ago and just walled up where it cut through .  could have done a better job  too .         cellars are close to dungeons     said polly .     now  pinch out one candle  because that way we   ll have light for twice as long  and then           perks  a word please .     said blouse .     over here .         yessir .      when they were standing a little apart from the rest of the squad  blouse lowered his voice and said     i don   t wish to discourage initiative  perks  but what are you doing .         er   anticipating your orders  sir .         anticipating them .         yessir .         ah .  right .  this is still small picture stuff  is it .         exactly  sir .         then my orders  perks  are to proceed with speed and caution to release the prisoners .         well done  sir .  we   ll go through this   this           crypt     said igorina  looking around .   the candle blew out .   somewhere ahead of them  in darkness absolute and velvet thick  stone moved on stone .      i wonder why this passage was sealed up .     said the voice of blouse .      i think i   ve stopped wondering why it was sealed up in such a hurry     said tonker .      i wonder who tried to open it .     said polly .       there was a crash of  as it might be  a heavy slab falling off an ornate tomb .  it could have been half a dozen other things but  somehow  that was the image that sprang to mind .  the dead air moved a little .      i don   t want to worry anyone     said shufti     but i can hear the sound of sort of feet  sort of dragging .      polly remembered the man lighting the candles .  he   s dropped the bundle of matches into the brass saucer of the candlestick  hadn   t he .  moving her hand slowly  she groped for them .      if you didn   t want to worry anyone     came the voice of tonker from the dry  thick darkness     why the hell did you just tell us that .      polly   s fingers found a sliver of wood .  she raised it to her nose  and sniffed the sulfurous smell .      i   ve got one match     she said .     i   m going to strike a light .  everyone try to see a way out .  ready .      she sidled to the invisible wall .  then she scratched the match down the stone  and yellow light filled the crypt .   someone whimpered .   polly stared  hypnotized .   the match went out .      o kay     said the subdued voice of tonker .     walking dead people .  so .         the one near the archway was the late general puhloaver .     said blouse .     i have his book on the art of defense .         best not to ask him to autograph it  sir     said polly as the squad bunched together .   there was the whimpering again .  it seemed to come from where polly remembered wazzer standing .  she heard her praying .  there were no words that she could make out  just a fierce and urgent whispering .      maybe these washing sticks can slow them down a bit .     shufti quavered .      more than being dead already .     said igorina .   no  a voice whispered  and light filled the crypt .   it was barely brighter than a glowworm  but a single photon can do a lot of work in chthonic darkness .  it rose above the kneeling wazzer until it was woman height  because it was a woman .   or  at least  it was the shadow of a woman .  no  polly saw  it was the light of a woman  a moving web of lines and highlights in which there came and went  like pictures in a fire  a female shape .      soldiers of borogravia   attention .     said wazzer .  and underneath her reedy little tone was a shadow voice  a whisper that filled and refilled the long rooms .       soldiers of borogravia   attention .   soldiers     soldiers   attention .   soldiers of borogravia       the lurching figures stopped .  they hesitated .  they shuffled backwards .  with a certain amount of clattering and tongueless bickering  they formed two lines .   wazzer stood up .      follow me       she said .       follow me        me          sir .     said polly to blouse .      i think we go  don   t you .     said the lieutenant  who seemed oblivious of wazzer   s activities now that he was in the presence of the miliary might of the centuries .     oh  god   there   s major galosh .  and major general the lord kanapay .  general annorac .  i   ve read everything he wrote .  i never thought i   d see him in the flesh .         partly flesh  sir     said polly  dragging him forward .      every great commander of the last five hundred years was buried here  perks .         i   m very pleased for you  sir .  if we could just move a little faster           it is my fondest hope that i   ll spent the rest of eternity here  you know .         wonderful  sir  but not starting today .  can we catch up with the rest of them  sir .      as they passed  hand after ragged hand was raised in jerky salute .  staring eyes gleamed in hollow faces .  the strange light glistened on dusty braid and stained  faded cloth .  and there was a noise  harsher than the whispering  deep and guttural .  it sounded like the creaking of distant doors  but individual voices rose and fell as the squad passed the dead figures     death to zlobenia   get them   remember   give them hell   vengeance   remember   they   re not human   avenge us   revenge     up ahead  wazzer had reached some high wooden doors .  they swung open at her touch .  polly hurried after her .  the light traveled with her  and the squad were on her heels .  to be too far behind was to be in the dark .      couldn   t i just ask major general       blouse began  dragging on polly   s hand .      no .  you can   t .  don   t dawdle .  come on .     polly commanded .   they reached the doors  which tonker and igorina slammed behind them .   polly leaned against the wall .      i think that was the most   most amazing moment of my life     said blouse  as the boom died away .      i think this is mine     said polly  fighting for breath .   light still glowed around wazzer  who turned to face the squad with an expression of beatific pleasure .      you must speak to the high command     she said .   you must speak to the high command  whispered the walls .      be kind to this child .          be kind to this child        this child       polly caught wazzer before she hit the ground .      what is happening with her .     said tonker .      i think the duchess really is speaking through her     said polly .  wazzer was unconscious  only the white of her eyes showing .  polly laid the girl down gently .      oh  come on .  the duchess is just a painting .  she   s dead .      sometimes you give in .  for polly  that time had been the length of time it took to walk through the crypt .  if you don   t believe  or want to believe  or if you don   t simply hope that there   s something worth believing in  why turn round .  and if you don   t believe  who are you trusting to lead you out of the grip of dead men .      dead .     she said .     so what .  what about the old soldiers back there  who haven   t faded away .  what about the light .  and you heard how wazzer   s voice sounded .         yeah  but   well  that sort of thing doesn   t happen to people you know     said tonker .      it happens to   well  strange religious people .  i mean  a few days ago she was learning how to fart loudly .         she .     whispered blouse to polly .     she .  why is        once again a part of polly   s mind overtook the sudden panic .      sorry  daphne .     she said .      oh   yes   of course   can   t be too   yes       the lieutenant murmured .   igorina knelt down by the girl and put a hand on her forehead .      she   s on fire     she said .      she used to pray all the time back at the gray house     said lofty  kneeling down .      yeah  well  there was a lot to pray about  if you weren   t strong     growled tonker .     and every bloody day we had to pray to the duchess to thank nuggan for slops you wouldn   t give to a pig .  and that damn picture everywhere  that fishy stare   i hate it .  it could drive you mad .  that   s what happened to wazz  right .  and now you want me to believe the old fat biddy is here and treating our friend there like some   puppet or something .  i don   t believe that .  and if it   s true  it shouldn   t be .      she   s burning up  magda     said lofty quietly .      d   you know why we joined up .     said tonker  red in the face .     to get away .  anything was better than what we had .  i   ve got lofty and lofty   s got me  and we   re sticking with you because there   s nothing else for us .  everyone says the zlobenians are terrible  right .  but they   ve never done anything to us  they   ve never hurt us .  if they want to come over here and hang a few bastards  i could give    em a list .  everywhere there   s something bad happening  everywhere the small minded bullies are inventing new cruelties  new ways of keeping us down  that bloody face is watching .  and you say it   s here .         we   re here     said polly .     and you are here .  and we   re going to do what we came to do and get out  understand .  you kissed the picture  you took the shilling .         i damn well didn   t kiss her face .  and a shilling   s the least they owe me .         then go .     shouted polly .     desert .  we won   t stop you  because i   m sick of your   your bullshit .  but you make up your mind right now  right now  understand .  because when we meet the enemy i don   t want to think you   re there to stab me in the back .      the words flew out before she could stop them  and there was no power in the world that could snatch them back .   tonker went pale  and a certain life drained out of her face like water from a funnel .      what was that you said .      the words    you heard me .     lined up to spring from polly   s tongue  but she hesitated .  she told herself  it doesn   t have to go this way .  you don   t have to let a pair of socks do the talking .      words that were stupid     she said .     i   m sorry .  i didn   t mean it .      tonker settled slightly .      well   all right then     she said grudgingly .     just so long as you know we   re in this for the squad  okay .  not for the army and not for the bloody duchess .         that was a treasonable speech  private halter .     said lieutenant blouse .   everyone but polly had forgotten about him  and he stood there like an easy man to forget .      however     he went on     i realize we   re all somewhat       he looked down at his dress        confused and  er  bewildered by the pace of events        tonker tried to avoid polly   s eye .      sorry  sir     she muttered  glowering .      i must make it clear that i will not stand to hear such things repeated     said blouse .      no  sir .         good     said polly quickly .     so let   s           but i will overlook it this time     blouse went on .   polly could see tonker snap .  the head raised slowly .      you   ll overlook it .     said tonker .     you will overlook it .         careful     said polly  just loud enough for tonker to hear .      let me tell you something about us  lieutenant     said tonker  grinning horribly .      we are here  private  whoever we are     snapped polly .     now let   s find the cells .         um       said igorina     we   re quite close  i think .  i can see a sign .  um   it   s at the end of this passage .  um   just behind those rather puzzled armed men with the  um    efficient looking crossbows .  um .  i think what you   ve just been saying was important and needed to be said .  only  um   not just now  perhaps .  and not so loudly .      only two guards were watching them now  raising their bows cautiously .  the other was running way down the passage  shouting .   the squad  as one man  or woman  shared the thoughts .  they   ve got bows .  we haven   t .  they   ve got a lot more swords .  they got reinforcement behind them .  all we   ve got is a darkness full of the restless dead .  we haven   t even got a prayer anymore .   nevertheless  blouse made an effort .   in the tones of daphne  he shrilled     oh  officers   we seem to have got lost on the way to the ladies room           they were not put into a dungeon  although they were marched past plenty .  there were lots of bleak stone corridors  lots of heavy doors with bars and lots and lots of bolts  and lots of armed men whose job  presumably  only became interesting if all the bolts disappeared .  they were put into a kitchen .  it was huge  and clearly not the kind of place where people chopped herbs and stuffed mushrooms .  in a gloomy  grimy  soot encrusted hall like this  cooks had probably catered for hundreds of hungry men .   occasionally the door was opened and shadowy figures stared in at them .  no one had said anything  at any time .      they were expecting us     muttered shufti .  the members of the squad were sitting on the floor with their backs to a huge  ancient chopping block  except for igorina  who was tending to the still unconscious wazzer .      they couldn   t have got that elevator up by now     said polly .     i wedged that stone in good and hard .         then maybe the washerwomen gave us away     said tonker .     i didn   t like the look of mrs .  enid .         it doesn   t matter now  does it .     said polly .     is that the only door .         there   s a storeroom at the other end     said tonker .     no exit  except a grill in the floor .         could we get out that way .         only diced .      they stared glumly at the distant door .  it had opened again  and there was some muffled conversation among the silhouettes beyond .  tonker had tried advancing on the open doorway  and found men with swords suddenly occupying it .   polly turned to look at blouse  who was slumped against the wall  staring blankly upwards .      i   d better go and tell him     she said .  tonker shrugged .   blouse opened his eyes and smiled wanly when polly approached .      ah  perks     he said .     well  we almost made it  eh .         sorry we let you down  sir     said polly .     permission to sit  sir .         treat the rather chilly flagstones as if they were your own     said blouse .     and it was i who let you down  i   m afraid .         oh  no  sir       polly protested .      you were my first command     said blouse .     well  apart from corporal drebb and he was seventy and only had one arm  poor chap .     he pinched the bridge of his nose .     all i had to do was get you to the valley .  that was all .  but  no  i foolishly dreamed of a world were everyone would one day wear a blouse .  or eat one  possibly .  i should have listened to sergeant jackrum .  oh  will ever i look my dear emmeline in the face again .         i don   t know  sir     said polly .      that was meant to be more of a rhetorical cry of despair rather than an actual question  perks     said blouse .      sorry  sir     said polly .  she took a deep breath  ready for the plunge into the icy depths of the truth .     sir  you ought to know that           and i   m afraid once they realize we aren   t women we   ll be put in the big dungeons     he said .     very big  and very dirty  i   m told .  and very crowded .         sir  we are women  sir     said polly .      yes  well done  perks  but we don   t have to pretend anymore .         you don   t understand  sir .  we really are women .  all of us .      blouse grinned nervously .     i think you   ve got a little   confused  perks .  i seem to recall that the same thing happened to wrigglesworth           sir              although i have to say he was very good at choosing curtains           no  sir .  i was a   i am a girl  and i cut my hair and pretended i was a boy and took the duchess   s shilling  sir .  take my word for it  sir  because i really don   t want to have to draw you a picture .  we played a trick on you  sir .  well  not a trick  really  but we  all of us  had reasons for being somewhere else  sir  or at least not being where we were .  we lied .      blouse stared at her .      you   re sure .         yes  sir .  i am of the female persuasion .  i check every day  sir     polly added .      and private halter .         yes  sir .         and lofty .         oh  yes  sir .  both of them  sir .  don   t go there  sir .         what about shufti .         expecting a baby  sir .      suddenly  blouse looked terrified .     oh  no .  here .         not for several months  sir  i believe .         and poor little private goom .         a girl  sir .  and igor is really an igorina .  and wherever she is  carborundum is really jade .  we   re not sure about corporal maladict .  but the rest of us definitely have pink blankets  sir .         but you didn   t act like women .         no  sir .  we acted like men  sir .  sorry  sir .  we just wanted to find our men or get away or prove a point or something .  sorry it had to happen to you  sir .         you   re sure about all this  are you .      what are you expecting me to say .  polly thought .     whoops  now i come to think about it  yes  we   re really men after all .      she settled for saying     yes  sir .         so   you   re not called oliver  then .     it seemed to polly that the lieutenant was having a lot of difficulty with all this  he kept asking the same basic question in different ways  in the hope of getting something other than the answers he didn   t want to hear .      no  sir .  i   m polly  sir           oh .  do you know there was a song about           yes  sir     said polly firmly .     believe me  i   d rather you didn   t even hum it .      blouse stared at the far wall  eyes slightly unfocused .  oh dear  polly thought .      you took a terrible risk     he said distantly .     a battlefield is no place for women .         this war isn   t staying on battlefields .  at a time like this  a pair of trousers is a girl   s best friend  sir .      blouse fell silent again .  suddenly  polly felt very sorry for him .  he was a bit of a fool  in that special way very clever people have of being foolish  but he wasn   t a bad man .  he   d been decent to the squad and he   d cared about them .  he didn   t deserve this .      sorry you have to be involved  sir     she said .   blouse looked up .     sorry .     he said  and to her amazement he was looking more cheerful than he had all day .     good heavens  you don   t have to be sorry .  do you know anything about history  polly .         can we stick with perks  sir .  i   m still a soldier .  no  i don   t know much history  sir .  at least  much that i trust .         then you   ve never heard of the amazon warriors of samothrip .  the most fearsome fighting force for hundreds of years .  all women .  absolutely merciless in battle .  they were deadly with the longbow  although in order to get maximum draw they had to cut off one of their  um   er   i say  you ladies haven   t been cutting off your  um  er           no  we haven   t cut off any um ers  sir .  only hair .      blouse looked incredibly relieved .      well  and then there   s the female bodyguards of king samuel in howandaland .  all seven feet tall  i understand  and deadly with the spear .  throughout klatch  of course  there are many stories of female warriors  often fighting alongside their men .  fearsome and fearless  i believe .  men would desert rather than face females  perks .  couldn   t deal with    em .      once again  polly felt the slight unbalanced feeling of having tried to jump a hurdle that turned out not to be there .  she took refuge in      what do you think   s going to happen now  sir .         i haven   t a clue  perks .  um   what   s wrong with young goom .  some kind of religious mania .         could be  sir     said polly guardedly .     the duchess talks to her .         oh dear     said blouse .     she        the door opened .  a dozen soldiers filed in and spread out on either side .  they wore a variety of uniforms   mostly zlobenian  but polly recognized several as ankh morporkic or whatever they called it .  they were all armed  and held their weapons like men who expected to use them .   when they had lined up and were glaring at the squad  a smaller group of men stepped in .  again  there was a variety of uniforms  but they were a lot more expensive .  these were worn by officers   high ranking ones  to judge by the expressions of disdain .   the tallest of them  made taller by his high  plumed cavalry helmet  stared along his nose at the women .  he had pale blue eyes  and his face suggested that he did not really want to see anything at all in this room unless it had been thoroughly cleaned first .      who is the officer here .     he said .  he sounded like a lawyer .   blouse stood up and saluted .      lieutenant blouse  sir  tenth infantry .         i see .     the man looked at his fellow officers .     i believe we can dispense with the guard now  don   t you .  this matter should be handled quietly .  and  for heavens    sake  can   t we find this man a pair of pants .      there were a few murmurs .  the man nodded to the sergeant of the guard .  the armed men filed out  and the door shut behind them .      my name is lord rust     said the man .     i head the ankh morpork detachment here .  at least     and he sniffed     the military detachment .  you have been treated well .  you have not been manhandled .  i see there is a   young lady on the floor .         she   s in a swoon  sir     said polly .  the blue eyes lighted upon her .      you would be    .     he said .      corporal perks  sir     said polly .  there were some barely suppressed smiles from the officers .      ah .  i believe you are the one seeking her brother .     said lord rust .      how do you know that .     said polly .      we are an  mm  efficient army     said rust and treated himself to a little smile of his own .     your brother   s name is paul .         yes .         we shall locate him  eventually .  and i understand another lady was seeking her young man .      shufti curtsied nervously .      me  sir .         again  we shall locate him  if you give us his name .  now  please listen to me carefully .  you  miss perks  and the rest of you  will be taken from here  tonight  entirely unharmed  and escorted back into your country as far as our patrols can take you  which  i suspect  will be quite a long way .  is that understood .  you will have what you came for .  won   t that be nice .  and you will not return here .  the troll and the vampire have been captured .  the same offer applies to them .      polly was watching the officers .  they looked nervous      except for one at the back .  she   d thought all the guards had gone  and  while this man was dressed like a guard   dressed  that is  like a badly dressed guard   he wasn   t acting like one .   he was leaning against the wall by the door  smoking half a cigar and grinning .  he looked like a man enjoying a show .      very generously     rust went on     this offer applies to you too  lieutenant   blouse  wasn   t it .  but in your case  you would be on parole in a house in zlobenia  very pleasant i understand  healthy walks in the countryside and all that sort of thing .  this offer has not been extended to your superior officers here  i may add .      so why make it to us .  polly thought .  are you frightened .  of a bunch of girls .  and that makes no sense     behind the officers  the man with the cigar winked at polly .  his uniform was very old fashioned   an ancient helmet  a breastplate  some slightly rusted chain mail  and big boots .  he wore it like a workman wears his overalls .  unlike the braid and brilliance in front of her  the only statement his clothes made was that he didn   t intend to get hurt .  it had no insignia that polly could see  apart from a small shield hooked onto the breastplate .      if you will excuse me a moment     said blouse     i will consult with my men .         men .     said rust .     they   re a bunch of women  man .         but at this moment  sir     said blouse coolly     i would not exchange them for any six men you could offer me .  if you gentlemen would care to wait outside .      behind the group  the badly dressed man burst into silent laughter .  his sense of humor was not shared by the rest of the group  however .      you cannot possibly consider refusing this offer .     said lord rust .      nevertheless  sir     said blouse .     we will take a few minutes .  i think the ladies would prefer some privacy .  one of them is expecting a child .         what  here .     as one man  the group drew back .      not yet  i believe .  but if you would just step outside        when the officers had retreated to the masculine safety of the corridor  the lieutenant turned to his squad .      well  men .  for you  it is a very attractive offer  i have to say .         not for us .     said tonker .  lofty nodded .      nor me     said shufti .      why not .     said blouse .     you would get your husband .         that might be a bit difficult     mumbled shufti .     anyway  what about the invasion .         i   m not going to be sent home like a package     said igorina .     anyway  that man has an objectionable bone structure .         well  private goom can   t join us right now     sighed blouse .     so that leaves you  polly .         why are they doing this .     said polly .     why do they want us out of the way .  why aren   t they just leaving us locked up .  this place must be full of cells .         ah  perhaps they are sensible to the frailties of your sex     said blouse  and then fried in their stares .     i didn   t say i was     he added quickly .      they could just kill us     said tonker .     well  they could     she added .     why not .  who   d care .  i don   t think we count as prisoners of war .         but they haven   t     said polly .     and they   re not even threatening us .  they   re being very careful .  i think they   re frightened of us .         oh  yeah  right     said tonker .     maybe they think we   re going to chase them and give them a big wet sloppy kiss .         good  then we   re agreed that we   re not going to accept     said blouse .     damn right   oh  i do apologize           we all know the words  sir     said polly .     i suggest we see how much we frighten them  sir .         the officers were waiting with unconcealed impatience  but rust managed a brief smile when he stepped back into the kitchen .      well  lieutenant .     he said .      we have given your offer due consideration  sir     said blouse     and our reply is  stick it up your       he leaned down to polly  who whispered urgently .     who .  oh  yes  right .  your jumper  sir .  stick it  in fact  up your jumper .  named after colonel henri jumper  i believe .  a useful woolen garment akin to a lightweight sweater  sir  which  if i recall correctly  was named after regimental sergeant major sweat .  that  sir  is where you may stick it .      rust received this calmly  and polly wondered if it was because he hadn   t understood it .  the scruffy man once more leaning against the wall had understood it  though  since he was grinning .      i see     said rust .     and that is the answer from all of you .  then you leave us no choice .  good evening to you .      his attempt to stride out was hindered by the other officers  who had less sense of the dramatic moment .  the door slammed behind them  but not before the last man out turned very briefly and made a hand gesture .  you would have missed it if you weren   t watching him   but polly was watching .      that seemed to go well     said blouse  turning away .      i hope we   re not going to get into trouble for that     said shufti .      compared to what .     said tonker .      the last man out stuck his thumb up and winked     said polly .     did you notice him .  he wasn   t even wearing an officer   s uniform .         probably wanted a date     said tonker .      in ankh morpork that means    jolly good        said blouse .     in klatch  i think  it means    i hope your donkey explodes .     i spotted the man .  looked like a guard sergeant to me .         didn   t have stripes     said polly .     why   d he want to say jolly good to us .         or hate our donkey so much .     said shufti .     how   s wazzer .         sleeping     said igorina .     i think .         what do you mean .         well  i don   t think she   s dead .         you don   t think she is .     said polly .      yes     said igorina .     it   s like that .  i wish i could keep her warmer .         i thought you said she was burning up .         she was .  now she   s freezing cold .      lieutenant blouse strode over to the door  grabbed its handle and  to the surprise of all  pulled it open .  four swords were leveled at him .      we have a sick man here .     he snapped to the astonished guards .     we need blankets and firewood .  get them now .      he slammed the door .      it might work     he said .      that door doesn   t have a lock     said tonker .     useful fact  polly .      polly sighed .     right now  i just want something to eat .  this is a kitchen  after all .  there could be food here .         this is a kitchen     said tonker .     there could be cleavers .      but it is always upsetting to find that the enemy is as bright as you .  there was a well  but a web of bars across the top allowed for the passage of nothing bigger than a bucket .  and someone with no sense of the narrative of adventure had removed from the room anything with an edge and  for some reason  anything that could be eaten .      unless we want to dine on candles     said shufti  pulling a bundle of them out of a creaking cupboard .        s tallow  after all .  i bet old scallot   d make candle scubbo .      polly checked the chimney  which smelled as though there had not been a fire in it for a long time .  it was big and wide  but six feet up a heavy grill was hung with sooty cobwebs .  it looked rusted and ancient  and could probably be shifted by twenty minutes work with a crowbar  but there   s never a crowbar when you want one .   there were a couple of sacks of ancient  dry  and dusty flour in the storeroom .  it smelled bad .  there was a thing with a funnel and a handle and some mysterious screws .   there were a couple of rolling pins  a lettuce strainer  some ladles   and there were forks .  lots of small forks .  polly felt let down .  it was ridiculous to expect that someone imprisoning people in some ad hoc cell would leave in all the ingredients to effect an escape but  nevertheless  she felt that some universal rule had been broken .  they had nothing better than a club  really .  the toasting forks might prick  the lettuce strainer might pack a punch  and the rolling pins were at least a traditional female weapon  but all you could do with the thing with a funnel and a handle and mysterious screws was baffle people .   the door opened .  armed men came in to act as protection for a couple of women  carrying blankets and firewood .  they scurried in with their eyes cast down  deposited their burdens  and almost ran out .   polly strode over to the guard who seemed to be in charge  and he backed away .  a huge keyring jingled on his belt .      you knock next time  all right .     she said .   he grinned nervously .     yeah  right     he said .     they said we weren   t to talk to you           really .      the jailer glanced around .     but we reckon you   re doing bloody well  for girls     he said conspiratorially .      so that means you won   t shoot at us when we break out .     said polly sweetly .   the grin faded .     don   t try it     said the jailer .      what a big bunch of keys you have there  sir     said tonker  and the man   s hand flew to his belt .      you just stay in here     he said .     things are bad enough already .  you stay here .      he slammed the door .  a moment later they heard something heavy being pushed up against it .      well  now we have a fire  at least     said blouse .      er        this was from lofty .  she volunteered a word so seldom that the rest turned to look at her  and she stopped in embarrassment .      yes  lofty .     said polly .      er   i know how to get the door open     muttered lofty .     so it stays open  i mean .      had it been anyone else  someone would have laughed .  but words from lofty had obviously been turned over for some time before utterance .      er   good     said blouse .     well done .         i   ve been thinking about it     said lofty .      good .         it will work .         just what we need  then .     said blouse  like a man trying against all the odds to keep cheerful .   lofty looked up at the big sooty beams that ran across the room .      yes     she said .      but there   ll still be guards outside     said polly .      no     said lofty .     there won   t .         there won   t .         they   ll have gone away .      lofty stopped  with the air of one who   d said everything that needed to be said .   tonker walked over and took her arm .      we   ll just have a little chat  shall we .     she said and led the girl to the other side of the room .  there was some whispered conversation .  lofty spent most of it staring at the floor  and then tonker came back .      we will need the bags of flour from the storeroom  and the rope from the well     she said .     and one of those  .  .  .  what are those big round things that cover dishes .  with a knob on .         dish covers .     said shufti .      and a candle     tonker went on .     and a lot of barrels .  and a lot of water .         and what will all this do .     said blouse .      make a big bang     said tonker .     tilda knows about fire  believe me .  and flour dust explodes .         when you say she knows       polly began uncertainly .      i mean every place she worked at burned down     said tonker .      they rolled the empty barrels to the middle of the room and filled them with water from the pump .  under lofty   s monosyllabic direction  using the rope from the well  they hauled three leaking  dusty flour sacks up as high as possible  so that they twisted gently over the space between the barrels and the door .      ah     said polly  standing back .     i think i understand .  a flour mill on the other side of town blew up two years ago .         yes     said tonker .     that was tilda .         what .         they   d been beating her .  and worse .  and the thing about tilda is  she just watches and thinks and somewhere in there it all comes together .  then it goes bang .         but two people died .         the man and his wife .  yes .  but i heard that other girls sent there never came back at all .  shall i tell you that tilda was pregnant when they brought her back to the gray house after the fire .  she had it  and they took it away  and we don   t know what happened to it .  and then she got beaten again because she was an abomination unto nuggan .  does that make you feel better .     said tonker  tying the rope to a table leg .     there   s just us  polly .  just her and me .  no inheritance  no nice home to go back to  no relatives that we know of .  the gray house breaks us all  somehow .  wazzer talks to the duchess  i don   t have   middle gears  and tilda frightens me when she gets her hands on the box of matches .  you should see her face then  though .  it lights up .  of course     tonker smiled in her dangerous way     so do other things .  better get everyone into the storeroom while we light the candle .         shouldn   t tilda do that .         she will .  but we   ll have to be ready to drag her away  otherwise she   ll stay and watch .      this had started like a game .  she hadn   t thought of it like a game  but it was a game called    let polly keep the duchess .     and now   it didn   t matter .  she   d made all kinds of plans  but she was beyond plans now .   they   d done bloody well  for girls     a last barrel of water had been placed  after some discussion  in front of the storeroom door .  polly looked over the top at blouse and the rest of the squad .      okay  everybody  we   re   er   about to do it     she said .     are we sure about this  tonker .         yep .         and we won   t get hurt .      tonker sighed .     the dusty flour will explode .  that   s simple .  the blast coming this way will hit the barrels full of water  which   ll probably last just long enough to see it rebound .  the worst that should happen to us is that we get wet .  that   s what tilda thinks .  would you argue .  and in the other direction  there   s only the door .         how does she work this out .         she doesn   t .  she just sees how it should go .     tonker handed blouse the end of a rope .     this goes over the beam and down to the dish lid .  can you hold it  lieutenant .  but don   t pull it until we say .  i really mean that .  c   mon  polly .      in the space between the barrels and the door  lofty was lighting a candle .  she did it slowly  as if it was a sacrament or some ancient ceremony every part of which held enormous and complex meaning .   she lit a match  and held it carefully until the flame caught .  she waved it back and forth on the base of the candle  which she thrust firmly onto the flagstones so that the hot wax stuck it into position .  then she applied the match to the candlewick .   polly and tonker watched her kneel there  staring at the dancing flame .      okay     said tonker .     i   m just going to pick her up  and you just carefully lower the lid over the candle  right .  c   mon  tilda .      she raised the girl carefully to her feet  whispering to her all the time  and then nodded to polly  who lowered the lid with a carefulness that amounted to reverence .   lofty walked as though asleep .   tonker stopped by the leg of a heavy kitchen table  to which she   d attached the other end of the rope holding the flour bags .      okay so far     she said .     now  when i pull the knot we each grab an arm and we run  polly  understand .  we run .  ready .  got her .     she hauled on the rope .     run .      the flour sacks dropped  streaming white dust as they fell  and exploded in front of the door .  flour rose like a fog .   they raced for the storeroom and fell in a heap past the barrel as tonker screamed     okay  lieutenant .      blouse pulled the rope that raised the lid and let the candle flame reach     the word was not whoomph .  the experience was whoomph .  it had a quality that overwhelmed every sense .  it shook the world like a sheet  painted it white  and then  surprisingly  filled it with the smell of toast .  and then it was over  in a second  leaving nothing but distant screams and the rumble of collapsing masonry .   polly uncurled and looked up into blouse   s face .      i think we grab things and run now  sir     she said .     and screaming would help .         i think i can manage the screaming     muttered shufti .     this is not a very nurturing experience .      blouse gripped his ladle .      i hope this isn   t going to be our famous last stand     he said .      in fact  sir     said polly .     i think it   s going to be our first .  permission to yell in a bloodcurdling way  sir .         permission granted  perks .         the floor was awash with water and bits   quite small bits   of barrel .  half the chimney had collapsed into the fireplace and the soot was blazing fiercely .  polly wondered if  down in the valley  it   d look like a signal     the door was gone .  so was a lot of wall around it .  beyond     smoke and dust filled the air .  in it  men lay groaning  or picked their way aimlessly across the rubble .  when the squad arrived  they did not simply fail to put up a fight  they failed to understand .  or hear .   the women lowered their weapons .  polly spotted the sergeant  who was sitting and hitting the side of his head with the flat of his hand .      give me the keys .     she demanded .   he tried to focus .      what .         the keys .         i   ll have a brown one  please .         are you okay .         what .      polly reached down and snatched the keyring from the unresisting man   s belt  fighting down an instinct to apologize .  she threw them to blouse .      will you do the honors  sir .  i think we   ll be having a lot of visitors really soon .     she turned to the squad .     the rest of you  get their weapons off them .         some of these men are badly hurt  polly     said igorina  kneeling down .     there   s one here with multiple .         multiple what .     said polly  watching the steps .      just   multiple .  multiple everything .  but i know i can save his arm  because i   ve just found it over there .  i think he must   ve been holding his sword and           just do what you can  okay .     said polly .      hey  they   re enemies     said tonker  picking up a sword .      thith ith an igor thing     said igorina  taking off her pack .     i   m thorry  you wouldn   t underthand .         i   m beginning not to .     tonker joined polly in her watch on the stairs .  around them  men groaned and stone creaked .      i wonder how much damage we did .  there   s a lot of dust up there           there   ll be a lot of people here soon     said polly more calmly than she felt .  because this is going to be it  she thought .  this time there   s going to be no turkey to save us .  this is where i find out if i   m the meat or the metal     she could hear blouse unlocking doors  and the shouts from those within .      lieutenant blouse  tenth infantry .     he was saying .     this is a rescue  broadly speaking .  sorry about the mess .      probably his inner daphne had added that last bit  polly thought .  and then the corridor was full of released men  and someone said     what are these women doing here .  for god   s sake  give me that sword  girl .      and  right now  she wasn   t inclined to argue .      men take over .  it is probably because of socks .   the squad retired to the kitchen  where igorina was at work .  she worked fast  efficiently  and  on the whole  with very little blood .  her large pack was open beside her .  the jars inside were blue  green  and red  some of them smoked when she opened them  or gave off strange lights .   igorina   s fingers moved in a blur .  it was fascinating to watch her work .  at least  it was if you hadn   t just eaten .      squad  this is major erick von moldvitz .  he asked to meet you .     they turned at the sound of blouse   s voice .  he   d brought a newcomer .   the major was young  but much heavier built than the lieutenant .  he had a scar across his face .      stand easy  lads     he said .     blouse here has been telling me what crackin    work you   ve been doing .  well done .  dressin    up as women  eh .  lucky you weren   t found out .         yessir     said polly .  from outside  there came the sound of cries and fighting .      didn   t bring your uniforms with you .     said the major .      could   ve been tricky if they were found on us     said polly  staring at blouse .      could   ve been tricky anyway  eh  if you were searched .     said the major  winking .      yessir     said polly obediently .     lieutenant blouse told you all about us  did he  sir .      just behind the major  blouse was making a universal gesture .  it consisted of both hands held palms up and outwards and waggled furiously with all fingers extended .      hah  yes .  stole some clothes from a knockin    shop  eh .  young lads like you shouldn   t have gone in a place like that  eh .  those places are an abomination  if they   re run right .     said the major  wagging a finger theatrically .     anyway  we   re doing well .  hardly any guards this deep in the keep  y   see .  the whole place was built on the basis that the enemy would be on the outside .  i say  what   s that man doin    to the man on the slab .         patching him up  thur     said igorina .     thewing hith arm back on .         he   s a enemy  ain   t he .         code of the igorth  thur     said igorina reproachfully .     a thpare hand where needed  thur .      the major sniffed .     oh well  can   t argue with you fellows  eh .  but when you   re finished  we   ve got plenty of chaps out there who could do with your help .         certainly  thur     said igorina .      any news of my brother  sir .     said polly .     paul perks .         yes  blouse here mentioned him  perks  but there   s men locked up everywhere and it   s a little tricky right now  eh .     said the major brusquely .     as for the rest of you  we   ll get you into a pair of trousers as soon as possible and you can join in the fun  eh .         the fun     said tonker in a hollow voice .      the fun being    .     said polly .      we   ve got as far as the fourth floor already     said von moldvitz .     we might not have the whole keep back  but we hold the outer courtyards and some of the towers .  by morning  we   ll control who comes in and goes out .  we   re back in the war .  they won   t invade now .  most of their top brass are in the inner keep .         back in the war     murmured polly .      and we will win .     said the major .      oh  sugar     said shufti .   something was going to give  polly knew .  tonker had that look she got before she exploded  and even shufti was fidgeting .  it would only be a matter of time before lofty found her box of matches  which polly had hidden in a cupboard .   igorina packed up her bag and smiled brightly at the major .      ready to go  thur     she said .      at least remove the wig  eh .         it   th my own hair  thur     said igorina .      looks a bit   sissy  then     said the major .     it would be better if           i am  in fact  female  sir     said igorina  dropping most of the lisp .     trust me  i   m an igor .  we know about this sort of thing .  and my needlework ith second to none .         a woman .     said the major .   polly sighed .     we all are  sir .  really women .  not just dressed up as women .  and right now i don   t want to put any trousers on because then i   d be a woman dressed up as a man dressed up as a woman dressed up as a man  and then i   d be so confused i won   t know how to swear .  and i want to swear right now  sir  very much .      the major turned stiffly to blouse .      did you know about this  lieutenant .     he barked .      well   yes  sir .  eventually .  but even so  sir  i would           this cell was an old guard room .  it was damp  and had two creaking bunks .      on the whole     said tonker     i think it was better when we were locked up by the enemy .         there   s a grill in the ceiling     said shufti .      not big enough to climb through     said polly .      no  but we can hang ourselves before they do .         i   m told it   s a very painful way to die     said polly .      who by .     said tonker .   occasionally the sounds of battle filtered through the narrow window .  mostly it was yells  often it was screams .  fun was being had .   igorina sat staring at her hands .      what wrong with these .     she said .     didn   t i do a good job on that arm .  but no  they   re afraid i might touch their privates .         perhaps you could have promised to operate only on officers     said tonker .  no one laughed  and probably no one would have bothered to run for it if the door had swung open .  it was a proud and noble thing to escape from the enemy  but if you were escaping from your own side  where would you escape to .   on one of the bunks  wazzer slept like a hibernating bear .  you had to watch her for some time to see her breathe .      what can they do to us .     said shufti nervously .     you know   really do to us .         we were wearing men   s clothes     said polly .      but that   s only a beating .         oh  they   ll find some other stuff  believe you me     said tonker .     besides  who knows we   re here .         but we got them out of prison .  our side .      polly sighed .     that   s why  shufti .  no one wants to know that a bunch of girls dressed up as soldiers and broke into a big fort and let out half an army .  everyone knows females can   t do that .  neither side wants us here  understand .         on a battlefield like this  who   ll worry about a few more bodies .     said tonker .      don   t say that .  lieutenant blouse spoke up for us .     said shufti .      what  daphne .     said tonker .     hah .  just another body .  they   ve probably locked him up somewhere  just like us .      there was a distant cheering  which went on for some time .      sounds like they   ve got the building     said polly .      hooray for us     said tonker and spat .   after a while  a small hatch was opened in the door and a silent man handed through a big can of scubbo and a tray of horse bread .  it wasn   t bad scubbo or  at least  not bad scubbo by the standards of bad scubbo .  there was some discussion about whether being fed meant you weren   t going to be executed  until someone pointed out the tradition of the last hearty meal .  igorina gave it as her professional opinion that the stew was not only hearty but lungy and livery  too .  but at least it was hot .   a couple of hours later  a can of saloop was handed through  with some mugs .  this time  the guard winked .   an hour after that  the door was unlocked .   a young man in a major   s uniform stepped inside .   oh well  let   s go on as we started  polly thought .  she leaped to her feet .      squaddd    .  tennn   hut .     with reasonable speed  the squad at least managed to stand up straight and in a line .   the major acknowledged her by tapping the peak of his cap with a stick .  it was definitely thinner than an inch .      stand easy   corporal  isn   t it .     he said .      yessir .     that sounded promising .      i am major clogston  of the provost   s office     said the major .     and i   d like you to tell me all about it .  about everything .  i will make notes  if you don   t mind .         what   s this about .     said tonker .      ah  you   d be   private halter     said clogston .     i   ve already spoken at length to lieutenant blouse .     he turned  nodded at the guard hovering in the doorway  and shut the door .  he also closed the hatch .      you are going to be tried     he said  sitting down on the spare bunk .     the politicos want you to be tried by a full nugganite court  but that would be tricky here  and no one wants this to go on for any longer than it has to .  besides  there have been an   unusual event .  someone has sent a communique to general froc asking about you all by name .  at least     he added     by your surnames .         was that lord rust  sir .         no  it was someone called william de worde .  i don   t know if you   ve run across his newspaper thing .  we   re wondering how he knew you were captured .         well  we didn   t tell him .     said polly .      it makes things a little   tricky     said clogston .     although  from your point of view  a lot more hopeful .  there are those members of the army who are  let us say  considering the future of borogravia .  that is  they would like there to be one .  my job is to present your case to the tribunal .         is that a court martial .     said polly .      no  they   re not that stupid .  calling it a court martial would indicate that they accept that you are soldiers .         you did     said shufti .      de facto is not de jure     said clogston .     now  as i said   tell me your story  miss perks .         that   s    corporal     thank you .         i apologize for the lapse .  now   go on        clogston opened his bag and produced a pair of half moon spectacles  which he put on  and took out a pencil and something white and square .      whenever you   re ready .     he added .      sir  are you really going to write on a jam sandwich .     said polly .      what .     the major looked down and laughed .     oh .  no .  excuse me .  i really mustn   t miss meals .  blood sugar  you know           only it   s oozing  sir .  don   t mind us .  we   ve eaten .      it took an hour  with many interruptions and corrections  and two more sandwiches .  the major used up quite a lot of notebook  and occasionally had to stop and stare at the ceiling .         and then we were thrown in here     said polly  sitting back .      pushed  really     said igorina .     nudged .         mmm     said clogston .     you say corporal strappi  as you knew him  was   suddenly very ill at the thought of going into battle .         yessir .         and in the tavern in plotz you really kneed prince heinrich in the fracas .         in or about the fracas  sir .  and i didn   t know it was him at the time  sir .         i see you haven   t mentioned the action on the hilltop where  according to lieutenant blouse  your prompt work got the enemy code book           not really worth mentioning  sir .  we didn   t do much with it .         oh  i don   t know .  because of you and that nice man from the newspaper  the alliance has had two regiments trotting around in the mountains after some guerrilla leader called    tiger .     prince heinrich insisted  and is  in fact  in command .  he is  you could say  a sore loser .  very sore  according to rumor .         the newspaper writer believed all that stuff .     said polly  amazed .      i don   t know  but he certainly wrote it down .  you say lord rust offered to let you all go home quietly .         yessir .         and the consensus of opinion was that he could           stick it up his jumper  sir .         oh  yes .  i couldn   t read my own writing .  j   u   m       clogston carefully wrote the word in capital letters  and then said     i am not saying this  i am not here  but some   senior   people on our side are wondering if you would just quietly go    .      the question hung in the air like a corpse from a beam .      i   ll put that down as    jumper    too  then  shall i .     said clogston .      some of us have got nowhere to go to     said tonker .      or with     said shufti .      we haven   t done anything wrong     said polly .      jumper it is  then     said the major .  he folded up his little spectacles and sighed .      they won   t even tell me what charges are going to be made .         being bad girls     said tonker .     who are we fooling  sir .  the enemy wanted just to be quietly rid of us  and the general wants the same thing .  that   s the trouble about the good guys and the bad guys .  they   re all guys .         would we have got a medal  sir  if we   d been men .     shufti demanded .      yep .  certainly .  and blouse would have been promoted on the spot  i imagine .  but right now we   re at war  and this might not be the time              to thank a bunch of abominable women .     polly suggested .   clogston smiled .     i was going to say    to lose concentration .     it   s the political branch who are pushing for this  of course .  they want to stop word getting around .  and high command want this over quickly for the same reason .         when is all this going to start .     said polly .      in about half an hour .         this is stupid .     said tonker .     they   re in the middle of a war and they   re going to take the time to hold a trial for a few women who haven   t even done anything wrong .         the general has insisted     said clogston .     he wants this cleared out of the way .         and what authority has this meeting got .     said polly coldly .      thousands of men under arms     said clogston .     sorry .  the trouble is  when you say to a general    you and whose army .     he just has to point out of the window .  but i intend to prove that the meeting should be a court martial .  you all kissed the duchess .  you took the shilling .  i say that makes it military business .         and that   s good  is it .         well  it means there are procedures     said the major .     the last abomination from nuggan was against jigsaw puzzles .  they break the world into pieces  he says .  that   s making people think  at last .  the army may be crazy  but at least it   s crazy by numbers .  it   s reliably insane .  er  your sleeping friend   will you leave her here .         no     said the squad  as one woman .      she needs my constant attention     said igorina .      if we leave her she might have a sudden attack of vanishing without a trace     said tonker .      we stick together     said polly .     we don   t leave a man behind .         the room chosen for the tribunal was a ballroom .  more than half the keep had been taken back  polly learned  but the distribution of ground was erratic .  the alliance still held the central buildings  and the armory  but was entirely surrounded by borogravian forces .  the current prize to fight for was the main gate complex  which hadn   t been built to withstand attack from inside .  what was happening out there now was a brawl  a midnight bar fight but on a huge scale .  and  since there were various war engines atop the towers now occupied by either side  the keep was shooting at itself  in the finest traditions of the circular firing squad .   the floor in here smelled of polish and chalk .  tables had been pushed together to made a rough semicircle .  there must have been more than thirty officers  polly thought .  then she saw the other tables behind the semicircle  and the maps  and the people scurrying in and out  and realized that this was not just about them .  this was a war room .   the squad were marched in  and stood at attention .  igorina had browbeaten a couple of guards to carry wazzer on a stretcher .  that circle of stitches under her eye was worth more that a colonel   s pips .  no soldier wanted to be on the wrong side of the igors .   they waited .  occasionally an officer would glance at them and go back to looking at a map or talking .  then polly saw some whispering going on  heads turned again  and there was a drift toward the semicircle of seats .  there was a definite sense that here was a tiresome chore that  regrettably  had to be done .   general froc did not look directly at the squad until he had taken his seat in the center of the group and adjusted his papers neatly .  even then  his eye passed over them quickly  as if it was afraid to stop .   polly had never seen him before .  he was a handsome man and still had a fine head of white hair .  a scar down one side of his face had just missed an eye and showed up against the wrinkles .      things are moving well     he said to the room in general .     we have just heard that a flying column led by the remnant of tenth are closing on the keep and attacking the main gates from outside .  someone must have seen what is happening .  the army is on the move .      there was a certain amount of refined cheering at this  none of it from the squad .  the general glanced at them again .      is this all of them  clogston .     he said .   the major  who at least had a small table to himself  stood up and saluted .      no  sir     he said .     we are awaiting        the doors opened again .  jade was brought in  chained between two much larger trolls .  maladict and blouse trailed behind her .  it seemed that in all the rush and confusion no one had found any trousers for blouse  and maladict looked slightly blurred .  his chains jingled constantly .      i object to the chains  sir     said clogston .   the general held a whispered consultation with a few of the other officers .      yes  we do not want undue formality     he said  nodding at the guards .     remove them .  you trolls can go .  i just want the guards to remain on the door .  now  let us proceed .  this really shouldn   t take too long .  now then  you people     he settled himself in his chair     this really is very simple .  with the exception of lieutenant blouse  you will agree to be returned to your homes and placed in the charge of a responsible male  understood .  and no more will be said about this matter .  you have showed considerable spirit  there is no doubt about that  but it was misplaced .  we are not ungrateful  however .  we understand that none of you are married  and so we will present you all with suitable  indeed  with handsome dowries        polly saluted .     permission to speak  sir .      froc stared at her  and then looked pointedly at clogston .      you   ll have a chance to speak later  corporal     said the major .      but what exactly have we done wrong  sir .     said polly .     they should tell us .      froc looked at the far end of the row of chairs .      captain .     he said .   a short officer got to his feet .  in polly   s face  the tide of recognition raced across the mudflats of hatred .      captain strappi  political division  sir       he began  and stopped at the groan from the squad .  when it had died away  he cleared his throat and went on     twenty seven abominations have been committed under nugganatic law  sir .  i suspect there have been many more .  under military law  sir  we have the simple fact that they posed as men in order to join up .  i was there  sir  and saw it all .         captain strappi  may i congratulate you on your rapid promotion .     said lieutenant blouse .      yes  indeed  captain     said clogston .     apparently you were a humble corporal only a few days ago .      plaster dust drifted down again as something heavy struck the wall outside .  froc brushed it off his paperwork .      not one of ours  i hope     he said  to a certain amount of laugher .     do go ahead  captain .      strappi turned to the general .     as you know  sir  it is occasionally necessary for us in the political division to assume a lower rank in order to gain intelligence .  covered under the regulations  sir     he added .   the look that general froc gave him stirred a little teacup of hope in polly   s breast .  no one could like something like strappi  not even a mother .  then the man turned back to clogston .      is this germane  major .     he said testily .     we know they disguised themselves as              women  sir     said clogston smoothly .     that   s all we know  sir .  apart from captain strappi   s assertion  and i intend to suggest later that this is tainted  i haven   t yet heard any evidence that they have dressed in any other way .         we have the evidence of our own eyes  man .         yes  sir .  they   re wearing dresses  sir     said clogston patiently .      and they   re practically bald .         yes  sir     said clogston .  he picked up a thick book  dripping with bookmarks .     book of nuggan  sir     it is a beatitude unto nuggan that an woman shall wear her hair short  that the amorous propensities of men be not therefore inflamed .            i don   t see a lot of bald women around .     snapped froc .      yes  sir .  it is one of those utterances that people find somewhat tricky  like the one about not sneezing .  i should say at this point  sir  that i intend to show that abominations are routinely committed by all of us .  we have got into the habit of ignoring them  in fact  which opens up an interesting debate .  in any case  short hair is nugganatically correct .  in short  sir  and in short hair  the ladies appear to have been involved in nothing more than a little laundry  a kitchen accident  and the release of your good self from the cells .         i saw them .     snarled strappi .     they looked like men and they acted like men .         why were you in the recruiting party  captain .     said major clogston .     i would not have thought one of those would have been a hotbed of seditious activity .         is that a relevant question  major .     said the general .      i don   t know  sir     said clogston .     that   s why i asked .  i don   t think we would wish it to be said that these ladies had not been given a fair hearing .         said by whom .     said froc .     my officers can be relied upon to be discreet .         said by the ladies themselves  sir .         then we must require that they do not speak to anyone .         oh  i say .     said blouse .      and how will you enforce this  sir .     said clogston .     against these women who  we have agreed  stole you out of the jaws of the enemy .      there was some muttering among the officers .      major clogston  did you have lunch .     said the general .      no  sir .         colonel vester said you become a little   erratic when you miss meals           no  sir .  i become tetchy  sir .  but i think a little tetchiness is called for right now .  i put a question to captain strappi  sir .         very well  captain  perhaps you will tell us why you were with that recruiting party .     said the general wearily .      i was   investigating a soldier  sir     said strappi reluctantly .     a noncommissioned officer .  our attention had been drawn to irregularities in his files  sir  and where there are irregularities we generally find sedition .  i hesitate to talk about this  sir  because this sergeant has been of some service to yourself           hrumph .     said the general loudly .     this is not a matter of discussion here  i think .         it was just that according to the files  several officers had helped       strappi went on .      hrumph .  not matter for this court  captain .  are we agreed  gentlemen .         yes  sir  it was just that the major asked me and i       strappi began  bewildered .      captain  i suggest you learn what a hrumph means .     roared froc .      so what were you looking for when you rummaged through our stuff .     said polly as strappi shrank .      mmmmmy cccccoffffee .     said maladict .     yyyyyou ssssstole mmmmmy cccccoffffee .         and you ran away when you were told you were going into combat  you little dog   s pizzle .     said tonker .     polly said you pissed your drawers .      general froc slammed his fist on the table  but polly noticed that one or two officers were trying to conceal a smile .      these are not matters for this inquiry .     he said .      although  sir  one or two of them seem to me to be subject for investigation later on     said a colonel further along the table .     the personal belongings of enlisted men may only be searched in their presence  general .  this may seem a trivial point  but men have mutinied over it in the past .  did you  in fact  believe the   men to be women when you did this  captain .      oh  say yes  please say yes  polly thought  as strappi hesitated .  because when we talk about how those cavalrymen found us so quickly  it   ll mean you set them on a bunch of borogravian girls .  let   s see how that one plays in plotz .  and if you didn   t know  then why were you rummaging .   strappi preferred the rock to the hard place .  stone clattered down in the courtyard outside  and he had to raise his voice to make himself heard .      i was  er  generally suspicious of them  sir  because they were so keen           sir  i protest .     said clogston .     keenness is not a military vice .         in moderation  certainly     said froc .     and you found evidence of some sort  did you .         i did find a petticoat  sir     said strappi  feeling his way with care .      they why didn   t you       froc began  but strappi interrupted .      i did serve for a while with captain wrigglesworth  sir     he said .      and .     said froc  but the officer on his left leaned over and whispered something to him .      oh  wrigglesworth .  ha  yes     said froc .     of course .  fine officer  wrigglesworth .  keen on  er           amateur dramatics     a colonel supplied in a noncommittal voice .      right .  right .  ver    good for morale  that sort of thing .  hrumph .         with respect  general  i think i can offer a way through .     said another man with a general   s rank .      really  bob .     said froc .     oh  well   feel free .  the record will show that i am yielding the floor to general kzupi .         i   m sorry  sir  i thought these proceedings were not being recorded .     said clogston .      yes  yes  of course  thank you so much for jogging my memory     said froc .     however  if we were to have a record  that is what it would show .  bob .         ladies     said general kzupi  flashing the squad a glossy smile .     and you too  of course  lieutenant blouse  and you too  er       he looked quizzically at maladict  who stared straight back       sir .     general kzupi  though  was not to be derailed by an eyeballing vampire  even one that couldn   t stand still .     firstly  may i offer on behalf of all of us  i think  our thanks for the incredible job you have done .  a splendid effort .  but  sadly  the world we live in has certain   rules  you understand .  to be frank  the problem here is not that you are women .  as such  that is .  but you persist in maintaining that you are .  you see .  we can   t have that .         you mean if we put on uniforms again and swaggered around belching and saying    har har  fooled you all     that would be all right .     said polly .      perhaps i could help .     said yet another voice .  froc looked along the table .      ah  brigadier stoffer .  yes .         this is all rather damn silly  general           hrumph .     said froc .      what say .     said stoffer  looking puzzled .      there are ladies present  brigadier .  that is  ahah  the problem .         damn right .     said tonker .      understood  general .  but the party was led by a man  am i right .         lieutenant blouse tells me he is a man  sir     said clogston .     since he is an officer and a gentleman  i will take his word for it .         well  then  problem solved .  these young ladies helped him .  smuggled him in  and so forth .  assisted him .  fine traditions of borogravian womanhood and all that .  not soldiers at all .  give the man a big medal and make him a captain  and all this   ll be forgotten .      strappi rocketed to his feet .      general  i protest .  it would not be           protest not accepted .     froc snapped .     this is real politics  captain .  it is not about prying and peeking .  it is not a matter for the political department .      strappi deflated back into his chair .  he caught polly   s eye for a moment and then hastily looked away .      very well     said froc  looking up and down the table  and then smoothing his paperwork and squaring off the edges like a man finishing for the day .     this sounds a very sensible and generous proposal to me  major .         excuse me one moment  general     said clogston .     i will consult with what we would call the accused if anyone would enlighten me as to the precise nature of the charges .      he walked over to the squad and lowered his voice .      i think this is the best offer you   re going to get     he said .     i can probably get the money  too .  how about it .         it   s completely ridiculous .     said blouse .     they showed tremendous courage and determination .  all this would not have been possible without them .         yes  blouse  and you would be allowed to say that     said clogston .     stoffer has come up with quite a clever idea .  everyone gets what they want  but you just have to avoid any suggestion that you were  in fact  acting as soldiers .  brave borogravian women going to the aid of a gallant hero  that works .  you could take the view that these are changing times  and you are helping them change faster .  well .      the squad exchanged glances .      er   i   d be happy about that     shufti ventured .     if everyone else is .         so you   d have your baby without a husband .     said polly .      he   s probably dead anyway  whoever he was     sighed shufti .      the general has influence     said clogston .     he might be able to           no  i   m not buying into this     said tonker .     it   s a gooey little lie .  to hell with them .         lofty .     said polly .   lofty struck a match  and stared at it .  she could find matches anywhere .   there was another crump  high above .      maladict .     said polly .      llet tthe bball rroll .  ii ssay nno .         and you  lieutenant .     clogston asked .      it   s dishonorable     said blouse .      could be problems for you if you don   t accept  though .  with your career .         i suspect i haven   t got one  major  whatever happens .  no  i will not live a lie .  i know  now  that i   m not a hero .  i   m just someone who wanted to be one .         thank you  sir     said polly .     er   jade .         one of der trolls wot arrested me hit me with his club an    i frew a table at him     said jade  looking at the floor .      that was mistreatment of a pris    .     blouse began  but clogston said     no  lieutenant  i know something about trolls .  they are very   physical .  so   he   s a rather attractive lad  is he  private .         i got a good feelin    about him     said jade  blushing .     so i don   t want to be sent home .  nothin    for me there  anyway .         private igor   ina .     said blouse .      i think we ought to give in     said igorina .      why .     said polly .      because wazzer   s dying .     she raised a hand .     no  please don   t cluster round .  give her air  at least .  she hasn   t eaten .  i can   t get any water down her at all .     she looked up with redrimmed eyes .     i don   t know what to do .         the duchess talked to her     said polly .     you all heard .  and you know what we saw down in the crypt .         and i said i don   t believe any of that .     said tonker .     it   s her   mind .  they made her crazy enough .  and we were all so tired  we   d see anything .  all that stuff about wanting to get to the high command .  well  here they are  and i don   t see any miracles .  do you .         i don   t think she would have wanted us to give in     said polly .   no     did you hear that .     said polly  although now she wasn   t certain if the word had turned up in her head via her ears .     no  i didn   t .     said tonker .     i didn   t hear it .         i don   t think we can accept this compromise  sir     said polly to the major .      then i won   t     said shufti promptly .     i don   t   this wasn   t   i only came because   but   look  i   m staying with you .  erm   what can they do to us  sir .         put you in a cell for a long time  probably     said the major .     they   re being kind to you           kind .     said polly .      well  they think they   re being kind     said clogston .     and they could be a lot worse .  and there   s a war on .  they don   t want to look bad  but froc didn   t get to be a general by being nice .  i have to warn you about that .  you   re still turning this down .      blouse looked around at his men .      i believe we are  major .         good     said clogston  winking .   good .   clogston went back to his table and shuffled his papers .      the allegedly accused  sir  regretfully turn down the offer .         yes  i thought they might     said froc .     in that case  they are to be returned to the cells .  they will be dealt with later .     plaster showered down as something hit the outer wall again .     this has gone quite far enough .         we won   t be sent to the cells .     tonker shouted .      then that is mutiny  sir .     said froc .     and we know how to deal with that .         excuse me  general  does that then mean the tribunal does agree that these ladies are soldiers .     said clogston .   general froc glared at him .      don   t you try to tie me up with procedural nonsense  major .         it   s hardly nonsense  sir  if the very basis            duck    the word was the faintest  merest suggestion in polly   s head  but it also seemed to be wired to her central nervous system .  and not only hers .  the squad ducked  igorina throwing herself across her patient   s body .   half the ceiling collapsed .  the chandelier fell down and exploded in a kaleidoscope of splintering prisms .  mirrors shattered .   and then there was  by comparison at least  silence  broken only by the thud of a few late bits of plaster and the tinkle of a tardy shard .   now     footsteps approached the big doors at the end of the room  where the guards were just struggling to their feet .   the doors swung open .   jackrum stood there  shining like the sunset .  the light glinted off his shako badge  polished to the point where it would blind the incautious with its terrible gleam .  his face was red  but his jacket was redder  and his sergeant   s sash was the pure quill of redness  its very essence  the red of dying stars and dying soldiers .   blood dripped off the cutlasses thrust into his belt .   the guards  still shaking  tried to lower their pikes to bar his way .      do not try it  lads  i beg you     said jackrum .     upon my oath  i am not a violent man  but do you think sergeant jackrum is going to be stopped by a set of bleedin    cutlery .      the men looked at jackrum  steaming with barely controlled rage  and then at the astonished generals  and took an immediate decision on their own desperate initiative .  weapons were lowered .      good lads     said jackrum .     with your permission  general froc .      he did not wait for a reply but marched forward with parade ground smartness .  he came to boot crashing attention in front of the senior generals  who were still brushing plaster dust from their uniforms  and saluted with the precision of a semaphore .      i beg to report  sir  that we now hold the main gates  sir .  took the liberty of putting together a force of the ins and outs  the side to sides and the backwards and forwards  sir  just in case  saw a big cloud o    flame and smoke over the place  and arrived at the gates just as your lads did .  got    em coming and going  sir .      there was a general cheer  and general kzupi leaned toward froc .      in view of this pleasing development  sir  perhaps we should hurry up and close this        froc waved him into silence .      jackrum  you old rogue     he said  leaning back in his chair .     i heard you were dead .  how the devil are you .         fightin    fit  sir .     barked jackrum .     not dead at all  despite the hopes of many .         glad to hear it  man .  but  while your rosy face is a welcome sight at any time  we are here to           fourteen miles i carried you  sir .     jackrum roared  sweat pouring down his face .     pulled that arrow out of your leg  sir .  sliced that devil of a captain who pushed an axe in your face  sir  and i   m glad to see the scar   s looking well .  killed that poor sentry lad just to steal his water bottle for you  sir .  looked into his dyin    face  sir  for you .  never asked for nothin    in return  sir .  right  sir .      froc rubbed his chin and smiled .      well  i seem to remember there was that little matter of fudging some details  changing a few dates       he murmured .      don   t give me that bleedin    slop  sir  with respect .  that wasn   t for me  that was for the army .  for the duchess  sir .  and  yeah  i see a few other gentlemen around this table who had reason to do the same little service for me .  for the duchess  sir .  and if you was to leave me one sword i   d stand and fight any man in your army  sir  be he never so young and full of mustard .      in one movement  he pulled a cutlass from his belt and brought it down on the paperwork between froc   s hands .  it bit through  into the wood of the table  and stayed there .   froc didn   t flinch .  instead he looked up and said calmly     hero though you may be  sergeant  i fear that you have gone too far .         have i gone the full fourteen miles yet  sir .     said jackrum .   for a moment  there was no sound but that of the cutlass  vibrating to a halt .  froc breathed out .      very well     he said .     what is your request  sergeant .         i notes you have my little lads before you  sir .  i   m hearing that they are in a spot of bother  sir .         the girls  jackrum  are to be restrained in a place of safety .  this is no place for them .  and that is my order  sergeant .         i said to    em when they signed up  sir  i said  if anyone drags you away they   ll have to drag me away  too  sir .      froc nodded .     very loyal of you  sergeant  and very much in your character .  nevertheless           and i have information vital to these here deliberations  sir .  there is something i must tell you  sir .         really .  then by all means tell us  man .     said froc .     you don   t have to take all           it requires that some of you gentlemen quit this room  sir     said jackrum desperately .  he was still at attention  still holding the salute .      now you do ask too much  jackrum     said froc .     these are loyal officers of her grace .         no doubt of it  sir .  upon my oath  i am not a gossiping man  sir  but i will speak my piece to those i choose  sir  or speak it to the world .  there   s ways to do that  sir  nasty newfangled ways .  your choice  sir .      at last  froc colored .  he stood up abruptly .      are you seriously telling me that you   d           this is my famous last stand  sir .     said jackrum  saluting again .     do or die  sir .      all eyes turned to the general .  he relaxed .     oh  very well .  it can   t do any harm to listen to you  sergeant .  god knows you   ve earned it .  but make it quick .         thank you  sir .         but try this again and you   ll be on the biggest fizzer you can imagine .         no worry there  sir .  never been one for fizzers .  i will  by your leave  point to certain men and i   ll include strappi in this category     cos i wouldn   t dream of calling a captain a dog   s todger  sir        they were about half of the officers .  they rose with greater or lesser protest  but rise they did  under froc   s sapphire glare  and filed out in the corridor .  strappi was among them  trying to stay inconspicuous .      general  i protest .     said a departing colonel .     we are being sent out of the room like naughty children  while these   females are           yes  yes  rodney  and if our friend the sergeant doesn   t have a damn good explanation i   ll personally turn him over to you for punishment detail     said froc .     but he   s entitled to his last wild charge if any man is .  go quietly  there   s a good chap  and keep the war going until we get there .  and have you finished this strange charade  sergeant .     he added  as the last of the officers left .      all but one last thing  sir     said jackrum and stamped over to the guards .  they were at attention already  but nevertheless contrived to become more attentive .      you lads go outside this door     said the sergeant .     no one is to come close  understand .  and i know you boys won   t try to eavesdrop  because of what   ll happen to you if i ever found that you had done so .  off you go  hup  hup  hup .      he shut the doors behind them and the atmosphere changed .  polly couldn   t quite detect how  but perhaps it was that the click of the doors had said    this is our secret    and everyone present was in on it .   jackrum removed his shako and laid it gently on the table in front of the general .  then he took off his coat and handed it to polly  saying     hold this  perks .  it   s the property of her grace .      he rolled up his sleeves .  he relaxed his enormous red suspenders .  and then  to polly   s horror if not to her surprise  he brought out his paper screw of foul chewing tobacco and his blackened penknife .      oh  i say       a major began  before a colleague nudged him into silence .  never had a man cutting a wad of black tobacco been the subject of such rapt  horrified attention .      things are going well outside     he said .     shame you aren   t all out there  eh .  still  the truth   s important  too  right .  and that   s what this tribunal is for  i   ve no doubt about it .  it must be important  the truth  else you wouldn   t be here  am i right .     course i am .      jackrum finished the cut  palmed the stuff into his mouth and got it comfortable in a cheek  while the sounds of battle filtered through from outside .  then he turned and walked toward the major who had just spoken .  the man cringed a little in his chair .      what   ve you got to say about the truth  major derbi .     said jackrum conversationally .     nothing .  well  then  what shall i say .  what shall i say about a captain who turned and ran sobbing when we came across a column of zlobenians  deserting his very men .  shall i say that ol    jackrum tripped him up and pummelled him a bit and put the fear of   jackrum into him  and he went back and    twas a famous victory he had that day  over two enemies  one of them being in his own head .  and he came to ol    jackrum again  drunk with battle  and said more   n he ought           you bastard     said the major softly .      shall i tell the truth today   janet .     said jackrum .   the sounds of battle were suddenly much louder .  they poured into the room like the water rushes to fill a hole in the ocean floor  but all the sound in the world could not have filled that sudden  tremendous silence .   jackrum strolled on toward another man .      good to see you here  colonel cumabund .     he said cheerfully .     o   course  you were only lieutenant cumabund when i was under your command .  plucky lad you were  when you led us against that detachment of kopelies .  and then you took a nasty sword wound in the fracas  or just above  and i got you through with rum and cold water  and found that plucky you might be  but lad you weren   t .  oh  how you gabbled away in your feverish delirium   yes  you did .  that   s the truth    olga .      he stepped around the table and started to stroll along behind the officers  those he passed stared woodenly ahead  not daring to turn  not daring to make any movement that would attract attention .      you could say i know something about all of yez     he said .     quite a lot about some of you  just enough about most of you .  a few of you  well  i could write a book .     he paused just behind froc  who stiffened .      jackrum  i       he began .   jackrum put a hand on each of froc   s shoulders .      fourteen miles  sir .  two nights     cos we lay up by day  the patrols were that thick .  cut about pretty dreadful  you were  but you got better nursing from me that any sawbones  i   d bet .      he leaned forward until his mouth was level with the general   s ear  and continued in a stage whisper      what is there left about you that i don   t know .  so   are you really looking for the truth   mildred .      the room was a museum of waxworks .   jackrum spat on the floor .      you cannot prove anything  sergeant     said froc eventually  with the calm of an ice field .      well  now  not as such .  but they keep telling me this is the modern world  sir .  i don   t need proof  exactly .  i know a man who   d love such a tale to tell  and it   d be in ankh morpork in a couple of hours .         if you leave this room alive     said a voice .   jackrum smiled his evilest smile and bore down on the source of the threat like an avalanche .     ah .  i thought one of yez would try that  chloe  but i note you never made it beyond major  and no wonder  since you always try to bluff with no bleedin    cards in your hand .  nice try  though .  but  first  i could take you to the bleedin    cleaners before those guards were back in here  upon my oath  and  second  you don   t know what i   ve writ down and who else knows .  i trained all you girls at one time or another  and some of the cunning you got  some of the mustard  some of the sense   well  you got it from me .  didn   t you .  so don   t any of you go thinking you can be artful about this  because when it comes to cunning i am mister fox .         sergeant  sergeant  sergeant     said froc wearily .     what is it you want .      jackrum completed his circuit of the table and finished in front of it  once again like a man before his judges .      well  blow me down     he said quietly  looking along the row of faces .     you didn   t know  did you   you didn   t know .  is there a   a man among you that knew .  you thought  every one of you  that you were all alone .  all alone .  you poor devils .  and look at you .  more   n a third of the country   s high command .  you made it on your own  ladies .  what could you have done if you   d acted tog        he stopped and took a step toward froc  who looked down at her cloven paperwork .      how many did you spot  mildred .         that will be    general     sergeant .  i   m still a general  sergeant .  or    sir    will do .  and your answer is  one or two .  one or two .         and you promoted them  did you  if they was as good as men .         indeed not  sergeant .  what do you take me for .  i promoted them if they were better than men .      jackrum opened his arms wide  like a ringmaster introducing a new act .      then what about the lads i brought with me  sir .  as cracking a bunch of lads as i   ve ever seen .     he cast a bloodshot eye around the table .     and i   m good at weighing up a lad  as you all know .  they   d be a credit to your army  sir .      froc looked at his colleagues on either side .  an unspoken question harvested unsaid answers .      yes  well     she said .     all seems clear to us  in the light of new developments .  when beardless lads dress up as gels  there   s no doubt that people will get confused .  and that   s what we   ve got here  sergeant .  mere confusion .  mistaken identities .  much ado  in fact  about nothing .  clearly they are boys  and may return home right now with an honorable discharge .      jackrum chuckled and stuck out a palm  flexing the fingers upwards like a man bargaining .   once again  there was the communion of spirits .      very well .  they can  if they wish  continue in the army     said froc .     with discretion  of course .         no  sir .      polly stared at jackrum  and then realized the words had  in fact  come from her own mouth .   froc raised her eyebrows .      what is your name again .     she said .      corporal perks  sir .     said polly  saluting .   she watched froc   s face settle into an expression of condescending benevolence .  if she uses the words    my dear     i shall swear  she thought .      well  my dear           not your dear  sir or madam     said polly .  in the theater of her mind  the duchess inn burned to a cinder and her old life peeled away  black as charcoal  and she was flying  ballistic  too fast and too high and unable to stop .     i am a soldier  general .  i signed up .  i kissed the duchess .  i don   t think generals call their soldiers    my dear     do they .      froc coughed .  the smile remained  but had the decency to be a bit more restrained .      and private soldiers don   t talk like that to generals  young lady  so we   ll let that pass  shall we .     she said .      just here  in this room  i don   t know what passes and what stays  sir     said polly .     but it seems to me that if you are still a general then i   m still a corporal  sir .  i can   t speak for the others  but the reason i   m holding out  general  is that i kissed the duchess and she knew what i was and she   didn   t turn away  if you understand me .         well said  perks     said jackrum .   polly plunged on .     sir  a day or two ago i   d have rescued my brother and gone off home and i   d have thought it a job well done .  i just wanted to be safe .  but now i see there   s no safety while there   s all this   this stupidity .  so i think i   ve got to stay and be a part of it .  er   try to make it less stupid  i mean .  and i want to be me  not oliver .  i kissed the duchess .  we all did .  you can   t tell us we didn   t and you can   t tell us it doesn   t count  because it   s between us and her           you all kissed the duchess     said a voice .  it had an   echo .       you all kissed the duchess       did you think that meant nothing .  that it was just a kiss .          did you think it meant nothing  just a kiss    the whispered words washed against the walls like surf  and came back stronger  in harmonies .       did you kiss meant nothing meant a  kiss just think a kiss meant a kiss    wazzer was standing up .   the squad stood petrified as she walked unsteadily past them .   her eyes focused on polly  and then looked down at her own legs .      so good to have a body again     she said .     i wonder what all the fuss is about            so good a body  the fuss is i wonder the fuss    something was in wazzer   s face .  her features were all there  all correct  her nose was as pointed and as red  her cheekbones as hollow   but there were subtle changes .   she held up a hand and flexed her fingers .      ah     she said .     so       there was no echo this time  but the voice was stronger and deeper .  no one would ever have said that wazzer   s voice had been attractive  but this one was .   she turned to jackrum  who dropped onto his fat knees and whipped off his shako .      sergeant jackrum  i know that you know who i am .  you have waded through seas of blood for me .  perhaps we should have done better things with your life  but at least your sins were soldier   s sins  and not the worst of them  at that .  you are hereby promoted to sergeant major  and a better candidate for the job i have never met .  you are steeped in deviousness  cunning  and casual criminality  sergeant jackrum .  you should do well .      jackrum  eyes cast down  raised a knuckle to his forehead .         not worthy  your grace     he muttered .      of course you aren   t .     the duchess looked around .     now  where is my army   ah .      there was no hesitancy now  and none of wazzer   s cowering and downcast eyes .  she positioned herself directly in front of froc  who was staring with her mouth open .      general froc  you must do one final service for me .      the general glared .     who the hell are you .         you need to ask .  as always  jackrum thinks faster than you .  you know me .  i am the duchess annagovia .         but you are       one of the other officers began  but froc held up a hand again .      the voice   is familiar     she said in a faraway whisper .      yes .  you remember the ball .  i remember it  too .  forty years ago .  you were the youngest captain ever .  we danced  stiffly in my case .  i asked you how long you had been a captain  and you said                 three days        breathed froc with her eyes shut .      and we ate brandy pillows  and drank a cocktail that i believe was called              angel   s tears     said froc .     i kept the menu  your grace  and the dance card .         yes     said the duchess .     you did .  and when old general scaffer led you away  he said     that   ll be something to tell your grandchildren  my boy .     but you were   so dedicated that you never had children   and what a man you became   my boy            my boy   my boy       i see heroes .     said the duchess  staring at the tableau of officers .     all of you gave up   much .  but i demand more .  much more .  is there any among you who for the sake of my memory will not die in battle .     wazzer   s head turned and looked along the row  and smiled .      no .  i see there is not .  and now i demand that you do what the ignorant might feel is the easier thing .  you must refrain from dying in battle .  revenge is not redress .  revenge is a wheel  and it turns backwards .  the dead are not your masters .         what is it you want of me  ma   am .     froc managed .      call in your other officers .  make what truces are necessary  for now .  this body  this poor child  will lead you .  i am weak  but i can move small things .  thoughts  perhaps .  i will leave her   something  a light in the eye  a tone in the voice .  follow her .  you must invade .         certainly .  but how           you must invade borogravia .  in the name of sanity  you must go home .  the winter is coming  the trusting animals are not fed  old men die of cold  women mourn  the country corrodes .  fight nuggan  because he is nothing now  nothing but the poisonous echo of all your ignorance and pettiness and malicious stupidity .  find yourself a worthier god .  and let   me   go .  all those prayers  all those entreaties   to me .  too many hands clasped that could more gainfully answer your prayers by effort and resolve .  and what was i .  just a rather stupid woman when i was alive .  but you believed i watched over you  and listened to you   and so i had to  i had to listen  knowing that there was no help   i wish people would not be so careless about what they believe .  go .  invade the one place you   ve never conquered .  and these women will help .  be proud of them .  and  lest you think to twist my meaning  lest you doubt   let me  as i leave  return to you this gift .  remember .  a kiss .          a kiss  a kiss a kiss return to you kiss  remember    as one woman  as one man  the crowd in the room reached up hesitantly to their left cheek .  and wazzer folded up  very gently  collapsing like a sigh .   froc was the first to speak .      this is   i think we need to       she faltered into silence .   jackrum got to his feet  brushed the dust off his shako  placed it on his head and saluted .      permission to speak  sir .     he said .      oh  good heavens  jackrum .     said froc distractedly .     at a time like this .  yes  yes           what are your orders  sir .         orders .     froc blinked and looked around .     orders  orders   yes .  well  i am the commander  i can request a   yes  i can request a truce  sergeant           that   s    sergeant major     sir     said jackrum .     right you are  sir  i   ll organize a runner to go to the alliance .         i suppose a   white flag would be           good as done  sir .  leave it to me     said jackrum  radiating efficiency .      yes  of course   er  before  before we go any further   ladies and gentlemen  i   er   some of the things said here   the whole issue of women joining as   women   obviously       froc raised her hand to her cheek again  in a kind of wonderment .     they are welcome .  i   salute them .  but for those of us that went before  perhaps it is not   not yet the time .  you understand .         what .     said polly .      lips sealed  sir .     said jackrum .     you can leave it all to me  sir .  captain blouse   s squad  attention .  you will obtain uniforms .  you can   t go around still dressed as washerwomen  oh dear me .         we are soldiers .     said polly .      o   course you are  otherwise i wouldn   t be shoutin    at you  you    orrible little woman .  the world   s turned upside down .  it   s a bit more important than you right now  eh .  you   ve got what you   re after  right .  now get hold of a uniform  find yourself a shako  and wipe your face  at least .  you are taking the official truce to the enemy .         me  sarge .     said polly .      right .  just as soon as the officers have done the official letter .     jackrum turned .     tonker  lofty   see what you can find for perks to wear .  perks  don   t be cowed  and bull yourself up .  the rest of you  hurry up and wait .         sergeant jac   er  sergeant major .     said blouse .      yessir .         i   m not a captain  you know .         are you not .     said jackrum  grinning .     well  leave it to jackrum  sir .  we shall see what the day brings  eh .  minor point  sir .  i should lose the dress if i was you .      jackrum marched off  his inflated chest as red as a robin   s and twice as threatening .  he shouted at orderlies  harried guards  saluted officers  and  despite everything  hammered the blade of purpose out of the red hot steel of panic .  he was a sergeant major in a roomful of confused ruperts  and he was happier than a terrier in a barrel of rats .   stopping a battle is much harder that starting it .  starting it only requires you to shout    attack .      but when you want to stop it  everyone is busy .   polly could feel the news spreading .  they   re girls .  the orderlies scuttling in and out once more kept staring at them  as if they were some kind of strange insects .  i wonder how many jackrum missed  polly thought .  i wonder     bits of uniform turned up .  jade found some trousers that fitted by locating a clerk who was polly   s height  lifting him up and pulling them off him .  a jacket was acquired .  lofty even stole a shako of the right size and polished the badge with her sleeve until it gleamed .   polly was just doing up the belt when she spotted a figure on the far side of the room .  she   d completely forgotten about him .   she pulled the belt tight and thrust the leather through the buckle as she walked and then strode through the crowds of figures .  strappi saw her coming  but it was too late .  there was no escape short of running  and captains didn   t run from corporals .  he stood his ground  like a rabbit hypnotized by the approaching vixen  and raised his hands as she approached .      now then  perks  i   m a captain and i had a job to       he began .      and how long do you think you   ll hold that rank now  sir .     hissed polly .     if i tell the general about our little fight .  and how you sicced the prince onto us .  and how you bullied wazzer .  and about my hair  you sticky little miserable apology for a man .  shufti   s a better man than you  and she   s pregnant .         oh  we knew there were women getting in     said strappi .     we just didn   t know how the rot went           you took my hair because you thought it meant something to me     hissed polly .     well  you can keep it .  i   ll grow some more  and no one is going to stop me  understand .  oh  and one other thing .  this is how far the rot goes .      it was a blow rather than a slap  and it knocked him down so hard that he rolled .  but he was strappi  and staggered upright with a finger pointed for vengeance .      she struck a superior officer .     he screamed .   a few heads turned .  they looked at strappi .  they looked at polly .  then they looked back  grinning  at what they were doing .      i should run away again  if i was you     said polly .   she turned on her heel  feeling the heat of his impotent fury .   as she was about to rejoin jade and maladict  someone touched her arm .  she spun around .      what .  oh   sorry  major clogston     she said relaxing .  she felt she wouldn   t be able to deal with strappi again  not without committing murder .  that would probably get her into trouble  even now .      i should like to thank you for a most enjoyable day     said the major .     i did my best  but i think we were all   outclassed .         thank you  sir     said polly .      this was a pleasure  corporal perks     said clogston .     i shall watch your future career with interest and envy .  congratulations .  and since in here protocol seems to be flapping loose  i will shake you by the hand .      they did so .     and now  we have duties     said major clogston as jade arrived with a white sheet on a pole .     oh  and by the way   my name is christine .  but  you know  i really don   t think i could get used to wearing a dress again           maladict and jade were chosen to see polly through the castle  a troll because a troll commands respect and a vampire because a vampire demands it .   there were groans and cheers as they elbowed their way along the passages  because news had already got around .  that was another reason for taking jade .  trolls could push .      okay     said jackrum  bringing up the rear .     at the bottom of these steps there   s a door  and beyond that door is enemy territory .  put the white flag out first .  important safety tip .         can   t you come with us  sarge .         hah  me .  i daresay there   s a few people out there who   d take a potshot at me  white flag or no .  don   t you worry .  the word   s gone out .         what word   s that  sarge .      jackrum leaned closer .      they ain   t gonna shoot a girl  perks .         you told them .         let   s just say that news gets around fast     said jackrum .     grab the advantage .  and i   ll find your brother while you   re gone  upon my oath .  oh  one other thing   look at me  perks .      polly turned in the crowded  jostling corridor .   jackrum   s eyes twinkled .      i know i can trust you  perks .  make the most of it  lad .  kissin    don   t last .      well  that couldn   t be plainer  polly thought as the armed men by the door beckoned them forward .      stick to the walls  okay  ladies .  and be quick with that rag .      the heavy door swung open .  half a dozen arrows bounced and pinwheeled along the corridor .  another one tore through the flag .   polly waved it desperately .  she heard distant shouting and then cheers .      go .  go .     said a guard  pushing her forward .   she stepped out into the sudden daylight and  to make sure  waved the flag overhead a few more times .  there were men in the courtyard and lining the battlements around it .  there were bodies  too .   a captain  with blood soaking through his jacket  stepped across the fallen and held out his hand .      you may give that to me  soldier     he said .      no  sir .  i must deliver it to your commander  and wait for his reply  sir .         then you give it to me  soldier  and i will bring you back the reply .  you have surrendered  after all .      polly shook her head .     no .  this is a truce .  that   s not the same thing .  i have to hand this over personally and you aren   t big enough .     a thought hit her .     i demand to take this to commander vimes .      the captain stared at her  and then looked closer .      aren   t you one of those       he began .      yes     sighed polly .      and you locked them in chains and threw the key away .         yes     said polly  seeing her past life start to flash before her eyes .      and they had to hop miles with shackles on and no clothes .         yes .         and you   re just   women .         yes .     said polly  letting the    just    go for now .   the captain leaned closer and spoke while trying not to move his lips .      dan gug show .  ell done .  agout time soes arragunk arsetards ere aken own a eg .      he leaned back .     commander vimes it is  then .  follow me  miss .      polly felt hundreds of eyes on her as the squad was let into the inner keep .  there were one or two wolf whistles  because there were more soldiers in there  including quite a few trolls .  jade bent down  snatched up a rock  and hurled it at one of them  hitting him between the eyes .      no one move .     shouted maladict  waving his hands urgently as a hundred men raised their weapons .     that was a troll version of blowing a kiss .      and  indeed  the troll who had been hit was waving at jade  a little unsteadily .      can we knock it off with the lovey dovey  please .     said polly to jade  as bows were lowered .     the soft people are likely to get the wrong idea .         it   s stopped the whistling  though     maladict observed .   more people watched them as they climbed flight after flight of stone steps .  no one could take this place  polly could see that .  every flight was seen by another one higher up  every visitor would be sighted on before she   d even glimpsed a face .   a figure stepped out of the shadows as they reached the next floor .  it was a young woman  in old fashioned leather and mail armor  with a breastplate .  she had long  very fair hair  for the first time in weeks  polly felt a twinge of envy .      thank you  captain  i   ll take over from here     she said and nodded to polly .     good evening  corporal perks   if you would follow me  please .         she   s a woman .  and a sergeant .     maladict whispered as angua led them down a wide corridor .      yes  i know     said polly .      but she gave an order to that captain .         maybe she   s a political           and she   s obviously female .         i   m not blind  mal     said polly .      i   m not deaf  either     said the woman  turning and smiling .     my name is angua .  if you will wait here  i   ll have some coffee sent in .  there   s a bit of an argument going on in there at the moment .      they were in a sort of anteroom  not much more that a widened area of the corridor  with a few benches .  there were big double doors at the far end  behind which voices were being raised .   angua left .      just like that .     said maladict .     what   s to stop us taking over the place .         all those men with crossbows we passed on the way up .     said polly .  why us .  she thought  looking blankly at the wall .      oh  yes .  those .  yes     said maladict .     er   poll .         yes .         i   m actually maladicta .     she sat back .     there .  i   ve told someone .         dat   s nice     said jade .      oh  good     said polly .  i   d be going out to give the latrines their afternoon swill about now  she thought .  this has got to be better than that  right .      i thought i did pretty well     maladicta went on .     now  i know what you   re thinking .  you   re thinking  vampires have a pretty good time of it whatever sex they are  right .  but it   s the same everywhere .  velvet dresses  underwired nightgowns  acting crazy all the time  and don   t let   s even go near the whole    bathing in virgin   s blood    thing .  you get taken a lot more seriously if they think you   re male .         right     said polly .  all in all  it   s been a long day .  a bath would be nice .      i thought i did pretty well right up until the whole coffee thing .  a necklace of the roast beans  that   d be the thing .  i   ll be better prepared another time .         yeah     said polly .     good idea .  with real soap .         soap .  how would soap work .         what .  oh   sorry     said polly .      did you hear anything i said .     said maladicta looking pained .      oh  that .  yes .  thank you for telling me .         is that it .         yes     said polly .     you   re you .  that   s good .  i   m me  whoever i am .  tonker   s tonker .  it   s all just   people .  look  a week ago the high spot of my day was reading the new graffiti in the men   s latrines .  i think you   d agree that a lot has happened since then .  i don   t think i   m going to be surprised at anything anymore .  the coffee bean necklace sounds good  by the way .     she drummed her feet on the floor impatiently .     right now  i just wish they   d hurry up in there .      they sat and listened  and then polly became aware of a little column of smoke coming from behind a bench on the other side of the space .  she walked over and peered over the back .  a man was lying there  head on one arm  smoking a cigar .   he nodded when he saw polly   s face .      they   re going to be ages yet     he said .      aren   t you that sergeant i saw in the old kitchen .  making faces behind lord rust from ankh morpork .         i was not making faces  corporal     said the man  sitting up .     that   s how i always look when lord rust is talking .  and i was a sergeant once  it   s true  but  look  no stripes .         make der faces once too often .     said jade .   the man laughed .  he hadn   t shaved today  by the look of it .      something like that  yes .  come along to my office  it   s warmer .  i only came out here because people complain about the smoke .  don   t worry about that lot in there  they can wait .  i   m only down the passage .      they followed him .  the door was  indeed  only a few steps away .  the man pushed it open  walked across the little room beyond  and sat down in a chair .  the table in front of it overflowed with papers .      i think we can get enough food up here to see you through the winter     he said  picking up a sheet of paper  apparently at random .     grain   s a bit short but we   ve got a handy surplus of white drumhead cabbage  keeps wonderfully  full of vitamins and minerals   but you might want to keep your windows open  if you follow me .  don   t stare  i know the country   s a month away from starvation .         but i haven   t even shown this letter to anyone .     polly protested .     you don   t know what we           i don   t have to     said the man .     this is about food and mouths .  good grief  we don   t have to fight you .  your country is going to fall over anyway .  your fields are overgrown  most of your farmers are old men  the bulk of the grub goes to the army .  and armies don   t do much for agriculture except marginally raise the fertility of the battlefield .  the honor  the pride  the glory   none of that matters .  this war stops  or borogravia dies .  do you understand .      polly remembered the gale swept fields  the old people salvaging what they could        we   re just messengers     she said .     i can   t negotiate           you know your god   s dead .     said the man .     nothing left but a voice  according to some of our priests .  the last three abominations were against rocks  ears  and accordion players .  okay  i might be with him on the last one  but   rocks .  hah .  we can advise you if you   re going to look for a new one  by the way .  om   s very popular at the moment .  very few abominations  no special clothing  and hymns you can sing in the bath .  you won   t get offler the crocodile god up here with your winters  and the unorthodox potato church is probably a bit too uncomplicated for        polly started to laugh .      look  sir  i   m just a   what is your name  please .         sam vimes .  special envoy  which is kind of like an ambassador but without the little gold chocolates .         vimes the butcher .     said maladicta .      oh  yes .  i   ve heard that one     said vimes  grinning .     your people haven   t really mastered the fine art of propaganda .  and i   m telling you because   well  have you heard of om .      they shook their heads .      no .  well  in the old book of om there   s a story about some city full of wickedness  and om decided to destroy it with holy fire  this being back in the old smiting days before he   d got religion .  but bishop horn protested this plan  and om said he   d spare the city if the bishop could find one good man .  well  the bishop knocked on every door  and turned up empty handed .  it turned out  after the place had been reduced to a big puddle of glass  that there were probably plenty of good people there and  being good  they weren   t the sort to admit it .  death by modesty  a terrible thing .  and you  ladies  are the only borogravians i know much about  apart from the military  who  frankly  aren   t chatty .  you don   t appear to be as insane as your country   s foreign policy .  you   re the one piece of international goodwill it has .  a bunch of young boys outwitting crack cavalrymen .  kicking the prince in the fork .  people at home liked that .  and now it turns out that you   re girls .  they   ll love that .  mr .  de worde is going to have fun with that when he finds out .  and i   ll see he does .         but we don   t have any power .  we can   t negotiate a           what does borogravia want .  not the country .  i mean the people .      polly opened her mouth to reply  and then shut it again and thought about the answer .      to be left alone     she said .     by everybody .  for a while  anyway .  we can change things .         you   ll accept the food .         we are a proud country .         what are you proud of .      it came swiftly  like a blow  and polly realized how wars happened .  you took that shock that had run through her  and let it boil .      it may be corrupt  benighted  and stupid  but it   s ours     vimes was watching her face .      from this desk here     he said     the only thing your country has to be proud of right now is you women .      polly stayed silent .  she was still trying to cope with the anger .  it made it worse to know that he was right .  we have our pride .  and that   s what we   re proud of .  we   re proud of being proud        very well  then  will you buy some food .     said vimes  watching her carefully .     on credit .  i suppose you still have someone in your country who knows about the kind of international affairs that don   t involve edged weapons .         people would accept that  yes     said polly hoarsely .      good .  i   ll send a clacks back tonight .         and why would you be so generous  mr .  ankh morpork .         because i   m from a wonderfully warm hearted city  corporal   hah  no  i can   t say that and keep a straight face     said vimes .     do you want to know the truth .  most people in ankh morpork hadn   t even heard of your country until the clacks went down .  there   s dozens of little countries around here selling one another hand painted clogs or beer made from turnips .  then they knew you as the bloody mad idiots who fight everyone .  now they know you as   well  people who   d do just what they   d do .  and tomorrow they   ll laugh .  and there   re other people  people who sit and think about the future every day  who believe it   s worth a little to be friends with a country like that .         why .     said maladicta suspiciously .      because ankh morpork is a friend to all freedom loving people everywhere .     said vimes .     gods  it must be the way i tell    em .  ze chzy brogocia proztfik .     he saw their blank expressions .     sorry  i   ve been away from home too long .  and frankly  i   d rather be back there .         but why did you say you were a cherry pancake .     said polly .      didn   t i say i am a citizen of borogravia .         no .  brogocia is the cherry pancake  borogvia is the country .         well  i made the effort  at least .  look  we   d rather prince heinrich wasn   t ruler of two countries .  that   d make one quite big country  much bigger than the other ones around here .  so it   d probably get bigger still .  he wants to be like ankh morpork  you see .  but what he means is he wants power and influence .  he doesn   t want to earn them  he doesn   t want to grow into them or learn the hard way how to use them .  he just wants them .         that   s playing politics .     said maladicta .      no .  it   s just telling the truth .  make peace with him  by all means .  just leave the road and the towers alone .  you   ll get the food anyway  at whatever price .  mr .  de worde   s article will see to that .         you sent the coffee     said polly .      oh  yes .  that was corporal buggy swires  my eye in the sky .  he   s a gnome .         and you set a werewolf on us .         well     set    is a bit strong .  angua followed you  just to be on the safe side .  she   s a werewolf  yes .         the girl we met .  she didn   t look like one .         well  they don   t  usually     said vimes .     right up until the moment when they do  if you see what i mean .  and she was following you because i was looking for anything that   d stop thousands of people dying  that   s why .  and that   s not politics either     said vimes .  he stood up .     and now  ladies  i have to go and present your document to the alliance leaders .         you came out for a smoke at the right time  didn   t you     said polly slowly and carefully .     you knew we were on our way  and you made sure you   d get to us first .         of course .  can   t leave this to a bunch of   oh  yes   ruperts .         where is my brother  mister vimes .     said polly stiffly .      you seem very sure i know       said vimes  not looking her in the face .      i   m certain you do     said polly .      why .         because no one else does .      vimes stubbed out his cigar .     angua was right about you     he said .     yes  i  er  arranged for him to be put in what i like to call    protective custody .     he   s fine .  angua will take you to him now  if you like .  your brother  possibility of revenge  blackmail  who knows what   i thought he might be safer if i know exactly who holds the keys .      the end of the journey  polly thought .  but it wasn   t  not anymore .   she got the distinct impression that the man opposite was reading her thoughts .      that   s what all this was about  wasn   t it .     he said .      no  sir .  it   s just how it started     said polly .      well  it continues like this     said vimes .     this is going to be a busy day .  right now i shall take this offer of a truce in the room down the passage and present it to the very important men     his voice went flat to say those words     who are discussing what to do about borogravia .  you   ll get a truce  the food  and probably some other help .         how do you know that .     said polly .     they haven   t discussed it .         not yet .  but  as i told you   i used to be a sergeant .  angua .      the door opened .  angua came in .  as vimes had said  you couldn   t tell who was a werewolf until you found out        and now i   d better have a shave before i go to see the very important men     said vimes .     people set a lot of store by shaving .         polly felt embarrassed walking down the steps with sergeant angua .  how did you start a conversation .     so you   re a werewolf  then .     would be sort of idiotic .  she was glad that jade and maladicta had been left in the waiting room .      yes  i am     said angua .      but i didn   t say it .     polly burst out .      no  but i   m used to situations like this .  i   ve learned to recognize the way people don   t say things .  don   t worry .         you followed us     said polly .      yes .         so you must   ve known we weren   t men .         oh  yes     said angua .     my sense of smell is much better than my eyesight  and i   ve got sharp eyes .  humans are smelly creatures .  for what it   s worth  though  i wouldn   t have told mister vimes if i hadn   t heard you talking to one another .  anyone could have heard you  you don   t need to be a werewolf for that .  everyone   s got secrets they don   t want known .  werewolves are a bit like vampires in that way .  we   re tolerated   if we   re careful .         that i can understand     said polly .  so are we  she thought .   angua stopped by a heavy  studded door .     he   s in here     she said  producing a key and turning it in the lock .     i   ll go back and chat with the others .  come and find me when you   re ready        polly stepped inside  heart pounding  and there was paul .  and there was a buzzard  on a perch by the open window .   and on the wall  where paul was working so intensely that his tongue was sticking out of the corner of his mouth and he hadn   t even noticed the door opening  was another buzzard  flying in the heart of the sunrise .   right now  polly could forgive ankh morpork anything .  someone had found paul a box of colored chalks .      what was a long day began to get longer     she had a kind of power .  they all did .  people gave them space  watched them .  the fighting had stopped and they were the cause and no one knew exactly why .   there were lighter moments .  they might have power  but general froc gave the orders .  and general froc might give the orders  but it was permissible to suppose that it was sergeant major jackrum who anticipated them .   and perhaps that was why shufti asked polly and tonker to go with her  and they were ushered into a room where a couple of guards stood on either side of a sheepish young man called johnny who had fair hair and blue eyes and a gold earring and his trousers round his knees in case shufti wanted to check his other distinguishing feature .   he also had a black eye .      this the one .     said major clogston  who was leaning against the wall eating an apple .     the general has asked me to tell you that there will be a dowry of five hundred crowns  with the army   s compliments .      johnny brightened up slightly when he heard that .   shufti gave him a long and careful look .      no     she said at last  turning away .     that   s not him .      johnny opened his mouth  and polly snapped     no one asked you to speak  private .     and such was the nature of the day that he shut up .      oh  dear .  i   m afraid he   s the only candidate     said clogston .     we   ve got any amount of earrings  heads of fair hair  blue eyes  johnnies  and  surprisingly  a fair number of carbuncles .  but he   s the only one with everything .  are you sure .         positive     said shufti  still staring at the boy .     my johnny must have been killed .      clogston walked over and lowered her voice .      in that case  uh  the general did say  informally  that a marriage certificate  a ring  and a widow   s pension could be arranged     she said .      can she do that .     whispered polly .      for one of you .  today .  you   ll be amazed what can be done     said clogston .     don   t think too badly of her .  she means well .  she   s a very practical man .         no     said shufti .     i   it   s   well  no .  thank you  but no .         are you sure .     said polly .      positive     said shufti  looking defiant .  since she was not naturally a defying kind of person  it was not quite the look that she thought it was and ought to have been  having overtones of hemorrhoid sufferer  but the effort was there .   clogston stepped back .     well  if you   re certain  private .  fair enough  then .  take that man away  sergeant .         just a moment     said shufti .  she walked over to the bewildered johnny  stood in front of him  held out her hand and said     before they take you away again i want my sixpence back  you son of a bitch .      polly held out her hand to clogston  who shook it and smiled .  there had been another little victory  of sorts .  if the landslide is big enough  even square pebbles will roll .      polly headed back to the rather larger cell that had been made available as the women   s barracks  or at least the barracks for the official women .  men  grown men  had fallen over themselves to put cushions in there  and bring in wood for the fire .  it was all very strange .  polly felt they were being treated as something dangerous and fragile  like  say  a huge and wonderful jar full of poison .   she turned the corner into the big courtyard and there was de worde  with mr .  chriek .  there was no escaping them .  they were definitely people looking for someone .  the man was dragging out his notebook even as he came toward her  and gave her a look in which reproach was mingled with hope .      er   so you   re women  then .     he said .      er  yes     said polly .  that seemed to cover it .      but you didn   t tell me when we met before     said de worde  as if this was some dereliction of manners .      sorry .  but we didn   t tell you we were men  either .      de worde  a man who wrote things down  found a nice new page in his book .      this is an amazing story     he said .     you really fought your way here and got in disguised as washerwomen .         well  we were women  and we did do some washing     said polly .     i suppose it was quite a cunning disguise  really .  we got in by not being disguised  you could say .         general froc and captain blouse say they   re very proud of you     de worde went on  scribbling .      oh  he has got promoted  then .     said polly .      yes  and froc said you did wonderfully well  for women .         yes  i suppose we did     said polly .     yes .  very well  for women .         the general went on to say       de worde consulted his notebook     that you are a credit to the women of your country .  i wonder if you   d care to comment .      he looked innocent  so possibly he didn   t understand the raging argument that had just broken out in polly   s head .  a credit to the women of your country .  we   re proud of you .  somehow those words locked you away  put you in your place  patted you on the head and dismissed you with a sweetie .  on the other hand  you had to start somewhere        that   s very nice of them     said polly .     but we just want to get the job done and go home .  that   s what soldiers want .     she thought for a moment  and then added     and hot sweet tea .      to her amazement  he wrote this down  too .      just one last question  miss  do you think the world would be a different place if more women were soldiers .     de worde asked .  he was smiling again  she noted  so this was probably a jokey kind of question .      oh  i think you   d have to ask general froc that     said polly .  and i   d like to watch her expression if you do        yes  but what do you think  miss .         that   s    corporal     please .         sorry  corporal   and .      the pencil was hovering .  around it  the world turned .  it wrote things down  and then they got everywhere .  the pen might not be mightier than the sword  but maybe the printing press was heavier that the siege weapon .  just a few words can change everything        well     said polly     i        there was a sudden bustling around the gates at the other end of the courtyard  and some cavalry officers arrived .  they must have been expected  because zlobenian officers were converging in a great hurry .      ah  i see the prince is back     said de worde .     he   s probably not going to be happy about the truce .  they sent some gallopers out to meet him .         can he do anything about it .      de worde shrugged .     he left some very senior officers here .  it would be rather shocking if he did .      the tall figure had dismounted  and was striding toward polly  or rather  she realized  the big doorway next to her .  frantic clerks and officers trailed after him  and were brushed off .  but when a white oblong was waved in front of his face by one man  he grabbed it and stopped so quickly that several other officers bumped into him .      um     said de worde .     the edition with the cartoon  i expect .  um .      the paper was thrown down .      yes  probably that was it     de worde went on .   heinrich advanced .  now polly could make out his expression .  it was thunderous .   beside her  de worde turned over to a fresh page in his notebook and cleared his throat .      you   re going to talk to him .     said polly .     in that mood .  he   ll cut you down .         i have to     said de worde .  and  as the prince and his retinue reached the doorway  he took a step forward and said  in a voice that cracked slightly     your highness .  i wonder if i could have a word .      heinrich turned to scowl at him and saw polly .  for a moment  their gazes locked .   the prince   s adjutants knew their master .  as the man   s hand flew to his sword  they closed on him in a mob  completely surrounding him  and there was some frantic whispering  in which some rather louder injections from heinrich on the broad theme of    what .     could be heard  followed by a toccata on    the hell you say .     and a riff in the key of    what  seriously .      the crowd parted again .  the prince slowly and carefully brushed some dust off his spotless jacket  glanced only briefly at otto and de worde  and  to polly   s horror  strolled toward her  suddenly all shiny smiles        and with one white gloved hand extended .   oh no  she thought .  but he   s cleverer than vimes thinks he is  and he can control his temper .  and  suddenly  i   m everyone   s mascot .      for the good of our great countries     said heirich     it is suggested that we publicly shake the hand of friendship .     he smiled again  or at least allowed the corners of his mouth to turn up .   because she could think of no other way out  polly took the huge hand and obediently shook it .      oh  ver    good     said otto  grasping his picture box .     i can only take zer vun  of course  because unfortunately i shall haf to use flash .  just vun moment        polly was learning that an art form that happens in a fraction of a second nevertheless needs a long time to take place  allowing a smile to freeze into a mad grimace or  in the worst cases  a death rictus .  otto muttered to himself as he adjusted the equipment .   heinrich and polly maintained the grip and stared at the picture box .      so     muttered the prince out of the corner of his mouth     the soldier boy isn   t a soldier boy .  that is your good luck .      polly kept her fixed grin .      do you often menace frightened women .     she said .      oh  that was nothing .  you are only a peasant girl  after all .  what do you know of life .  and you showed spirit .         everyvun say chiz .     otto commanded .     vun  two  three   oh  bug        by the time the after images had died away  otto was back on his feet again .     vun day i really hope to find a filter zat works     he muttered .     thank you  everyvun  neverzerless .         that was for peace and goodwill between nations     said polly  smiling sweetly and letting go of the prince   s hand .  she took a step back .     and this  your highness  is for me        actually  she didn   t kick .  life was a process of finding out how far you could go too far  and you could probably go too far in finding out how far you could go .  but a mere twitch of a leg was enough  just to see the idiot collapse in the ridiculous  knock kneed  protective crouch that is as instinctive to a man as saving half an onion is to a woman .   she marched away  singing inside .  this was not a fairy tale castle and there was no such thing as a fairy tale ending  but sometimes you could threaten to kick the handsome prince in the ham and eggs .   and now  there was one other little thing .      the sun was setting before polly found jackrum again  and blood red light shone through the high windows of the keep   s biggest kitchen .   he was sitting alone at a long table by the fire  in full uniform .  and he was eating a thick slab of bread plastered with pork dripping .  a mug of beer was not far from his other hand .   jackrum looked up as she approached  and nodded companionably toward another chair .  around them  women ran to and fro .      pork drippin    with salt and pepper  and a mug of beer     he said .     that   s the ticket .  you can keep your cuisine .  want a slice .     he waved a hand at one of the kitchen girls who was dancing attendance on him .      not right now  sarge .         sure .     said jackrum .     there   s an old sayin        kissing don   t last  cooking do .     i hope that it   s one you don   t have cause to reflect upon .      polly sat down .      kissing is lasting so far     she said .      shufti get sorted out .     said jackrum .  he finished the beer  snapped his fingers at the serving girl  and pointed to the empty mug .      to her own satisfaction  sarge     said polly .      fair enough .  you can   t get fairer .  so what next  perks .         dunno  sarge .  i   ll go with wa   with alice and the army and see what happens .         best of luck .  look after    em  perks     cos i ain   t coming     said jackrum .      sarge .     said polly  shocked .      well  looks like we   re going to be short by one war at present  eh .  anyway  this is it .  the end of the road .  i   ve done my bit .  can   t go on now .  shot me quiver with the general  and i daresay he  ahem  will be glad to see the back of me .  besides  old age is creepin    on .  i killed five poor devils when we attacked today  and afterwards i found meself wonderin    why .  not good  that .  time to get out before i blunt me own edge .         you   re sure  sarge .         yeah .  seems to me the ol       my country right or wrong    thing has had its day .  time to put my feet up and find out what it is we   ve been fighting for .  sure you won   t have any dripping .  it   s got crunchy bits .  that   s what i call style  in dripping .      polly waved away the proffered slab of grease smeared bread  and sat in silence while jackrum engulfed it .      funny thing  really     she said  at last .      what   s that  perks .         finding out that it   s not about you .  you think you   re the hero  and it turns out you   re really part of someone else   s story .  wazz   alice will be the one they remember .  we just had to get her here .      jackrum said nothing but  as polly would have predicted  pulled his crumpled bag of chewing tobacco out of his pocket .   she slipped a hand in her own pocket and pulled out a small packet .  pockets  she thought .  we   ve got to hang on to pockets .  a soldier needs pockets .      try this  sarge     she said .     go on  open it .      it was a small  soft leather pouch  with a drawstring .  jackrum held it up so that it twisted this way and that .      well  perks  upon my oath  i am not a swearing man       he began .      no  you   re not .  i   ve noticed     said polly .     but that grubby old paper was getting on my nerves .  why didn   t you ever get a proper pouch made for yourself .  one of the saddlers here sewed that up for me in half an hour .         well  that   s life  isn   t it .     said jackrum .     every day you think     ye gods  it   s about time i had a new bag     but then it all gets so busy you end up using the old one .  thank you  perks .         oh  i thought     what can i give the man who has everything .     and that was all i could afford     said polly .     but you don   t have everything  sarge .  sarge .  you don   t  do you        she sensed him freeze over .  the noises of the kitchen went away  beyond a dome of frigid silence .      you stop right there  perks     he said  lowering his voice .      i just thought you might like to show someone that locket of yours  sarge     said polly cheerfully .     the one round your neck .  and don   t glare at me  sarge .  oh  yeah  i could walk away and i   d never be sure  really sure  and maybe you   d never show it to anyone else  ever  or tell them the story  and one day we   ll both be dead and   well  what a waste  eh .      jackrum glared .      upon your oath  you are not a dishonest man     said polly .     good one  sarge .  you told people every day .      around them  beyond the dome  the kitchen buzzed with the busyness of women .  women always seemed to be doing things with their hands   holding babies  or pans  or plates  or wool  or a brush  or a needle .  even when they were talking  busyness was happening .      no one would believe yer     said jackrum  at last .      who would i want to tell .     said polly .     and you   re right .  no one would believe me .  i   d believe you  though .      jackrum stared into his fresh mug of beer  as if trying to see the future in the foam .  he seemed to reach a decision  pulled the chain out of his noisome undershirt  unfastened the locket  and gently snapped it open .      there you go     he said  passing it across .     much good may it do you .      there was a miniature painting in each side of the locket  a dark haired girl  and a blond young man in the uniform of the ins and outs .      good one of you     said polly .      pull the other one  it has got bells on     said jackrum .      no  honestly     said polly .     i look at the picture  and look at you   i can see that face in her face .  paler  of course .  not so   full .  and who was the boy .         william  his name was     said jackrum .      your sweetheart .         yes .         and you followed him into the army           oh  yeah .  same old story .  i was a big strong girl  and   well  you can see the picture .  the artist did his best  but i was never an oil painting .  barely a watercolor  really .  where i came from  what a man looked for in a future wife was someone who could lift a pig under each arm .  and a couple of days later i was lifting a pig under each arm  helping my dad  and one of my clogs came off in the muck and the ol    man was yelling at me and i thought  the hell with this  willie never yelled .  got hold of some men   s clothes  never you mind how  cut my hair right off  kissed the duchess  and was a chosen man within three months .         what   s that .         it   s what we used to call a corporal     said jackrum .     chosen man .  yeah  i smiled about that  too .  and i was on my way .  the army   s a piece of piss compared to running a pig farm and looking after three lazy brothers .         how long ago was that  sarge .         couldn   t say  really .  i swear i don   t know how old i am  and that   s the truth     said jackrum .     lied about my age so often i ended up believing me .     she began  very carefully  to transfer the chewing tobacco into the new bag .      and your young man .     said polly quietly .      oh  we had great times  great times     said jackrum  stopping for a moment to stare at nothing .     he never got promoted on account of his stutter  but i had a good shouty voice  and officers like that .  but willie never minded  not even when i made it to sergeant .  and then he got killed at sepple  right next to me .         i   m sorry .         you don   t have to be  you didn   t kill him     said jackrum evenly .     but i stepped over his body and skewered the bugger that did .  wasn   t his fault .  wasn   t my fault .  we were soldiers .  and then a few months later i had a bit of a surprise  and he was called william  too  just like his father .  good job i had a bit of leave  eh .  me gran raised him for me  put him to a trade as an armorer over in scritz .  good trade  that .  no one kills a good armorer .  they tell me he looks just like his dad .  a captain i met once had bought a bloody good sword off him .  showed it to me  not knowin    the his   try  o   course .  damn good sword .  it had scroll work on the hilt and everything  very classy .  he   s married with four kids now  i heard .  got a carriage and pair  servants  big house   yeah  i see you   re paying attention           wazzer   well  wazzer and the duchess said           yeah  yeah  they talked about scritz  and a sword     said jackrum .     that   s when i knew it wasn   t just me watchin    over you lads .  i knew you   d survive .  the old girl needed you .         so you   ve got to go there  sarge     said polly .      got to .  who says .  i   ve served the old girl the whole of my life  and she   s got no call on me now .  i   m my own man  always have been .         are you  sarge .     said polly .      are you crying  perks .         well   it   s a bit sad  sarge .         oh  i daresay i sobbed a bit too  once in a while     said jackrum  still tucking the tobacco into the new pouch .     but when all   s said and done  i   ve had a good life .  saw the cavalry break at the battle of slomp .  i was part of the thin red line that turned aside the heavy brigade at sheep   s drift  i saved the imperial flag from four real bastards at raladan  and i   ve been to a lot of foreign countries and met some very interesting people  who i mostly subsequently killed before they could do me over good and proper .  lost a lover  still got a son   there   s many a woman who   s faced worse  believe me .         and   you spotted other girls           hah .  became a kind of hobby  really .  most of    em were frightened little things  running away from god knows what .  they got found out soon enough .  and there were plenty like shufti  chasin    their lad .  but there were a few who had what i call the twinkle .  a bit of fire  maybe .  they just needed pointing in the right direction .  i gave them a leg up  you might say .  a sergeant   s a powerful man  sometimes .  a word here  a nod there  sometimes even doctorin    some paperwork  a whisper in the dark              a pair of socks     said polly .      yeah  that sort of thing     said jackrum  grinning .     always a big concern to them  the whole latrine business .  least of your worries  i used to say .  in peace no one cares  in battle everyone takes a piss the same way  and damn quickly  too .  oh  i helped    em .  i was their whatsit  their eminence grease  and grease it was  too  slidin    them to the top .  jackrum   s little lads  i called    em .         and they never suspected .         what  suspect jolly jack jackrum  so full of rum and vinegar .     said jackrum  the old evil grin coming back .     jack jackrum  who could stop a bar fight by belchin    .  no  sir .  i daresay some of    em suspected something  maybe  i daresay they worked out that there was something going on somewhere  but i was just the big fat sergeant who knew everyone and everything and drank everything  too .      polly dabbed at her eyes .      what are you going to do now  then  if you don   t go to scritz .         oh  i   ve got a bit put by     said jackrum .     more than a bit  in point of actual fact .  pillage  plunder  loot   it all adds up  whatever you call it .  i didn   t piss it all up against a wall like the other lads  right .  i expect i can remember most of the bleedin    places i buried it .  always thought i might open an inn  or maybe a knocking shop   oh  a proper high class place  you don   t have to look at me like that  nothin    like that stinking tent .  no  i   m talkin    about one with a chef and chandeliers and a lot of red velvet  very exclusive .  i   d get some nobby lady to front it and i   d be the bouncer and run the bar .  here   s a tip  lad  for your future career  and it   s one some of the other little lads learned for    emselves  sometimes it   ll help if you visits one of them naughty places  otherwise the men   ll wonder about you .  i always used to take a book to read and advise the young lady to get some sleep     cos they does a tough job .      polly let that pass  but said     you don   t want to go back and see your grandchildren .         wouldn   t wish meself on him  lad     said jackrum firmly .     wouldn   t dare .  my boy   s a well respected man in the town .  what   ve i got to offer .  he   ll not want some fat ol    biddy banging on his back door and gobbing baccy juice all over the place and telling him she   s his mother .      polly looked at the fire for a moment  and felt the idea creep into her mind .      what about a distinguished looking sergeant major  shiny with braid  loaded with medals  arriving at the front door in a grand coach and telling him he   s his father .     she said .   jackrum stared .      tides of war  and all that     polly went on  mind suddenly racing .     young love .  duty calls .  families scattered .  hopeless searching .  decades pass .  fond memories .  then   oh  an overheard conversation in a bar  yeah  that   d work .  hope springs .  a new search .  greasing palms .  the recollections of old women .  at last  an address           what   re you saying  perks .         you   re a liar  sarge     said polly  leaning forward .     best i   ve ever heard .  one last lie pays for all .  why not .  you could show him the locket .  you could tell him about the girl you left behind you        jackrum looked away  but said     you   re a shining bastard of a thinker  perks .  and where would i get a grand coach  anyway .         oh  sarge .  today .  there are   men in high places who   ll give you anything you ask for  right now .  you know that .  especially if it meant they   d see the back of you .  you never put the bite on them for anything much .  if i was you  sarge  i   d cash in a few favors while you can .  that   s the ins and outs  sarge .  take the cheese while it   s there     cos kissin    don   t last .      jackrum took a deep  long breath .      i   ll think about it  perks .  now you push off  all right .      polly stood up .     think hard  sarge  eh .  like you said  anyone who   s got anyone left is ahead of the game right now .  four grandchildren .  i   d be a proud kid if i had a grandad who could spit tobacco juice far enough to hit a fly on the opposite wall .         i   m warning you  perks .         it was just a thought  sarge .         yeah   right     jackrum growled .      thanks for getting us through it  sarge .      jackrum didn   t turn around .      i   ll be going then  sarge .         perks .     said jackrum  as she reached the door .  polly stepped back into the room .      yes  sarge .         i   expected better of    em  really .  i thought they   d be better at it than men .  trouble was  they were better than men at being like men .  hah  they do say the army can make a man of you  eh .  so   whatever it is you are going to do next  do it as you .  good or bad  do it as you .  too many lies and there   s no truth to go back to .         will do  sarge .         that   s an order  perks .  oh   and perks .         yes  sarge .         thanks  perks .      polly paused when she got to the door .  jackrum had turned her chair to the fire  and had settled back .  around her  the kitchen worked .      six months passed .  the world wasn   t perfect  but it was still turning .   polly had kept the newspaper articles .  they weren   t accurate  not in the detail  because the writer told   stories  not what was actually happening .  they were like paintings  when you had been there and had seen the real thing .   but it was true about the march on the castle  with wazzer on a white horse in front  carrying the flag .  and it was true about people coming out of their houses and joining the march  so that what arrived at the gates was not an army but a sort of disciplined mob  shouting and cheering .  and it was true that the guards had taken one look at it and had seriously reconsidered their future  and that gates had swung open even before the horse had clattered onto the drawbridge .  there was no fighting  no fighting at all .  the shoe had dropped .  the country had breathed out .   polly didn   t think it was true that the painting of the duchess  alone on its easel in the big  empty throne room  had smiled when wazzer walked toward it .  polly had been there and didn   t see  but lots of people swore it had  and you might end up wondering what the truth really was  or whether there was the truth  and then again  if there was also the truth and  of course  the truth .  anyway  it was the stuff of legends  where accuracy is not required as a major ingredient .   anyway  it had worked .  and then      they went home .  a lot of soldiers did  under the fragile truce .  the first snows were already falling and  if people had wanted a war  then the winter had given them one .  it came with lances of ice and arrows of hunger  it filled the passes with snow  it made the world as distant as the moon     that was when the old dwarf mines had opened up  and pony after pony emerged .  it had always been said there were dwarf tunnels everywhere  and not just tunnels  there were secret canals under the mountains  docks  flights of locks that could lift a barge a mile high in busy darkness  far below the gales on the mountain tops .   they brought  indeed  cabbage and potatoes and roots and apples and barrels of fat  things that kept .   and winter was defeated  and the snowmelt roared down the valleys  and the kneck scrawled its random wiggles across the flat silt of the valley .   they   d gone home and polly wondered if they   ve ever really been away .  were we soldiers .  she wondered .  they   d been cheered on the road to prince marmaduke piotre albert hans joseph bernhardt wilhelmsberg  and had been much better treated than their rank deserved  and even had a special uniform designed for them .  but the vision of gummy abbens kept arising in her mind     we weren   t soldiers  she decided .  we were girls in uniform .  we were like a lucky charm .  we were mascots .  we weren   t real  we were always a symbol of something .  we   d done very well  for women .  and we were temporary .   tonker and lofty were never going to be dragged back to the school now  and they   d gone their own way .  wazzer had joined the general   s household  and had a room of her own and quietness  and made herself useful  and was never beaten .  she   d written polly a letter  in tiny spiky handwriting .  she seemed happy  a world without beatings was heaven .  jade and her beau had wandered off to do something more interesting  as trolls very sensibly did .  shufti   had been on a timetable of her own .  maladicta had disappeared .  and igorina  at least  had set up by herself in the capital  dealing with women   s problems  or at least those women   s problems that weren   t men .   and senior officers had given them medals  and watched them go with fixed  faint smiles .  kisses don   t last .   and now it wasn   t that good things were happening  it was just that bad things had stopped .  the old women still grumbled  but they were left to grumble .  no one had any directions  no one had a map  no one was quite certain who was in charge .  there were arguments and debates on every street corner .  it was frightening and exhilarating .  every day was an exploration .  polly had worn a pair of paul   s old trousers to clean the floor of the big bar  and had got barely a    hurrumph    from anyone .   oh  and the girls    working school had burned down  and on the same day two slim masked figures had robbed a bank .  polly had grinned when she heard that  and hoped that tonker and lofty would one day find a way to eat chocolates in a great big room where the world was a different place .   shufti  who   d somehow always be shufti to polly even if the rest of the world now called her betty again  had moved into the duchess .  her baby was called jack .  paul doted on it .   and now     someone had been drawing in the gents    privy again .  polly couldn   t wash it off  so she contented herself with correcting the anatomy .  then she swooshed the place clean   at least  clean by pub urinal standards   with a couple of buckets  and ticked off the chore  just as she did every morning .   when she arrived back in the bar  there were a group of worried men there  talking to her father .  they looked mildly frightened when she strode in .      what   s happening .     she said .   her father nodded to gummy abbens  and everyone stepped back a little .  what with the spittle and the bad breath  you never wanted a conversation with gummy to be particularly intimate .      the swede eatersh is at it again .     he said .     they   re gonna invade    cos of the prince saysh we belong to him now .         it   s all down to him being the duchess   s distant cousin     said polly   s father .      but i heard it still wasn   t settled .     said polly .     anyway  there   s still a truce .         sheems like he   sh shettling it     said gummy .   the rest of the day passed at an accelerated pace .  there were groups of people talking urgently in the streets  and a crowd around the gates to the town hall .  every so often a clerk would come out and nail another communiqu   on the gates  the crowd would close over it like a hand  open again like a flower .   polly elbowed her way to the front  ignoring the mutterings around her  and scanned the sheets .   the same old stuff .  they were recruiting again .  the same old words .  the same old croakings of long dead soldiers  inviting the living to join them .  general froc might be female  but he was also  as blouse would have said     a bit of an old woman .     either that or the heaviness of those epaulettes had weighed her down .   kissing don   t last .  oh  the duchess had come alive before them and turned the world upside down for a spell and maybe they had all decided to be better people  and out of certain oblivion had come a space to breathe .   and then   had it really happened .  even polly sometimes wondered  and she had been there .  was it just a voice in their heads  some kind of hallucination .  weren   t soldiers in desperate straits famous for seeing visions of gods and angels .  and somewhere in the course of the long winter the miracle had faded  and people had said     yes  but we   ve got to be practical .      all we were given was a chance  thought polly .  no miracle  no rescue  no magic .  just a chance .   she walked back to the inn  her mind buzzing .  when she got there  a package was waiting .  it was quite long and heavy .      it came all the way from scritz on the cart     said shufti excitedly .  she   d been working in the kitchen .  it had become  now  her kitchen .     i wonder what it can be .     she said pointedly .   polly levered the lid off the rough wooden crate  and found that it was full of straw with an envelope lying on top of it .  she opened it .   inside was an iconograph .  it looked expensively done  a stiff family group with curtains and a potted palm in the background to give everything a bit of style .  on the left  was a middle aged man looking proud  on the right  was a woman of about the same age  looking rather puzzled but nevertheless pleased because her husband was happy  and here and there  staring at the viewer with variations of smile and squint and expressions that ran from interest to a sudden recollection that they should have gone to the toilet before posing  were children ranging from tall and gangly to small and smugly sweet .   and sitting on a chair in the middle  the focus of it all  was sergeant jackrum  shining like the sun .   polly stared and then turned the picture over .  on the back was written  in big black letters     sm jackrum   s last stand .     and  underneath     don   t need these .      she smiled and pulled aside the straw .  in the middle of the box  wrapped in cloth  were a couple of cutlasses .      is that old jackrum .     said shufti  picking up the picture .      yes .  he   s found his son     said polly  unwinding a blade .  shufti shuddered when she saw it .      evil things     she said .      things  anyway     said polly .  she laid both the cutlasses on the table  and was about to lift the box out of the way when she saw something small in the straw at the bottom .  it was oblong and wrapped in thin leather .   it was a notebook with a cheap binding and musty yellowing pages .      what   s that .     said shufti .      i think it   s his address book     said polly  flicking through the pages .   this is it  she thought .  it   s all here .  generals and majors and captains  oh my .  there must be   hundreds .  maybe a thousand .  names  real names  promotions  dates   everything     she pulled out a white pasteboard rectangle that had been inserted like a bookmark .  it showed a rather florid coat of arms and bore the printed legend                william de worde  editor  ankh morpork times     the truth shall make ye frep     gleam street  ankh morpork  e mail  wdw times . am               someone had crossed out the    p    in    frep    and penciled in an    e    above it .   it was a sudden strange fancy     how many ways can you fight a war .  polly wondered .  we have the clacks now .  i know a man who writes things down .  the world turns .  plucky little countries seeking self determination   could be useful to big countries with plans of their own .   time to grab the cheese .   polly   s expression as she stared at the wall would have frightened a number of important people .   they would have been even more concerned about the fact that she spent the next several hours writing things down  because it occurred to polly that general froc had not got where she was today by being stupid  and therefore she could profit from following her example .  she copied out the entire notebook  and sealed it in an old jam jar  which she hid in the roof of the stables .  she wrote a few letters .  and she got her uniform out of the wardrobe and inspected it critically .   the uniforms that had been made for them had a special  additional quality that could only be called   girly .  they had more braid  they were better tailored  and they had a long skirt with a bustle rather than trousers .  the shakos had plumes  too .   her tunic had a sergeant   s stripes .  it had been a joke .  a sergeant of women .  the world had been turned upside down  after all .   they   d been mascots  good luck charms   and  perhaps  on the march to prince marmaduke piotre albert hans joseph bernhardt wilhelmsberg a joke was what everyone needed .  but  maybe  when the world turns upside down  you can turn a joke upside down  too .  thank you  gummy  even though you didn   t know what it was you were teaching me .  when they   re laughing at you  their guard is down .  when their guard is down  you can kick them in the fracas .   she examined herself in the mirror .  her hair  now  was just long enough to be a nuisance without being long enough to be attractive  so she brushed it and left it at that .  she put the uniform on  but with the skirt over her trousers  and tried to put aside the nagging feeling that she was dressing up as a woman .   there .  she looked completely harmless .  she looked slightly less harmless with both cutlasses and one of the horse bows on her back  especially if you knew that the inn   s dartboards now all had deep holes in the bull   s eyes from all the practicing .   she crept along the hall to the window that overlooked the inn yard .  paul was up a ladder  repainting the sign .  her father was steadying the ladder and calling out instructions in his normal way  which was to call out the instruction just a second or two after you   d already started doing something .  and shufti was watching them  holding jack .   it made a lovely picture .  for a moment  she wished she had a locket .   the duchess was smaller than she   d thought .  but if you had to protect it by standing in the doorway with a sword  you were too late .  caring for small things had to start with caring for big things  and maybe the world wasn   t big enough .   the note she left on her dressing table read      shufti  i hope you and jack are happy here .  paul  you look after her .  dad  i   ve never taken any wages  but i need a horse .  i   ll try to have it sent back .  i love you all .  if i don   t come back  burn this letter and look in the roof of the stables .      she dropped out of the window  saddled up a horse in the stables  and let herself out of the back gate .  she didn   t mount up until she was out of earshot  and then rode down to the river .   spring was pouring through the country .  sap was rising .  in the woods  a ton of timber was growing every minute .  everywhere  birds were singing .   there was a guard on the ferry .  he eyed her nervously as she led the horse aboard  and then grinned when he saw what he thought were stripes that didn   t really mean much .         morning  miss .     he said cheerfully .   oh  well   time to start .  polly marched in front of the puzzled man .      are you trying to be smart .     she demanded  inches from his face .      no  miss           that   s    sergeant     mister .     said polly .     let   s try again  shall we .  i said  are you trying to be smart .         no  sergeant .      polly leaned until her nose was an inch from his .      why not .      the grin faded .  this was not a soldier on the fast track to promotion .      huh .     he managed .      if you are not trying to be smart  mister  you   re happy to be stupid .     shouted polly .     and i   m up to here with stupid  understand .         yeah  but           but what  soldier .         yeah  but   well   but   nothing  sergeant     said the soldier .      that   s good .     polly nodded at the ferry men .     time to go .     she suggested  but in the tones of an order .      couple of people just coming down the road  sergeant     said one of them  a faster man with an uptake .   they waited .  there were  in fact  three people .  one of them was maladicta  in full female uniform .   polly said nothing until the ferry was out in midstream .  the vampire gave her the kind of smile only a vampire can give .  it would have been sheepish  if sheep had different teeth .      thought i   d try again     she said .      we   ll find blouse     said polly .      he   s a major now     said maladicta .     and happy as a flea because they   ve named a kind of fingerless glove after him  i heard .  what do we want him for .         he knows about the clacks .  he knows about other ways war can be fought .  with intelligence  for one thing .  and i know   people     said polly .      ah .  do you mean the    upon my oath  i am not a lying man  but i know people    kind of people .         those were the kind of people i had in mind  yes .     the river slapped against the side of the ferry .      good     said maladicta .      i don   t know where it   s going to lead  though     said polly .      ah .  even better .      at which point  polly decided that she knew enough of the truth to be going on with .  the enemy wasn   t men  or women  or the old  or even the dead .  it was just bleedin    stupid people  who came in all varieties .  and no one had the right to be stupid .   she looked at the other two passengers who   d sidled aboard .  they were country lads in ragged  ill fitting clothes  keeping away from her and staring intently at the deck .  but one glance was enough .  the world turned upside down  and history repeated itself .  for some reason  that suddenly made her feel very happy .      going to join up  lads .     she said cheerily .   there was some mumbling on the theme of    yes .         good .  then stand up straight     said polly .     let   s have a look at you .  chins up .  ah .  well done .  shame you didn   t practice walking in trousers  and i notice you didn   t bring an extra pair of socks .      they stared  mouths open .      what are your names .     said polly .     your real names  please .  don   t look so worried .  you can tell me the truth .  and don   t try cunning on me  because i was trained by mister fox .         er   rosemary     one of them began .      i   m mary     said the other .     i heard girls were joining  but everyone laughed  so i thought i   d better pretend to           oh  you can join as men if you want     said polly .   the girls looked at one another .      you get better swearwords     said polly .     and the trousers are useful .  but it   s your choice .         a choice .     said rosemary .      certainly     said polly .  she put a hand on a shoulder of
