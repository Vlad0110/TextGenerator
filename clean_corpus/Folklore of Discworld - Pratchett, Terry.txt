was the time when i was in a car with several other grownup  literate people and we passed a sign to the village of great dunmow  in essex .  i said aloud     oh  yes .  home of the dunmow flitch .     they had not heard of it  yet for centuries a married man could go to that village on a whit monday and claim the prize of a flitch  or side  of bacon if he could swear that he and his wife had not quarrelled  even once  during the past year .  and that he had never wished he was a bachelor again .  back in the late fifties and early sixties the flitch ceremony used to be televised  for heaven   s sake .   not long after this i did a book signing on the south coast  when i took the opportunity to ask practically every person in the queue to say the magpie rhyme  i was doing research for carpe jugulum  .  every single one of them recited  with greater or lesser accuracy  the version of the rhyme that used to herald the beginning of the     s and   s children   s tv programme magpie        one for sorrow  two for joy    .  it wasn   t a bad rhyme  but like some cuckoo in the nest it was forcing out all the other versions that had existed around the country  some of which will appear in a later chapter  .  then a distinguished looking lady was in front of me with a book  and i asked her  with some inexpressible hope in my heart  how many versions of the magpie rhyme she knew .  after a moment   s thought  she said    about nineteen    .   and that was how i met jacqueline simpson  who has been my friend and occasional consultant on matters of folklore  and once got me along to talk to the british folklore society  where i probably upset a few people by saying that i think of folklore in much the same way a carpenter thinks about trees .   some of the things in this book may well be familiar  and you will say    but everybody knows this    .  but the discworld series  which on many occasions borrows from folklore and mythology  twisting and tangling it on the way  must be the most annotated series of modern books in existence .  and one thing i have learned is this  not many people know the things which everyone knows .   but there are some things we shouldn   t forget  and mostly they add up to where we came from and how we got here and the stories we told ourselves on the way .  but folklore isn   t only about the past .  it grows  flowers and seeds every day  because of our innate desire to control our world by means of satisfying narratives .   i used to live a short distance away from a standing stone which  at full moon and or midsummer   s eve  would dance around its field at night  incidentally leaving unguarded a pot of gold which  in theory  was available to anyone who dared to seize it and could run faster than a stone .  i went to see it by daylight early on  but for some reason i never found the time to make the short nocturnal journey and check on its dancing abilities .  i now realize this was out of fear  i feared that  like so many stones i have met  it would fail to dance .  there was a small part of me that wanted the world to be a place where  despite planning officers and eu directives and policemen  a stone might dance .  and somewhere there  i think  is the instinct for folklore .  there should be a place where a stone dances .   for those who feel the same way we have included a short reading list  in theory for those readers who would like to know more  but also because people who love books always want to recommend them to other people at the least excuse .       introduction  by jacqueline simpson   ah yes  i remember it well  that book signing on the south coast .  a misty  moisty november evening in       a long queue inching its way towards a very impressive black hat  the eager voice demanding     tell me everything you know about magpies .      a little ahead of me in the queue  one woman had been explaining to all and sundry as we waited that it was for her nephew  not herself  that she wanted a signed copy of jingo .  she herself never  ever read novels of any kind  let alone fantasy fiction .     i only want facts .  what   s the point of reading about things that aren   t real .  as for a world flying through space on a turtle        her voice died out in a splutter of indignation  and the combined arguments of a dozen discworld readers couldn   t budge her one inch .  i was not surprised to learn what her job was  she was an accountant     which is to say  very nearly an auditor of reality .  give her a small grey robe with a cowl  and she would find a perfect niche on the disc .   the truth of the matter is  the disc is the earth  but with an extra dimension of reality .  on the discworld  things that on earth are creatures of the imagination  but sometimes quite powerful  even so  are alive and  in some cases  kicking .  sometimes we recognize them at once  is there anyone who doesn   t know a dragon when they meet one .   .  sometimes we simply feel that something is deeply familiar and completely right  but we have no idea why .  hours  days or weeks later  we may find the key  when the rich soil that accumulates at the back of the mind suddenly yields the fruit of memory .   then we realize that the key to the familiarity lies in folklore .  whatever is folklore on earth finds its mirror in the reality of the disc .  of course it   s perfectly natural that mrs gogol   s house moves about on four large duck feet  because baba yaga   s hut spins around on chicken legs in the forests of russia  of course the nac mac feegle are pictsies  not pixies  because of stories the scots told about picts  of course there   s an ancient king sleeping in a cavern deep under a mountain in lancre  because that   s what king arthur does in england and scotland  and the emperor barbarossa in germany .  we   ve known about such things for ages  even if we called them fairy tales  myths  and folklore  now that we   re on the disc  they are real  and we feel quite at home .   well  then  what is the    folklore    of earth  and more specifically of british tradition .  it   s the sum total of all those things people know without ever having been officially taught about them  all those stories and images which drift around with no apparent source  all those funny little customs people follow simply because everyone has always done them  and  usually  it   s fun  .  if we were bookish children  we may remember precisely when we first discovered some of them .  terry still has the copy of brewer   s dictionary of phrase and fable which he bought second hand when he was twelve years old  and read from end to end  it cost him          ok  ok    p  about three weeks    pocket money  .  i remember the hot summer day i spent sitting against a haystack  aged thirteen  and embarking for the first time on the genuine full length tales of king arthur and his knights  as written by sir thomas malory in the     s  funny spellings and weird words included .  but most people  most of the time  just grow up having always known how and when to touch wood or cross their fingers  and what happens when a princess kisses a frog or a boy pulls a sword from a stone .  they take for granted that there will be pancakes on shrove tuesday  pumpkins and scary costumes at halloween  bonfires on guy fawkes night  mince pies at christmas .   non british readers  please adjust to fit your own traditional foods and calendars .    so who are the    folk    who have all this    lore    .  the answer is     any of us    .  it   s a mistake to think that the only folklore worthy of the name is what you get by finding the oldest crone in the dirtiest cottage in the poorest village in the remotest mountain valley  and cross examining her on her deathbed .  every group and sub group in society has its jokes  its beliefs  its tales and traditions .  at this very moment  there are children in the playground giggling over the latest naughty joke  it may or may not be one their great grandparents knew too   young mothers who take for granted that little girls must wear pink  college students teaching each other the equivalent of nanny ogg   s    hedgehog song    .  and because where there is fun there is also money to be made  there   s a large scale trade in birthday cards  easter eggs  mother   s day cards  halloween masks and so forth  which no parent dares ignore .  and any town or pub or castle which wants to attract tourists will go looking for colourful local legends and customs to exploit .   the days are long gone when scholars insisted that    real folklore    must always be something passed on by word of mouth  not in print .  this was never very realistic  at any rate in literate societies  where generations of poets and novelists and dramatists have drawn material from myth and folk tale  twisted and embroidered it  and then handed it on to future readers .  and then  maybe  the readers become tellers in their turn  and hand it on again .  the tree of folklore has no objection whatever to creative carpenters .   stories and beliefs grow and multiply in all the media available  old and new  they are forever feeding on  and then feeding back into  the rich soup of tradition .  take vampires  for instance .  how much of    what everybody knows who knows anything about vampires    comes from the basic five hundred year old east european folklore  and how much from novels  films  comics  tv .  specialists can work it out  but does it really matter .  here and now  in the twenty first century  all vampire lore has blended together into a luscious soup .   folklore may look as if it never changes  but if you keep a watchful eye on it  you will notice some things dying out and others springing up .  in britain nowadays  people do not wear mourning for months on end after a death in the family  but because grief needs an outlet a new custom has appeared out of nowhere and is spreading fast     thirty years ago nobody built roadside memorials of flowers and mementoes at the site of tragic accidents  but now this is felt to be right and proper .  customs also travel from one country to another much faster and more frequently than they once did  since the     s britain has learned from america that if you tie a yellow ribbon to a tree or a fence  this means you   re praying for the safety of some prisoner or kidnap victim who is in the news .  in fact  variously coloured ribbons and plastic wrist bands in support of good causes are popping up all over the place now  in the way that lapel badges used to do  and everyone understands what each one means .   on the discworld  folklore is much more stable .  new symbols sometimes arise     the black ribbon recently adopted by reformed vampires  for instance  its earthly parallel was the blue ribbon of victorian teetotallers   and the commemorative spray of lilac which vimes and some others in ankh morpork wear on one day of the year  as explained in night watch     but nothing ever seems to be discarded and forgotten .  this makes the discworld a wonderful place in which to rediscover the solidity  the depth which tradition brings to a society  and learn to cherish it .   so when terry invited me to join him in exploring this incredibly rich network of links  i had only one misgiving .  is it wise to explain so much .  might it not be best to let readers enjoy the glimpses and hints and clues half understood  and gradually make their own discoveries .   but as terry has said elsewhere  a conjurer is more entertaining than a wizard because he entertains you twice  once with the trick  and once with the trickery .   so now  there   s a drum roll  the curtains part  and you can watch how the conjurer works          chapter     the cosmos   gods  demons  and things      very vast is the expanding rubber sheet of the space time continuum .  should we not call it infinite .   no  as a matter of fact  we should not  not unless we want to get into an interminable argument with both physicists and philosophers     the kind of argument where people steeple their fingers and say  very slowly     we ell  it all depends on what you mean by    infinite    .     and go on saying it  with variations  till the beer runs out .  if you are very unlucky  they will explain how infinities come in different sizes .   what we can fairly safely say is that there are clumps of matter on that rubber sheet  moving about and organizing themselves into complicated systems .  billions of them .  two of these deserve our close attention .  one consists of a rather lumpy and intensely hot spherical core of iron and rock  much of it in a molten state  held together by its own pressure  and wrapped in a thin solid crust .  it is whirled through space by the force of gravity .  this is the earth  which is round like a ball .  the other is round like a plate  and is moved at a more sedate pace by a team of elephants and a turtle .  this is the discworld .   what they have in common is that each carries through the cosmos a cargo of conscious  imaginative     we could even say  charitably  intelligent     living species .  over the many centuries of their existence  these species have generated an accumulation of thoughts  information  emotions  beliefs and imaginings which envelops their world like a mental atmosphere  a noosphere .  within this noosphere patterns have formed  driven by the irresistible force of narrativium  the narrative imperative  the power of story .  some scholars call the patterns motifs  others topoi  others memes .  the point is  they   re there  everyone knows them  and they go on and on .  more remarkably  some of the strongest can replicate themselves and go drifting off across the multiverse as particles of inspiration  which leads to some truly amazing similarities between the earth and discworld .       the elephants and the turtle   the absolutely central  incontrovertible fact about the discworld is that it is a disc .  at least  it   s incontrovertible unless you adhere to the omnian religion  in which case you must controvert it like billy o .  this disc rests upon four gigantic elephants  named berilia  tubul  great t   phon and jerakeen   whose bones are living iron  and whose nerves are living gold .  these elephants themselves stand upon the shell of the great a   tuin  a ten thousand mile long star turtle  which is swimming through space in a purposeful manner .  what this purpose may be  is unknown .   a child once asked     why does the turtle swim .      a wise man replied     child  there is no why .  it     is     so .      and that could be said of many things .   on earth    everyone knows    that people used to believe that their planet was also flat  if they thought about it at all .  in fact for several thousand years a growing number of educated people have shared the knowledge that it is a globe .  generally speaking it was wisest not to shout about it in the street  though  because of the unrest this could cause .  no doubt scholars in the ancient hindu india partook of this knowledge  but since truth comes in many forms  the age old epic poems of india declare the world to be a disc .   further details of hindu cosmology vary .  according to one myth  there are four  or eight  great elephants named the diggaja or digaja     elephants of the directions     guarding the four  or eight  compass points of this disc  with a type of god called a lokapala riding on the back of each one .  but the oldest texts do not claim that they carry the world .  according to another myth  however  the world rests on the back of a single elephant  maha padma  and he is standing on a tortoise named chukwa .  finally  it is said in yet another myth that the god vishnu once took on the form of a vast tortoise or turtle  krma   so huge that mount meru  the sacred central mountain of the world  could rest on his back and be used as a stick to churn the ocean .  at some stage  though nobody knows just when  these insights began to blend  with the result that some  but not all  hindu mythographers now say the world is a disc supported by four elephants supported by a turtle .   variations of the myth spread out from india to other areas of the globe .   one that has proved particularly popular involves an infinite regression of turtles .  it is said that an arrogant englishman once mocked a hindu by asking what the turtle stood on  untroubled  the hindu calmly replied     ah  sahib  after that it   s turtles all the way down .      another variation  briefly mentioned in the film a thief of baghdad  involves different creatures but is of value because it adds one vital factor  that of movement .  it tells how the world rests on seven pillars  carried on the shoulders of a huge genie  who stands on an eagle  which perches on a bull  which stands on a fish     and this fish swims through the seas of eternity .   chinese mythology also knows of an immense cosmic turtle  but with a difference .  according to the chinese  our world is not balanced upon the creature   s back  with or without elephants   but is sloshing about inside it .  its plastron contains the oceans upon which all our continents are floating  and when we look up at the dome of the night sky we are seeing the inside of its vast carapace  studded with innumerable stars .   clearly  fragments of information have drifted through the multiverse and taken root here and there .  but the full and glorious truth is known only on the discworld .  the turtle moves .   and beyond that truth lies an even deeper mystery  one hinted at in the legends of the dwarfs     the legend of the fifth elephant .  for the dwarfs of uberwald say there was once a fifth elephant supporting the disc  but it crashed   they say that the fifth elephant came screaming and trumpeting through the atmosphere of the young world all those years ago and landed hard enough to split continents and raise mountains .   the fifth elephant   nobody actually saw or heard this  but the dwarfs say that the vast deposits of iron ore  gold and fat under their mountains are all that remains of the fifth elephant .  also that the crash buried thousands of acres of prehistoric sugar cane  creating a mass of dense crystalline sugar which can now be mined .  these raw materials form the basis for a flourishing trade in confectionery and in very fine quality candles  soaps and lamp oils .   the iron  the gold and the fat undoubtedly exist .  yet the legend itself poses great problems .  if the four elephants mark the four quarters  where did the fifth stand .  centrally  to form the pattern known as a quincunx .  if it slipped and fell from the turtle   s back  how could it strike the disc     did it fall upwards .  and if so  wouldn   t it strike the underside of the disc rather than crashing down through the atmosphere .  did it perhaps briefly go into orbit .  dwarfs are a secretive race  so we are unlikely ever to learn the truth of this .   some philosophers in ephebe  hearing the tale  have concluded that the fifth elephant is not a gross material being subject to normal physical laws  but the pure  subtle  ethereal quintessence of cosmic pachydermacy .  it is nowhere to be seen because it is present everywhere .  without it  the whole universe of the discworld would cease to exist .  by a remarkable coincidence  this is exactly how the earth philosophers of ancient greece described their hypothetical fifth element     the invisible  impalpable  ethereal quintessence which provides the essential counterbalance to the four material elements of earth  air  fire and water  the five together making up their universe .  or it may just be a legend .  legends don   t have to make sense .  they just have to be beautiful .  or at least interesting .       the gods   at the last count  the number of major gods known to research theologians on the discworld was        and rising .  the potential number is unlimited  since at any moment a new one may be called into existence by the mere fact that it has occurred to a human being  or to a member of any other sentient species  to believe he  she or it exists  and to feel an urge to worship him  her or it .  the greater the number of devotees  rituals  shrines  temples  sacrifices  and sacred books which develop from this initial urge  the greater the status of the deity .  conversely  of course  since belief is the life force and nourishment of gods  in the course of time particular gods can and do lose power as the number of their believers drops .  rarely  however  do they dwindle into total insignificance  and any good dramatic miracle quickly restores them to their previous status  as was proved by the events narrated in small gods .  two of them  fate and luck  the lady   are almost certainly immune to change     they don   t have temples  but there can hardly be anybody  anywhere in the multiverse  who does not believe in them .  in addition  dwarfs have formulated the notion of a creator quite distinct from any individual gods  whom they call tak  we shall have more to say on this in the next chapter .   discworld people vary considerably in their attitude to the gods .  certain groups  notably witches  wizards  policemen and dwarfs  ignore them .  not that anybody would actually deny that they exist     it is known that they are quick with a thunderbolt if they detect actual atheism     but it is perfectly possible to get on with one   s life without thinking about them .  similarly  the citizens of ephebe do not pay very much attention to their numerous divinities .  on the other hand  the land of djelibeybi is swarming with local gods  in whose honour devoted priests carry out an endless round of sacred rituals .  in omnia and borogravia  every aspect of life is dominated by the very demanding cult of a single god  om and nuggan respectively .  as for ankh morpork  it is rather a paradox .  street after street has a temple in it  enough of them to suit every ethnic group  yet nobody could call it a pious city  exactly .  the citizens seem willing to worship any god at all  provided he or she is good for trade .  in that city  we learn  in making money   there is even a god of the month club .  and a deity currently in the ascendant is anoia  goddess of things that get stuck in drawers .  that   s life in the big city for you .  people will take a chance on heaven  but they would like to get their hands on the corkscrew right now  amen .   the major gods  loosely organized into a rather grumpy pantheon  have chosen to make their home on the peak of a truly remarkable mountain  cori celesti     a spire of rock and ice  ten miles high  rising above the clouds at the very centre and hub of the disc .  the home itself is of course a vast marble palace  a pile of pillars  pilasters  pinnacles  pyramids  parapets  peristyles  porticos  porches  portals and pavilions  which they have decided to call dunmanifestin .  gods are not noted for good taste or a sense of the ridiculous  nor indeed  in most cases  for intelligence .   if the gods have the ability to look into other dimensions  then they will see some remarkable resemblances to themselves in the cosmic soap operas of earth .  one thing they have apparently taken notice of is fashions in divine accessories and lifestyles     thunderbolts  goat   s feet  a jackal   s head  and so on     whatever .  if zeus and his gang have a mount olympus  and vishnu and his gang have a mount meru  they get themselves their cori celesti  and it   s higher than the other two put together .  this passion for keeping up with the zeuses means that anyone with a working knowledge of inter dimensional mythology who drops in at dunmanifestin will feel quite at home there .   the disc gods will have noticed  too  that all pantheons pass their time in banqueting  and that many also like playing board games .  for example  one of the first things the norse gods did when they had finished creating the cosmos was to settle down for a happy session of hnefatafl  played with pieces made of pure gold .  as hnefi is    fist    and tafl is    table    or    board     the name means roughly    the punch up board game     it is a bit like draughts but much more like the discworld game of thud .  it is thought that the run of play determines the destinies of men  gods  giants and the world itself .  apparently the game will be disrupted and the pieces scattered when gods and monsters fight at ragnarok  the war at the end of the world  also known as the doom of the gods and the twilight of the gods .  afterwards  according to the old icelandic prophetic poem v  lusp    a new world will arise and the surviving younger generation of gods will restore both the cosmic order and the game which expressed it   then once again in the grass are found  draughtsmen all of gold   the wondrous draughtsmen the gods had owned  in the earliest days of old .   on earth  however  not everyone relishes the idea of being a pawn in a game played by gods .  the twelfth century persian poet omar khayy  m made a resigned but gloomy comment on life in his rub    y  t      tis all a chequer board of nights and days  where destiny with men for pieces plays   hither and thither moves  and mates  and slays   and one by one back in the closet lays .   the gods of the discworld lack the patience and imagination to play chess  draughts  hnefatafl  or even chequers  their idea of amusement is a form of snakes and ladders  played with greased rungs   accompanied by heavy betting and a good deal of bluffing and cheating  which brings it nearer to poker .  the currency staked is the souls of men .  the gaming board is a finely carved map of the disc  overprinted with squares .  occasionally  the playing pieces represent monsters  more often  they are beautifully detailed models of those human beings who have foolishly done something to get themselves noticed .  it is said that these unfortunate mortals sometimes faintly hear  as they hasten to their doom  the rattle of dice in the celestial  skull shaped  shaker .   this is one of the reasons it   s wise to steer clear of the gods  as the wizard rincewind knows      i don   t like the idea of going anywhere near the gods .  we   re  like toys to them  you know .  and they don   t realize how easily  the arms and legs come off .      the last hero   or maybe  and even rincewind in his darkest moments didn   t think of this  they do realize  and find it funny .  that at any rate is what will shakespeare thought when he wrote king lear  in one of his darkest moments   as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods   they kill us for their sport .   the gods have an age old feud with the ice giants  a species of super troll the size of large houses  craggy and faceted  and composed entirely of ice which glints green and blue in the light     apart from their small  deep sunken  coal black eyes .  just as zeus and the olympians defeated the gigantic titans and imprisoned them inside volcanoes such as etna  where they still wriggle about  causing eruptions and earthquakes   so blind io and the other discworld gods defeated the ice giants and imprisoned them under the eternal ice at the hub .  there is  however  a prophecy .  a very norse sounding prophecy  a prophecy of end time doom   at the end of the world they   ll break free at last  and ride out on their dreadful glaciers and regain their ancient domination  crushing out the flames of civilization until the world lies naked and frozen under the terrible cold stars until time itself freezes over .  or something like that  apparently .   sourcery   whether it comes with ice ages  global warming  a nasty bang or a little whimper  the end of a world is never much fun .       blind io   io is the chief of the gods .  he is elderly  white haired and white bearded  dressed in a toga and wearing a white blindfold which conceals the blank skin where his eyes should be .  despite this  and despite his name  he sees everything that is going on  since in fact he has a number of detached eyes  several dozen of them  which hover around him and keep a sharp look out in all directions .  his throne too is encrusted with eyes .  he is the supreme thunderer  having absorbed every other thunder god on the disc into himself .  however  he keeps a stock of seventy hammers  double headed axes  and thunderbolts  each of a different design  to blend in with local expectations wherever he may appear .  this avoids unnecessary distress to worshippers .   at one time he employed a pair of ravens to fly hither and yon and keep him informed of everything going on in the world .  in another universe odin  chief of the norse gods  had had exactly the same idea  his two ravens were named memory and thought .  from the god   s point of view  it   s a good plan  efficient and energy saving .  from the ravens    point of view  regrettably  io   s free floating eyeballs were altogether too much of a temptation  odin   s one eye is firmly fixed in his head  so in his case the problem did not arise  and after some embarrassing scenes io   s ravens had to be dismissed .    earth is well stocked with thunder gods  including zeus  jupiter  thor  perkun  indra and jehovah .  usually  a thunder god is also the ruler of his particular pantheon  but thor is an exception  taking second place to odin  god of war  magic  death and poetry  .  blind io   s insistence on being the disc   s only thunderer is an example of how discworld gods love to outdo those of earth in displays of status .  it   s the same with his lavish use of detached eyeballs  whereas on the earth even the mightiest deities are satisfied with only one .  these are mostly to be found in ancient egypt  where the eye of a major god such as ra  atum  or horus embodied the concentration of his divine power and could be sent out to act on his behalf .  the separated eye  called the wedjat  was often shown in religious art  and worn as an amulet .  it was sometimes identified with the sun or the moon  and sometimes personified as itself a goddess .  that   s something io has not yet thought of .       dagon   a very ancient  mysterious and probably unpleasant god  believed to have been once worshipped on the mud flats where the city of ankh morpork was later built .  at least  something happened not so long ago when the late mr hong opened a takeaway fish bar on the site of an old temple in dagon street  at the time of the full moon     or  some say  of a lunar eclipse .  everybody has heard about it  in general terms  but nobody says just what it was      traditions of the earth are fuller .  it appears that dagon was first worshipped there some four thousand years ago by philistines and phoenicians in the middle east  there were temples to him in gaza and other coastal towns .  according to the bible    samuel     his statue stood in a mighty temple at ashdod  but when the captured jewish ark was brought into this temple the statue crashed to the ground and its head and hands broke off  leaving only a stump on the threshold .   there is argument among scholars as to what he looked like  and what it was he was god of .  the older generation thought his name came from a word for    fish    and that he must have been the god of fishes  shaped like a merman  human above the waist and fishy below .  most poets and occultists agree .  more recent scholars say no  the name comes from a word for    corn     and he was a god of farming  no fish tail required  .  the matter could easily be settled if one could find an old temple of his and set up a bakery in one corner and a fish and chip shop in the other  and see what happened .   one writer who had no doubts at all on the matter was the american h .  p .  lovecraft  whose eerily receptive mind picked up many strange influences from the worlds of gods and demons  and indeed from the dreaded dungeon dimensions .  in      he published a story     dagon     in which a shipwrecked man reaches an unknown land of mud and rocks  newly risen from the ocean floor .  there are weird buildings there  with repulsive carvings .  then he sees  emerging from a deep abyss  a vast and loathsome monster with scaly arms  webbed hands and feet  shockingly wide and flabby lips  and bulging  glassy eyes .  though he escapes  he remains haunted by the thought of huge nameless things crawling and floundering at the bottom of the ocean until the day when they will come to destroy mankind   once i sought out a celebrated ethnologist  and amused him with peculiar questions regarding the ancient philistine legend of dagon the fish god  but soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional  i did not press my enquiries .   this may well be significant  since it is strongly suspected on the discworld that dagon had some connection with the sunken land of leshp  which occasionally rises to the surface of the circle sea  as described in jingo .  on leshp  there are fragments of buildings with an uncomfortably non human look about them  a bodeful atmosphere  and plenty of pretty mosaics showing squid and octopuses .  all in all  it seems probable that dagon is actually one of the things from the dungeon dimensions still lurking on the disc  like bel shamharoth  see below  .       fate   this  possibly  is the god most feared and hated by men .  he is proverbially stern and implacable .  some earthbound poets have claimed that he is blind  but this is far from true  anyone who looks into his dark and bottomless eyes will see that they are holes opening on to the blackness of infinite night .  he enjoys gambling and chess  largely because when he plays  the roll of the dice is always fixed and there are always two queens on his side of the board     unless  of course  his eternal rival the lady has a hand in the game  in which case there is a million to one chance that somebody might cheat fate .   in the mythologies of the earth  fate is sometimes personified as three old women  the fates     three because triplicity symbolizes power .  more often  however  he remains an abstract figure .       the gods of djelibeybi   in the river kingdom of djelibeybi  the national religion has been accreting and fermenting and bubbling away for seven thousand years  during which time nobody ever threw away a god  in case he might come in useful one day .  as a result  the gods are far too numerous to list .  one might start by mentioning scrab the pusher of the ball of the sun  thrrp the charioteer of the sun  jeht the boatman of the solar orb  vut the dog headed god of evening  bunu the goat headed god of goats  ket the ibis headed god of justice  hat the vulture headed god of unexpected guests  bast the cat headed goddess of things left on the doorstep or under the bed     from which  two things are already obvious  they just love fooling around with funny faces  and most of them reckon they can do the top job .  they can also be quarrelsome   there was a monstrous splash out in the river .  tzut  the snake headed god of the upper djel  surfaced and regarded the assembled priesthood solemnly .  then fhez  the crocodile headed god of the lower djel  erupted beside him and made a spirited attempt at biting his head off .  the two submerged in a column of spray and a minor tidal wave .   pyramids   there are remarkably close and no doubt wholly coincidental similarities here to the pantheon of ancient egypt  where many of the deities have the heads of animals or birds  and where it was perfectly possible for several of them to be credited with the same important function .  thus  amun  aten  atum  ptah  and ra were each said to have been the creator of the world  and all except ptah were also sun gods .  this does not seem to have caused any quarrels  either among the gods themselves or among their priests .  in egypt  as in djelibeybi  priests  very much in the way of advanced physicists  took for granted that mutually incompatible statements could still both be true  and that in any case the really important thing was to carry out rituals correctly .   the kings of djelibeybi  also called pharaohs  are regarded as gods even while still alive  the divine part of their souls comes from the sun in the form of a bird     in the case of teppicymon xxvii  a seagull .  kings have the power  and duty  to make the sun rise every morning  and to make the river djel flood the land in due season  they do this by carrying out daily rituals as tradition requires .  there may be minor supernatural manifestations too     rivers flowing more strongly as a pharaoh passes by  grass and corn springing up in his footsteps  and so on .  on the earth  the pharaohs of egypt had similar powers and responsibilities .   it has to be said that the egyptian pantheon fits snugly into the discworld way of thinking with barely more than a few changes of name .  at one point the author of pyramids declared     i bought half a shelf of books on ancient egypt  and after a while i decided to make things up  because when you got down to details the real thing was just too weird .          herne the hunted   wherever humans go in for hunting  because they need the meat  or just because it   s such good fun  they tend to create a god  or goddess  of the hunt .  they pray  and make offerings .  they believe the god  or goddess  will provide a good fat deer or buffalo or wild boar for them  and ensure that they don   t break their necks as they gallop after the deer  or shoot one another by accident  or get gored by the boar .  but it never occurs to them that the prey could be praying too  though probably not to the same deity .   on the discworld  where divinities are called into existence by the very fact that someone hopes and believes that they exist  this often urgent prayer is catered for .  there  in the mountains and forests of lancre  lives herne the hunted  who is a god of the chase  though not in the usual sense   herne was the god of the chased and the hunted and all small animals whose ultimate destiny is to be an abrupt damp squeak .  he was about three feet high  with rabbit ears and very small horns .  but he did have an extremely good turn of speed .   lords and ladies   his role as a deity is to hear the occult voice of the prey .  he is a good listener  but his success rate at answering prayers is not high .  his worshippers  unfortunately  tend to die shortly after calling upon his name .   how he got his name is an interesting example of interaction between one universe and another .  at any one time there are millions of particles of inspiration and information pulsating through the multiverse  pouring out from the minds of various sentient species .  one of the most powerful sources was on earth  in the creative mind of a human being named william shakespeare .  in the world of shakespeare   s imagination     to be precise  in his play the merry wives of windsor  written in          there is a herne the hunter .  the two heroines of the play decide to make a fool of a man who is pestering them by persuading him to disguise himself as a ghost and meet them at midnight under an oak tree in windsor park .  describing this ghost  one says   there is an old tale goes  that herne the hunter   sometime a keeper here in windsor forest   doth all the winter time  at still midnight   walk round about an oak  with great ragg   d horns   and there he blasts the trees  bewitches cattle   and makes the cows yield blood  and shakes a chain  in a most hideous and dreadful manner .   according to another version of the play  some mothers used herne as a bogeyman to frighten children   oft have you heard since herne the hunter dyed   that women  to affright their little children   say that he walkes in shape of a great stagge .   shakespeare tells us nothing more about herne   s life or death  but about two hundred years later  in       a writer called samuel ireland says he had heard say that herne was a gamekeeper who had turned to crime  and who hanged himself on the oak  fearing he was about to lose his job .  this fits the traditional belief that suicides haunt the scene of their death .  the rattling chain is also standard equipment for a ghost  but the stag   s antlers are not .  perhaps shakespeare felt they matched the forest setting .  or perhaps he just wanted to get a laugh  elizabethan audiences thought horns side splittingly funny  even better than custard pies  and this is a comedy after all .   to shakespeare  herne was simply an earthbound ghost  for ever walking round and round one particular tree  in the same way as the ghostly kings of lancre must never move far from the stone walls of their castle .  but the job description    hunter    caught the eye of jacob grimm  a german expert on mythology in the early nineteenth century  and started up a whole new train of thought .  it reminded him of the wild hunt     a horde of phantom riders who  according to european folklore  gallop across the night sky during midwinter storms .  their leader is sometimes said to be a lost soul who is doomed to hunt for ever  sometimes the devil pursuing the souls of sinners  occasionally a god hunting forest elves .  maybe  said grimm  herne had once been a wild huntsman  not a common or garden gamekeeper   s ghost .   this is grimm   s theory  not will shakespeare   s .  but people liked the idea  and so on the earth herne the hunter  the stag headed god of hunting  was born .  he has enjoyed a brilliant career  thanks to those fascinating antlers .  in the     s  people started wondering if he could be connected with various old celtic gods who had horns or antlers on their heads  especially a gaulish one to whom sailors raised an altar in paris early in the first century ad  calling him cernunnos     horned one     or possibly    old horny     .  others thought he might even have as his remote ancestor a prehistoric man painted on the wall of a french cave  wearing a skin and antlers .  by now  there are many  many people ready to swear that herne is an age old god  the lord of wild nature .  but there is the truth and  then again  there is the truth  in the face of which truth can only shrug and grin .   according to a popular     s british tv series  robin hood used to meet a horned man in the forest  and this was none other than herne .  well  maybe so     provided robin had an efficient time machine to whisk him forward two or three centuries to elizabethan times  or backwards to the first century ad to meet up with cernunnos .   and so  while will shakespeare lies giggling in his grave  the story goes drifting off across the dimensions  twisting itself into other shapes  and creating herne the hunted .  stories and folklore always tangle  and never more than on discworld .       hoki the jokester   hoki is a localized nature god  only to be found in the deep forests of the ramtops .  sometimes he manifests himself as an oak tree  sometimes as half a man and half a goat  and pretty well always as a bloody nuisance .  he plays the flute  very badly .   hoki has a typically mix and don   t match approach to the business of filching attributes and character traits from the gods of another universe .  he admired and copied the shaggy goat legs and the pipes of pan  a cheerful  sexy little nature god living in arcadia in ancient greece .  his name  however  he took from that of the norse loki  a trickster and trouble maker  whose most infamous deed was a murder by proxy  he caused the death of the popular and handsome young baldur by getting a blind god to throw a twig of mistletoe at him  supposedly as a joke .  hoki must have got to hear about this  since it is said that he was thrown out of dunmanifestin for playing    the old exploding mistletoe trick    on blind io .   the oak tree manifestation is something hoki picked up more recently .  in some countries of the earth over the past fifty or sixty years there has been a revival of paganism  and sexy male nature gods are once again in fashion  including a green man who manifests himself as a face sprouting leaves  peering through leaves  or entirely made up of leaves .  sometimes  they are oak leaves .  observing this  hoki decided to go one better and be the whole tree .       the lady   though everyone believes in her and longs to win her favour  nobody ever calls her by her true name  or tries to summon her  for this would make her vanish .  her eyes are pure green  from edge to edge  and green is her favourite colour .  her realm is that of the throw of the dice  of uncertainty and chance  especially the million to one chance .  she thwarts the rigid rules of fate .   and on the earth too  that   s exactly how things are .  except as regards the colour green .  that information has not seeped through into our world  where many people regard green as unl    er  quite the opposite .       nuggan   nuggan  the god of borogravia  and also of paperclips  desk stationery sets  and unnecessary paperwork   is small and podgy  and has the sourest face one could wish never to see  with a fussy little moustache .  he has revealed himself unto his faithful people via the holy book of nuggan  which     unlike other holy writs     is published in a ring binder  since it is permanently incomplete  especially as regards the list of abominations .  updates appear regularly as an appendix .  at the last count  the things that are abominations in the eyes of nuggan included garlic  chocolate  certain mushrooms  dwarfs  cats  babies  shirts with six buttons  cross dressing  jigsaws  and the colour blue .   nuggan   s temper being notoriously tetchy  borogravians mostly pray to their ruler  the duchess annagovia  whom they call little mother  and whose icon is displayed in every house .  she herself is never seen  having shut herself away in a castle for years  in mourning for her husband who was gored by a wild boar when hunting  they say .   another instance of trans dimensional parallels  since on the earth adonis  a human lover of the greek goddess aphrodite  met his death in just the same way .   she may possibly be dead .  she is  or was  human  of course  yet somehow rather more  as the ankh morpork consul to zlobenia explained to commander vimes      the royal family in borogravia have always had a quasi religious status  you see .  they   re the head of the church  and the peasants  at least  pray to them in the hope that they   ll put in a good word with nuggan .  they   re like     living saints .  celestial intermediaries .  to be honest  that   s how these countries work in any case .  if you want something done  you have to know the right people .  and i suppose it   s easier to pray to someone in a picture than to a god you can   t see .      monstrous regiment   according to commander vimes  nuggan has dwindled away to a mere voice  and it is time for the borogravians to find themselves a new god .  the duchess herself agrees  speaking through her most fervent devotee  she declares   fight nuggan  for he is nothing now  nothing but the poisonous echo of your ignorance and pettiness and malicious stupidity .  find yourselves a worthier god .  and let     me     go .  all those prayers  all those entreaties     to me .  too many hands clasped  that could more gainfully answer your prayers by effort and resolve .   a very unusual message for a divinity  or a semi divinity  to give unto the faithful  in any universe  but it might bear repeating .       offler the crocodile   offler is a very old god  who first arose from steamy swamps in the hot dark land of klatch  and finds worshippers anywhere where there is a large river and a warm climate  including djelibeybi and ankh morpork .  he is sometimes known as    offler of the bird haunted mouth     because of the flock of brave and holy birds which attend upon him  pecking out those little shreds of meat which are such a nuisance when they get stuck between your fangs .  apart from his crocodile head  he is of normal human shape  though he has occasionally manifested himself with six arms instead of two .  he lisps  because of the fangs .   his counterpart on the earth is the egyptian sobek  son of the primeval waters  whose name means    the raging one    and who manifested himself either as an entire crocodile wearing a crown  or as a man with a crocodile head .  he lived in the marshes by the nile  and was ardently worshipped by prudent river fishermen .  nile crocodiles are notoriously savage .       om   the great god om is the sole god of the land of omnia  his devotees having zealously exterminated everybody who worshipped any others .  by nature he is very liable to outbursts of wrath  expressed through cursing  trampling of infidels  and smiting with lightning .  according to the omnian priests  he spoke     indeed  he spake     to a series of chosen prophets  dictating to them a vast number of laws  precepts and prohibitions which are enshrined in numerous sacred writings  not to mention some codicils written on slabs of lead ten feet tall .  sometimes  it is said  om did his spaking from out of a pillar of flame .  sometimes the chosen prophet sprouted glowing horns  for holy horns are om   s symbol .   the priests also claim that om made the world  and revealed to them that it is not a disc carried by a turtle  but a perfectly smooth ball moving in a perfect circle round the sun  which is another perfectly smooth ball  this has become a vital dogma in the omnian church .  actually  om now denies that he ever said this  or that he made the world     and if he had  he says  he wouldn   t have made it as a ball .  silly idea  a ball .  people would fall off .  come to that  om has only very vague memories of having met any prophets  and doesn   t recognize the things he is supposed to have said to them .   om   s views on these matters are known because he spent three years or so in the world in the form of a tortoise .  this was an embarrassing accident .  he had meant to manifest himself briefly in some suitably impressive avatar     most likely  a bull     but what he got was a tortoise .  not a vast mountain bearing tortoise such as the hindu god vishnu once chose  but a mere common or garden tortoise .  and he found he was quite unable to get back to his own shape .  this humiliating failure of god power was due to the fact that hardly any omnians had real  true  deep down belief in om .  possibly  only one .  the rest thought they believed in him  but what they really believed in was the terrifying authority of the omnian church and its quisition .  as the philosopher abraxas wrote   around the godde there forms a shelle of prayers and ceremonies and buildings and priestes and authority  until at last the godde dies .  ande this maye notte be noticed .   small gods   to make matters worse  om as tortoise found his physical life in danger .  far too many people he met knew that    there   s good eating on one of those    .  he was also being hunted by an eagle who had found out that if you carry off a tortoise in your talons and drop it on a rock from a great height  the result is a shattered shell and a rather fiddly meal .  if  on the other hand  you drop it on somebody   s head  then you are recreating the earth legend which claims that the ancient greek dramatist aeschylus was killed when a flying eagle dropped a tortoise on his bald head  mistaking it for a rock .   that eagles in some places have learned to drop tortoises in order to crack them open has been attested to by various sources  and our suspension of disbelief in a bird   s ability to target humans in the course of breaking its lunch was occasioned by a daily telegraph obituary of brigadier john mackenzie .  in the second world war he worked with partisans in the mountains of greece  and        on one occasion a brigade rifle meeting on a mountain was disrupted when a flock of vultures carrying various small tortoises in their talons decided to drop them on the mountainside to crack their shells .  two soldiers sustained fractured skulls from the tortoises and there were other injuries  the meeting was abandoned .      om has been affected by his spell as a humble tortoise .  the omnian church has now disbanded its quisition .  divine smitings have become noticeably rare .  om   s devotees grudgingly allow foreigners to worship their own deities without being massacred  and his missionaries simply afflict the infidel with hymns and excruciatingly boring tracts .  clearly  this is all made up and the story has nothing to do with any    earthly    deity .       valkyries   valkyries form a group of very specialized goddesses honoured by barbarian heroes  their name means    choosers of the slain    .  they are found both on the discworld and in the nordic and germanic myths of earth  where they serve odin the god of war  also known as wotan or woden  .  they became even better known through a nineteenth century opera by the german composer wagner .  they are tall  powerfully built women  wearing chain mail and horned helmets  and riding magnificent airborne horses .  since wagner   s time  a good singing voice is also a requirement for the job  for they ride to a rousing chorus of    hi jo to .  ho .  hi jo to .  ho .      the task of a valkyrie is to hover over battlefields where her chosen hero is fighting  bringing him good luck for as long as the god of war decrees .  then  when the fated time comes for the hero to be killed  she swoops down and carries his soul to odin   s valhalla     hall of the slain        or to its discworld equivalent  the halls of blind io     where he will enjoy a blissful afterlife of quaffing mead and feasting on roast boar .  the valkyries will be on hand to make sure the drinking horns are kept filled .  and there is other fun to be had too  as the medieval icelandic writer snorri sturluson explained in his account of heathen nordic mythology  the edda  in the     s      what sport is there for the chosen warriors when they aren   t drinking .     asked gangleri the wanderer .   the high one said     every day  when they have dressed they put on their armour and go out into the open country and have a battle  and they kill one another  every one of them .  that is their sport .  and when the time for the evening meal comes round  they ride back home to valhalla and sit down together to drink again .      it   s a magnificent option  an offer one can   t refuse .  but sometimes  sometimes     well  maybe only once in all the centuries of the discworld  and never on earth     there come heroes like cohen the barbarian and his silver horde  who do refuse it  as is told in the last hero .  as their confederate mr saveloy had once pointed out  in interesting times   it does sound like spending forever in a room full of sports masters .  and it involves hobnobbing with gods  which isn   t to everyone   s taste .  instead  cohen and the horde choose to ride away to the stars .       demons of the nether pit   demons have existed on the discworld for as long as the gods  whom in many ways they closely resemble .  there are millions of them .  they find it very galling that those stuck up bastards in dunmanifestin refuse to take them seriously .   the demons live in a spacious dimension which is more or less on the same space time continuum as that of humans  and which they have tastefully decorated in shades of flame and keep heated to roasting point  as tradition requires .  it is arranged in eight circles  surrounding a bubbling lake of lava substitute  from which rise the majestic towers of pandemonium  the demon city .  demonic society is strongly hierarchical  murderously competitive  and devoted to tradition .  its higher ranks have added impressive titles to their sonorously supernatural names     lord astfgl  duke vassenego  earl beelzemoth  duke drazometh the putrid .  this  incidentally  is equally true on earth  where the famous grimoire known as the lemegeton  attributed to king solomon  is intensely class conscious .  it lists seventy six aristocratic demons  eighteen kings  twenty six dukes  fifteen marquises  five earls and twelve presidents  besides various minor groups .   demons take a lively interest in observing human affairs  partly out of curiosity and partly because they do so much admire human ingenuity when it comes to devising ways of hurting one another .  like the gods  they can peer across multidimensional space  and take note of events and ideas on the earth as well as on the disc .  this is useful to them  since they are about as capable of original thought as a parrot is of original swearwords .  their infernal regions would have been pretty bleak without the picturesque notions they pinched from human imaginations .  from the bible they got the idea of a lake of fire  mentioned in the apocalypse  book of revelation   from the medieval italian poet dante  the idea that hell is a deep funnel shaped pit  with circular terraces running round it     dante talked of nine circles  but the discworld demons opted for eight  the preferred magical number in their universe .  in milton   s paradise lost  it is said that devils built themselves a palace in hell by the power of magic and music  and called it pandemonium   anon out of the earth a fabric huge  rose like an exhalation  with the sound  of dulcet harmonies and voices sweet      built like a temple  where pilasters round  were set  and doric pillars overlaid  with golden architrave  nor did it lack  cornice and frieze  with massive sculptures graven   the roof was fretted gold      and so on and so forth     brazen doors  marble pavements  starry lamps  a jewelled throne     the lot .  but still  it was just one palace .  the discworld demons can do better than that  their pandemonium is a whole city .   most demons are rather old fashioned as regards their personal appearance  liking to look as disgusting as possible .  thus urglefloggah  spawn of the pit and loathly guardian of the dread portal  who welcomes newcomers to hell  has various well fanged mouths and more tentacles than legs  though fewer arms than heads .  first impressions are so important .  then there was quezovercoatl the feathered boa  a demon who went off to become a god to the humans of the tezuman empire and teach them how to cut the hearts out of one another on top of pyramids .  it is thought that he had picked up his ideas from the aztecs of mexico  and likewise  more or less  his name .  he was half man  half chicken  half jaguar  half scorpion  and half mad .  however  he was also only six inches high  so when forced to manifest himself physically he came to a sad  squishy end .   at the time of the events described in eric  hell was ruled by a relatively new king named astfgl  who was determined to modernize everything  including his own appearance .  his predecessors had gone in for hoofs and shaggy hind legs  but such things were beneath him .  nor would he ever consider tentacles  or grotesque faces in unseemly places .  instead  he favoured a red silk cloak and gloves  crimson tights  a cowl with two rather sophisticated little horns on it  and a trident .  a brief glance at the theatrical archives of britain had been enough to show him that this is the correct formal dress for a demon king .  regrettably  whenever he lost his temper his neat costume would get ripped apart in a sudden sprouting of claws and wings .   lord astfgl also revamped the whole infernal regime to conform to up to date business practices .  he abolished good traditional tortures such as pushing a rock uphill only for it to roll down again  or having your liver eaten by an eagle every day     both copied from excellent models in greek myth  the punishments of sisyphus and prometheus .  instead  he issued memos  policy statements  and morale boosting notices to staff .  in agonies of outrage and boredom  the lesser demons conferred on him the title of supreme life president of hell and gave him a luxurious but remote office to himself  where he is still happily busy compiling an in depth analysis of the role  function  priorities and goals of the demon race .  after which  the old familiar flames flickered once again .  it was for the best  or  technically  for this is hell  for the worst  .  it is only a matter of time before he invents the first ever mission statement  causing his world to end in self defence .   it is a curious fact that demons  powerful though they are in their own dimension  can nevertheless be summoned into the human world and told to make themselves useful .  in theory  this requires elaborate magic circles  runes  pentacles  on earth  or octograms  on the discworld   plus special robes  wands  knives  swords  candles  talismans  and incense  all of which come expensive .  then there are the chants and invocations  which go on and on and on .  part of a conjuration composed in the     s by the learned elias ashmole  antiquary  alchemist  astrologer  and founder of oxford   s ashmolean museum  runs as follows   i  elias ashmole  adjure thee elaby gathen  straightly charge and command thee by tetragrammaton  emmanuel  messias  sether  panton  cratons  alpha and omega  and by all other high and reverend names of almighty god both effable and ineffable     that thou appear meekly and mildly in this glasse  without doinge hurt or daunger unto me or any other living creature     and truly  without fraud  dissymulation or deceite  resolve and satisfye me in and of all manner of such questions and commands and demandes as i shall either aske  require  desire or demande of thee      demons love this kind of language .  they think it shows proper respect .  and so long as you are ceremonially robed and equipped  and chanting jargon by the bucket load  they manage to forget that what   s actually going on is that they are being ordered about by a human .   they are less happy if someone cuts out the frills  as the three witches of lancre did in an emergency .  being in nanny ogg   s washroom at the time  they used a sharp and terrible copper stick  scattered some rather old washing soda and extremely hard soap flakes  and bound the demon by the names of the bald scrubbing brush of art and the washboard of protection .  and if the summoning was unorthodox  the dismissal was frankly insulting      may i go now .         um .         please .      granny jerked upright again .      oh .  yes .  run along     she said distractedly .     thank you .      the head didn   t move         you wouldn   t mind banishing me  would you .     said the demon  when no one seemed to be taking the hint .      what .     said granny  who was thinking again .      only i   d feel better for being properly banished .     run along    lacks that certain something     said the head         certainly     said magrat .     right .  okay .  um .  begone  foul fiend  unto the blackest pit        the head smiled contentedly as the words rolled over it .  this was more like it .   it melted back into the waters of the copper like candlewax under a flame .  its last contemptuous comment  almost lost in the swirl  was     run aaaalonggg         wyrd sisters   finally it has to be said that on the disc there are certain low grade demons who stay permanently in the human world  working inside pocket watches  picture making devices  personal disorganizers  and similar contraptions .  some are eager to please  others distinctly surly .  the great lords of hell never  ever  mention this .       things from the dungeon dimensions   it is well known on the discworld that things from the shadowy  chaotic wastelands outside space and time which some call the dungeon dimensions are always trying to break through into the little circle of candlelight loosely called    the real world    .  they prowl round its flimsy stockades  searching for places where the fabric of reality has worn thin .  their shapes are unstable  but nasty  with random combinations of tentacles  talons  mandibles  spindly limbs  and wings  this reflects their sad  mad  incoherent minds .  they hoot and howl and buzz  giggle and flutter  and produce a horrible chittering sound .  any large concentration of magic attracts them .  they crave the solidity  light  and life of real worlds  and hate all living creatures with a deep and jealous hate  if they did gain a foothold on the disc they would inevitably drain all life from it .  occasionally some deluded power seeking magician imagines that he can safely invoke and control them     or manages to trap the even more mysterious parasitic entity known as the hiver  described in a hatful of sky .  this brings disaster on the magician himself  and on others .  more often  someone accidentally creates a point of entry by  for example  conducting a powerful magical or religious ceremony at a spot where the walls between the dimensions are already weak .  so far  the breaches in the walls have always been healed and the things repulsed before too much harm has been done .   it appears from the obscure writings of some exceptionally erudite wizards that the things were once dark gods  existing on the discworld until they were driven out by even more ancient and powerful beings  the old high ones .  their names are listed in the utterly forbidden and totally perilous grimoire known as the necrotelicomnicon or liber paginarum fulvarum  book of yellow pages  compiled by the klatchian necromancer achmed the mad .  the first edition of this dread opus is kept in conditions of maximum security in the vaults of unseen university  and students are only permitted to read tenth  or twelfth hand copies .   awareness of these occult matters first reached the earth through the receptive mind of the american writer h .  p .  lovecraft  creator of horror fantasies in the     s and   s .  he too described monstrous beings from other dimensions forever trying to break through into the normal world  he too wrote of a potently evil book of spells written by a mad arab  the necronomicon  which could be used to summon and worship them .  alarmingly  it appears from his writings that these creatures have more than once managed to establish themselves in isolated parts of america .  one can only hope he was mistaken  but sometimes one fears he was not .       bel shamharoth   it is hard to know how to classify this extremely unpleasant entity .   on the one hand  it could be argued that he should be considered a god  since he inhabits a black eight sided temple deep in the forest of skund  near the hub .  he lurks there under an eight sided stone slab in a hall with eight walls  reached by eight corridors and lit by the dim  eldritch glow of eight sided crystals .  whether he currently has any worshippers is a very moot point     those who built the temple died long ago  and people who enter it now have an extremely short life span .  however  the level of belief they experience during the few moments that they are face to face with bel shamharoth is so exceptionally intense that it keeps him in existence .  his appearance is totally non humanoid .  he looks rather like a spider  or maybe an octopus or squid  or maybe something altogether more strange  something black  at any rate  that is all suckers and tentacles and mandibles  with a single great glaring eye in the middle .   on the other hand  the gods of cori celesti have never accepted bel shamharoth as one of their number .  the lady went so far as to say on one occasion that he should never have been spawned  and that she thought all such creatures had died out at the beginning of time .  this seems to imply that he was one of the old dark gods that once existed on the discworld  and that he managed to remain there when the others were driven out to the dungeon dimensions .   one of his powers  we are told in equal rites  is an ability to enter people   s dreams .  amazingly  this is so strong that he has been able to reveal something of himself even in another universe .  his title of    soul eater    is echoed in the mythology of the ancient egyptians  who believed that when the dead entered the afterlife their hearts were weighed against the ostrich feather of truth .  if they failed this test  they would be devoured by a hideous monster which crouched beside the scales  called the eater of souls .  it did not  however  look like bel shamharoth  simply being part lion  part crocodile  and part hippopotamus     no tentacles or suckers whatsoever .   many centuries later  the image of a monstrous tentacular creature stamped itself deeply on the mind of h .  p .  lovecraft .  he described an incredibly ancient being named cthulhu  one of the old ones who once ruled the earth  now banished below the ocean bed  but still remembered and worshipped by some .  a small stone figurine  of unfathomable antiquity  shows cthulhu as    a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline  but with an octopus like head whose face was a mass of feelers    .  even more appalling is the dunwich monster  child of a human mother and yog sothoth  another of the old ones  this creature is bigger than a barn  made of what looks like squirming ropes     an octopus  centipede  spidery kind of thing    with great bulging eyes all over it  and ten or twenty mouths all opening and shutting     definitely an echo or emanation of bel shamharoth .       the auditors   the most deeply negative and destructive forces in the cosmos of the discworld have no fangs  no tentacles  no red glowing eyes .  they look like small grey hooded robes  with nothing whatsoever inside .  they are the auditors of reality  who see it as their job to make sure that the universe functions smoothly and efficiently  without unpredictable interruptions .  above all  they distrust and reject the notion of individual personality  since they hold that to have a personality means to have a beginning and an end  and hence to forfeit immortality .  the way to be immortal  they maintain  is to avoid living .  therefore they operate entirely by consensus  never permitting themselves to show personal tastes  feelings or opinions  if any of them becomes aware of itself as an individual  it self destructs instantly .  they are the enemies of all imagination  creativity and emotion  and hence of life itself .   mercifully  their power on the discworld has so far been restricted .  on earth  their presence grows daily .     and some may be locally grown .  humanity seems predisposed to see the turtle as a massive carrier .     yes  we know that there are several versions of this story .     only to find a job with miss treason  see page      .  mythology loves ravens .       chapter     dwarfs      in a mine  there are many levels .  some  anybody can visit .  but lower down  there are hidden galleries  closed off corridors  places which only the oldest and wisest miners know .  and so it is with dwarfs .  pretty well everyone on the discworld has seen a dwarf  but very  very few really understand what it is like to be a dwarf .   what you see is easily told .  a dwarf is a smallish humanoid  about four foot tall on average   strongly built  bearded  dressed in layer upon layer of leather  plus chain mail and helmet if circumstances warrant it  and never without an axe .  this description applies to both male and female dwarfs  though some close observers have claimed that the beards of the latter are silkier .  all dwarfs are tireless  highly skilled workers  their traditional  ancestral occupations are mining and smithing  but they are also excellent engineers  jewellers  printers  and so forth .  thousands of them have migrated to ankh morpork  where they work hard and mostly keep themselves to themselves  some of the young ones  regrettably  like to congregate in dwarf bars where they drink too much  sing interminable songs about gold  and get into fights .   these facts find close parallels in the myths and legends of earth  especially in pre christian scandinavia and the germanic areas .  there  tradition tells of a race of small beings who live inside rocks and under mountains  and are so skilled in metalworking that they make magical weapons and rings for the gods themselves .  they are old  wise  and very rich .  female dwarfs are never mentioned  unlike she elves and giantesses   so one must assume that on our world  as on the discworld  they looked just like the males and worked at the same crafts .  although in later centuries the names for various types of small supernatural beings have become seriously confused  one can be sure that those that inhabit human mines  as gnomes and kobolds do in germany  and knockers in cornwall  and those that work as smiths are kin to the true ancient dwarfs .   one need only look at the names  nicknames and patronymics of many discworld dwarfs to find confirmation of this link with nordic and germanic dwarfdom     from their ancient king b   hrian bloodaxe to the modern albrecht albrechtsson or bjorn stronginthearm  there are echoes everywhere .  other dwarf names  ringfounder  helmcrusher  hammerhock  allude to battle prowess and craftsmanship .  but from time to time  curiously unsuitable ones occur  such as cheery  snorey  dozy  and bashfull  these must be due to some alien influence  possibly that which affected the discworld during the time when moving pictures were being made at holy wood .  it was certainly at that time that some dwarfs first felt an urge to sing the irritating  and previously unknown  hiho song  which is utterly undwarfish  since it does not mention gold and is less than an hour long  .   these are only the upper levels of their culture .  to understand the nature of a discworld dwarf  one must dig much deeper .  there  dwarfish identity is not defined by mere genetics and size  but by a whole complex culture of laws  taboos  customs  moral principles and traditional knowledge .  it is not precisely a religion  but it is as vital to their sense of selfhood as any religion could be .  height  in discworld dwarf culture  plays no part in defining a dwarf .  dwarfishness is about what you do  not how high you do it .  captain carrot ironfoundersson  for example  happens to have been born of human parents and to be well over six foot tall  but his upbringing has made him socially and spiritually a dwarf .  as he explains to vimes      adopted by dwarfs  brought up by dwarfs .  to dwarfs i   m a dwarf  sir .  i can do the rite of k   zakra  i know the secrets of h   ragna  i can ha   lk my g   rakha correctly     i am a dwarf .         what do those things mean .         i am not allowed to tell non dwarfs .      the fifth elephant   the legal aspects of this culture are known collectively as kruk .  outsiders think of this as    mining law     which is true as far as it goes  but as carrot explains      it   s a lot more than that .  it   s about     how you live .  laws of ownership  marriage laws  inheritance  rules for dealing with disputes of all kinds  that sort of thing .  everything  really .      each dwarf mine  has its own    king     a title roughly equivalent to    chief engineer      but in disputes where the kruk is unclear the final arbiter is the low king  whose authority extends over all dwarfish communities .  he is chosen by the senior dwarfs  usually from among the leading families  and is crowned sitting upon the scone of stone .  he must sit on it to give his judgements  as all low kings have done ever since the days of king b   hrian bloodaxe  fifteen hundred years ago .  this scone is the supreme example of a traditional dwarf bread     a highly prized product used by dwarfs as a food of last resort  and regarded as utterly inedible by all other races .  it also serves as a weapon .  some observers claim to have seen it being fashioned with hammer and anvil .  specimens kept in museums for decades  if not centuries  show little change from the day they were baked .  that  however  is not why the scone is held in deep reverence and guarded with the utmost care .  king b   hrian bloodaxe  fifteen hundred years ago  sat on it while it was still soft  and left his impression upon it .  it is now the very seat of majesty  conferring legitimacy on each new ruler .   this should not seem surprising to us .  pretty well every country can show at least one rock on to which some ancient hero or holy man has stamped his footprints     or hand prints  or the mark of his knees  or the hoof prints of his horse .  many are sites of pilgrimage .  some  in britain and ireland  are symbols of authority .  one famous scottish one was the stone of the footprints on the island of islay in the hebrides  a rock about seven foot square marked with two prints  at his inauguration  each chief of the macdonalds would set his feet in them and stand there  sword in hand  to take his oath .  this showed that he would walk in the ways of justice established by his forebears  and held his power by right .  this particular stone  alas  was destroyed some three hundred years ago .   the most famous of all inauguration stones is the stone of scone  on which generations of medieval kings of scotland were crowned .  some say it originally came from ireland  and is identical with the legendary liafail  which screamed a greeting when a rightful high king of ireland stood on it  if so  it is at least       years old .  it does not  however  bear any imprints .  it was removed from the castle of scone  near perth  in      by edward i of england after his victory over the scots  for centuries it was kept in westminster abbey  built into an ornate wooden throne on which every monarch  including the present queen  has sat for her or his coronation .  in      it was stolen  and recovered a few months later     or was it .  some say what was recovered was only a replica .  in any case  real or replica  the westminster stone was returned to scotland in       and is now in edinburgh castle .  clearly the stone of scone and the scone of stone echo one another across the multiverse .   curiously  and we advance it with some caution  our world may offer a more direct parallel with the scone of stone .  in her book footprints in stone janet bord mentions a local legend that there   s said to be a stone behind the main altar in reims cathedral with the marks of christ   s buttocks .  he was helping masons build the main doorway  and felt a bit tired .  so many comments spring to mind  but the only one we will allow to spring further is that stories of jesus helping in the construction were endemic during the cathedral building era  and this one has the feel of a workmen   s legend  especially the sort which would be told to wide eyed apprentices .   let us return to the discworld .  there  dwarfs are famous workmen .  as captain of the city watch  vimes had to learn about the folkways of this important ethnic minority .  when one of the city dwarfs was murdered  and later when one who had joined the multiracial city watch was killed in the course of his duties  vimes learned a good deal .  for one thing  a dead dwarf   s tools are always melted down  however fine they are  since no one else would want to use them      what  use another dwarf   s actual tools .     carrot   s mouth twisted in distaste .     oh no  that   s not     right .  i mean  they   re     part of him .  i mean     someone else using them  after he   s used them all these years  i mean     urrgh .      men at arms   and a weapon  of the finest quality  will be placed in his grave .  vimes  examining the murdered bjorn hammerhock   s workshop  noticed a particularly heavy axe etched with intricate patterns .  this  carrot explains  is a burial weapon      it   s made to be buried with a dwarf .  every dwarf is buried with a weapon .  you know .  to take with him to     wherever he   s going .         but it   s fine workmanship .  and it   s got an edge like    aargh     vimes sucked his finger     like a razor .      carrot looked shocked .     of course .  it would be no good facing them with an inferior weapon .         what them are you talking about .         anything bad he encounters on his journey after death     said carrot  a shade awkwardly .   this is so essential that cuddy  the dwarf watchman  flatly refuses to depart into the afterlife because his axe has been shattered in the fall that killed him .  he protests to death that he needs a good weapon      if i   m not going to be properly buried  i ain   t going .  my tortured soul will walk the world in torment .      it doesn   t have to .      it can if it wants to     snapped the ghost of cuddy .   many  many human societies in this world have agreed with the dwarfs that the dead should be given their weapons  and anything else they might need on the journey .  and archaeologists are very grateful to them     especially to the ones who carefully laid the stuff in the grave  rather than those who tossed it on to a funeral pyre  even if from the ghost   s point of view both methods are equally good .  obviously  archaeologists can   t tell from material remains whether in these old societies the living also felt  as carrot does  that there   s something disgusting about using weapons and tools that had belonged to the dead  but it would not be surprising if they did .  in the modern world  gypsies traditionally approve of the idea of burning a dead man   s caravan and all its contents  though this means such financial loss to the family that nowadays it is rarely done .  so too on the disc  the chalkland shepherds burned granny aching   s hut after her death  knowing none of them would dare use something she had made so much her own  see a hatful of sky  .   one of us recalls a metalwork shop staffed by very old men .  when one of them died  his personal tools were left on the bench where he   d put them  untouched  and were gradually buried under workshop debris .  it does not need a fevered imagination to see that in the days when tools were an expensive lifetime investment  shaped over the years to their owner   s hand  there would be a certain unfocused distaste for handling them after a workmate   s death .      outsiders often assume that because all dwarfs look  dress and behave alike  have masculine names  and refer to one another as    he     they are in fact all male .  this is completely untrue     the population  as with other humanoid races  is fifty per cent male and fifty per cent female .  but very  very  very few dwarfs would ever admit this statistic in public .  and  until very recently  none would let it be publicly known that they themselves belong to the female fifty per cent .   even when outsiders know about this  they underestimate the distress it can cause .  when the dwarf cheery littlebottom joined the ankh morpork watch  the werewolf angua guessed that    he    was really    she     but couldn   t understand why being spotted was so shattering   cheery sagged on to a seat .     how could you tell .  even other dwarfs can   t tell .  i   ve been so careful .         i don   t know why you   re so upset     said angua .     i thought dwarfs hardly recognized the difference between male and female  anyway .  look  there   s plenty of women in this town that   d love to do things the dwarf way .  i mean  what are the choices they   ve got .  barmaid  seamstress  or somebody   s wife .  while you can do anything the men do            provided we do only what the men do     said cheery .   angua paused .     oh     she said .     i see .  hah .  yes  i know that tune .      feet of clay   encouraged by angua  cheery gradually yields to her suppressed longing for a bit of jewellery and a dab of lipstick  eventually and with much nervousness  she dons a mid calf leather skirt  still keeping helmet  breastplate  and beard  naturally  .  some other dwarf watchmen react with horror      that   s     female clothes  isn   t it .         well .     she quavered .     so what .  i can if i want to .         that   s     my mother never even     urgh     that   s disgusting .  in public too .  what happens if kids come in .  i can see your ankles .      as it turns out  other she dwarfs in ankh morpork soon follow cheery   s lead and pluck up courage to    come out    .  but when her duties take her to the old homelands in the mountains  she has to face traditionalists who think it an obscene abomination  a denial of all true dwarfishness  for a female even to admit her gender  let alone to flaunt it by her appearance .  the fact that the relatively liberal king rhys rhysson accepts her presence  and actually shakes hands with her  is for them a major culture shock .   it is fascinating to compare the way discworld dwarfs view femininity with the rules  taboos and superstitions about women in many earthly societies  past and present .  at first glance  they seem to be opposites .  dwarfs expect females to conceal their gender  to dress exactly like males  to be warriors  miners  blacksmiths and so forth  just like males .  on earth  on the contrary  societies and religions which feel strongly on questions of gender abominate the idea of a woman dressing like a man .  they expect her to wear distinctively female clothing  obeying rules as to what is or is not    modest     the most important concerns usually being the length of the skirt and how much of the hair  head and face should be concealed .  in extreme cases  women end up looking more like small perambulating tents than human beings .  so  although their garb proclaims their gender  at the same time it hides it  as surely as that of a discworld she dwarf .   as regards work practices  however  discworld dwarfs are not hampered by the same taboos as earth   s older traditional societies  where it would be out of the question for a woman to take up man   s work .  even in european countries in recent times  in some ultra masculine occupations it was believed that the mere presence of a woman brought bad luck .  women were not allowed to go down mines or on board fishing boats     indeed  simply to meet a woman on the road down to the beach would make a fisherman give up his plans for the day and head back home .   behind this  rarely mentioned openly  is a deep rooted horror of menstruation  regarded as a source of magical harm in primitive societies  and as a pollution in the bible .  sir james frazer   s the golden bough gives examples of taboos among the native peoples of australia  north america and elsewhere  a menstruating woman must not touch a man  or his tools and weapons  or any object he may use  or he will surely die  she must not touch freshly killed meat  or it will go bad  she must not go anywhere near the pastures  or the cows will die .  there is a whole list of similar notions in the writings of the roman naturalist pliny  who regarded them as proven scientific facts  her touch will turn milk sour  cause plants to wither  blunt razors  cloud mirrors  and so on .  most of them crop up again in relatively modern european folklore .  as recently as      victor hugo noted that menstruating women were not allowed into parts of the paris catacombs where mushrooms were grown  as their presence would make the mushrooms rot .  and to this day some orthodox jews will not shake hands with a gentile woman  for fear she might be having her period  a jewish woman would know she must keep out of their way at this time  .   dwarfs say of themselves that they are not a religious race .  true  they have been heard to utter some rather strange words  which may be the names of gods  if they drop something heavy on their toes .  they also talk about agi hammerthief  a mischievous sort of sprite who hangs about in mines and makes off with the tool you were quite sure you   d put down just there .  sometimes  in a dark tunnel  you can hear his distant laughter .  but they don   t count these things as religion  they don   t take them seriously .   what dwarfs do take very seriously indeed are the laws  which were called into existence  at the beginning of time  by tak .  who tak was or is  is something they do not discuss  but every dwarf knows the tale of the things tak wrote   the first thing tak did  he wrote himself .   the second thing tak did  he wrote the laws .   the third thing tak did  he wrote the world .   the fourth thing tak did  he wrote a cave .   the fifth thing tak did  he wrote a geode  an egg of stone .   thud .    when the geode hatched in the twilight of the cave  the first man and the first dwarf were born  but only the first dwarf found the laws tak had written .  finally came the first troll .  the conclusion of the tale was deliberately distorted for thousands of years in order to justify the hatred dwarfs felt for trolls  but the true text has now been recovered .  it runs   then tak looked upon the stone and it was trying to come alive  and tak smiled and wrote    all things strive    .  and for the service the stone had given he fashioned it into the first troll  and delighted in the life that came unbidden .  these are the things that tak wrote .   this  as any earthbound reader can see  is a philosophically and morally profound creation myth  and tak a more impressive figure than any of the gods on cori celesti .  we can no longer accept that dwarfs are a non religious race .    yet in some dwarf communities devotion to the laws spawned an outlook as rigid as the unchanging ritualism in the kingdom of djelibeybi  though not as cruel as the enforcement of dogma by the omnians .  at the time of the events described in the fifth elephant and in thud .  the influence of traditionalist mountain dwarfs  especially those from schmaltzberg  had grown strong .  they held that those who had moved to ankh morpork and other lowland cities were d   rkza     not proper dwarfs     because they had become lax  they had let the old ways slide .  if albrecht albrechtsson had become low king  he would have declared all these city dwellers d   hrarak     non dwarfs     this would have made their marriages and business contracts invalid  and would have meant that old dwarfs would not be allowed to be buried back home .   albrecht did not become low king  so this did not happen .  instead  traditionalists themselves began coming to ankh morpork  hoping to re establish orthodoxy by their teaching and example .  they are called grags .  they are greatly respected by the city dwarfs  they conduct marriages and other necessary ceremonies  give judgement in disputes and advice on problems   please come and say the death words over my father     please advise me on the sale of my shop     please guide me in my business     i am a long way from the bones of my grandfathers  please help me to stay a dwarf .   thud .    the grags  or deep downers  go beyond even the strictest letter of the laws .  they have dug themselves new dwellings under the cellars of existing houses  where they live as much as possible underground  if they do have to come up to the surface  they wear heavy black leather robes and hoods with a mere slit for the eyes  and are carried about in curtained sedan chairs  so as never to commit the crime of seeing daylight .  the strictest among them form enclosed communities  and never come out .  they send a junior novice  called    the daylight face     to do any errands above ground and to speak with visitors in an antechamber .  they claim that everything that happens underground should be governed by kruk     mining law     not by the laws of ankh morpork .  this is something commander vimes vigorously rejects  city law  he argues  applies just as much below the city as in the city .   it should not be too difficult to find parallels to all this in other universes  including ours .  one thinks of fundamentalist movements in various religions  of cultic communities  of the rules of enclosed orders of monks and nuns .  humans and dwarfs think the same way .  regrettably  here there is no commander vimes around to put a stop to the endless revival of koom valley        any assembly of dwarfs for a common purpose is technically a    mine     even if it is a boat or a farm .     for a given value of    non religious    .  study of the text suggests that tak  in the dwarfs    understanding  is both the creator of  and immanent in  the fundamental laws of the universe .  there is no act of worship  any more than gravity is worshipped  although it may be argued that living a    right life    is such a thing .  even then the dwarf laws seem open to slow change by long argument .  dwarfs are artisans  after all  tools that don   t work are recast .       chapter     the elves      it   s easy  all too easy  for people nowadays to get hold of the wrong end of the stick if you tell them there are    elves    about .  and if you say    fairies     that just makes matters worse .  people think of tall  shining figures dancing in rings in the moonlight to the loveliest music one could hope to hear  or tiny dainty creatures with butterfly wings  fluttering round flowers .   and in a way  some of this is true .  for elves do generally choose to appear tall  beautiful and glamorous to humans .  their real appearance is thin  dull  and grey  with triangular faces and big slanty eyes  oddly  they occasionally let themselves be seen like this by the people of our world  who then label them    aliens    and    extraterrestrials     and get very excited  .  they do sing and dance  and sometimes they laugh a lot  though you would probably not like it if you knew what they are laughing about .  and there are indeed little flying ones  though they have more in common with hornets than with butterflies .  in truth  elves and fairies are a predatory  cruel  parasitic race  who will use other living beings  and hurt them  because this is fun .  they break into a world through those strange places where the barrier between dimensions is just a bit too thin for safety .  places which are like a door  half open .  places where it   s wise to put a marker of some kind     a solitary tree  say  or some standing stones     to warn everybody to keep away .   and yet  foolish people will go there .  in lancre  for instance  a group of men in a wood  looking for somewhere private to rehearse a play      let   s go right     said jason .      nah  it   s all briars and thorns that way .         all right  then  left then .         it   s all winding     said weaver .      what about the middle road .     said carter .   jason peered ahead .   there was a middle track  hardly more than an animal path  which wound away under shady trees .  ferns grew thickly alongside it .  there was a general green  rich  dark feel to it  suggestive of the word    bosky    .   his blacksmith   s senses stood up and screamed .      not that way     he said .      ah  come on     said weaver .     what   s wrong with it .         goes up to the dancers  that path does     said jason .   lords and ladies   the blacksmith jason ogg knows that the dancers     a ring of eight stumpy man sized stones  one of which is the piper     are to be avoided  though he doesn   t know why .  nor does his conscious mind know why he fears the ferny path  it is his instincts which  as we shall see  have picked up a warning from the lore of another world .  these are signs of a gateway  a short cut between dimensions  a place where elves can enter .   one clue that elves have broken in  or are just about to  is that crop circles start appearing in cornfields  the growing wheat bends over sharply  breaks  and lies down in a circle .  this strange phenomenon has been observed several times in lancre  and also on the earth in recent years .   earlier generations on earth got no such warnings  but then they didn   t need them .  they knew for sure that there were elves and fairies lurking in pools and streams  in deep woods and inside mounds and rocks  and sweeping across the sky in the wild winter winds .  and they knew that these beings were cold hearted  revengeful  often cruel  however beautiful their faces and however enchanting their music .  any countryman in ireland or the scottish highlands     or     years ago would have known of a dozen cases of someone who died  or lost his wits  or became paralysed  or simply was    never the same again    after meeting them .  similarly in england  at an earlier period     in       for instance  a writer named richard bovet reported that he knew someone  completely reliable  of course  who knew a man who had once seen fairies holding a market on blackdown hill in somerset and foolishly tried to join them .  he felt a sudden pain  and by the time he got home    lameness seized him all on one side    and he remained so  though he survived for many years .  we still call such a thing a    stroke     even if we have forgotten who did the striking .  and we still say of somebody who seems vague  dim witted  or slightly crazed that he or she is    away with the fairies    .   in eastern europe  the fear of elves and fairies was still powerful in quite recent years .  the american folklorist gail kligman  working in romania in       learned about wondrously beautiful but malevolent fairy maidens called iele  which literally means    they    or    themselves     since it is dangerous to utter their true name .  they live in woods and wild places .  they travel by night  singing and dancing  but those who listen to their music or join their dance will regret it     at best  they will be deaf for life  and may well be crippled  or go mad .  there is hardly any limit to the sickness and trouble which the iele can inflict on humans  even those who have never offended them .  in russia and other slavonic lands  there are forest elves who trick travellers into leaving the path to wander helplessly among the trees until they starve to death  and water elves who catch and drown the unwary .  beautiful .  yes  usually .  nice .  never .   wherever elves go they feed on the awe  the terror  the superstition they inspire .  they take control of people   s minds .  they enslave .  when they invaded lancre  as is told in lords and ladies  granny weatherwax warned king verence ii      when they get into a world  everyone else is on the bottom .  slaves .  worse than slaves .  worse than animals  even .  they take what they want  and they want everything .  but worst of all  the worst bit is     they read your mind .  they hear what you think  and in self defence you think what they want .  and it   s barred windows at night  and food out for the fairies  and turning around three times before you talks about    em  and horseshoes over the door .      horseshoes are important  and so are the blacksmiths who make them  since almost the only protection humans have against fairies is the power of iron .  it is known throughout the multiverse that all creatures of this species fear and detest iron  which causes them intense pain .  various more or less foolish theories have been proposed to account for this .  on the earth  it is often claimed that it shows    fairies    are nothing more than a folk memory of some prehistoric human society which did not have iron weapons  and fled from others who did .  but on the discworld people know the real reason .  elves have a powerful sixth sense based on awareness of magnetic fields  and use it to know precisely where they are  and where and what all other living creatures are .  so to them iron is       the terrible metal that drinks the force and deforms the flux universe like a heavy weight on a rubber sheet and blinds them and deafens them and leaves them rudderless and more alone than most humans could ever be .   lords and ladies   the other picture people have of fairies  the picture of their beauty and charm  is partly created by the fairies themselves as they infiltrate the collective memory and imagination of humanity .  nanny ogg knows this  yet even she finds it hard to keep a clear mind when thinking about elves   people didn   t seem able to remember what it was like with the elves around .  life was certainly more interesting then  but usually because it was shorter .  and it was more colourful  if you liked the colour of blood .  it got so people didn   t even dare talk openly about the bastards .   you said  the shining ones .  you said  the fair folk .  and you spat  and touched iron .  but generations later  you forgot about the spitting and the iron  and you forgot why you used those names for them  and you remembered only that they were beautiful .   elves .  the bastards     and yet     and yet     somehow  yes  they did things to memory .   we only remembers that the elves sang  thought nanny ogg  .  we forgets what it was they were singing about .   how completely people forget depends very much on when  where and how they live .  in the cities     in london  new york  or ankh morpork     elves and fairies are nothing more than fantasy  just a bit of fun for the kids .  but people who live on the land  especially in remote and wild parts of the country  those people know they are real .  and they remember that though they might  just occasionally  bring good luck  they are far more likely to inflict diseases  kidnap people  and steal human babies  replacing them with their own sickly and mentally deficient    changelings    .   changelings were a particularly sad obsession .  a healthy young couple out in the country and in a world without modern medical understanding or any idea of the meaning of the term    limited gene pool     give birth to a child who looks like a little old man  or is beautiful but very backward  or eats incessantly but nevertheless fails to thrive     and the only reason the family can find lies in folklore     the fairies stole our beautiful child and left one of their own .     a horrible thought  yet not quite so horrible for the parents as one religious alternative     it   s our own fault the baby is like this  it   s a judgement on us for our sins .      in a disturbing but fascinating paper published in the journal of the folklore society in       susan shoon eberley cites many accounts of the appearance and behaviour of changelings as they were described in nineteenth century sources  and maps them against dozens of childhood disorders which produce children that look and act    like the fairies    .  the victorian medical establishment was coming to grips with the idea that these children were victims of disease  but the common people fell back on folk myth  which was reinforced with every case .   folk myth also supplied a cruel remedy .  you had to make life so miserable for the changeling that it would flee and the    real    child would miraculously return .  custom handed down various    remedies     including putting the child in a hot oven or leaving it out on the midden all night     child abuse at best  socially condoned infanticide at worst .  the wonderful child did not return  but at least there was no longer the inconvenient changeling in the cradle  and everyone nodded and understood      nanny ogg  a midwife  knew what she was doing when she took the king of the elves to task in lords and ladies .  a society does not want elves in the driving seat .   yet by the nineteenth century  in much of europe  memories were fading  and people spoke of elves and fairies without such fear .  their world was under attack by education and street lights and medicine and technology  the telegraph could beat puck when it came to putting a girdle round the earth .   and thus their decline continued .  though people still told stories about changelings and abductions  on the whole they believed  or half believed  or suspended disbelief  that the hidden folk could be good neighbours to humans  and were just mischievous  not truly dangerous .  they could lead you astray even in woods which you knew quite well  so that you felt hopelessly lost and would maybe fall into a ditch  but that was just their fun  and in any case it was easier to blame the fairies than the cider  .  they would do you no harm  provided you were careful not to offend them .  the rules were clear  don   t cut down their favourite trees  don   t damage the mounds where they live  don   t build a road across their paths  be careful where you throw dirty water  keep your house clean and your hearth swept in case a fairy comes there in the night .   there was even one type  the house elves  whom humans welcomed .  the english called them hobs  pixies or pucks  the scots brownies  the scandinavians nisses and tomtes .  these would actually live in a farm and bring it luck  they would help with harvesting  tend the animals  even do housework  in exchange for an occasional bowl of milk or porridge     provided nobody spied on them or laughed at them .  russian country folk said there were several on each farm  the most important one lived behind the stove  others guarded the barn  the bath house  the henhouse  and so on .  on the discworld  only the wee free men have ever done such a favour for humans  and then only once  in the very special circumstances created by their bond with tiffany aching .  their reward was special sheep liniment  which smells suspiciously like whisky .   another sign that people in europe were forgetting the true nature of elves  and no longer took them seriously  is that they so often thought of them as small .  the little people  the wee folk .  some people said they were about the size of a rabbit  others  that of a six year old child .  some said they were really  really small     like the little farm elf in sweden who sweated and panted as he dragged a single ear of wheat into the barn  but went off in a huff when the farmer laughed at him  once he was gone  the farm went to rack and ruin .  so he had his revenge .  even so  one can   t be seriously scared of something a few inches high  unless  of course  it is a nac mac feegle  .   why did the menace of elves dwindle in this way .  how can they have been so reduced .  once again  it was will shakespeare   s plays which nudged the human imagination on to a new path .  in a midsummer night   s dream he gave elves sweet but silly names  peaseblossom and cobweb  mustardseed and moth .  they were  by his reckoning  just about big enough to kill a red hipped bumble bee on top of a thistle .  true  he also wrote about puck  who was bigger and more active and enjoyed playing practical jokes  but there is no real malice or danger in puck   s tricks .  in romeo and juliet he described mab  queen of the fairies  who controls people   s dreams  like the fairy queen whom tiffany encounters in the wee free men .  but whereas that queen is terrifying  queen mab is a delightful little thing as she drives her tiny  dainty chariot across the bodies of sleeping humans   her waggon spokes made of long spinners    legs   the cover  of the wings of grasshoppers   the traces  of the smallest spider   s web   the collars  of the moonshine   s watery beams   her whip  of cricket   s bone  the lash  of film   her waggoner  a small grey coated gnat      this new image of fairies and their world proved irresistible .  from shakespeare   s time right down to the twentieth and twenty first centuries it has gone on spreading in literature  painting  children   s books  films  television .  so now there are plenty of pretty fairies and quaint little elves on earth     they make a good story to entertain a child .  and so some become santa   s little helpers  and some bring money for a tooth  and there are fairies at the bottom of the garden  it   s not so very  very far away  .  there   s one who says she   ll die if children don   t clap their hands to prove they believe in her .  and for very young children  just to get them properly addicted to tweeness  there are dumpy little baby fairies in romper suits  with horns  living in a land where it   s all trees and flowers and sunshine .  so nice .  such good fun .   there is another way in which earthly folk have tamed the notion of the elf  and this too involves children .  adults who have stopped believing in elves can make damn sure that their children are still scared of them  because that way they   ll stay away from dangerous places  and learn to obey the rules .  they turn elves and fairies into nursery bogeys     don   t play in the woods after sunset  the hytersprites will get you           don   t stand at the edge of the pond  jenny greenteeth will drag you in and gobble you up           behave yourself while i   m out  remember the tomte who lives under the stairs will be watching you    .   nanny ogg understands this principle .  consider the copper in her washhouse   the water under the lid was inky black and  according to rumour  bottomless  the ogg grandchildren were encouraged to believe that monsters from the dawn of time dwelt in its depths  since nanny believed that a bit of thrilling and pointless terror was an essential ingredient of the magic of childhood .   wyrd sisters   but not entirely pointless .  after all  a toddler could drown in a copper .   however  fashions in child rearing change .  in many parts of the earth it is now considered quite wicked to deliberately frighten a child  even for its own good  so nursery bogeys are an endangered species .  some have reinvented themselves as funny  but nice  fairies in order to survive .  in iceland  children used to be told that in the thirteen nights leading up to christmas thirteen hideous hobgoblins would come down from the mountains and creep into the house  one by one  they would carry off any child who was naughty  and probably eat it .  nowadays  this simply won   t do .  the thirteen christmas lads still look hideous  but that   s just a joke  and nobody is afraid of them .  in fact  each of the lads pops a sweet  or some other little present  under the child   s pillow .  perhaps this delicacy is because we think we know of more complex monsters now .  but we always have .  the world of the fairy tale is a map of prohibitions  do not open that door enter that wood     and above all  young lady  don   t talk to the wolf .   there have been many theories as to what the true home of the elfin races is like  and where it may be found     if indeed they have a home  for they might simply be alien nomads  creating the illusion of a fairyland in any territory they invade .  the nac mac feegle  who ought to know  as they are fairies of a sort themselves  say that there is an elf world  but it   s a mere parasite .  one of them tells tiffany aching     it floats around until it finds a place that   s weak on a world where no one   s payin    attention  and opens a door .  then the queen sends in her folk .  for the stealin     ye ken .      the wee free men is the story of how elves    open a door    between standing stones on the chalk hills  and how tiffany crosses into their world to rescue her little brother  kidnapped by the queen  and also  incidentally  an older boy named roland .  one can   t properly describe this    fairyland     for it is full of human dreams and nightmares  which keep on changing .  but in its true nature  before the illusions begin  it is a cold  snowy land which somehow does not feel like a real place .  there is no sun in the sky .  the woods are full of dimness and shadows  and no birds sing .  nothing grows older there  because nothing grows at all .   yet the nac mac feegles tell tiffany that    fairyland    was not always such a terrible place .  it has been ruined by a domestic dispute      it wasnae so bad then .  it wasnae perfect  mark you  but the quin wasnae as cold in them days .  the king was still aroound .  she was always happy then .         what happened .  did the king die .         no .  they had words  if ye tak    my meanin        said rob .      oh  you mean like an argument           a bit  mebbe     said rob .     but they was magical words .  forests destroyed  mountains explodin     a few hundred deaths  that kind of thing .  and he went off to his own world .  fairyland was never a picnic  ye ken  even in the old days .  but it was fine if you kept alert  an    there was flowers and burdies and summertime .      the wee free men   there are mysteries here .  will shakespeare must have picked up some echo of them  since his midsummer night   s dream tells of a quarrel between the king and queen of fairyland  whom he calls oberon and titania  ending in reconciliation .  whether there can be the same happy ending elsewhere in the multiverse remains to be seen .  but where  meanwhile  has oberon   s discworld counterpart disappeared to .  and who is he .  the witches of lancre know the answer .  he is the powerful antlered figure who lies in the cavern beneath the barrow known as the long man  dreaming the days away in his steam filled sweat house .  one day  maybe  he will return .  meanwhile  as we learn in lords and ladies   he occasionally intervenes to frustrate the plans of his queen .   when tiffany asks the nac mac feegles what will become of her brother if she can   t rescue him  they explain that he will probably return one day  but         time passes slower the deeper ye go intae this place .  years pass like days .  the quin   ll get tired o    the wee lad after a coupla months  mebbe .  a coupla months here  ye ken  where time is slow an    heavy .  but when he comes back intae the mortal world  you   ll be an old lady  or mebbe you   ll be deid .  so if youse has bairns o    yer own  you   d better tell them to watch out for a wee sticky kid wanderin    the hills shoutin    for sweeties     cos that   ll be their uncle wentworth .  that wouldna be the worst o    it  neither .  live in dreams for too long and ye go mad  ye can never wake up prop   ly  ye can never get the hang o    reality again         the grim picture of a sunless land where time does not run true matches some accounts in the folklore which took shape before shakespeare   s influence was felt .  take the story of thomas the rhymer  also called thomas of erceldoune  a poet and seer who lived on the borders between scotland and england at the close of the thirteenth century .  some time in the next couple of hundred years  someone wrote a ballad about him  it is still sung today  .  it tells how thomas  resting on a hillside near edinburgh  saw the queen of elfland ride by on a milk white horse with silver bells on its mane  she summoned him to be her harpist  he kissed her and mounted behind her on her horse .   o they rade on  and farther on   the steed gaed faster than the wind   until they reached a desert wide   and living land was left behind .   in that desert is a place where three paths meet  just as they do in lancre .  one is a narrow path  thick beset with thorns and briars  this  says the queen  is the christian path of righteousness .  the second is a broad path through flowery meadows  and that   s the path of wickedness .  as for the third      and see ye not yon bonny road   that winds about the fernie brae .   that is the road to fair elfland   where thou and i this night maun gae .      but the bonny road among the ferns isn   t so very bonny after all   o they rade on  and farther on   and they waded rivers abune the knee   and they saw neither sun nor moon   but they heard the roaring of the sea .   it was mirk  mirk night  there was nae starlight   they waded thro    red blude to the knee   for a    the blude that   s shed on earth  runs through the springs o    that countrie .   finally they reach a garden  where the queen gives thomas an apple as his wages  and with it the unwelcome gift of    a tongue that can never lie    .  he eats  one should never eat the food in elfland    and till seven years were gane and past   true thomas on earth was never seen .   it could have been worse .  he was away only seven years  after all  and when he returned he became a famous seer and prophet  thanks to his truth telling tongue .   people who are kidnapped by elves can be rescued  but this needs courage and a cool head  as there won   t be a second chance .  sometimes the rescuer has to go deep into elfland  as tiffany does  .  sometimes  according to our own tales  it is enough to go back a year later to the place where the person was taken     a fairy ring  perhaps  where elves gather to dance  or some crossroads which they pass when they ride out hunting     and wait and watch .  when they appear  their human captive will be seen among them .  the rescuer must drag him or her out of the dance  or off the horse  and hold on tight  no matter what monsters and terrifying illusions the elves call up .  another method  known in scotland  is to throw a dagger over the captive   s head .  some would be rescuers have lost their nerve  but others do not      i remember a folksong about a situation just like this     said magrat .     this girl had her fianc   stolen by the queen of the elves and she didn   t hang around whining  she jolly well got on her horse and went and rescued him .  well  i   m going to do that too .      lords and ladies   the song magrat remembers is known in scotland as the ballad of tam lin .  to save him  his lover janet must pull him off the fairy horse and hold on as he turns into a snake  a deer  and a red hot iron  before returning to human form .  she has the courage  and tam is free and unharmed .   others were not so lucky .  some never escaped  others fell victim to the distortion of time in fairyland .  an irish hero  bran the son of febal  heard an elf woman singing and followed her to her magical island in the western seas .  he remained there for a year  so he thought   but then he and his companions grew homesick .  she told them they were allowed to sail close to the coast of ireland and speak with anyone standing on dry land  but must not step ashore themselves .  and so they anchored in a harbour  and shouted to the men on the beach .  nobody recognized them  though someone remembered that there were old stories about a man called bran who once  long ago  had sailed into the west .  one of bran   s friends jumped into the water and swam ashore  but as soon as he touched land he crumbled to dust .  as for bran  he put out to sea again  and has never been seen since .   and it   s not only bards  seers and heroes     quite ordinary people get taken too .  during a wedding dance on a danish farm the bride went out for a breath of air  and walked as far as a little mound in one of the fields  a mound where elf folk lived .  it had opened up  and elves were dancing there too  and one of them came out and offered her some wine .  she drank .  she joined in the dancing  just one dance  and then remembered her husband and went home .  but the village and the farm looked different  she couldn   t recognize anybody  and nobody recognized her .  there was just one old woman who listened to her story and exclaimed     why  you must be the girl who disappeared a hundred years ago  at my grandfather   s brother   s wedding .     at these words  the bride   s true age came upon her in an instant  and she fell dead .   in tales such as this  told in the european countryside  elves were often lurking in quite normal  familiar places .  just a little mound in a field which you pass every day  nothing particularly eldritch about it  no marker stones to warn you off .  it might of course be an ancient burial mound  like the one on the chalk downs which the wee free men take as their home  but on the other hand it might be a simple natural hillock .  but if you lie down and press your ear to the ground  you hear faint music     then one day it is standing open  and there they are .  they are the hidden people  the underground folk  the good people  the good neighbours .  maybe they   ve come to do you a favour  or to ask for one .  there   s no need to be frightened  is there .  is there .   yet long after the    enlightened    and well educated generations had lost their faith and fear  after the wild elves had been safely reduced to peaseblossoms  an occasional artist recaptured the older image .  the crazed painter richard dadd did so in his sinister picture the fairy feller   s master stroke  which he worked on from      to       while living in an asylum .  so did the composer rutland boughton in the key aria of his opera the immortal hour         based on a poem by fiona mcleod   how beautiful they are   the lordly ones  who dwell in the hills   in the hollow hills .     their limbs are more white  than shafts of moonshine .   they are more fleet  than the north wind .     they laugh and are glad  and are terrible .   when their lances shake and glitter  every green reed quivers .     how beautiful they are   how beautiful   the lordly ones  in the hollow hills .   beautiful  yes .  and terrible .       chapter     the nac mac  feegle      the wee free men  also known as the nac mac feegle  and  sometimes  as    the defendants      are a fiercely independent species  organized into numerous interrelated clans .  outsiders sometimes call them gnomes .  to humans  they are one of the most feared of the fairy races     indeed  they can put trolls to flight  and even nanny ogg   s cat greebo retires under the furniture at the sight of them .  they have shaggy red hair  and are covered all over with blue tattoos and blue paint  in patterns which indicate their clan .  they wear kilts or leather loincloths  use feathers  bones or teeth as decorations  and carry swords almost as large as themselves     though they go in for kicking and head butting too .  they are about six inches tall .   originally  they were denizens of fairyland  and served its queen as her wild champion robbers who went raiding on her behalf into every world there is  but all that is over .  why so  is not certain .  some say they were thrown out of fairyland for being drunk and disorderly  making rude gestures  and using language which would be considered offensive by anybody who could understand it .  they themselves say they left in disgust because the queen was a spiteful tyrant  and ordered them to steal from the poor as well as the rich     but we said it   s no right to steal an ol    lady   s only pig  or the food frae them as dinnae ha    enough to eat .     whatever the truth of it  they are now out and out rebels against any authority whatsoever .  their war cry is    nac mac feegle .  the wee free men .  nae king .  nae quin .  nae laird .  nae master .  we willna be fooled again .      they now live in the human territories of the discworld  but it is hard to say just where they are at any one time .  not only do they stay well hidden  but they often shift from one area to another at high speed  rather like a swarm of locusts  while indulging in their favourite occupations  drinking  stealing  and fighting anything that gets in their way .  they get such pleasure from this that they think they   re dead  and gone to heaven  where there   s lovely sunshine  not like the perpetual half light of fairyland   good hunting  and plenty of monsters to fight   an amazing world like this couldn   t be open to just anybody  they say .  it must be some kind of a heaven or valhalla  where brave warriors go when they are dead .  so  they reason  they have already been alive somewhere else  and then died and were allowed to come  to the discworld  because they have been so good .   a hatful of sky   they don   t mourn much for those that actually get killed while fighting on the disc      oh  they   ve gone back to the land o    the livin    .  it   s nae as good as this one  but they   ll bide fine and come back before too long .  no sense in grievin    .      the wee free men   they do not limit themselves to the discworld  for  as one of their leaders  rob anybody  proudly declares     we   ve been robbin    an    runnin    aroound on all kinds o    worrlds for a lang time .     their running around within a particular world is done normally  with feet  though very  very fast   but their transit from one universe to another is done by magic .  they are unwilling to discuss the process  which they call    the crawstep    .  those who have seen them actually doing it say they simply thrust out one leg straight ahead of them  wiggle the foot  and are gone .   for many centuries  one of their favourite places was an area of the earth called scotland .  they were already there in the time of the ancient romans  who spoke of them as picti     painted men     julius caesar himself records that the tribes of northern britain had    designs carved into their faces by iron     a clear reference to tattooing .  needless to say  they refused to submit to the empire  conducting such a persistent guerrilla war that the romans gave up hope of conquering scotland  and the wee free men remained both wee and free .   later generations of scottish humans were well aware of their presence  and called them pehts  pechs  pechts or picts .  they themselves like the last version best  and have adopted it for their own use  in the form    pictsies    .   be careful  however  never to confuse them with the    pixies    of devon and cornwall  since pixies are an altogether inferior race  whom the feegles despise as    wee southron shites     whatever that means .   several scotsmen have described the pechs  who were somewhat taller than the discworld clans  but in other respects pretty similar .  they were    unco wee bodies  but terrible strang     wrote a certain james knox in       and lived in underground chambers and burial mounds .  indeed  for generations the scots took it for granted that any odd stone structures found underground were    picts    houses    .  robert chambers  in his popular rhymes of scotland         wrote     short wee men they were  wi    red hair  and long arms  and feet sae braid that when it rained they could turn them up owre their heads  and then they served for umbrellas .  the pechs were great builders  they built a    the auld castles in the kintry .      this refers to the brochs  a type of ancient round tower  which scotsmen called    picts    castles    .  why they built them is a mystery  since they never lived in them  perhaps they had struck some bargain with the local human ruler  broch building in exchange for hunting rights  or the like .  it was said they could raise a broch in a single night  quarrying the stones  forming a long chain from the quarry to the chosen site  flinging the stones from hand to hand  and then piling them into massive walls .  this is much the same technique as that of the feegles when fighting people bigger than themselves  they work in groups  running up one another   s backs to form a pyramid  till the top one is high enough to punch the enemy  or  preferably  to head butt him .  once he is down  it is all over bar the kicking .   feegles can easily lift things far heavier than themselves  to steal a sheep or cow  for instance  needs only four of them  as nanny ogg explains      four .  one under each foot .  seen    em do it .  you see a cow in a field  mindin    its own business  next minute the grass is rustlin    .  some little bugger shouts    hup  hup  hup     and the poor beast goes past  voom .  without its legs movin    .  backwards  sometimes .  they   re stronger   n cockroaches .  you step on a pictsy  you   d better be wearin    good thick soles .      lords and ladies   another clan of feegles settled in ireland  where they changed their way of dressing to suit local fashions  but continued to spread undiluted terror .  people there were too scared to use their proper name  so they called them    the good folk     hoping they might take the hint .  it didn   t work .  the poet william allingham records the lament of some irish humans   up the airy mountain   down the rushy glen   we daren   t go a hunting  for fear of little men .   wee folk  good folk   trooping all together   green jacket  red cap   and grey cock   s feather .   on the discworld  feegles initially took up residence on the high moors of uberwald  but some came into conflict with vampires who objected to the presence of any others of the    old races    .  since vampires can fly and feegles can   t  except on large birds   the former had an unfair advantage  and the latter decided to move on .  they arrived in lancre  where  in return for timely help given to king verence  they were granted possession of an island on a lake  with lots of fish around  and the chance of good hunting up the valley  provided they promised not to go cattle raiding .   there are other feegle clans on the downland chalk .  one group lives inside the large burial mound of some ancient king  whose bones don   t bother them at all  and whose gold occasionally comes in useful .  these particular feegles are probably unique in that some of them have actually been seen doing chores for a human girl  tiffany aching  a young witch whom they greatly respect .  in general  however  we must repeat the warning that pictsies are not pixies .  as nanny ogg has remarked  if you leave a saucer of milk out for them  hoping they   ll do the washing up while you   re asleep  all that   ll happen is that the    little buggers will break into your cottage and steal everything in your drinks cabinet    .   very occasionally  for reasons unknown  an individual feegle may leave his clan for a while  to get a taste of city life .  one such is wee mad arthur  rat catcher and pest destroyer in ankh morpork  who plays a crucial role in feet of clay .  the locals refer to him as a    gnome     but his accent  his strength and his fondness for head butting all show he is a true feegle .   no one could clear out rats like wee mad arthur .  old and cunning rats that knew all about traps  deadfalls and poison were helpless in the face of his attack  which was where  in fact  he often attacked .  the last thing they felt was a hand gripping each of their ears  and the last thing they saw was his forehead  approaching at speed .   feet of clay   the same may well be true of the    gnome    buggy swires  a recently recruited corporal in the city watch  where he is the head  and only member  of the airborne section  as mentioned in monstrous regiment .  he patrols the skies by riding on a large female buzzard named morag  who was trained by pictsies and is well worth the crate of whisky she cost the watch .  typical .  shakespeare   s ariel thought himself a fine fellow because he could fly on a bat   s back  but only a large bird of prey will do for a feegle .   the time that the feegles or their ancestors spent in scotland has had a deep influence on them  unless  who knows  it was the other way around  .  besides the tattoos and the kilts  they have developed a taste for strong liquor  and even for haggis .  each clan keeps a bard and musician  called a gonnagle  with a repertoire of heroic lays  laments  and martial music played on the mousepipes .  such performers are invaluable in battle  for terrorizing the enemy .  when tiffany aching and the feegles of the chalk are attacked by a pack of fairy grimhounds  the venerable william the gonnagle takes out his pipes      i shall play     he announced  as the dogs got close enough for tiffany to see the drool     that firrrm favourite     the king underrr waterrr    .      as one pictsie  the nac mac feegles dropped their swords and put their hands over their ears .   william put the mouthpiece to his lips  tapped his foot once or twice  and  as a dog gathered itself to leap at tiffany  began to play      the dog in front of her went cross eyed and  instead of leaping  tumbled forward .   the grimhounds paid no attention to the pictsies .  they howled .  they spun around .  they tried to bite their own tails .  they stumbled  and ran into one another .  the line of panting death broke into dozens of desperate animals  twisting and writhing and trying to escape from their own skins .   the wee free men   what had happened was that william had played    the notes of pain     pitched too high for human ears  but agonizing to dogs .  there is precedent for such skill in our world .  according to ballad singers in shetland  there was once a king orfeo whose wife had been slain by a dart flung by the king of fairies .  so orfeo went into fairyland to win her back .  he entered in at a grey stone  and played his pipes at the fairy court .  first he overwhelmed his hearers with pain  then filled them with joy  and finally played a wild dance tune to make their hearts whole again   an first he played da notes o noy   an dan he played da notes o joy   an dan he played da g  d gabber reel  dat meicht ha made a sick hert hale .   naturally  his wife was given back to him .  and  unlike the ancient greek orpheus  he did not lose her by looking back .   the title of office for a feegle bard     the gonnagle     is a touching tribute to the memory of william mcgonagall  born        a famously excruciating scottish poet .  he had grasped one basic point about poetry  namely that it should rhyme  eventually  but since he had not the faintest conception of rhythm he was capable of stretching a line of verse like chewing gum .  as for his choice of words  the less said the better .  his most celebrated production was a lament over the collapse of a railway bridge .  it is long  so the first and last verses must suffice   beautiful railway bridge of the silv   ry tay .   alas .  i am very sorry to say  that many lives have been taken away  on the last sabbath day of        which will be remembered for a very long time .          oh .  ill fated bridge of the silv   ry tay   i must now conclude my lay  by telling the world fearlessly without the least dismay  that your central girders would not have given way   at least many sensible men do say   had they been supported on each side with buttresses   at least many sensible men confesses   for the stronger we our houses do build   the less chance we have of being killed .   the feegles of the chalk have an aspiring young bard who has mastered this style to perfection  and deploys it when they are under attack from vicious little flying fairies  rather like dragonflies .  standing with one hand pressed to his heart and the other outstretched very theatrically  and rolling his eyes  he utters a long drawn mournful moan  and launches forth .      oooooooooooooiiiiiit is with great lamentation and much worrying dismay     the pictsie groaned     that we rrregard the doleful prospect of fairyland in considerrrable decay         in the air  the flying creatures stopped attacking and began to panic .  some of them flew into one another .      with quite a large number of drrrrrreadful incidents happening everrry day .  including  i am sorrrry to say  an aerial attack by the otherwise quite attractive fey         the flyers screeched .  some crashed into the snow  but the ones still capable of flight swarmed off amongst the trees .      witnessed by all of us at this time  and celebrated in this hasty rhyme     he shouted after them .   and they were gone .   the old bard congratulates the young one      that  lad     he said proudly     was some of the worst poetry i have heard for a long time .  it was offensive to the ear and a torrrture to the soul .  the last couple of lines need some work but ye has the groanin    off fiiine .  a    in a     a verrry commendable effort .  we   ll make a gonnagle out o    ye yet .      the wee free men   the speech of the feegles is markedly scottish  to the point that  though it is not technically a foreign language  unlike  for example  that of dwarfs   most people in lancre and ankh morpork find it very hard to follow .  yet it   s a good language  as nanny ogg says     with a hint of heather and midden in it    .  most of it is a form of lowlands scots peppered with glasgow slang  but there are several words adopted from gaelic  the celtic language of the highlands and isles  one of which is of considerable folkloric significance .  in its original tongue it is cailleach  pronounced approximately    kall yack    and meaning    old woman  hag    .  like    hag     it often implies magical power  and so can mean    witch    .  in the feegle language it has developed two quite different forms .  the first  used light heartedly in ordinary speech  is    callyake    .  for example  a feegle who had been startled by greebo shouted at nanny ogg     ach  hins tak yer scaggie  yer dank owd callyake .      which appears to mean     oh  devil take your moggy  you daft old woman .     but the second form     kelda     is a title to be used with the deepest respect .   feegles are matriarchal .  each community is ruled by a kelda  who has come from some different clan when young  to choose one of them as her husband and be their queen and their wise woman for the rest of her life .  like a queen bee  she bears an incredible number of offspring  but in her case  unlike the bee   s  all but one or two of them are male .  this means that all the men of the clan are either her sons or her husband   s brothers  apart from a few of her own brothers who came with her as bodyguards  and probably the gonnagle  since these travel from clan to clan .  keldas are rather taller than the male feegles  and very  very fat  looking just like the little figurines of goddesses carved on earth way back in the times of ice and mammoths .  their word is law  as truly as if they were indeed goddesses .  as for the title itself  though centuries of use have worn it down  its origins can still be guessed .  it comes from cailleach dubh     the black hag     a supernatural figure in scottish and irish tradition who shapes the landscape  rules the seasons  protects wild animals  and confers power on favoured humans .  the cailleach dubh was a true mother goddess  and the language of the feegles honours her memory .   and what of their own name .  here again we see the influence of the scottish and irish lore they picked up during their stay on the earth  or vice versa  .     mac feegle    means    sons of feegle     and    feegle    is clearly a variation of    fingal     the eighteenth century scottish name for a great hunter and warrior hero in celtic tradition .  tales about him under his older name of finn or fionn mac cumhaill have been popular for over twelve hundred years in ireland  and almost equally long in scotland  where he is called finn maccool .  he was the chieftain of the fianna  a band of wild young men who lived by hunting deer and wild boar  fighting  cattle raiding and robbing .  at times they might take service under some king and fight in his wars  at other times they chose an independent life .  all were fearless in confronting any enemy  natural or supernatural .  fionn himself more than once entered some sinister region of the otherworld and had to fight his way out against great odds .  it is very understandable that the race now known as the nac mac feegle should wish to take his name .       chapter     trolls      trolls are a unique life form because their    flesh    is composed of silicon in various complex combinations .  at least  so it is said .  they look rocky .  lichen grows on their heads .  they have carbon as well as silicon in their make up     in their teeth  which are of diamond     and from time to time  at intervals of many centuries  there appears a king of trolls who is pure diamond .  in one sense  therefore  trolls belong in the mineral kingdom  and exposure to strong sunlight often puts them into a fully stony state until nightfall     although in truth it is heat rather than light that slows down their brains .   at the same time  they do have most of the attributes of animal life  they eat and drink  mineral and chemical substances only   walk and talk  are male or female  make love and have children .  their given names are always related to geology     mica  bluejohn  flint  morraine  or brick  for one born in the city  .  they can be killed by force  but do not  as far as is known  ever die a natural death .  instead  after several centuries of active life  a troll withdraws to some remote mountain area and settles down in one spot among the rocks to think long  slow thoughts about nothing in particular .  gradually he becomes more and more rock like  till he is to all intents and purposes simply a landscape feature .   many have come down from the ramtop mountains  which for most of them is their native region  and have come looking for work in towns and cities .  being immensely strong and intimidating  they are welcome wherever a hired fist is needed     as private bodyguards  barmen  bouncers or splatters  who carry out the same duties  but with messier results  .  one  who has adopted the human name of big jim beef  is employed as a customs officer and frontier guard for the kingdom of lancre  when not making checks on travellers  he lives under the troll bridge .  it is not a good idea to mention billygoats in his hearing .  unfortunately  some of the young city dwelling trolls give themselves unpleasantly thuggish airs  they go in for elaborate body carving and real skull pendants  and become addicted to various brain rotting substances  and practically anything can slow down a troll   s brain  .   the best known troll is detritus  who was recruited into the ankh morpork city watch by captain vimes  and has proved a most keen and loyal sergeant  if a little slow on the uptake .  trolls are not in fact stupid  despite what most people think  but their brains function properly only at low temperatures  because of the silicon   so the warm climate of the valleys and plains makes them very sluggish  especially in the daytime .  detritus now gets some help from a small fan attached to his helmet  but it was only when he was accidentally shut in the refrigerated pork futures warehouse that his true intelligence was revealed     as he gradually froze  he scratched calculations worthy of einstein all over the iced up walls .  there are hints that trolls have age old cultural traditions which no outsider knows anything about  there is talk of their history chants and stone music  for instance  and of their long dance .  they think of time in a curious though logical way  the future  they say  must be behind you  since you can   t see it  but the past  which you can see in your memory  must be ahead .   there is an age old feud between trolls and dwarfs  possibly arising from the fact that both races live in the same mountain regions  and that dwarfs spend their lives mining and tunnelling through rock     something which trolls find it upsetting to think about .  it is even rumoured that dwarfs have occasionally tunnelled into the underside of a particularly stony and immobile troll .  be that as it may  the feud led to the disastrous battle of koom valley  said to be the only occasion in military history where each army ambushed the other .  it was long ago and far away  but has never been forgotten .  koom valley has become a myth  a state of mind .   where any dwarf fought any troll  there was koom valley .  even if it was a punch up in a pub  it was koom valley .  it was part of the mythology of both races  a rallying cry  the ancestral reason why you couldn   t trust those short  bearded   big  rocky bastards .   thud .    and yet     and yet     if other myths can be trusted  the first man  the first dwarf and the first troll all originated in a single egg of stone  a geode  more than         years ago  and are therefore  in some sense  brothers .  this myth was mentioned above  in the section on dwarfs .  its implications  together with the story of what really happened in koom valley  are explored in thud .  .   trolls also have a dislike of druids  who can be found in the small  rainy  mountainous kingdom of llamedos .  there is no mystery about the reason  for the druids of the disc went around erecting huge stone circles in much the same way as  some folk used to say  british druids did at stonehenge .  regrettable errors occurred   any sapient species which spends a lot of time in a stationary  rock like pose objects to any other species which drags it sixty miles on rollers and buries it up to its knees in a circle .  it tends to feel it has cause for disgruntlement .   soul music   even the dragging on rollers is not the worst of it .  it is said  as recorded in the light fantastic  that one particularly skilled group of druids found a way to quarry huge slabs of high quality stone and fly them hundreds of miles along ley lines to the snowy vortex plain  where they set them up as an immense construction of concentric circles  towering trilithons  and mystic avenues  to be a great computer of the skies .  it proved hopelessly inaccurate .  this act of wanton cruelty to minerals made trolls still more bitter towards druids .   on earth  there are two quite different races claiming the name    troll    .  one lot is to be found in denmark  these are smallish mischievous goblins with red hair  living inside mounds and hillocks near farmland .  they can be disregarded here since  apart from the name  they have nothing in common with discworld trolls  and seem akin to feegles .   the other ones  however     the huge mountain trolls who live in iceland and norway     are remarkably like those of the discworld  but wilder and more hostile to human beings .  they are thought to be the direct descendants of the dangerous giants of scandinavian myth  but differ from them in being generally solitary creatures .  they are immensely old and strong  and probably not as stupid as humans say they are .  they have had a considerable impact on the landscape     quite literally so  since they often quarrel and hurl huge boulders at one another  and never clear the pieces away afterwards .  they also send avalanches and rock falls crashing down on anybody who annoys them by shouting among the mountains .  many of them object to humans building churches in their district  partly because they dislike christianity itself  and partly because they hate the noise of bells .  the troll   s solution is always the same  heave a large rock at it .  he always misses .  at least  so the stories say  but can we be sure that there are no squashed churches under any of the rocks that litter the landscape .  has anyone checked .   there was once a norwegian troll who tried a different plan .  hearing that st olaf was trying to build himself a church at trondheim  he volunteered his services as a stonemason .  but this was in fact a plot to kill olaf .     i   ll build your church for you     said the troll     but i   ll take the sun and the moon and the heart out of your breast as my fee     unless you can guess my name before the last stone is in place .     the troll turned out to be not only extremely strong but also a remarkably quick worker  and in no time the walls were done  and the tower was rising fast .  but then one night as the saint wandered gloomily along the mountain paths  he heard the voice of a she troll from inside the rocks  as she sang her little ones to sleep     hushabye  hushabye  your daddy finn will soon be home  and he   ll bring you the sun and the moon to play with  and the priest   s heart too .     next morning st olaf strolled up to the church  just as the troll was setting the last course of stones on the tower .     splendid work  finn     said olaf .  now  it is one of the basic rules of folklore that to know a magical creature   s name gives you the power to destroy him     and another  that somehow or other the secret is sure to get out .  so the troll crashed down dead  but trondheim cathedral is still there .   the physiology of earth   s mountain trolls must be based on silicon  like that of their discworld counterparts  judging by the way they all too easily turn into large boulders  which in their case are permanent .  one variety  the icelandic night troll  hides in caves all day and only comes out at night  because any ray of direct sunlight petrifies it at once .  there are several spectacularly tall rocks offshore which are said to be trolls caught unawares by the sunrise while wading out to sea .   naturally  the best defence against a night troll is to keep it talking till the sun comes up .  there was once an icelandic girl who had been left at home on christmas eve  to look after her baby brother while everyone else went to church .  in the middle of the night she heard a deep voice outside the window  serenading her .   fair seems your hand to me   hard and rough mine must be   dilly dilly do .   but she did not look round .  instead  she sang to the baby in the cradle   dirt it did never sweep   sleep  little kari  sleep   lully lully lo .   when the troll praised her eyes and her feet  she told the baby that she had never looked on anything evil  never trodden on dirt .  and so it went on all night  till dawn broke and the girl sang in triumph   stand there and turn to stone   so you   ll do harm to none   lully lully lo .   and when the family came home from church  they found a huge boulder on the path between the farm buildings  which had certainly not been there the night before .   as this tale shows  one difference between the way trolls evolved on earth and in the discworld is that the earth ones can get amorous towards humans  an idea which would never enter the head of a troll on the disc .  icelandic she trolls sometimes kidnap a handsome young man to be their mate  or lure him up into their caves by magic chants .  there  they do all they can to seduce him  and to persuade him to eat trolls    food  they rub him with strange ointments  stretch his limbs  and bellow into his ear  to make a troll of him .  it is said that men who do not manage to escape gradually do turn into trolls themselves .  in the norwegian legend of peer gynt  the king of the mountain wanted peer to marry his daughter  who was apparently quite good looking  whereas it is unlikely that a female discworld troll would ever appeal to a male human  no matter how cheap the beer and however bad the club lighting .   earthly trolls can  in fact  look like humans and humans can become trolls  and it has been suggested that trolls have their origins in    folk memories    of earlier races  even neanderthals  who were pushed to the edges of the habitable world by the stumbling advance of civilization  and then into myth and story .  this attractive and beguiling idea is very familiar to folklorists as an explanation for    fairy    folk of any sort  who look outlandish and have strange powers   and so we will back tactfully away and leave it to the anthropologists .   it   s worth adding that discworld trolls cannot digest human beings  though they have been known to try   whereas those of earth find them both tasty and wholesome .  in norway  men have heard she trolls bellowing to one another among the crags  discussing their cooking     sister  can i borrow your big pot .            what for .            here   s jon the woodcutter coming up this way  i want to make a stew of him .            all right  sister .  when you skim the broth  save some of the fat for me .     somehow  bellowing across the landscape that you are waiting in ambush seems so very troll .   trolls were still being talked about in iceland as late as the nineteenth century .  there were certain cliffs where seabirds nested  and it was said that when men went over the edge on ropes to gather eggs or to catch the birds themselves for food  great  grey  shaggy hands carrying very sharp knives would reach out from caves and cut the ropes  and so kill the men who hung there .  so then some priest would be sent for to drive the trolls out by going down on a rope and blessing the cliff  while men on the cliff top sang psalms as loud as they could .  the really intelligent priests would bring a hammer  and chip away the sharp ridges on the cliff face as they blessed it     after which  the ropes hardly ever frayed and broke .  but there remain a few cliffs which were never blessed  and where egg gatherers never go  however many birds there may be .  this is because once  when a bishop had gone down on a rope and was working his way along the cliff face  a voice from inside the rocks called out     don   t bless anything more .  the wicked do have to have somewhere to live .     and the bishop  being a fair minded man  left this place unblessed .       gargoyles   although gargoyles are very different from a standard troll in size  appearance  habitat and habits  they are in fact a subspecies which has evolved to fit an urban environment .  they are  if anything  even more stony  they squat motionless on some rooftop  which they are very reluctant to leave .  on the other hand  their digestive system is quite different from that of trolls  they are carnivores  preying on pigeons .  their main occupation is absorbing rainwater from the gutters and ejecting it vigorously  through their gaping jaws  on to the heads of pedestrians below .  when they do move  it is in slow  grinding jerks  their mouths are permanently fixed open  making it hard to understand their speech .  but their endless patience and keen eyesight make them valuable members of the watch in ankh morpork  somewhat like cctv cameras in a modern city on earth .   gargoyles are also a familiar sight on the roofs of earth   s medieval churches and castles  where they got their name .  it suits them well  for they gurgle  gargle and glug in their gullets  and most of them goggle too .  but there are few  if any  stories about them  probably because they are too high up for anyone to see them properly .       sea trolls   it should be mentioned that    trolls    of one sort or another apparently exist elsewhere in the multiverse .  the wizard rincewind  in one of his early adventures described in the colour of magic  was almost swept over the edge of the disc  where an endless cascade of ocean pours away into space .  instead  he crashed into the circumfence     a single rope  suspended a few feet above the water from occasional wooden posts  and extending for tens of thousands of miles round the rim of the disc .  this particular section was patrolled by a sea troll  a creature of a pleasantly translucent blue colour  apparently composed of sea water and very little else .  as for size  he gradually swelled as the hours went by  then just as gradually shrank  owing to the strength of the discworld moon  he was suffering from chronic tides .   the sea troll was not native to the discworld .  he came from a different disc  quite a small one  mostly blue   where the seafolk lived in thriving civilized communities on its three oceans .  unfortunately  he had been blown over the edge in a great storm  fell through outer space  which froze him solid   and eventually landed on the disc .  curiously  the name of his own world is bathys  which on earth is greek for    ocean depths     and the troll   s personal name is tethis  remarkably close to that of the ancient greek sea nymph thetis .   interestingly  the norwegian artist theodor kittelsen  who painted a large number of what we now call fantasy paintings  did several based on trolls  including  in       a fearsome sea troll .  alas  it is not transparent .       chapter     other significant  races      vampires   the children of the night are an increasing presence in ankh morpork these days  thanks to the efforts of the uberwald league of temperance .  sensible vampires have realized that a diet of black pudding and blood sausage and a stake in a growing economy is much to be preferred to just a stake .  however  it was not always thus  the vampire     or at least the image of the vampire     has evolved quite markedly over the centuries .   do vampires suck blood .  silly question  nowadays .  if there   s one thing everybody knows about vampires  it   s that they suck your blood  leaving you with two neat puncture marks at the base of your neck .  of course  what everyone knows is wrong  and nearly everyone knows it .  at least  we think so  the trouble with what everyone knows is that you can never be sure that everyone knows it .  but surely everyone knows that vampires  like werewolves  have stepped out of folklore and into popular culture .  the movies  of course  were the major influence  in the     s and   s a generation grew up  thanks to hammer films  knowing that female vampires always wore underwired nightgowns  and male ones a high collared black cloak with a red satin lining .    but it was not always so .  in the folklore of the balkans  greece  and central europe a vampire  also known as a nosferatu  a vrykolakas  or a nachzehrer  was simply an undead revenant     a corpse that gets out of its grave and wanders about .  some sucked blood  others didn   t .  instead  they might breathe on you and give you plague  cholera or consumption  or sit on your chest and give you nightmares  or strangle you  or beat you black and blue  or simply get into your house and smash the furniture .  subtle and elegant they were not .  their close relative  the draug of medieval iceland  would break every bone of your body  and of your cattle too .   early european vampires were not aristocrats  but village folk .  they did not look like noble gentlemen in black cloaks  or luscious women in low cut ball gowns .  they looked like what they were  corpses .  to be precise  corpses that have been buried long enough to begin decaying  but not long enough to turn into nice clean skeletons .  when terrified locals dug into the grave of a suspected vampire to destroy him  they would find a body bloated with gases  and therefore plumper and bigger than when alive  the skin taut  the blood no longer congealed  but runny  and often oozing from the mouth or nose  the face puffy and red  or in some cases dusky .  if they jabbed a stake or spade into it  nasty reddish liquids gushed out .  they might even hear a sort of grunt or squawk as the blow forced the gases out through the windpipe .  who could doubt that this was an undead .   such a corpse must then be destroyed by burning .  if this is too difficult  dead bodies take a lot of burning   at least it can be mutilated or pinned down in some way  so that it will never walk again .  which is where staking comes in  or beheading  or tearing the heart out .   vampires as the earth knows them now are rather different .  they were created by english writers in the romantic and victorian periods  and perfected by that most powerful myth making medium  the cinema .  the first was lord ruthven in john polidori   s story    the vampyre            an evil blood sucking deathless aristocrat .  then in      came joseph sheridan le fanu   s story about the beautiful young carmilla  who  like salacia in thud .    assumed she could evade discovery by making anagrams of her name     millarca  mircalla .  she was gentler than lord ruthven  but she too brought death  she was eventually found in a blood filled coffin  staked  and decapitated .   and then  in       bram stoker   s dracula appeared  presenting the sinister but elegantly seductive count  his female victims  and three erotic female vampires .  stoker stole the count   s name from the real life vlad dracul  also known as vlad tepes the impaler  one of the great warrior princes of romanian history  who in his native country is respectfully remembered as a hero  and is never  never thought of as a vampire .  stoker also adopted many details from east european folklore .  for over a hundred years now  the dracula figure and its variants have been fixed in modern popular mythology     fangs  swirling black cloaks with red linings  brocaded waistcoats  a haughty manner  and an escort of bats  rats  and wolves .   on discworld  the count de magpyr is a magnificent example of the aristocratic vampire  sprung from an ancient family whose motto is carpe jugulum     go for the jugular    .  his son vlad is very much the dandy  his daughter lacrimosa is a thin girl in a white dress  with very long black hair and far too much eye make up .  their home is a castle on a crag in uberwald  complete with sinister ancestral portraits .  one of these shows aunt carmilla  a far more savage figure than le fanu   s heroine of the same name  she used to bathe in the blood of up to two hundred virgins at a time  just as the real life hungarian countess elizabeth bathory was rumoured to do .  it was a good cosmetic .  there is also the portrait of the old count de magpyr  father of the present one  and remembered by some as    old red eyes       a bald head .  dark rimmed  staring eyes .  two teeth like needles  two ears like batwings  fingernails that hadn   t been trimmed for years      that   s something known on this world too .  that   s nosferatu  perhaps the most terrifying vampire in the history of the cinema  as created in      .   but the current count de magpyr is adapting to modern times .  to the fury of his servant igor  whose attitude can be described as more gothic than thou  he and his family wear full evening dress in the evenings only  not all the time  as his father the old count did  the rest of the time  it   s fancy waistcoats for the men and lacy skirts for the women .  in the castle  squeaky door hinges must now be oiled  guttering candles removed  spiders chased out of the dungeons .  there must be no black plumes on the coach or its horses     coaches looking like hearses are not at all cool .   the count   s aim is to train his family  little by little  to overcome all the taboos which limit a vampire   s freedom  and which are only cultural conditioning     a conditioning which  strangely  seems to be much the same on the discworld and the earth .  he believes that with a little effort and practice  modern vampires could and should learn to drink     wine  go out in sunlight  cross running water  eat garlic flavoured canap  s  bear the touch of holy water  and look at any sacred symbol without wincing .  by and large  the plan seems to be succeeding .  but they still can   t enter a house unless invited .   as was noted above  quite a number of discworld vampires hope to become integrated into society as a whole  and so have joined the uberwald league of temperance  members have forsworn the drinking of human blood     or  as they prefer to call it     the b word    .  they carry their badge  a small twist of shiny black ribbon  and gather regularly in mutual support groups for a nice singsong with cocoa and a bun .  one black ribboner is otto chriek  a brilliant iconographer on the staff of the ankh morpork times .  he dresses as the cinematic stereotype requires  and speaks  when he wants to  with a thick uberwald accent     deliberately so  to make people laugh .  that way  no one fears him  or hates him .  since otto personally has not overcome his hereditary allergy to strong light  he suffers intensely whenever he has to use a flash  sometimes even crumbling to dust .  he carries a card for such emergencies   do not be alarmed .  the former bearer of this card has suffered a minor accident .  you vill need a drop of blood from any species  and a dustpan and brush .   the truth   if some kind person dribbles a drop or two from  say  a piece of raw steak on to the dust  it mushrooms up into the air  becomes a mass of coloured flecks  and once again is otto chriek .   from the information so far available  it looks as if all discworld vampires become such either by their genetics  or by being bitten .  admittedly  one may suspect that the genes of the late count notfaroutoe were pretty reluctant to be activated in the unlikely dna of his only remaining relative  his nephew arthur winkings  who was a coming man in the wholesale fruit and vegetable business .  and arthur was even more reluctant to receive them  as we learn in reaper man .  but that   s how it goes     if you inherit the title and the estates  you get the coffin and the batwings too .  genetics  or a bite .  take your choice .   on the earth  this is true in the literary and cinematic mythology  but in european folklore there are plenty of other reasons why the dead become vampires .  they may have lived an evil life  committed suicide  or practised black magic  they may have been conceived in sacrilege  their parents having had sex on a holy day  they may have been born with teeth  or a tail  or two hearts   or a caul .  in romania  anyone with red hair and blue eyes is regarded as a potential vampire .  in many parts of europe  a corpse will become a revenant if it is left unburied  or buried secretly without proper rites .  if it is laid out at home  it should be in a lighted room  and there should always be somebody keeping watch  no dog or cat should be allowed to jump on to or over it .  break any of these rules  and you will soon have a vampire in the village .   and when you do  what do you do about it .  as the quite reverend oats  self appointed omnian missionary to lancre  explained to nanny ogg      it depends exactly where they   re from  i remember .  uberwald is a very big place .  er  cutting off the head and staking them in the heart is generally efficacious     in splintz they die if you put a coin in their mouth and cut their head off     in klotz they die if you stick a lemon in their mouth     after you cut their head off .  i believe that in glitz you have to fill their mouth with salt  hammer a carrot into both ears  and then cut off their head     and in the valley of the ah they believe it   s best to cut off the head and boil it in vinegar     but in kashncari they say you should cut off their toes and drive a nail through their neck .         and cut their head off .         apparently you don   t have to .      carpe jugulum   decapitation was the folk method in parts of europe too  especially among germans and western slavs  with the addition that the severed head must be placed between the legs of the corpse  behind its buttocks  or below its feet     so that it couldn   t find it and put it back on .  the southern slavs preferred staking the corpse  greeks cremated it  often cutting the heart out first  russians would throw it into a lake or river .  danes staked revenants  medieval icelanders beheaded and or burned them .   there was no need to stick to one method at a time .  in germany  one woman who    walked    was dug up  decapitated  and then reburied at a crossroads with her mouth full of poppy seeds .  another corpse was taken to a border between two districts  cut open  staked through the heart  and beheaded  a stone was put in the mouth  and both body and head were left lying there  for animals to eat .   of course  it was best if you could stop the corpse from leaving its grave at all  by giving it something to do which would keep it there .  for example  oats told nanny ogg  you can defeat vampires by stealing their sock      they   re pathologically meticulous  you see .  some of the gypsy tribes in borogravia say that if you steal their sock and hide it somewhere they   ll spend the rest of eternity looking for it .  they can   t abide things to be out of place or missing     they say in some villages that you can even slow them down by throwing poppyseed at them .  then they   ll have a terrible urge to count every seed .  vampires are very anal retentive  you see .      paul barber  a notable american authority on vampires  has similarly stressed their    limited  rigid  and compulsive nature    .  this makes it easier to stop them from coming home after burial .  for instance  they have to re enter the house in the same way they left it  so if you lift the coffin out through a window or a hole in the wall  instead of using the door  and then shut the window or refill the hole  they   ll never find the way back .  if you bury them face down  when they try to dig themselves out they   ll just go down deeper and deeper .  if you put seeds or sand in a vampire   s mouth or coffin  or on the path to the graveyard  this activates his compulsions     he must collect the grains one at a time  and often only one grain per year .  this so engages his attention that he is obliged to drop all other pursuits .     nets and knitted stockings in the coffin are just as good  he has to unpick them  one knot or stitch per year .  as for putting coins  pebbles  dirt or food in the corpse   s mouth  that gives him something satisfying to chew on .   so a girl setting out to be a vampire slayer in uberwald needs a big sack  to be ready for all possibilities .  she must carry a stake and mallet  a spade  and a strong knife  nets  seeds  coins  sand  salt  stones  lemons  garlic  assorted vegetables  thorns and needles to stick in the vampire   s feet to stop him walking  and in his tongue to stop him sucking  a flask of holy water and the sacred symbols of all major gods .   but  as nanny ogg could tell her  there is a better way .  she could simply borrow greebo the cat  and wait till a very large red eyed bat comes by .  for that would be a flabberghast     which is foreign for bat     nanny ogg explains   and a flabberghast is a shape shifted vampire .  and it would very soon learn the useful truth set down in witches abroad   vampires have risen from the dead  the grave and the crypt  but have never managed it from the cat .       banshees   these unpleasant  and mercifully rare  creatures  native to the uberwald mountains  are the only humanoid species on the discworld that has evolved wings  apart from certain small elves  vampires who fly  such as the count de magpyr and his family  simply do so by a form of levitation .  however  there may possibly be some remote genetic connection between the two races  since a banshee has two hearts  which  according to some folk traditions  is a characteristic of vampires .  no research has been done on this topic  nor is likely to be .   a discworld banshee is about the same size as a man  but far more lightly built  consisting almost entirely of thin bones and very strong sinews  several rows of pointy teeth  and huge claws .  at first glance  you would think it is wearing a black leather cloak .  this  as you will soon discover  is its wings .  and then there is its scream .   it was harsh  guttural  it was malice and hunger given a voice .  small huddling shrew like creatures had once heard sounds like that  circling over the swamps .   going postal   it is well known that to hear the banshee   s scream means that you are going to die .  with the more civilized banshees  all this means is that they have taken on the job of a death omen  and will sit screeching on your roof to make sure you get plenty of warning that death is on his way .  indeed  in ankh morpork there is one solitary and gloomy banshee named ixolite who suffers from a speech impediment and just writes ooooeeeeooooeeeeee on a scrap of paper and slips it under your door .  but the wild banshees  such as the mr gryle described in going postal  do the whole job themselves .  one minute you hear the scream  next minute there   s a swoop and a pounce and some quite remarkable claws .   over in our own parallel universe  banshees are only to be found in one particular habitat  namely ireland .  the name  if not the species  must have originated there  since bean s   makes good sense in irish  though it is mere gibberish in discworld languages .  it means    woman of the otherworld        for in ireland the creature is invariably female .  her mission is to announce the imminent death of someone in one of the old aristocratic irish families  by screaming and wailing near their homes .  she is more often heard than seen  but when she does let herself be glimpsed it is as an old woman with long  loose white hair which she combs as she wails .  sometimes she is seen crouching by a river  washing a winding sheet .  in some parts of the country she is also known as the badhbh chaointe  pronounced    boheenta    and meaning    the keening scaldcrow     though she does not nowadays actually appear in crow shape .   though the irish banshee is no predator  it is best to be wary of offending her .  there was once a man who saw a banshee combing her hair on the riverbank at twilight  crept up behind her  and snatched her comb .  he ran home with it .  that night there were terrifying shrieks all around his house  and something was hammering on his window .  so he opened the window just a little way and pushed the comb out  holding it in the big iron tongs from the fireplace .  and it was well for him that he did so rather than putting his hand out  for the thing that grabbed the comb grabbed the tongs too and threw them to the ground  all bent and twisted .  such is a banshee   s strength .       golems   in all societies there is a good deal of boring  dirty  heavy work which nobody really wants to do  whatever the pay .  so what could be better than to find a race of strong  tireless  silent workers to take on these jobs .  especially if they don   t need paying .   the historical solution  in ankh morpork  is the golems     large  powerful creatures made of baked clay  roughly humanoid in form but seven or eight foot tall .  they need no food or sleep  they can work underwater  or in extremes of heat or cold  or in total darkness  they cannot feel pain or boredom .  they can repair themselves  and last for centuries .  their triangular eyes have the faint  dark red glow of a banked fire  and on the rare occasions when they open their mouths you get a brief glimpse of an inferno .  according to the original specifications they cannot speak  though they can write  this  however  was changed at the insistence of commander vimes  after the events recounted in feet of clay .   a golem   s head is hollow  and flips open when you press a line across the forehead  inside is a yellowing scroll bearing words in cenotine  an ancient sacred script  the language of a dead religion .  this has to have been written by a priest .  take out the scroll  and the light in the golem   s eyes goes out  and its life  if it can be called life  ceases .  put it back  and it comes    alive    again .  when the golem dorfl is asked to explain itself  it writes on a slate   i am a golem .  i was made of clay .  my life is the words .  by means of words of purpose in my head i acquire life .  my life is to work .  i obey all commands .  i take no rest     golem must work .  golem must have a master .   feet of clay   the written commands in a golem   s head are those which the cenotine god is said to have given to the first people on earth  after he had baked them out of clay .     thou shalt labour fruitfully all the days of your life    is one of them  and another is    thou shalt not kill     and a third    thou shalt be humble    .   not surprisingly  factory owners are prepared to pay a good price for golems .  there are stories that sometimes one of them over does things  being too stupid to stop work unless actually ordered to  so your house gets flooded as it brings pail after pail from the well .  this  however  always seems to have happened somewhere else  some good while ago  and can be disregarded .  one minor snag is that just occasionally they down tools and go off for a few hours  leaving a message that today is for them a holy day .  apart from that  they are perfect machines for work .   few in ankh morpork remember who first made a golem  or why  or how .  recent archaeological discoveries  described in making money  indicate that particularly fine specimens existed in the ancient city of um  back in the clay age some sixty thousand years ago .  when rincewind visited the counterweight continent  see interesting times  he accidentally roused a vast red army of seven thousand terracotta golems  which were standing guard inside the burial mound of some very ancient emperor     but again  nothing is known of their making .  to learn more  one must turn to the more recent traditions of jewish communities in central and eastern europe .  for there  by one of those remarkable freaks of cosmic resonance  the story of the making of the golem first appeared in fifteenth century germany  and by the seventeenth century had become famous .   in hebrew  the word    golem    means an unshaped lump of matter  an imperfect or incomplete creation .  according to legend  various extremely learned and pious rabbis knew how to create a humanoid being out of clay  thanks to the magical power of holy words and letters  especially the four letters forming the name of god .  the act echoed that of god himself in forming adam from the dust of the earth  and for that reason most rabbis never put their knowledge into practice  for fear of blasphemy .  but a few did  to get themselves a servant  or to get help in times of great danger .   the fullest and most famous story is about judah loew ben bazalel  chief rabbi of prague towards the end of the sixteenth century .  in      the jews of prague were under attack from anti semitic fanatics  and rabbi loew received a divine message telling him to create a golem for their protection .  four elements would be required  earth  fire  water and air .  he went with two disciples to the bank of the river vltva  and moulded a human form of clay .  then one disciple danced round it seven times from right to left  saying certain words which invoked the element of fire  causing it to glow like red hot metal .  the other disciple danced round it seven times from left to right  saying words to invoke the element of water  and by the time he had finished steam was rising  and the golem   s hair and nails had begun to grow .  finally rabbi loew himself danced round seven times  breathed air into the golem   s nostrils  and put a parchment with a word on it into its mouth     or  some say  wrote a word upon its brow .   then the golem came to life and stood up  though it lacked the power of speech .  rabbi loew said     your mission is to walk the streets of prague and keep my people safe from persecution .  you will obey my commands  and go wherever i send you     into fire  into water  or down to the floor of the sea .      what was the word that gave a golem life .  some say it was schem  which means    name     and refers to the tetragrammaton jhvh  the never to be spoken holy name of god .  others say it was emeth     truth     and that one could destroy the golem by rubbing out the first letter  leaving meth  which means    death    .  for eventually  all legends agree  something will go wrong  and the golem will have to be    killed    .  perhaps it has grown so big and powerful that its maker can no longer control it .  or perhaps he has forgotten to give it its orders for the day  and it has gone berserk through having nothing to do  and is about to devastate the city .   in prague  rabbi loew kept his golem till       but then  knowing the danger of persecution had passed  he and his disciples reversed their rituals  reducing it to a mere mass of clay .  this they sealed up in the attic of the synagogue  and rabbi loew ordered that nobody was ever to set foot in that attic again .  and nobody ever has .   such was the sad destiny of earth   s golems .  in the discworld  thanks to the ferocious sense of justice of commander vimes and the pragmatism of lord vetinari  golems are now in process of buying their freedom from their masters  and have acquired speech and independence of thought .  the words in their heads are those they have chosen themselves .  still untiring and sternly moral  some have found a role as law enforcers  one instance of this is described in going postal  .  naturally  this requires a certain modification of one of the basic laws of golems  which now runs     you shall not harm a human being  or allow a human being to come to harm     unless ordered to do so by a properly constituted authority .     as we have said  lord vetinari is a pragmatic ruler .  that is not the same as nice .       werewolves   wherever wolves are found in the multiverse  there are werewolves too  yet the condition of werewolfery  or lycanthropy  as those of more scientific bent prefer to call it  remains mysterious .  what can be the cause .  is it voluntary or involuntary .  is it a magical power  or a form of madness .  are werewolves heroes  victims  or criminals .   the clash of theories is obvious on earth .  several ancient greek writers blamed religious cannibalism  allegedly practised in honour of lycean  i . e .     wolfish     zeus in the wild hilly region of arcadia .  according to pausanias  a greek geographer writing in ad      the first werewolf was a certain king lycaon of arcadia  whose very name means    wolf    .   lycaon brought a human baby to the altar of lycean zeus and sacrificed it and poured out the blood upon the altar  and they say that immediately after the sacrifice he was turned into a wolf .  for my own part i believe the tale  it has been handed down among the arcadians from antiquity  and probability is in its favour .  they say that from the time of lycaon downwards one man has always been turned into a wolf at the festival of lycean zeus  but that the transformation is not for life  for if while he is a wolf he abstains from human flesh  in the ninth year afterwards he changes back into a man  but if he has tasted human flesh he remains a beast for ever .   about a hundred years earlier  the roman author petronius had included a werewolf story  more or less as a joke  in his comic novel satyricon .  to him  it was simply magical shape shifting  a young soldier deliberately turned into a wolf by taking off his clothes in a graveyard by moonlight and pissing round them  and went off to kill cattle and sheep     but then  like many shape shifters before and since  he was wounded while in animal form  and so his secret was discovered .   in later european folklore  all sorts of explanations were suggested .  some said it was a magic art of warriors  who went into battle as wolves by wearing a wolf   s pelt .  others  that it was due to a spell which a witch could lay on a man by striking him with a wolfskin glove .  others  that it came from accidentally eating a particular magic plant  or bathing in a particular lake .  others  that it was a curse that a child was born with  as a punishment because his parents conceived him on a holy day when sex was not allowed   or because his mother used magic to avoid a painful childbirth .  others  that the man had made a deliberate pact with the devil  and went about murdering people while in his wolf form .  in more recent centuries  it has been generally assumed that lycanthropy was a madman   s delusion .  attitudes varied according to the theories     wolf warriors were admired as heroes  the victims of spells and curses were to be pitied as well as feared  the lunatics were to be locked up  but murderous satanist werewolves were to be tried and hanged .   there are no such crazy notions on the discworld .  there  everybody knows that being a werewolf is just something that you   re born with  something that runs in families .  it   s not supernatural  but it   s very  very embarrassing .  especially if you live in a town .  most humans and dwarfs find werewolves both frightening and disgusting  so werewolves do all they can to keep their condition secret  and most of the time they can pass as human .  but if when in wolf shape they were to meet real wolves  they could never pass as wolf     the scent is quite different .  and for the most part real wolves detest werewolves .  so  one way and another  werewolves lead a lonely life .   the genetic laws governing discworld werewolfery are logical  but far more complex than the transformation rules of earth  since the condition can show itself in different forms .  ludmilla cake  who is a    classic bimorph    werewolf  is a tall  strong girl for three weeks in every month  though a careful observer might note that her hair is unusually thick and long .  in the week of the full moon  however  she becomes a wolf and stays in her room  so as not to upset the neighbours .  sometimes preliminary signs appear a day or two before what her mother coyly refers to as    your time      something came in from the back yard .  it was clearly  even attractively female in general shape  and wore a perfectly ordinary dress .  it was also apparently suffering from a case of superfluous hair that not all the delicate pink razors in the world could erase .  also  teeth and fingernails were being worn long this season .  you expected the whole thing to growl  but it spoke in a pleasant and definitely human voice .   reaper man   mrs cake   s forebears had originally come from the ramtop mountains  and she suspected that ludmilla was a throwback to this distant past  she was pretty sure that her own mother had once alluded circumspectly to a great uncle erasmus who sometimes had to eat his meals under the table .   the exact opposite of a werewolf is a wolfman .  for three weeks in every month he is simply a wolf  but as soon as he sees the full moon he stops howling  most of his hair temporarily falls out  and next minute he   s standing up  walking and talking .  the problem is  no clothes .  so when the full moon is due to rise  a canny wolfman takes care to get back to where he keeps a pair of trousers stashed .  it is to be hoped that lupine the wolfman and ludmilla the werewolf have managed to find happiness together  despite having to pay more attention to the calendar than most couples .   sergeant angua of the ankh morpork city watch is different again .  like ludmilla  she is compelled to become a wolf during the time of the full moon  but in addition she has the power to shape shift at will  by day or night  at any time of the month .  this gift is a great advantage to her in police work  when in wolf form she has a superb sense of smell  thanks to which she can track anyone anywhere and decipher subtle clues at crime scenes .  and  as many a villain has found out  it is most disconcerting to chase an attractive and unprotected girl into a dark alley  only to find a pile of discarded clothes and a large she wolf  teeth bared .  however  she has certain weaknesses .  for a day or two before her change she becomes irritable  due to pre lunar tension .  when she is in wolf form the touch of any silver object gives her intense pain  and  like werewolves on the earth  she is vulnerable to silver bullets .  some strong smells overwhelm her delicate nose  bringing on the equivalent of acute hay fever .   angua   s parents are the extremely aristocratic baron guye von uberwald  also known as silvertail  and baroness serafine von uberwald  also known as yellowfang  .  the baron spends most of his time in wolf form  to the annoyance of his wife .  angua had a brother named wolfgang  a magnificently built and very athletic young man  with strongly nietzschean views  who made a terrifying wolf and would have felt quite at home in the ss .  even his father was afraid of him .  but  as she tells carrot  she also has another brother  andrei  and she did have a sister named elsa  till wolfgang killed her .      he said it was an accident .  poor little elsa .  she was a yennork  just like andrei .  that   s a werewolf that doesn   t change  you know .  i   m sure i   ve mentioned it .  our family throws them up from time to time .  wolfgang and i were the only classic bimorphs in the litter .  elsa looked human all the time  even at full moon .  andrei was always a wolf .         you mean you had a human sister and a wolf brother .         no  carrot .  they were both werewolves .  but the  well  the little     switch     inside them didn   t work .  they stayed the same shape .  in the old days the clan would kill off a yennork quickly  and wolfgang is a traditionalist when it comes to nastiness .  he says they made the blood impure .  you see  a yennork would go off and be a human or a wolf but they   d still be carrying the werewolf blood  and then they   d marry and have children     or pups     and  well  that   s where the fairytale monsters come from .  people with a bit of wolf  and wolves with that extra capacity for violence that is so very human .  but elsa was harmless .  after that  andrei didn   t wait for it to happen to him .  he   s a sheepdog over in borogravia now .  doing well  i hear .  wins championships .      the fifth elephant   not surprisingly  angua has broken with her family .   but the existence of the yennork explains a lot .  no doubt the aristocratic werewolves guard their pedigrees carefully  but mistakes will happen  even in the best regulated families .       igors   the igors are a very numerous humanoid family in the uberwald region  each of whom is named either igor or igorina .  they are not  of course  undead  but are usually standing very close to a corpse .  they are  in fact  a big nod to the cinematic clich   that whenever there is a brain to be collected or a big crackling switch to be pulled  then there is an igor  or someone who looks very much like him  ready and willing to do the job .   igors are heavily built  with a strong tendency to lurch and shamble  and they speak with a heavy  spluttering lisp .  for generations many of them have gone into service in the households of aristocratic vampires in uberwald  where it is their pride and joy to ensure that massive doors creak  candles gutter  cobwebs abound  and carriages look as much like hearses as possible .  they have a keen appreciation of all the traditional trappings of horror .  sadly  earthly vampires  unlike those of the disc  seem never to have employed igors .  as we have pointed out  they did not have many visitors .   another reason why igors like working for vampires is that their castles usually have large  deep  cool cellars where an igor can quietly pursue his real interests .  the whole clan has a remarkable hereditary skill in surgery  especially transplants and wound repair  including the replacing of severed limbs .  this they practise both on themselves and on others .  you can always recognize an igor by his distinctly patchwork look and interestingly individual scar patterns  and maybe an extra thumb or mismatched eyes .  in many cases  you could place a ball on the top of his head  and it would not roll off .   the igorinas  on the other hand  use their skill to look absolutely stunning  but always include some fetching little detail     a beautifully curved scar under one eye  a line of decorative stitching round the wrist     to maintain the family look .   since igors hate discarding any body part that could be recycled  an elderly member of the clan will make arrangements for the best bits of himself to be shared out among his kin when the time comes .  they have a great fondness for heirlooms  among igors     he   s got his grandfather   s hands    is likely to be literally true .   there is a tradition among igors that the ancestor who first learned surgery was working for a mad doctor at the time .  a more recent member of the clan  who diversified into extremely delicate clock making  produced references from a series of employers whose hold on sanity appears to have been shaky     mad doctor scoop  crazed baron haha  crushed by a burning windmill   thcreaming doctor bertherk  died of blood poisoning caused by a dirty pitchfork   and demented doctor wimble  who discovered how to make the perfect clock while working on a scheme to extract sunshine from oranges .  this particular igor has a passion for electricity and thunderstorms  as described in thief of time .   there are few echoes of the igors on earth .  and those that there are are only to be found in modern cinema and comic strips  not in age old folklore .  however  they do support the idea that an igor once worked for a doctor frankenstein  who was definitely crazy  on a job which involved a great deal of stitching body parts together and exposing them to lightning .  the doctor wouldn   t have got far without his help .   despite the people they work for  igors are generally well intentioned  nay  spiritual beings .  most religions teach that the body is just an outer garment  to be shed in due time  and igors think  in a provident way  that items with some wear left in them should not be wasted .       zombies   it is not strictly accurate to include the discworld zombies in this chapter  since  unlike werewolves  golems or igors  they do not constitute a separate race or species .  on the contrary  a zombie is simply a human being who obstinately remains sort of alive when he has in fact died .  he ought to lie a mouldering in his grave  instead of wandering around looking vaguely grey  with fingers dropping off occasionally .  no one knows why some people are natural zombies  it may simply be stubborn bloody mindedness  an inborn refusal to kowtow to any authority  even that of death .  what death thinks of this situation has not been recorded .   on the disc  it would seem that zombies keep the personalities they had when alive  more or less intact  with the result that the four we know best are strikingly different .  one is mr slant  the eminent lawyer who can count most of the upper class families in ankh morpork among his clients .  he is dry as dust  in a very literal sense  and though he would never  of course  do anything illegal  it is not wise to cross him .  he knows family secrets going back for an uncomfortable number of generations .  at the opposite end of the city   s social and political spectrum is reg shoe .  in life he saw himself as a romantic revolutionary  in death he devotes most of his energies to protesting at society   s unjust prejudice and discrimination towards the undead .  then there is the old wizard windle poons  who finds his time as a zombie considerably more exciting than his actual life had been  as we learn in reaper man  in his case  however  it is merely a temporary state     the default setting for someone who happens to die when death is not around to do whatever it is he does with his scythe .  and in distant genua there is baron saturday  a zombie who may be something more than just that .  his name and his appearance suggest that he has an earthly counterpart in the sinister baron samedi in haiti     a being who is not himself a zombie or ghost  but a spirit lord of the dead .  he is seen at crossroads and in cemeteries  and can be recognized by his black tuxedo  white top hat  dark glasses  and skull like face .  he is greatly feared .   earth   s zombies  who are only to be found in the traditional beliefs of haiti  are very  very different  despite the identical name  and despite the fact that they too are undead humans .  their condition is due to the spells of some voodoo sorcerer who has called them from their graves     and who  some say  was responsible for putting them down there in the first place  having sent them into a death like trance by a secret poison  concocted from the liver of a very rare fish  it appears  from a conversation recorded in reaper man  that the wizards of unseen university have heard rumours about this  .  when haitian zombies emerge  their minds and souls have gone  they have become mere robots  incapable of speech  who must serve the sorcerer as his slaves .  however  there is one way to rescue a zombie  give him salted food  or salt water to drink  and his soul and his power of speech will be restored .   it is said there was once a girl who died and was buried  but she was seen three years later  working very long hours in a boutique  she looked much the same as in the past  except that her neck was twisted     and that was because her coffin had been too small  and they had had to force her head down .  but she spoke to nobody  and her eyes had no life in them .   reg shoe  the tireless revolutionary and champion of the rights of the undead  would be unspeakably angry if he knew the plight of the poor  exploited  downtrodden zombies of haiti .     and also that in the inevitable chase scene the coach would always break down in the same place in black park  near pinewood studios     according to terry .  this may not be strictly true  but it gave him the idea for don   tgonearthe castle .     as we will see later  two hearts are magical .  however  the only known person with two hearts on the planet earth is doctor who .     see the section above on vampires  where this same thing is mentioned as one possible cause for the condition .  for much of the early history of these creatures  that is  before the days when vampires dressed snappily and werewolves generally managed to keep their trousers on  they were in most cultures pretty much the same thing .  someone who was a werewolf when alive would keep up the bad work by becoming a vampire when dead .       chapter     beasties      it is one of the mysteries of the multiverse that animals which exist as normal flesh and blood creatures in one world are regarded as imaginary  legendary or folkloric in another     and yet  in many cases  the descriptions tally almost perfectly .  whether this is due to the perpetual drifting of particles of knowledge through cosmic space  or whether such species did once inhabit all worlds and have regrettably become extinct in some of them  is a matter of debate .   but nobody can deny that the fauna of the discworld is particularly rich in species which other worlds have dreamed of .  not for nothing does the old song run   all beasts bright and beautiful   all monsters big and small   all things weird and wonderful   the discworld has them all .       dragons   on our world  the image of the dragon is so widespread and so deep rooted that it can truly be said that its origins are lost in those famous mists of time .  it   s a persistent image  too .  even after the last land masses had been explored  and map makers were forced to admit that    here be no dragons     people still reported seeing sea serpents  and huge scaly things in lakes .  and to this day there are innumerable storytellers and artists  still eagerly creating and re creating dragons in their works .  there must be a powerful flow of draconicons still pouring into the earth from some other universe .  it seems likely that the source is the discworld  which can boast of two flourishing species and has some awareness of a third .        a  draco vulgaris   visitors to ankh morpork and other discworld cities have often commented on the charming fashion for society ladies to wear small  colourful dragons on their shoulders  in the winter months  they are also popular as muffs and foot warmers .  these are miniature specimens of draco vulgaris  the common swamp dragon  which probably no longer exists in the wild but has been bred in captivity for many generations .  the basic type is the common smut  familiar to all  from which numerous distinct varieties have been developed  some three dozen are recognized for show purposes  details obtainable from the cavern club exhibitions committee  .  most are of amiable disposition  but it should be noted that the golden deceiver retains some characteristics of its wild ancestors  it makes a good watch dragon but should not be allowed near children .   to own a pedigree swamp dragon is a mark of taste and refinement  but also requires a degree of patience which  alas  all too few would be owners possess .  where dragons are kept  damage to furniture and clothing is inevitable  and chemical effluvia are frequently emitted which some persons of delicate constitution may find offensive .  most dragons are highly strung  excitable little creatures  so great care must be taken in approaching and handling them  if the owner wishes to avoid scratches  bites  and unsightly loss of hair through sudden flaming at close range .  the owner can also expect much expense on vets    bills  since dragons suffer from a multitude of ills     slab throat  skiplets  the black tups  storge and staggers  to name but a few  see diseases of the dragon  by sybil deirdre olgivanna ramkin  .  their digestive systems are liable to catastrophic malfunctions  notably blowback  which is invariably fatal .  needless to say  all varieties readily explode under stress .   there has been much debate as to how so delicate and vulnerable a species can have evolved and survived .  true  their native habitat in the swamps of genua was fairly inaccessible  and they had no natural predators  the only external danger was from callous young men who had worked out that the simplest way to set yourself up as a hero was  in the words of sir samuel vimes     to come plodding into the swamp to stick a sword into a bag of guts that was only one step away from self destruction anyway    .  yet their entire metabolism seems radically unsuited to discworld conditions .  leonard of quirm has proposed the bold theory that swamp dragons did not originate on the disc but are descended from the non discly species draco nobilis  see below   showing adaptations for a heavy air environment .  the difference in size would thus be an example of evolutionary dwarfism  a process well attested in isolated populations .        b  draco nobilis   everyone on the discworld and on earth has heard of the noble or great dragon     a creature many times larger than the swamp dragon  fierce  untameable  with scales and claws and breath like a blast furnace  coiled up in its secret lair on top of a great hoard of gold .  in traditional tales  such dragons fed on virgins and could only be slain by heroes  preferably the long lost heirs of kingdoms   and we shall have more to say on this in a later chapter .  but were they myth  or were they real .   at the time of the events recounted in guards .  guards .  the most that could be said was that they were a great mystery .  lady sybil ramkin knew that they used to turn up from time to time  full of vim and vigour  but had ceased coming .  she believed they had migrated to somewhere where gravity wasn   t so strong  where they could fulfil their potential and be all that a dragon should be .  lord vetinari was positive that they were extinct  despite the fact that something large  hot and angry was incinerating portions of the city .  the unique and supreme lodge of the elucidated brethren of the ebon night were using rituals to summon and control a great dragon .  they discovered that if summoning is hard  control is much  much harder .  but at least nobody could still argue that draco nobilis was a myth .  ensuing events confirmed that draco vulgaris and draco nobilis are indeed related  but gave no clue as to the latter   s current habitat .   the wizard rincewind claimed to have learned  in the course of a very alarming early experience of his own  that most of the time they do not exist as people generally understand    existence     but only potentially   the true dragon is a creature of such refinement of spirit that they can only take on form in this world if they are conceived by the most skilled imagination .  and even then the said imagination must be in some place heavily impregnated with magic  which helps to weaken the walls between the world of the seen and unseen .  then the dragons pop through  as it were  and impress their form upon this world   s possibility matrix .   the colour of magic   some years later  rincewind revised his views on the mystery in the light of fresh discoveries .  when the intrepid voyagers on leonard of quirm   s flying machine landed briefly on the disc   s moon  as recounted in the last hero   they found a population of magnificent silver dragons of all sizes  feeding on moon plants with metallic silver leaves .  they were completely unafraid of humans  indeed  the little ones would swarm all over people  like kittens .  it is plausible to assume that these superb creatures are a variety of draco nobilis .  how we yearn to know more about them .  but it seems the gods have decreed that no more flying machines shall be built .  probably this is for the best .  let the moon dragons enjoy their serene life  safe from the deplorable impact of humanity .  the true dragon lover must rejoice for them .        c  draco maritimus immensis   no other dragon species has actually been observed on or near the disc  but according to scandinavian mythology there was  or is  a third one on earth  the aquatic midgardsorm or middle earth worm  draco maritimus immensis  .  it is written that it lies on the seabed  encircling the whole earth  where it will remain till the end of the world  when it will emerge  and a particularly stupid norse god named thor will clobber it with a hammer .  it is some comfort that it is also written that its dying breath will poison him .   this myth is hard to believe .  the distribution of land masses on the earth is so untidy that no dragon could encircle the whole planet while lying on the seabed without suffering painful and possibly fatal dislocations of its spine .  however  somewhere there exists another universe which was once briefly summoned into a prism by the gifted young wizard simon  and this one does appear to contain a middle earth worm .   a prism     held another slowly turning disc  surrounded by little stars .  but there were no ice walls around this one  just a red gold thread that turned out on closer inspection to be a snake     a snake big enough to encircle a world .  for reasons best known to itself it was biting its own tail .   equal rites   this is confirmed by something the sea troll tethis told rincewind  see the colour of magic  .  while tumbling through space after being swept off the edge of his own world  tethis passed within a few leagues of a world with a strange ring of mountains round it     mountains that turned out to be    the biggest dragon you could ever imagine  covered in snow and glaciers and holding its tail in its mouth    .  a dim awareness of this universe may explain the earth myth of draco maritimus immensis  and also the image of the ouroboros or tail biting serpent known to alchemists and hermetic philosophers as the symbol of the ever circling eternity of time and space .       the basilisk and the chimera   the basilisk is a particularly dangerous species of serpent  which can kill any other animal merely by glancing at it with its fierce  fell and fiery eyes  its breath destroys all vegetation  so it is necessarily a desert dweller  its blood is said to be of great value to magicians .  on earth  it was first identified by the ancient greeks  who gave it a name meaning    little king     because  as the roman naturalist pliny explained  it has a golden mark like a crown on its head .   later  during the middle ages of western europe  people believed that it wore an actual coronet of pure gold  and some described it as a snake with four pairs of legs .  they gave it a second name     cockatrice     and said it was a mortal enemy of crocodiles .  they also claimed to know how it is born  when a farmyard cock lives longer than is normal for his species  in the last stage of his life he starts to lay eggs  and if  in the hottest days of summer  some venomous serpent or toad coils itself round such an egg and hatches it  what comes out is the cockatrice or basilisk .  it has the head and legs of a cockerel  but its body tapers down to a snake   s tail  ending in a dart .  it was much feared for its death dealing glance  until a method of destroying it was devised .  writing a historie of serpents in       the naturalist edward topsell mocked the legend   i cannot without laughing remember the old wives    tales of the vulgar cockatrices that have been in england  for i have often times heard it confidently related  that once our nation was full of cockatrices  and that a certain man did destroy them by going up and down in glasse  whereby their own shapes were reflected upon their own faces  and so they died .   topsell was wrong to laugh .  the method is perfectly valid .  it exploits an instinct which can also be seen in young male swamp dragons in the breeding season  when they are so eager to drive off a rival that they will attack their own reflections  as chubby did in men at arms  .   on the discworld  the basilisk inhabits the burning deserts of klatch .  on one occasion  as we read in sourcery  a hungry basilisk which lay panting in the baking shade of a rock  dribbling corrosive yellow slime  heard the thumping of hundreds of little feet .  this  the creature thought  must mean that its dinner was on the way .  but what was approaching was the wizard rincewind   s fearsome luggage  which was in a particularly foul mood because it had become separated from its master and had recently had to fight its way across a river infested with alligators .   the basilisk blinked its legendary eyes and uncoiled twenty feet of hungry body  winding out and on to the sand like fluid death .   the luggage staggered to a halt and raised its lid threateningly .  the basilisk hissed  but a little uncertainly  because it had never seen a walking box before  and certainly never one with lots of alligator teeth stuck in its lid .  there were also scraps of leathery hide adhering to it  as though it had been involved in a fight in a handbag factory  and in a way that the basilisk wouldn   t have been able to describe even if it could talk  it appeared to be glaring .   right  the reptile thought  if that   s the way you want to play it .   it turned on the luggage a stare like a diamond drill  a stare that nipped in via the staree   s eyeballs and flayed the brain from the inside  a stare that tore the frail net curtains on the windows of the soul  a stare that     the basilisk realized something was very wrong .  an entirely new and unwelcome sensation started to arise just behind its saucer shaped eyes .  it started small  like the little itch in those few square inches of back that no amount of writhing will allow you to scratch  and grew until it became a second  redhot  internal sun .   the basilisk was feeling a terrible  overpowering and irresistible urge to blink      it did something incredibly unwise .   it blinked .   sourcery   the luggage went on its way  with a few traces of yellow slime rapidly drying on its lid .  what a tragic misunderstanding .  if only the basilisk had been less hungry that day  and the luggage less ill tempered  they would have seen how much they had in common     a domineering gaze  a dislike of alligators and crocodiles  perhaps even a multiplicity of feet  if some pictures of basilisks can be trusted .  a beautiful friendship might have been born .  but it was not to be .   pursuing its erratic course across the dunes of klatch  the luggage next encountered a chimera  which was sitting on a stone pinnacle the shape and temperature of a firebrick .  before recounting the outcome  it will be useful to see what books from our own world can tell about this monster     legendary here  but real enough on the discworld .   according to john milton  a chimera is just about the worst thing you could meet on a guided tour of hell .  in book   of his paradise lost he lists the horrors in the infernal landscape at some length  and caps them all with the assertion that hell is a place  where all life dies  death lives  and nature breeds  perverse  all monstrous  all prodigious things  abominable  inutterable  and worse than fables yet have feigned  or fear conceived  gorgons  and hydras  and chimaeras dire .   after which it comes as a bit of a let down to find that  according to ancient greek poets  the chimera was a rather muddled female monster  consisting of a fire breathing nanny goat with a lion   s head and a snake   s body .  an alternative view  supported by ancient greek artists who had to draw the damn thing  was that she had two heads at the front end  one leonine and one capriform  and a long scaly tail at the back end  terminating in a snake   s head .  the greek chimera   s family was an unpleasant one .  her father typhon  the god of storms at sea  was nothing but a writhing mass of serpents from the waist down  and had snakes instead of fingers  while his wings darkened the whole sky  her mother was a sea monster  half woman and half snake  who ate humans raw  her siblings included cerberus  the three headed hound of hell  and the hundred headed hydra .   the greek chimera did her best to be dire  she tried to look as abominable and inutterable as she could  but the goat component undermined the effect .  her biggest asset was her fiery breath  yet even this turned out to be unhelpful when the hero bellerophon was sent to kill her  on the orders of an enemy of his  who assumed this was a mission impossible     indeed  fatal .  but bellerophon was as canny as he was good looking  and devised a cunning plan .  mounted on his good flying horse pegasus  he swooped over the chimera  firing arrows at her  and when she opened her lion   s jaws to puff flame at him he dropped a lump of lead down her throat .  the heat of her stomach melted the lead  sealing her doom from the inside .   the chimera of the discworld may be related  but separate evolution has brought about several differences  including some unexpected wings .  according to broomfog   s bestiary anima unnaturale   it have thee legges of an mermade  the hair of an tortoise  the teeth of an fowel  and the winges of an snake .  of course  i have only my worde for it  the beast having the breathe of an furnace and the temperament of an rubber balloon in a hurricane .   sourcery   such was the creature which attacked rincewind   s luggage .   the chimera   s technique was to swoop low over the prey  lightly boiling it with its fiery breath  and then turn and rend its dinner with its teeth .  it managed the fire part but then  at the point where experience told the creature it should be facing a stricken and terrified victim  found itself on the ground in the path of a scorched and furious luggage .   the only thing incandescent about the luggage was its rage .  it had spent several hours with a headache  during which it seemed the whole world had tried to attack it .  it had had enough .   when it had stamped the unfortunate chimera into a greasy puddle on the sand  it paused for a moment  apparently considering its future      sourcery   there is a distinct possibility that the discworld chimera  always an endangered species  is now extinct .       the sphinx   though there can be no doubt that prince teppic of djelibeybi once met a sphinx  there has been much argument over whether the creature is truly part of the discworld   s fauna .  teppic himself was unclear as to where he was when he encountered it .  space and time had been behaving strangely .  a spokesman for unseen university expressed the view that   the sphinx is an unreal creature .  it exists solely because it has been imagined .  it is well known that in an infinite universe anything that can be imagined must exist somewhere  and since many of them are not things that ought to exist in a well ordered space time frame they get shoved into a side dimension .   pyramids   to which teppic replied that that   s as may be  but he was in no doubt that either he broke into the sphinx   s dimension or it broke into his  and that what has happened once may happen again .  provisionally  therefore  the sphinx has been listed as a potential  if unwelcome  denizen of the discworld .   on earth  its existence is better documented .  according to ancient writers  a sphinx is a creature with the body of a lion or lioness and a human head  one subspecies has wings and human female breasts  another has a serpent   s tail  yet another exists only in the form of conjoined twins .  the name means    throttler    in greek .  they were native to egypt  where they guarded the borders of the kingdom  the entrances to temples  and the approaches to important pyramids and tombs .  they were not normally dangerous to humans .  many statues of them were made  and can be seen to this day .   the egyptians themselves had no generic word for sphinxes  each one  and there were hundreds of them  having a name of its own .  tourists visiting the great sphinx of giza should address it  cautiously  as horemakhet khepri ra atum .  if they get the pronunciation right  it may choose to reveal some of the hidden treasures which it guards .  if they get it wrong  it may choose to reveal its claws .   the great sphinx of giza has two aims in its existence .  the first is to guard the royal tombs at memphis  which it has successfully done for some       years  the second is to keep itself  and the town of giza  free from drifting sand  because sand makes it ache in all its limbs .  this has been a sorry failure .  after a mere eleven hundred years it was buried in dunes right up to the neck  until it was dug clear by prince thutmose  whom it gratefully made pharaoh .  other people have had to dig it out again since then  but they don   t now get to be made pharaoh .  in fact  the great sphinx seems to have pretty well given up on its sand repelling duties  allowing giza to be engulfed  and relying on humans to give it the occasional brush up .  the arabs say it is sulking because a holy man smashed its nose .   according to greek mythology  the goddess hera brought a single female sphinx from egypt to greece  for vindictive reasons  she must have hoped that  as so often  the introduction of a foreign species would seriously damage the local ecology  but since she neglected to provide it with a mate it did not breed  and the devastation it caused ended with its life .   this greek sphinx was more active  more malevolent  than her egyptian relatives .  she perched herself on a rock overlooking the main road into thebes  where she forced every traveller to try to guess her utterly perplexing riddle     what animal walks on four legs in the morning  two at midday  and three in the evening  and is at its weakest when it has most legs .     if they couldn   t answer  she throttled them  and ate them .  and so it went on  until one day oedipus came along  and replied     that animal is man .  as a feeble baby  he crawls on all fours  as an adult  he walks upright  as an old man  he uses a stick .     the sphinx was so furious that she beat her brains out against the rock .   prince teppic   s sphinx  like the egyptian one  guarded a border     in this case  a fold in the space time continuum which was a border between dimensions .  like the greek one  it relied upon the riddle to provide it with entertainment and with innumerable meals .  now teppic  despite being a fully qualified assassin  was not a man of violence  and had a proper concern for wildlife  even in its more alarming forms .  he tried polite conversation     we   ve got any amount of statues to you at home      but the sphinx  though flattered  could not be sidetracked for long  and challenged him with its riddle .  teppic admitted defeat  so the gloating sphinx itself gave him the explanation .   now  teppic had been born into a culture profoundly distrustful of metaphors  symbolism  allegories  and figures of speech of every sort .  the people of djelibeybi took all religious  poetic  and metaphysical statements as literal physical truths  to them  a metaphor was a lie .  furthermore  teppic had recently visited ephebe  where he had heard the philosopher xeno expounding his famous logical proof that if you shoot an arrow at a tortoise you cannot possibly hit it .   so teppic launched an attack  not on the sphinx  but on its metaphor .  combining the deadly literalism of djelibeybi with the debating skills and logic of ephebe  he demanded clarifications .  did all this actually happen in one day  to one individual .  well  no  the sphinx admitted  it is a figure of speech  but what   s wrong with that .     an element of dramatic analogy is present in all riddles     it claimed .     yes  but     said teppic     is there internal consistency within the metaphor .     step by step  the hapless sphinx was forced to concede that in an analogy where the human lifespan of seventy years is represented by twenty four hours  the crawling stage only lasts for about twenty minutes  and can   t be called    morning     as it comes just after midnight .  there are other problems too .  since some old folk need no sticks while others use two  would it not be more accurate to say that after supper time    it continues to walk on two legs or with any prosthetic aids of its choice    .   when everything had been settled to their mutual satisfaction  the sphinx repeated its challenge .  but of course prince teppic already knew the answer .  the sphinx itself had told him  earlier on .  he now gave it  and the sphinx had to let him go free .  he got away just in time as an angry bellow erupted behind him  when the sphinx finally worked out what had happened .   should the creature ever reappear on the discworld or in our own universe  people will now know how to deal with it .       the phoenix   everyone agrees that the phoenix  also known as the firebird  is extremely beautiful  and that it is the rarest bird that has ever existed  or could ever exist  anywhere in the multiverse .  it   s said  both on the discworld and on earth  that you only get one phoenix at a time  that it lives to be five hundred years old  and that when it feels its death approaching it builds a nest  in which it lays a single egg .  then it bursts into flame and burns itself up  so that the warmth will hatch out the new bird from the ashes .  this way of life  and death  makes it extremely useful as an allegory or metaphor .  it also makes some people think that it is only a mythical creature .   however  there are people in lancre who  having observed nature closely  think the commonly accepted story cannot be accurate .  both hodgesaargh the falconer and granny weatherwax have found the occasional phoenix feather  a small flickering flame like thing which nothing can quench .  granny keeps hers in a little glass bottle .  one day the other witches are examining it      i saw her pick that thing up years ago     said magrat .     it was around this time of year  too .  we were walking back through the woods and there was a shooting star and this sort of light fell off it and we went to look and there it was .  it looked like a flame but she was able to pick it up .         sounds like a firebird feather     said nanny .     there used to be old stories about them .  they pass through here .  but if you touch their feathers you   d better be damn sure of yourself  because the old stories say they burn in the presence of evil           firebird .  you mean a phoenix .     said agnes .      haven   t seen one go over for years     said nanny .     sometimes you   d see two or three at a time when i was a girl  just lights flying high up in the sky .         no  no  the phoenix     there   s only one of it  that   s the whole point     said agnes .      one of anything   s no bloody use     said nanny .   carpe jugulum   on the discworld  the firebird is said to have its main home in the hot deserts of klatch  even though its seasonal migrations take it over lancre .  so  the best place to look for its equivalent on earth would be in the hot deserts of ancient egypt .  and there  sure enough  it is     not yet called the phoenix  but the benu bird .  the name probably means    rise and shine    .  according to one egyptian myth it is the oldest of all creatures  its cry was the first sound ever heard  when it perched  glowing  on the first mound of earth to rise up out of the primeval sea     or  others said  on the first sacred obelisk  the benben stone at heliopolis .  it was usually described as a heron  or as a huge golden hawk with a heron   s beak .   many generations later  in the fifth century bc  the greek writer herodotus visited heliopolis  where he was told about a marvellous red gold bird which would come to the temple of the sun there once every five hundred years .  he called it    phoenix     meaning that its brilliant colouring was as fine as the richest phoenician purple dye .  this bird  he was told  would arrive carrying an egg which it had formed from the ashes of its parent mixed with myrrh  the next phoenix would be born from this egg .   later writers changed the bird   s homeland from egypt to arabia  and gave a different explanation of its death and rebirth .  an aged phoenix  they said  would build itself a nest full of spices  and settling there would sing a last sad song .  then it would burst into flame and burn itself to ashes .  but from the ashes a new young bird would arise .   thanks to this story  the phoenix is famous in poetry and folklore as a symbol of indestructible life .  as will shakespeare put it   thus when  the bird of wonder dies  the maiden phoenix   her ashes new create another heir   as much to be admired as she herself .   the witches of lancre would not entirely agree .     bird of wonder     yes     maiden     no .  for  as granny weatherwax pointed out     one of anything ain   t going to last for very long  is it .          the salamander   salamanders are a species of lizard  pinkish in colour  sluggish in behaviour  and in no way dangerous .  the only interesting thing about them is that they do not eat in the normal sense of the word  instead  they subsist entirely on the nourishing quality of octarine  the eighth colour in the discworld   s sunlight  which they absorb through their skins .  since the wavelengths corresponding to the other colours have no food value for them  they store this surplus light in a special sac and discharge it when the sac is full  or when they are alarmed  causing a vivid flash .  a cage of salamanders is a very useful piece of equipment for anyone who wants to keep a pictorial record of events  such as twoflower the tourist  or otto chriek the journalistic iconographer   for the flash enables the imp in the picture box to function even in the dark .   on earth the name was applied  in the days of the ancient greeks  to what must be a related species     a lizard that lives in the midst of fire  remaining unharmed because its body is so intensely cold that it extinguishes the flames around it .  centuries later  the alchemist paracelsus taught that each of the four elements  earth  air  fire and water  had its own elemental spirit  and that of fire was a salamander .  these dramatic creatures are now regarded on earth as mere myths  useful only in poetry and heraldry .  confusingly  however  there are also on that world several species of flesh and blood lizards which are called    salamanders    .  throwing them into a fire as an experiment is not considered an environmentally friendly act .       the unicorn   this elegant but sometimes ferocious beast is an elvish creature  not native to the discworld .  the one which appeared in lancre  as told in lords and ladies  came from an alternative universe where it was the elf queen   s pet  it had crossed accidentally  at one of those places where worlds come too close together  and the wall between them is thinner than one would wish .  it could not return .  terrified and enraged  it became a danger     for a large stallion with a twelve inch razor sharp horn growing from its forehead is not to be treated lightly .   yet granny weatherwax was able to cope .  when the unicorn charged at her  she created an invisible wall into which it crashed  and as it writhed on the ground she let down her hair  and broke off a single hair at the root .   granny weatherwax   s hands made a complicated motion in the air as she made a noose out of something almost too thin to see .  she ignored the thrashing horn and dropped it over the unicorn   s neck .  then she pulled .   struggling  its unshod hooves kicking up great clods of mud  the unicorn struggled to its feet .      that   ll never hold it     said nanny  sidling around the tree .      i could hold it with a cobweb  gytha ogg .  with a cobweb .      and so indeed she does  dragging the unicorn to jason ogg   s forge  where its hooves are shod     not with iron  of course  since that would kill an elvish animal  but with silver horseshoes made from granny   s own best tea set .  her ability to control the beast should not surprise anybody  for  as nanny ogg says  there are some things which everybody knows about trapping unicorns        who is qualified to trap    em is what i   m delicately hintin    at .     it takes a maiden to do it  in any universe .  and granny may be old  but she is qualified .   granny emerged from the forge  leading the unicorn     it walked politely alongside the witch until she reached the centre of the square .  then she turned it loose  and gave it a slight slap on the rump .   it whinnied softly  turned  and galloped down the street  towards the forest         she   ll never get it back  though she calls for it for a thousand years     said granny  speaking to the world in general      the unicorn reached the forest  and galloped onwards .   there are clear affinities here with what people on earth have long been saying  though  regrettably  in that world the fate of the captured unicorn is more cruel .  as early as the seventh century  the spaniard isidore of seville described the unicorn  and how to hunt it   the unicorn is a most savage beast .  it has this name because in the middle of its forehead it has a horn  four foot long .  and that horn is so sharp and so strong that it knocks down or pierces everything it strikes .  this beast often fights against the elephant and pierces him in the belly and throws him to the ground .  and the unicorn is so strong that he cannot be taken by the might of hunters .  but men who write about the nature of animals say that a maiden is brought where the unicorn may come  and she opens her lap and the unicorn lays his head on it  and abandons all his fierceness  and falls asleep there .  and thus the beast is caught  and slain by the huntsmen   s spears .   granny   s device of using a hair as a noose and leash is a remarkable piece of magical skill  and very rare .  in earthly legends one occasionally reads about a maiden tying a defeated dragon with the girdle of her robe and leading it away     st martha did this  at tarascon in southern france  and so did the girl st george rescued     but a hair  no .  however  a few malevolent hags in the scottish highlands did know the trick .  if one of these hags found a huntsman sheltering in a mountain bothy  she would kill him  provided she was safe from his dog .  so she would ask him to tie the dog up with one of her own long hairs .  when she cried     tighten and choke  hair .     the dog died .   but that is an unpleasant thought .  instead  let us turn to what the poet alexander pope has to say about a girl   s charming ringlets   love in these labyrinths his slaves detains   and mighty hearts are held in slender chains .   fair tresses man   s imperial race ensnare   and beauty draws us with a single hair .       the luggage   perhaps the strangest of all life forms on the disc is the luggage .  it is certainly made of wood  yet its multiple legs and strong aggressive instincts are equally certainly proof that it is no mere plant or plant product .  and very  very certainly it has a mind of its own .     vegetable with animal connections    is a fair summary .  yet much mystery remains  even after careful study of various earthly traditions which help to throw light on its possible evolution .   on earth  there was a time when travelling was truly travelling  not just a matter of hopping on to a jet for a five day break on the costa del sol .  people said     i go south in the winter     meaning they made a habit of spending a couple of months on the riviera every year  they went off for half their lives to govern a chunk of far flung empire  in extreme cases  they went round the world in eighty days .  en route  they tended to acquire pterodactyls  mummies  and bits of old temples .  so when an english gentleman travelled  a whole host of trunks  crates  chests  portmanteaux  packing cases  suitcases  dressing cases  shoe cases  hatboxes  bandboxes  gladstone bags  carpet bags  and pistol cases travelled with him .  arriving at his destination  he would leave most of them at the quayside or station and enter his hotel with a mere smattering of hand baggage  say  as much as two porters could carry   telling the manager     my luggage will follow    .  and so it would  pushed on handcarts  or carried on the backs or heads of porters .   but as time rolled on  the race of porters became mysteriously extinct  and evolutionary pressures caused luggage itself to develop mechanisms enabling it to obey its instinct to follow .  the first scientific record of this phenomenon was by terry himself  when he wrote in        many years ago i saw  in bath  a very large american lady towing a huge tartan suitcase very fast on little rattly wheels which caught in the pavement cracks and generally gave it a life of its own .  at that moment the luggage was born .  many thanks to that lady      dedication of sourcery   the discworld environment is hostile to things with little rattly wheels  as we learn in reaper man  when it is menaced by an incursion of alien supermarket trolleys .  therefore on the disc evolution has produced a more elegant solution  the luggage hurtles across the landscape  and  if need be  through space  time  and dimensions  on several hundred energetic but retractable little legs  always following the person it has adopted as its owner .   if that were all  one could reasonably claim to understand the origins and characteristics of the luggage .  but it has more mysterious properties  whose equivalents on earth are obscure  though not beyond all conjecture .  outwardly it looks like a pirate   s treasure chest  the kind one expects to find brim full of ill gotten gold and jewels  but its interior is larger than its exterior  and probably does not occupy the same space time framework .  sometimes it does indeed contain bags of gold  at other times food and drink  or its owner   s neatly folded clothes  smelling of lavender  but when it is in fighting mode it opens its lid menacingly to reveal rows and rows of large square teeth  as white as bleached sycamore or tombstones  and a red  pulsating  mahogany tongue .  it is wholly impervious to magic  being itself made of sapient pearwood from the counterweight continent  possibly the most concentrated magical substance on the disc .  when angry  as it so often is  it is a fearsome enemy  as was amply demonstrated during a fight in the broken drum .   the door burst open .  two trolls hurried through it  slammed it behind them  dropped the heavy bar across it and fled down the stairs .   outside there was a sudden crescendo of running feet .  and  for the last time  the door opened .  in fact it exploded  the great wooden bar being hurled far across the room and the frame itself giving way .   door and frame landed on a table  which flew into splinters .  it was then that the frozen fighters noticed that there was something else in the pile of wood .  it was a box  shaking itself madly to rid itself of the smashed timber around it      a raven swooped down from its perch in the rafters and dived at the wizard  rincewind   talons open and gleaming .   it didn   t make it .  at about the half way point the luggage leapt from its bed of splinters  gaped briefly in mid air  and snapped shut .   it landed lightly .  rincewind saw its lid open again  slightly .  just far enough for a tongue  large as a palm leaf  red as mahogany  to lick up a few errant feathers .   the colour of magic   it would be reassuring to think that no such devastating piece of carpentry exists  ever has existed  or ever could exist elsewhere in the multiverse .  but the myths of olden time and the inspirational insights of modern authors both show that a race of deadly chests has evolved on earth  with all the destructive power of the luggage  and none of its usefulness and charm .   the first hint of their existence comes from plutarch  a greek writer living in rome who died in ad      he visited egypt  whose ancient religion fascinated him  and wrote a book concerning isis and osiris based on the legends current there in his time .  he recounts in detail how the virtuous king osiris was murdered by his evil brother seth .  seth secretly obtained the exact measurements of osiris  and had a magnificent chest made  he then displayed it during a feast  promising to give it to whoever could fit inside it exactly .  many tried  but in vain .  finally osiris laid himself in the chest  which immediately became a perfect fit for him  seth promptly bolted it shut  sealed it with lead  and threw it into the nile .  it floated magically for many miles  and when it washed ashore in the lebanon it grew at once into a marvellous tree  still containing the dead body of osiris  then it was cut down and made into a pillar in a king   s palace .  isis  wife of osiris  claimed the pillar and had it opened  revealing the chest coffin  which held the wonderfully preserved corpse  it thus became the prototype for all egyptian mummy cases .   another death dealing chest is recorded in norse tradition as the property of the legendary goldsmith volund  or  in english  wayland  .  a cruel king held him captive on an island  forcing him to work at making golden treasures  his sword had been taken from him  and he had been deliberately lamed to prevent any escape .  the king had two young sons  who one day went hunting on that island and came to volund   s forge .  there they saw a great chest  and asked volund for the key .  he opened it  and they looked in .  it held great evil  but to the boys it seemed filled with gold rings and fine jewels .     come back tomorrow     said volund     and all this will be yours .  but tell no one that you are visiting me .     and so they did  and  as the old icelandic poem v  lundarkvid   a says   they came to where the great chest stood   asked volund for the key   when they looked in  there was revealed  evil and enmity .   he struck off the heads of those two boys  as they bent down to gaze   and under the pit of the anvil there  he buried their bodies .      he struck off the heads        but how  as he had no sword .  one has a nasty suspicion that the chest did the deed itself  using its lid as a weapon .   suspicion also surrounds a tragic event chronicled by thomas haynes bayly in his poem    the mistletoe bough    in the     s .  it was in the times of merrie england that one of our typical merrie barons was holding a typically merrie christmas dance in his typically merrie castle  together with his retainers  who all were blithe and gay   his newly married daughter  and the latter   s bridegroom  young lovell .  seized by a sudden merrie whim  the bride decided to play hide and seek  challenging lovell to find her secret lurking place .  but it all went horribly wrong   they sought her that night .  they sought her next day .   and they sought her in vain when a week passed away .   in the highest     the lowest     the loneliest spot    young lovell sought wildly     but found her not .   many  many years passed by  and then   at length an oak chest  that had long lain hid   was found in the castle     they raised the lid      and a skeleton form lay mouldering there   in the bridal wreath of that lady fair .   oh .  sad was her fate .  in sportive jest  she hid from her lord in the old oak chest .   it closed with a spring .      and  dreadful doom   the bride lay clasp   d in her living tomb .   sheer accident .  the corresponding tragedy in the history of lancre does indeed seem so  judging by nanny ogg   s account      i remember years ago my granny telling me about queen amonia  well  i say queen  but she never was queen except for about three hours because of what i   m about to unfold  on account of them playing hide and seek at the wedding party and her hiding in a big heavy old chest in some attic and the lid slamming shut and no one finding her for seven months  by which time you could definitely say the wedding cake was getting a bit stale .      lords and ladies   yet over in our own world  suspicion lingers .  did the chest bayly speaks of have some rudimentary capacity for bloody minded malevolence .  and how exactly had it managed to lie hidden while everybody was searching the castle from turret to dungeon .  there is a sinister mystery here .   a later generation glimpsed what may be a related phenomenon in robert louis stevenson   s treasure island        .  jim hawkins  looking back on the adventure of his boyhood  recalled how it began on the day the    brown old seaman with the sabre cut    arrived  followed by his sea chest  and took lodgings at the inn which jim   s parents owned .   i remember him as if it were yesterday  as he came plodding up to the inn door  his sea chest following behind him in a hand barrow     i remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself as he did so  and then breaking out in that old sea song he sang so often afterwards         fifteen men on the dead man   s chest      yo ho ho  and a bottle of rum .   drink and the devil had done for the rest      yo ho ho  and a bottle of rum .      this ill omened shanty echoes again and again through the story  and is never completed  or explained .  jim writes that    at first i had supposed the    dead man   s chest    to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room     the great sea chest which none of them had ever seen opened .  the thought gave him nightmares  as well it might .  for how could fifteen men be on one chest .  knowing what we now know of the luggage  we must query the correctness of the preposition .  not on but in  perhaps .  let us recall rincewind   s conversation with conina  on an occasion when the luggage had just emerged from the shades with several arrowheads and broken swords sticking in it .  she asks him if it is dangerous .      there   s two schools of thought about that     said rincewind .      there   s some people who say it   s dangerous  and others who say it   s very dangerous .  what do you think .      the luggage raised its lid a fraction      conina stared at that lid .  it looked very like a mouth .      i think i   d vote for    terminally dangerous        she said .      it likes crisps     volunteered rincewind  and then added     well  that   s a bit strong .  it eats crisps .         what about people .         oh  and people .  about fifteen so far  i think .      sourcery   fifteen  eh .   but it would be unfair to take leave of the luggage without any mention of the gentler  more domestic side of its nature .  during a brief return to its native country  described in interesting times  it gallantly rescued a rather charming trunk with inlaid lid and dainty feet  with red toenails  from the unwelcome attentions of three big  coarse cases covered in studded leather .  romance blossomed .  mysterious sounds of sawing and hammering were heard by night on a hillside where pear trees grew .  and when the luggage reappeared it     or shall we say he .      was followed by the dainty footed luggage  and then  in descending order of size  four little chests  the smallest being about the size of a lady   s handbag .  but the luggage could not deny its inner calling .  after one or two sad backward glances  or what might have been glances if it had had eyes  it cantered away through the dimensions  still following rincewind .       chapter     the witches of  lancre      why three .  why    wyrd    .    the greatest concentration of natural magical talent in the discworld is found in the ramtop mountains  especially in the small kingdom of lancre .  there have been witches there for generations  remembered to this day with fondness and fear .  and still one can hear the age old rallying call  as an eldritch voice shrieks through a thunderstorm     when shall we three meet again .     to which  after a pause  another replies in far more ordinary tones     well  i can do next tuesday .      which is all very well  but it does raise questions .  lancre witches normally work alone  each having her own personal approach to her craft .  so why do these particular witches  granny weatherwax  nanny ogg  and magrat garlick  often meet as a threesome .  why is the first account of their deeds entitled wyrd sisters  when they are not sisters .  and isn   t wyrd a weird way to spell weird  even if they are weird .   as with so many other things  it   s all down to will shakespeare .  his impact on the universe certainly stretches as far as lancre .   in will shakespeare   s macbeth  there is a trio of secret  black and midnight hags who forgather in a thunderstorm on a blasted heath  boil up unappetizing brews in a cauldron  and utter tricky prophecies which shape the destinies of kings .  the stage directions are quite clear as to what they are     thunder and lightning  enter three witches      and the text is equally clear as to their name .  they are the weird sisters .  that is what macbeth calls them  and what they call themselves .  the weird sisters .   being strong individualists  it would never occur to granny weatherwax  nanny ogg and magrat to give themselves a collective name .  but the book does .  being receptive to inspiration  it calls them wyrd sisters .   that  actually  is how shakespeare ought to have spelled the name of his own three witches  since it is their true and original title .  it doesn   t mean they were peculiar or crazy .  it is the anglo saxon wyrd  a word meaning fate or destiny  which is now completely forgotten in england  but is still sometimes heard in scotland  in encouraging remarks such as    weel  laddie  ye maun e   en dree your weird     roughly     that   s your bad luck  son  and you   ll just have to put up with it     .  shakespeare   s witches could foretell  and probably direct  your destiny .   shakespeare found their name in the book where he first read about macbeth   s career  raphael holinshed   s history of scotland        .  holinshed was too cautious to commit himself as to what exactly the three women on the heath can have been .  he wrote   the common opinion was  that these three women were either the weird sisters  that is  as ye would say  the goddesses of destinie  or else some nymphs or feiries  indued with knowledge of prophecie by their necromanticall science  because euerie thing came to pass as they had spoken .   goddesses  nymphs  fairies  witches  necromancers  prophets .  you can take your pick .  but there is no doubt that they had power .   but why  in both universes  are there precisely three of them .  it is of course true that this suits the theatre  as the great playwright hwel remarks when he looks through a script which  emanating from the mighty power source of shakespeare   s mind  has drifted over to the discworld without too much damage .   there were  he had to admit  some nice touches .  three witches was good .  two wouldn   t be enough  four would be too many .  they could be meddling with the destinies of mankind and everything .  lots of smoke and green light .  you could do a lot with three witches .  it was surprising no one had thought of it before .   wyrd sisters   but the true reason lies far  far deeper .  three has always been an important number in stories  and in magic .  all good things come in threes  and all bad things too .  which is why the ancient greeks and romans spoke of three fates who held in their hands the thread of each person   s life  clotho spun it on her distaff  lachesis measured it  and in due time the dreaded atropos     she who can   t be turned aside     snipped it with the shears of death .  they were usually said to be old women  looking much alike  except that the first two wore white robes and the third  guess who  black .   norsemen too believed in goddesses of destiny  the norns .  according to one poem there were just three  whose names were urd   r  verd   andi  and skuld     meaning    what   s happened already        what   s happening now     and    what   s bound to happen    .  but others said there were many of them  and that they came to every child when it was born  to shape its life .   in southern europe people thought that there were supernatural women who bestowed wishes and gifts on newborn babies .  they were a kind of fairy  but it was most unwise to use that word     better to refer tactfully to    ladies from outside     or    ladies who must not be named    .  they were the original fairy godmothers .  in greece and the balkans  they would arrive on the third night after the birth  and there were three of them .  everyone went to bed early that night  the dogs would be chained up  the door of the house left unlocked .  the baby   s cot would be placed near the icon in the main room  and beside it a table with three low stools for the ladies .  there would be a candle burning  and heaps of food     bread and wine  fruit  nuts  honey cakes .  nobody could enter the room till morning  when the midwives and female relatives would eat up the goodies themselves  for the ladies had already magically taken what they wanted of them during the night .   on one occasion  as recounted in wyrd sisters   granny weatherwax  nanny ogg and magrat saved a baby   s life and appointed themselves his godmothers .  in normal circumstances  they would certainly have appreciated a cosy midnight feast  if one had been on offer .  but the circumstances were far from normal  and they had to bestow their gifts from a distance .   magrat sighed .      you know     she said     if we are his godmothers  we ought to have given him three gifts .  it   s traditional .         what are you talking about  girl .         three good witches are supposed to give the baby three gifts .  you know  like good looks  wisdom and happiness .     magrat pressed on defiantly .     that   s how it used to be done in the old days .         oh  you mean gingerbread cottages and all that     said granny dismissively .     spinning wheels and pumpkins and pricking your finger on rose thorns and similar .  i could never be having with all that .      in the end  however  granny agreed .  each gave her gift separately  and these gifts shaped the child   s destiny  for  as the anglo saxons used to say  wyrd bid    swid   ost     fate is the strongest     and wyrd bid    full ar  d     fate is inflexible .      as a result of this episode and of the events in witches abroad  fairy godmothers are officially defined in the discworld companion as    a specialized form of witch with particular responsibility for the life of one individual or a group of individuals    .       maiden  mother  crone   when magrat got married  she gave up witching for a while .  this caused problems for the other two  because not only is three a good number for witches  but it has to be the right sort of three .  the right sort of types .  nanny ogg brooded on the matter   as a witch  she naturally didn   t believe in occult nonsense of any sort .  but there were one or two truths down below the bedrock of the soul which had to be faced  and right in among them was this business of  well  the maiden  the mother and the     other one .   of course  it was nothing but an old superstition and belonged to the unenlightened days when    maiden    or    mother    or     the other one     encompassed every woman over the age of twelve or so  except maybe for nine months of her life .   even so     it was an old superstition     older than books  older than writing     and beliefs like that were heavy weights on the rubber sheet of human experience  tending to pull people into their orbits .   they needed to be three again .   maskerade   nobody would dream of arguing with nanny on a point like this .  the discworld is about what people believe is true .  so if nanny says it   s a truth down below the bedrock of her soul that three witches must be of different ages  then     on the discworld     it is .  if she says that it   s a superstition older than books  older than writing  then     on the discworld     it is .   but on earth it   s not .  it   s just over one hundred years old  actually .  will shakespeare   s witches were all the same age .  so were the three fates  the three norns  the three graces  the three mothers in early britain  the three war goddesses in ireland  and other female trios in old mythologies .   it was in      that a cambridge scholar  jane ellen harrison  decided that all the many goddesses in ancient religions could be tidily sorted out into three aspects of one great earth goddess  the maiden  the mother  and a third she did not name .  she was mainly interested in the first two  so was her colleague sir james frazer  he of the golden bough   who thought they were a mother and daughter pair like demeter and persephone in greece .   the first writer to pay much attention to the third one was the magician aleister crowley  who called her    the crone    and identified her with the sinister hecate  a greek goddess of darkness and black magic .  he seems to have loathed her .  in his novel moonchild in       he wrote   artemis  the moon goddess  is unassailable  a being fine and radiant  hecate is the crone  a woman past all hope of motherhood  her soul black with envy and hatred of happier mortals  the woman in the fullness of life is the sublime persephone .   and then the idea took root in the mind of the poet robert graves  and grew into his book the white goddess         the picture of a lovely  cruel threefold deity who brings both life and death  inspiration and despair .  her third aspect is the crone  the hag  the destroyer  but beyond the pain she represents there is a promise of reward and renewal  so she is not to be seen as evil .  this powerful image which graves created is now firmly imprinted on the minds of modern occultists on earth  where the trio of identical figures which shakespeare knew has faded away  morphing into the sharply differentiated group of maiden  mother  and crone .   but if nanny ogg is right  and she always is  it all began on discworld way back in the mists of time .  there is leakage between universes .   so she and granny weatherwax had to find some way of setting up a threesome of the right type  to spread the load .  they began by recruiting shy young agnes nitt  also known  in the recesses of her own mind  as perdita  to replace magrat and carry out the traditional tasks of the maiden  which consist mainly of fetching the tea and getting bullied .  but then magrat had a baby  and so would be qualified to return as mother .  this  however  is nanny ogg   s natural role  seeing as she has had fifteen children  and revels in an ever growing horde of grandchildren and great grandchildren .  in literal years  nanny belongs to the same generation as granny  but in these matters it is not literal facts that count .  it is no accident that her cottage is called tir nani ogg  which  as tiffany aching rightly suspects  means    the land of the ever young     tir nan og  in the ancient celtic speech which the nac mac feegles brought to the discworld     and not  regrettably     nanny ogg   s place     wintersmith  .   it is understandable that when it seemed that granny might be about to withdraw from witching  nanny disliked the consequences for herself     can   t say i fancy being a crone .  i ain   t the right shape and anyway i don   t know the sound they make .      so  for the present at least  the threesome is a quartet  and who stands for what still has to be sorted out .  nevertheless  granny and nanny have grown into their roles during the course of the series  nanny is the notionally soft big hearted one  an expert on midwifery  while granny is the one you will  with some trepidation  call in when death is in the air .       borrowing is not shape changing   granny weatherwax is the most skilful borrowing witch in all lancre .  while her body lies cold and rigid in her bed  her mind goes off and borrows the consciousness of any bird or animal she chooses .  steering it gently  she sees with its eyes  feels its pleasures and fears and appetites  absorbs any knowledge it has .  in due course she guides it into her bedroom  and quietly slips out of its mind .  then she has a short lie down  just to get used to the feel of her own body again .  and then  since things have to balance  for the next few days she will put out some food for the creature whose mind she entered .   she is so skilled that she has even borrowed a swarm of bees      she   s going to swank about this for weeks     said nanny ogg .     no one   s ever done it with bees .  their mind   s everywhere  see .  not just in one bee .  in the whole swarm .         i done it with beezzz .  no one can do it with beezzz  and i done it .  you endzzz up with your mind all flying in different directionzzz .  you got to be good to do it with beezzz .      lords and ladies   which also goes to show that some of what you   ve borrowed stays with you for a while  such as  in this case  a certain confusion in the vocal cords  plus a need for a bunch of flowers  a pot of honey  and someone to sting .  the bees themselves     or the owl  bat  hare  or whatever     remain almost unaware that a human mind has been riding them .  at least  that is how it should be .  if someone ruthless does it  an elf queen for example  she goes through the animal   s mind like a chainsaw  leaving it half crazed .   there are dangers  of course .  no magical procedure is without risks .  a young inexperienced witch with a natural talent can become so intoxicated by the joy of borrowing that she sinks too deep in  and stays there .  so can an old one  come to that .  for years nanny ogg used to put out lumps of fat and bacon rind for a bluetit that she was sure was old granny postalute  who went out borrowing and never came back .  even granny weatherwax knows that she must be careful .  it   s addictive  like a drug .   there is also the practical problem that someone might mistake your body for a corpse  and pop it into a coffin before you can get back .  to avoid this embarrassment  granny weatherwax always holds  in her rigid hands  a small card which says i ate   nt dead .   not all discworld witches are able  or willing  to borrow  while on earth the skill is almost unknown .  there  one of the very few accounts of what appears to be a borrowing witch comes from st briavels in gloucestershire  and was reported in the journal folk lore in      .  there was a girl there who  for some reason  had to share a bed one night with a certain old woman and her daughter .   during the night she happened to wake  and was alarmed to feel how very cold the old woman was .  she shook her  but in vain .  so she then woke the daughter  crying     i do believe your mother   s dead .            dead .     laughed the daughter .     her bain   t dead  her be out and about now .      shape changing witches  on the other hand  are extremely common in the lore of this world .  the difference is that whereas a borrower sends her separated mind to    ride    in an animal  which has its own real existence  before  during and after the process   the shape changer changes herself entirely  body and mind together  into the appearance of an animal .  there is no real animal there at all  simply the transformed witch .   witches of the earth could turn into any animal they wanted  but hares seem to have been the favourites  with cats a close second .  being a hare was especially good fun because it gave them the chance to infuriate huntsmen .  stories about this were told throughout britain well into the twentieth century  for instance one which was collected by members of a local women   s institute for their book it happened in hampshire          when i was a boy  they did say there was a woman over to breamore that could turn herself to a hare up there on the downs .  if the dogs did press her too much she could turn herself back again and they wouldn   t see nothing but a woman combing her hair .  one day the dogs were after her  just as she was getting near her cottage .  she did shoot through the keyhole  but they were after her .  the children cried out     run  granny  run .  or the dogs   ll have    ee .     but her was up on the top of the old brick oven so they never had her .  whether    twas true or whether it wasn   t  that is what i did hear when i was a boy .   the witch hare did not always escape .  if the hounds were particularly fast  or if the huntsman was a good shot with a bullet made from a silver sixpence  she might get bitten or shot in the rump as she bolted indoors .  and next day everyone would see that she was limping badly .   people on the discworld have heard about this somehow  and those who do not understand granny weatherwax sometimes think this is what she gets up to .  thatcher the carter  for instance      cor  she frightens the life out of me  her .  the way she looks right through you .  i wouldn   t say a word against her  mark you  a fine figure of a woman  but they do say she creeps around the place o    nights  as a hare or a bat or something .  changes her shape and all .  not that i believes a word of it  but old weezen over in slice told me once he shot a hare in the leg one night and next day she passed him on the lane and said    ouch    and gave him a right ding across the back of his head .      lords and ladies   in equal rites  there is an argument on this point between esk  an intelligent little girl  and her brothers gulta and cern      they say     said gulta     she can turn herself into a fox .  or anything .  a bird  even .  anything .  that   s how she always knows what   s going on .  they say there   s a whole family over crack peak way that can turn themselves into wolves .  because one night someone shot a wolf and next day their auntie was limping with an arrow wound in her leg  and            i don   t think people can turn themselves into animals     said esk  slowly .      oh yes  miss clever .         granny is quite big .  if she turned herself into a fox what would happen to all the bits that wouldn   t fit .         she   d just magic them away     said cern .      i don   t think magic works like that     said esk .   but occasionally  very occasionally  granny does shape shift  or appears to do so .  this happened during her confrontation with archchancellor cutangle of unseen university  as described in equal rites .  the archchancellor had unwisely hurled white fire at her  and she had deflected it towards the roof .  then   cutangle vanished .  where he had been standing a huge snake coiled  poised to strike .   granny vanished .  where she had been standing was a large wicker basket .   the snake became a giant reptile from the mists of time .   the basket became the snow wind of the ice giants  coating the struggling monster with ice .   the reptile became a sabre toothed tiger  crouched to spring .   the gale became a bubbling tar pit .   the tiger managed to become an eagle  stooping .   the tar pit became a tufted hood      this is what students of folklore on the earth have labelled the transformation combat .  a typical instance would be the battle recorded in the medieval icelandic saga of sturlaug starfsama  between an icelandic youth and a lapland wizard .  to the bewilderment of the observers   they set upon one another and fought fiercely  so swiftly that they could not be followed with the eye  but neither managed to wound the other .  when men looked again  they had vanished  and in their place were two dogs  biting one another furiously  and when they least expected it  the dogs disappeared too  and they heard a noise going on in the air .  they looked up and saw two eagles flying there  and each tore out the other   s feathers with claws and beak so that blood fell onto the earth .  the end was that one fell dead to the ground  but the other flew away  and they did not know which one it was .   that was a well matched fight  but sometimes one of the magicians is simply trying to escape .  a medieval welsh tale tells how the witch ceridwen has spent a year and a day boiling a magic potion .  she sets a boy called gwion to keep the fire going under the cauldron .  but the potion splutters  and three scalding drops splash gwion   s finger  so he automatically sucks it     and all the magic power becomes his .  he flees  in the form of a hare .  the furious ceridwen turns into a greyhound .  he runs to the river  and changes into a fish .  she chases him  as an otter .  he becomes a small bird  she a hawk .  he becomes a grain of wheat  and she a high crested black hen     and swallows him .  and that  ceridwen must have thought  was that .  but not so .  the grain of corn made her pregnant  and the son she bore  who was really gwion  grew up to be the great seer and poet taliesin .   it is interesting that in her contest with cutangle  granny weatherwax does not counter attack aggressively  but chooses forms which restrain and control .  for the snake  an indian snake charmer   s basket  for the dinosaur  a coating of ice  for the tiger  sticky tar  for the eagle  a falconer   s hood .  granny is always a careful minimalist in the magic arts .       changing the shapes of others   throughout the multiverse  there is a persistent story that if you annoy a witch she will utter a curse which turns you into some small and unpleasant animal  probably a frog .  and an animal you will be for ever  unless somebody finds a way to break the spell .  this idea is common in fairy tales and old ballads  where the witch is quite often the victim   s wicked stepmother .  in this world  there used to be people who seriously believed that a witch might change you temporarily into a horse  if she wanted to ride to a sabbat .  at pendle in lancashire in       according to the records of a witch trial there  a young boy accused a neighbour of having done this to him .  he later admitted he was lying .   the annals of the discworld record only three clear instances of such a transformation .  one occurred when the malicious witch lilith of genua turned two coachmen into beetles  and trod on them  as told in witches abroad .  the second case concerns the talking toad which is the familiar of miss perspicacia tick  a witch of the chalk country  see the wee free men   though initially suffering from memory loss  he later recalls that he was once a human lawyer  who foolishly took a witch to court for supplying substandard magic .  the third was when tiffany  under the influence of the hiver  turned a useless wizard  brian  into a frog  as described in a hatful of sky .  admittedly  there have also been one or two occasions when granny weatherwax messed with someone   s head  causing him to believe that he was a frog  but she knew the effect would wear off fairly soon .   what is far more common on the disc is the reverse process  where a witch uses her power to transform an animal   s outward appearance  and  to a lesser extent  its behaviour  into that of a human .  but here too the result is unstable .  the three witches of lancre encountered some nasty examples of this type of magic when they travelled to genua  as told in witches abroad      the work of lilith  real name lily   whose hobby was to enslave the wills of those around her and force them to re enact the plots of fairy tales  whether they wanted to or not .  she  meanwhile  kept all true power in her own hands  because she was the one in charge of the stories .  as part of her plans  she had turned a swamp frog into a prince     but the spell held only during daylight hours  so at night he turned back into his old shape  and had to have a pond in his bedroom .  lilith also turned two snakes into apparent women  to guard the potential heroine of the tale she was concocting  and mice into horses to draw her coach .   faced with this cruelty  nanny ogg persuades the other two that it is right to fight fire with fire  using her own beloved one eyed cat  greebo  who she thinks is nearly human anyway .     and it   ll only be temp   ry  even with the three of us doing it     she said .  and so the three of them concentrated .   changing the shape of an object is one of the hardest magics there is .  but it   s easier if the object is alive .  after all  a living thing already knows what shape it is .  all you have to do is change its mind .   greebo yawned and stretched .  to his amazement he went on stretching .   through the pathways of his feline brain surged a tide of belief .  he suddenly believed he was human .  he wasn   t simply under the impression he was human  he believed it implicitly .  the sheer force of the unshakeable belief flowed out into his morphic field  overriding its objections  rewriting the very blueprint of his self .   in his human form  greebo is a grinning  swaggering  six foot bully boy in black leather  with a broken nose  an eye patch  and an excitingly lascivious smile .  he is just as keen on fighting and love making as when he was in cat shape .  and there can still be claws on his hands  if he so wishes .  a few hours later he reverts to his natural felinity  but it turns out that he has been left with a problem seldom encountered by cats .  it is one of the laws of magic that no matter how hard a thing is to do  once it has been done it becomes a whole lot easier  and will therefore be done a lot .  for the rest of his life  part of greebo   s soul knows that he has one extra option for use in a fight  and that is  become human .  he has become a spontaneous shape changer  even if the effect never lasts long     fortunately for him  and for others .       the dis organization of witches   there have been times and places in the multiverse when people got really paranoid about witches .  for about three hundred years in most countries of europe  they felt sure that there was a huge conspiracy of malevolent women  hundreds of whom would gather to hold sabbats where they worshipped the powers of evil  plotted magical murder and mayhem  and held unimaginably sexy orgies .  german and swedish witches were said to choose the peak of a bare mountain for these gatherings .   in england  early in the twentieth century  one scholar  margaret murray  maintained that witches had indeed been members of a real secret society  but that they did no harm     all they were doing was to keep an old religion going  honouring gods and goddesses of earth and moon  of sex and seasons and crops .  she claimed that they were tightly organized into covens of thirteen  and had been holding exactly the same ceremonies to mark the seasons on the same dates all over europe for hundreds of years .  nobody seems to have reminded her that spring in  say  italy doesn   t come in on the same date as in  say  sweden  weather being rather more relevant to the idea of a    season    than the mathematics of the calendar .   nowadays  historians and folklorists think murray   s theory is an elaborate house of cards built up on hardly any evidence at all .  on the other hand  a whole new religion called wicca sprang up in england in the mid twentieth century  based on her ideas .  wiccans worship the powers of nature as personified by a triple goddess and a horned god  and yes  many of them do gather in groups of thirteen .  they tend to say that it doesn   t matter too much what the facts of history may have been .  what matters is whether their magic works for them .   whatever may or may not have happened on this planet  the true witches of lancre don   t form covens and secret societies  and they don   t go in for sabbats .  they are totally dis organized  though they do hold periodic competitive witch trials  where each can display her skills .  each is an individual  working in her own way  and often alone  though when she grows old she will probably take on a girl and train her  in exchange for a bit of help with the housework   so as to hand over the area to her when she dies .  even those witches who act as a threesome only do so on the understanding that the arrangement is entirely voluntary and non hierarchical .  except  naturally  that granny weatherwax gives the orders  and magrat makes the tea .   your average witch is not  by nature  a social animal as far as other witches are concerned .  there   s a conflict of dominant personalities .  there   s a group of ringleaders without a ring .  there   s the basic unwritten rule of witchcraft  which is    don   t do what you will  do what i say .     the natural size of a coven is one .  witches only get together when they can   t avoid it .   witches abroad   yet something of the notion of a coven has leached into the discworld  particularly affecting the minds of beginners in the craft .  in her younger days  magrat yearned for one   it had seemed such a lovely idea .  she   d had great hopes of the coven .  she was sure it wasn   t right to be a witch alone  you could get funny ideas .  she   d dreamed of wise discussions of natural energies while a huge moon hung in the sky  and then possibly they   d try a few of the old dances described in some of goodie whemper   s books .  not actually naked  or skyclad as it was rather delightfully called     that wasn   t absolutely necessary      what she hadn   t expected was a couple of crotchety old women who were barely civil at the best of times and simply didn   t enter into the spirit of things .   wyrd sisters   occasionally  there were lancre girls who preferred a more intellectual and ritualistic kind of magic  more like wizardry     the kind which involves chalk circles and cones of power and candles and tarot cards  and which promises spectacular displays  on earth  it   s often called high magick  .  such a girl has had an education .  she probably wears a big floppy black hat  and black lace  and lots of occult silver jewellery .  she paints her fingernails black .  she adopts a new  flamboyant name .  arrogant and domineering  she creates a coven which she runs entirely to suit herself  bullying and mocking her followers .  one such girl was diamanda  real name lucy tockley   who thought she could challenge granny weatherwax  and became dangerously involved with elves  as is told in lords and ladies .       the tools of the craft   young witches tend to attach too much importance to their tools .  magrat  for instance  at the start of her career  used to read grimoires  drew sigils on her cottage walls  and owned a fine assortment of wands  robes  crystals  grails  crucibles  magical knives  mystic coloured cords  candles  incense  and occult jewellery  including bracelets bearing the hermetic symbols of a dozen religions .   she would have felt quite at home among the wiccans and neo pagans of earth today  in a society where a pentacle is just another ornament  fifty years ago most people would simply think you were jewish but hadn   t thought to count the points on your star .    but older witches avoid showy items of magical equipment .  crystal balls  for example .  granny weatherwax loathes crystal balls  especially big expensive quartz ones     never could get the hang of this damn silicon stuff .  a bowl of water with a drop of ink in it was good enough when i was a girl     .  instead  both she and nanny ogg use old green glass ones  which had once been buoys for fishing nets .   pondering on this fact  young agnes nitt sees that there are good historical reasons for it .   a glass fishing float  five hundred miles from the sea .  an ornament  like a shell .  not a crystal ball .  you could use it like a crystal ball  but it wasn   t a crystal ball     and she knew why that was important     witches hadn   t always been popular .  there might even be times     there had been times  long ago     when it was a good idea not to advertise what you were  and that was why all these things on the table didn   t betray their owner at all .  there was no need for that any more  there hadn   t been in lancre for hundreds of years  but some habits get passed down in the blood .   in fact things now worked the other way .  being a witch was an honourable trade in the mountains  but only the young ones invested in real crystal balls and coloured knives and dribbly candles .  the old ones     they stuck with simple kitchen cutlery  fishing floats  bits of wood  whose very ordinariness subtly advertised their status .  any fool can be a witch with a runic knife  but it took skill to be one with an apple corer .   carpe jugulum   there are practical reasons too .  if you believe that a spell will only work if you wear your robes and use the right coloured ink on the right kind of parchment while burning the right kind of incense on the right day of the week  you will be helpless if an emergency arises and you don   t have all your paraphernalia at hand .  the three lancre witches once needed to invoke a demon  but as they were in nanny ogg   s washhouse at the time magrat protested      oh  but you can   t .  not here .  you need a cauldron  and a magic sword .  and an octogram .  and spices  and all sorts of stuff .      granny and nanny exchanged glances .      it   s not her fault     said granny .     it   s all them grimmers she was bought .     she turned to magrat .      you don   t need none of that     she said .     you need headology .     she looked around the ancient washroom .      you just use whatever you   ve got     she said .   wyrd sisters   and in fact the demon was successfully summoned by means of a copper  its paddle  a scrubbing brush  a washboard  and a lump of soap .  magrat learned the lesson well  and not long afterwards was able to bring surging life back into the long dead timbers of a dungeon door  by sheer force of imagination and will  with no artificial aids whatsoever .   yet tools can be very  very useful for impressing the client  especially when combined with a few little white lies .  take healing  for example .  magrat is a good healer because she knows a lot about herbs  but granny is an even better one because of her skill in stage management and the use of props .  she gives people a bottle of coloured water  tells them they feel better  and they do .  as she explains to young esk      i saved a man   s life once .  special medicine  twice a day .  boiled water with a bit of berry juice in it .  told him i   d bought it from the dwarves .  that   s the biggest part of doct   rin  really .  most people   ll get over most things if they put their minds to it  you just have to give them an interest .      equal rites   similarly on earth  the village healers who were known as    cunning folk    or    wise women    knew just how important it was to add a touch of drama .  in county clare in ireland in the nineteenth century there was a woman called biddy early with a great reputation as a healer .  she used all sorts of herbal brews  but what impressed people most was the small blue bottle which she kept always at hand  and used as a focus for her second sight when she was scrying  which is the same as crystal gazing  only without the crystal  .  when a sick person came to consult her she would shake it  stare fixedly into its cloudy depths  and then tell him what ailed him  and what he must do to get well .  some said this bottle had been given to her by fairies .  it is said  too  that on her death bed she made her family swear to throw it into a lake  on pain of some terrible curse if they disobeyed .  so they did  but as soon as she was dead they hurried down to the lake to fish it out again     after all  she hadn   t expressly told them not to  had she .  but they never found it  and though many people have tried  no one has yet .  at least  that is one story  another is that the parish priest threw it into the lake .  and there is another  which says that later on  a dark stranger appeared in the village  went to the lake and     but that   s another story  and stories cling to biddy like iron filings to a magnet .  there is a consensus that she was born in county clare in      and died in kilbarron  near feakle  in      .  in between  she has become folded and moulded by narrativium  and defined by the kind of accounts that begin     i heard tell when i was a boy    .  in short  for the purposes of this book  she could be thought of as granny weatherwax and nanny ogg rolled into one .  by all accounts she had a fine grasp of practical psychology as well as some expertise in folk medicine  and was famous for her cures  she was said to have got her powers from the fairies or some similar    sponsor    and probably did nothing to discourage this belief .  she liked a drink  too  and when it came to payment she was on the whiskey and chickens standard .  she must also have liked men  because she had four husbands .   nowadays  if you go looking for    biddy early   s cottage     you will eventually be directed to a lonely  tumbledown building at the far end of a weed choked path .  you will find that others have been there before you  leaving their tokens on windowsill and doorstep     coins  flowers  strips of cloth  candles  beer bottles .  she is not forgotten .   in fact biddy early needs a book of her own  and our bibliography has at least two .       of hats and brooms   there is of course the pointy hat .  and the broomstick .  every discworld witch uses these  and as far as we know they always have .  yet the broomstick is merely a convenience  and the hat is not in itself magical .  its secret     and it is one of the great secrets of witchcraft     lies elsewhere .  when granny challenges clever young esk to discover it  esk examines the hat carefully .   there was nothing particularly strange about it  except that no one in the village had one like it .  but that didn   t make it magical     it was just a typical witch   s hat .  granny always wore it when she went into the village  but in the forest she just wore a leather hood         i think i know     she said at last .      out with it  then .         it   s sort of in two parts .         well .         it   s a witch   s hat because you wear it .  but you   re a witch because you wear the hat .  um .         so        prompted granny .      so people see you coming in the hat and the cloak and they know you   re a witch and that   s why your magic works .      equal rites   on earth too  some people who practised magic for a living appreciated the value of eye catching clothes and headgear  though there was no uniform style .  there was mother redcap  for instance  a fortune teller in camden town in london in the seventeenth century  whose appearance was definitely eccentric .  she was strikingly ugly  kept a huge black cat  and always wore the red bonnet which gave her her nickname  plus a grey shawl with strange black patches .  from a distance  they looked like flying bats .  then there was billy brewer  the most famous fortune teller and magical healer in nineteenth century somerset  who practised in taunton from the     s till his death in      and called himself the wizard of the west  he went about the streets wearing a long inverness cloak  a tattered brown wig  and a sombrero  with gold and silver rings glittering on every finger .  this did wonders for his reputation .   in the matter of pointy hats and broomsticks  it is a curious fact that nowadays  as soon as you say    witch    people just see the hat and the broom  and yet three hundred years ago they were very  very rare .  many people believed that witches could fly through the air  but they were said to do this by riding on all kinds of everyday objects and animals  not just brooms .  the fashion for broomsticks began in late medieval france and flanders  and only started spreading after about       in germany  cooking sticks were preferred  in britain  pitchforks and hurdles .  in russian fairy tales  there   s the famous witch baba yaga  a child eating ogress who lives in the forest  she often travels high above the tree tops  sitting in an iron kettle or a stone mortar .   as for the hat  nobody  in all the witch trials of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries  ever stepped into court and said     i know she   s a witch because she wears a pointy hat .     no paintings  prints or pamphlets of that period show it  if a witch is wearing any headgear at all  it is that of ordinary everyday dress .  but then things change .  if we look at william hogarth   s cartoon of      which mocks    credulity  superstition and fanaticism     we can see a preacher brandishing a doll dressed as a witch .  she   s an ugly old woman .  in a pointy hat .  astride a broom .  something remarkable must have happened  since hogarth obviously expected everybody to know what his picture meant .  and that was only the beginning  because now there are broomsticks  black cloaks and pointy hats in every toyshop in the run up to halloween .  they are spreading fast  even in countries which had never heard of them fifty years ago .  in sweden  for instance  until quite recently witches wore aprons and head scarves when they gathered for their annual great sabbat  held at easter   but now it   s cloaks and pointy hats for them too .   so what can have happened .  there can only be one explanation     this costume was invented on the discworld and rightfully belongs there  but the image it creates is so powerful that it is seeping out across the multiverse  and before long people will recognize it in every other world there is .       so what do witches actually  do  then .    whatever might be the case elsewhere and elsewhen  in lancre witchcraft is seen as an honourable profession .  witches get respected .  they don   t go in for fancy titles  but use good old fashioned homely names which speak volumes for their solid respectability     dame this  old mother that  gammer t   other  and of course granny and nanny .  it is to them that the village turns when a child or a cow falls desperately sick  when a woman is having a difficult labour  when those who are dying cannot actually die .  it is then that the witch has to bring help     and take responsibility .  nobody knows this better than granny weatherwax .   there were stories that were never to be told  the little secret stories enacted in little rooms      they were about those times when medicines didn   t help and headology was at a loss because a mind was a rage of pain in a body that had become its own enemy  when people were simply in a prison made of flesh  and at times like this she could let them go .  there was no need for desperate stuff with a pillow  or deliberate mistakes with the medicine .  you didn   t push them out of the world  you just stopped the world pulling them back .  you just reached in  and     showed them the way      she   d been a witch here all her life .  and one of the things a witch did was stand right on the edge  where the decisions had to be made .  you made them so that others didn   t have to  so that others could even pretend to themselves that there were no decisions to be made  no little secrets  that things just happened .  you never said what you knew .  and you didn   t ask for anything in return .   carpe jugulum   well  true enough  you didn   t ask  but  as nanny ogg says     there   s ways and ways of not askin     if you get my meaning .  people can be very gen   rous to witches .  they do like to see a happy witch .     and it was indeed amazing how many people would pop round to a witch   s cottage from time to time with a basket of this or a bottle of that  and would volunteer to do a bit of digging  or to check that the chimneys were ok .   magrat once grumbled that granny weatherwax hardly ever did    real magic           what good is being a witch if you don   t do magic .  why doesn   t she use it to help people .      to which nanny ogg replied that it was precisely because she knew how good she would be at it that she didn   t .  nanny meant that magic is power  and where there is power  there is always the temptation to abuse it .  granny steered clear of that temptation  knowing its strength only too well .  moreover  she thought that you could not help people with magic  though you could certainly help them by headology and hard work .   all this is very much like what used to go on on earth up to a hundred years or so ago     maybe even more recently  in some parts .  there were women who knew charms and cures  who told fortunes  who acted as midwives and nurses  who knew what counter spells to use against bewitchment .  and men too .  you could find them in both villages and towns  and their clients came from miles around .  some openly made a career of it  taking payment in cash for their services  others used nanny ogg   s technique  with an edge to it  .  a sussex village witch in the     s  for example  was described to a folklorist in       in the sussex county magazine .   her reputation was very valuable to her .  if she stopped a child and said     what a fine crop of plums your mother had down crabtree lane  dearie     the result would be a basket of the best plums  as otherwise the tree would wither and die .  so she kept herself provided with good things .   but you had to be careful what you called such people  since on earth the word    witch    so often meant someone who uses magic to harm  not to help .  it was more polite to say    wise woman        white witch        charmer        cunning man     even    wizard        and latterly a    district nurse    .  but shorn of the little nods to superstition  what they had and have in common has been a certain strength of character  practical experience and the ability to take charge of a situation .   yet  in spite of these parallels  there are important differences between magical practitioners in the two universes .   the most far reaching concerns the source of their power .  on the earth it was generally assumed that magic power must originate in some non human source  and that the witch had received it as a gift or reward  or through some pact or bargain .  those who feared and hated witches accused them of having pledged their souls to devils .  some of the more learned magicians boasted that their knowledge came from angels and spirits .  some scottish wise women claimed they had been taught charms and remedies by elves  whom they would visit in the hollow hills  or by the dead .  in other lands  gods and the spirits of ancestors were the power sources .   the witches of lancre have no such ideas .  their skill and power are their own innate gifts  carefully honed by practice and observation .  they have no dealings with the gods or the dead  despise demons  and rightly regard elves as dangerous and evil .  nor do they depend on    familiars    to act on their behalf  as earthly witches were said to do     these being minor demons  usually in the form of toads  mice  or cats  who were loaned to witches by the devil and would perform magical tasks in exchange for a few drops of blood .   the cat greebo is no demon  he is nothing more  and nothing less  than a cat .  miss tick   s toad appears to have no magical abilities at all  his power of speech is merely the residue of his previous human faculties .    another major difference is that on the discworld witches undertake one dangerous duty that    our    witches have no idea of .  it is their responsibility to defend their homeland against insidious supernatural invasions .  blatant attacks by creatures from the dungeon dimensions are usually dealt with by the wizards of unseen university  who can be relied on to recognize a tentacular threat when it turns up on their doorstep  but it takes a witch to fight the more subtle menace of vampires or elves .  their epic struggles on behalf of lancre are recounted in lords and ladies and carpe jugulum .  never  in the field of inter species conflict  was so much owed by so many to so few .  but do the people of lancre appreciate this .  do they  hell .  they don   t even notice .  which is perhaps how it should be .       wicked witches   the witches of lancre remember stories about other witches long ago  or maybe not so long ago  whom they disapprove of .  witches who have gone to the bad  who have crossed over to the dark side .  there is something of the dark in the weatherwax heredity  and granny was for a long time worried about her own nana  alison weatherwax  who disappeared in uberwald and was rumoured to have hobnobbed with vampires .  fortunately  the rumour was false .  she didn   t hobnob with them  she staked them .   then there was black aliss .  not exactly a bad witch  but so powerful that one couldn   t really tell the difference  and deeply affected by narrative patterns similar to those which the brothers grimm recorded on earth .  magrat asked about her once .      she was before your time     said nanny ogg .     before mine  really .  she lived over skund way .  very powerful witch .         if you listen to rumour     said granny .      she turned a pumpkin into a royal coach once     said nanny .      showy     said granny weatherwax .     that   s no help to anyone  turning up at a ball smelling like a pie .  and that business with the glass slipper .  dangerous  to my mind .         but the biggest thing she ever did     said nanny  ignoring the interruption     was to send a whole palace to sleep for a hundred years until        she hesitated .     can   t remember .  was there rose bushes involved  or was it spinning wheels in that one .             why did they call her black aliss .         fingernails     said granny .      and teeth     said nanny ogg .     she had a sweet tooth .  lived in a real gingerbread cottage .  couple of kids shoved her in her own oven at the end .  shocking .      wyrd sisters   one sign that things weren   t quite right with black aliss was that she used to cackle .  so one day when granny weatherwax uttered a cackle  though she swore it was just a rather rough chuckle   nanny ogg warned her      you want to watch out that you don   t end up the same way as she did .  she went a bit funny at the finish  you know .  poisoned apples and suchlike .      wyrd sisters   but black aliss wasn   t really bad  not out and out bad .  it was just that she got so involved in old stories     those rural myths that happen over and over again and everyone knows about     that they sent her weird in the head  so she lost track of what was real and what wasn   t .     i mean  she didn   t ever really eat anyone     said nanny .     well .  not often .  i mean  there was talk  but         her name can   t have helped  for names shape people  and this one carries sinister echoes drifting across from the earth .  there  in the city of leicester  a hideous hag called black annis lived in a cave in the dane hills  just outside the town .  she had a dark blue face  and her nails were long sharp talons .  there can be no doubt that she ate people     naughty children mostly  but good ones too if they stayed out late .  she would lurk in a tree overhanging the mouth of her cave  ever ready to spring like a wild beast on any stray children passing below  then she would scratch them to death with her claws  suck their blood  and hang up their skins to dry .  if memories from black annis   s mind had infected black aliss  it   s a wonder that she didn   t become far more wicked than she did .   names shape people .  when a young witch gives herself a new name  it tells you who and what she wants to be     who and what she will inevitably become .  most times  all it means is a little vanity  a little snobbishness and misplaced romance .  if a girl named violet prefers to be    magenta     or an agnes becomes    perdita     that does no great harm .  but if a lucy turns into a    diamanda     that shows she   s already a bright  hard little bitch  and intends to become brighter and harder .   so what of that most powerful and evil of witches  who began her life in lancre as plain lily weatherwax  but took the name lilith when she moved to genua .  how did it come into her mind .  surely it must have arrived as a particle of inspiration  originating in a parallel universe .  for in earthly myth and legend    lilith    is the name of a terrible female demon  noted for pride as well as cruelty .  it is said that she was adam   s first wife  but refused to submit to his authority and fled from eden into the desert  where she consorted with demons and became a demon herself .  ever since  she has exploited her beauty by seducing sleeping men in their dreams  and satisfied her cruelty by killing women in childbirth and strangling young babies .  she feeds on their blood and sucks the marrow from their bones .  and so  in her own way  does lilith of genua .  she takes people   s lives and twists them  sucking away their will power and personality  forcing them into the patterns of old stories where she  and she alone  is in control .  yet all the time she is enslaving them  she convinces herself that she is the good godmother  the good witch .  and if that   s not being a wicked witch  what is .       chapter     the land of  lancre      lancre landmarks   the dancers   when people have lived in the same place for generations  they know every inch of the countryside as if it were their own backyard  which it often is .  they like things to have reasons  a name  a history  an explanation .  particularly an explanation .  everything inexplicable demands an explanation .  narrativium takes over  the land becomes filled with stories  and the result is a fine crop of folklore .  on the discworld the process is most obvious in lancre and on the chalk  though much the same thing would be found in every country if anyone went to look .   of course  there are always people who wouldn   t take a folk tale seriously even if it jumped up and bit them  which  given the power of narrativium  it might quite well do  .  consider the case of eric wheelbrace  that most resolute and rational of ramblers  now alas missing and presumed dead .  among interesting features noted in his essay    lancre  gateway to the ramtops     included in a tourist guide to lancre   he briefly mentions the dancers  a group of standing stones on a small area of moorland about midway between lancre river and the ramtops   there are eight of them  in a circle wide enough to throw a stone across .  they are reddish  about man height  and barely thicker than a man as well .  local legend has it that they are a gateway into the kingdom of the elves but the truth is likely to be much more prosaic .  they are typical of a style of silicon chronograph constructed in the dawn of time by our ignorant forebears .  basically  they are an underused resource  and i for one intend to organize a lancre music and dance festival next year  based round the stones  which are in a perfect location for that sort of activity .  it is my belief that the stories are put about by the locals in order to keep people away  but we will not be deterred .   a tourist guide to lancre   oh deary  deary me .  eight of them  a magic number .  and called the dancers  too  with a piper and a drummer among them .  this looks very much like a warning that something eldritch happened there in the olden days  and maybe could happen again .  the witches have done their best to make sure everyone avoids the place .  even the more stupid locals have some notion of the dangers      i remember an old story about this place     said baker .     some man went to sleep up here once  when he was out hunting .         so what .  i can do that     said carter .     i go to sleep every night  reg   lar .         ah  but this man  when he woke up and went home  his wife was carrying on with someone else and all his children had grown up and didn   t know who he was .      lords and ladies   these weird tricks of time always happen when someone is taken out of their own world into elfland  as we noted in an earlier chapter .  but in what sense are the stones themselves dancers .  since the locals didn   t tell wheelbrace  or if they did he wasn   t listening  we must look to the earth for the explanation  thanks to some of those remarkable parallels and echoes between one universe and another .   stone circles are powerful or  at least  become cloaked in powerful stories .  in various parts of england     cornwall  devon  dorset  derbyshire     there are circles of stones known as the nine ladies or nine maidens or merry maidens .  there may or may not actually be nine of them  it   s a magical number  like eight is on the disc   but their story is everywhere the same  there were once some girls who loved dancing so much that they would go off to the hills to dance together whenever they could  even on sundays when they should have been in church .  so one sunday they were smitten by the wrath of god  which turned them to stone .  no more dancing for them     except maybe for the ones near okehampton in devon  where  some people say  they are allowed to take a few steps every day at noon .  sometimes one stone in the circle  or close beside it  is named the piper or fiddler  it is said he was playing the music for the girls to dance to  and was smitten too .   back in lancre  eric wheelbrace insisted that there was a right of way across the dancers  and that he would organize his festival there .  dismissing local objections as mere superstition  and declaring that a determined rambler will laugh with scorn at threats  he set off to cross the circle one midsummer eve .  his boots were found frozen solid  in a hedge a mile away .  he has presumably now discovered that the dancers are indeed  as legend claims     a gateway into the kingdom of the elves     and he may even understand that such gates are meant to be kept shut .  that   s why the stones chosen for the job are reddish and magnetic  they contain a good deal of iron  a tried and trusted elf repellent .       the standing stone   on the crest of a moor in the ramtops  there is a solitary bluish standing stone  well  sometimes there is  .  it is a painfully shy megalith  so although there is only one of it  nobody has ever been able to count it .  if it sees anyone approaching with a calculating look  it shuffles off to hide among the gorse bushes or flops into a peat bog .  there are rumours that other huge standing stones on the moor are mobile too  but are too keen on their privacy to let themselves be seen when on the move .   the folklore of earth is  as so often  remarkably close to the facts of the disc .  it is almost commonplace on earth to be told that at midnight  or at dawn  a particular standing stone will spin round on its base  or dance  or walk down to the river to drink .  but if someone tells you about this  do listen carefully     it could be folklore  or it could be a leg pull .  if what he said was     that stone turns round whenever it hears the church clock strike midnight     he   s speaking a very literal kind of truth  and what you have to ask yourself is     how often does a stone hear a clock .     never  actually .  that   s the leg pull .  on the other hand  if what he said was     that stone turns round when the church clock strikes midnight     he   s folk  and that   s lore .   as for counting  earthly megaliths absolutely hate being counted  and will do anything to prevent it .  stonehenge used to be very good at this     a rumour got around that anyone who reckoned up its stones and got the number right would be sure to die .  and those who did try got wildly different results .  yet daniel defoe  writing in the     s  said he had seen them counted four times  and each time the total was     the only problem  he thought  was that many were fallen and half buried  so one could not easily tell whether one was seeing two parts of one stone  or two separate stones .  in      the antiquary william stukeley published his count  making it     and exclaiming triumphantly     behold the solution of the mighty problem  the magical spell is broke which has so long perplexed the vulgar .     modern archaeologists disagree with them both  having tidied the place up and mapped it  they have settled on    .   in several places where there are    countless stones     people have had the same bright idea  take a basket of loaves  count them  and put one on top of each stone till you have gone all round the ring  then see how many loaves are left  do a simple sum  and  bingo  that   s it .  this did work with the hurlers in cornwall  but not at stonehenge  nor yet at little kit   s coty in kent .  there  some say  a baker who tried this trick ended up with more loaves than he started out with  others say he completed his calculations but dropped dead before he could announce the result .   some people might suggest that all you need to do is chalk a number on each stone as you go  but somehow that just doesn   t do the trick  lore wise .  it lacks style .  besides  there   s sure to be something that comes creeping up behind you to rub the figures out .       the long man   in a valley a few miles from lancre   s solitary standing stone is an even more significant landmark  the long man .  this name could mislead someone from our world  since here the long man is a giant human figure carved into the chalk of a hillside at wilmington  on the sussex downs .  lancre has no chalk  and hence no hill figures  but it does have plenty of burial mounds     barrows      housing the dead of long gone generations  and sometimes housing the wee free men as well .  some have partly collapsed  exposing their huge stones to the sky  and attracting folklore of their own .  there   s one that   s supposed to be the workplace of an invisible blacksmith  people put a sixpence on the stone and leave a horse there overnight to be shod  just as people of this world used to do at wayland   s smithy on the berkshire downs .  there  this magic worked  or so they say   in lancre  both coin and horse would be gone by morning  people there having more of a sense of humour .   what lancre calls    the long man    is a group of burial mounds close together  two round ones at the foot of a long one .  nanny ogg says that the first time she saw them from the air she laughed so much she nearly fell off her broomstick .  she has also given a pithy description of a much loved lancre custom  the scouring of the long man .   this takes place about every twenty years in early may  when the men and the married women go up to the long man and cut away all the bracken and seedlings which have grown up since the last scouring .  says nanny     unmarried girls ain   t allowed to join in  but it   s amazin    what a good view you can get from up a tree and if you ain   t got brothers you can get an education there which will prevent surprises later in life .  when it   s decently dark there   s a pig roast and then people wander off and make their own entertainment .      a tourist guide to lancre   if the memories of nanny ogg   s great grandmother can be trusted  things had been a good deal wilder in the old days  when the menfolk used to go up to the long man for strange rites which no woman ever saw  unless  being an ogg  she hid in the bushes       she said they just used to build sweat lodges and smell like a blacksmith   s armpit and drink scumble and dance around the fire with horns on and piss in the trees any old how .  she said it was a bit cissy  to be honest .  but i always reckon a man   s got to be a man  even if it is cissy .      lords and ladies   in lancre town  as eric wheelbrace notes  one can buy    vulgar and inappropriate souvenirs which allegedly depict the long man and some of the legends attached to it    .  well  well .   there is nothing on the earth which fully matches the three dimensional majesty of lancre   s long man  where  as nanny ogg puts it  the landscape itself is boasting     i   ve got a great big tonker .     the poor old long man of wilmington  in fact  has no tonker at all .  in dorset  however  there is the cerne abbas giant  which is the outline of a huge man with an erect penis  carved into the chalk .  it requires to be scoured every seven years  to keep it clear of grass and weeds .  there is a strong local tradition that couples who want a child but have failed to conceive should visit the giant and make love at the appropriate spot .  we are not certain if an appointment is required .   the scouring of lancre   s long man  though  would seem to have more in common with the periodical scouring of the white horse  a magnificent and very ancient figure carved into a hillside near uffington in berkshire  see the section on the chalk  .  on irregular occasions the horse was cleaned up  and this became the occasion for a fair and games such as chasing cheeses down a hill  climbing the greasy pole  cudgelling  wrestling and  as the ale and the sun both went down  brawling  drunkenness and  after dark     making your own entertainment    .   but there is more to lancre   s long man     much  much more .  at the foot of the long mound three large irregular stones form a low cave .  one wall has a drawing scratched on it  showing an owl eyed man wearing an animal skin and horns  who appears to be dancing .  a shaman  performing a magical hunting ritual .  a god  half human and half beast .  a shaman  dressed as this god .  whoever and whatever he is  he has an identical twin brother on earth  painted several thousand years ago on the wall of the trois fr  res cave in the south of france .   force the stones apart  and the opening reveals steps leading down into the vast underground network of the lancre caves .  this too is an entrance to an elf world     but this is the other elf world  the one the queen   s elves don   t talk about  the one which is an integral part of lancre  not a malevolent  parasitic universe .  a spiral path goes further and further down under the long man  till one comes to a hot  dark  steamy tent of skins  a shaman   s sweat lodge .  there  sprawled half asleep beside a bowl of red hot stones  lies the huge figure of the antlered one  the only god for whom nanny ogg has a soft spot .  he is the lord of the elves  the queen   s estranged husband  at nanny   s request  he forces the queen to give up her attack on lancre  as described in lords and ladies .   will shakespeare  whose finely tuned mind often unconsciously picked up the particles of information which drift from one universe to another  echoed the strained relations between the elf queen and her husband when he described the quarrel of titania and oberon in his play a midsummer night   s dream .  yet he had no inkling of the true nature and appearance of the antlered elf lord .  in fact  it is less than a hundred years since this image began to coalesce in the imaginations of english witches and pagans .  it has been built up out of bits and pieces of various myths  some far older than others     the figure in the trois fr  res cave  the greek pan  the celtic antlered god cernunnos  the medieval idea that the devil has bull   s horns and goat   s feet .  plus the fact that horns are a natural  universal symbol of a male animal   s strength and sexuality .  put all this together  and you get what modern witches call the horned god     the incarnation of maleness  the personification of the ever renewed vital force of nature .  some now say he is the oldest god man has created .  and on the discworld  he is real .       sleeping warriors   there are other things too in the labyrinthine lancre caves  for these are one of those areas where the normal rules of time and space do not apply .  when nanny ogg goes there with the dwarf casanunda  they pass a certain cavern   there were hundreds of dust covered slabs ranged around the cavern in a spiral  at the centre of the spiral was a huge bell  suspended on a rope that disappeared into the darkness of the ceiling .  just under the hanging bell was one pile of silver coins and one pile of gold coins .      don   t touch the money     said nanny .        ere  watch this  my dad told me about this  it   s a good trick .      she reached out and tapped the bell very gently  causing a faint ting .   dust cascaded off the nearest slab .  what casanunda had thought was just a carving sat up  in a creaky way .  it was an armed warrior     he focused deepset eyes on nanny ogg .      what bloody tyme d   you call thys  then .         not time yet     said nanny .      what did you goe and bang the bell for .  i don   t know  i haven   t had a wynke of sleep for two hundred years  some sodde alwayes bangs the bell .  go awaye .      the warrior lay back .      it   s some old king and his warriors     whispered nanny as they hurried away .     some kind of magical sleep  i   m told .  some old wizard did it .  they   re supposed to wake up for some final battle when a wolf eats the sun .      lords and ladies   the legend of the sleeping warriors recurs so often that its narrativium drive must be unusually powerful .  on the discworld it has been found in at least three other places  far from lancre .   first  in a huge burial mound on the counterweight continent there are seven thousand terracotta warriors  each seven foot tall  who form an invincible red army when aroused .  their earthly counterparts were discovered by archaeologists some years ago  drawn up in military array in pits all round an emperor   s grave in china  wisely  nobody has yet attempted to arouse them .  it is as yet unclear whether the golems who have come to ankh morpork  as is told in making money  and who were last seen digging themselves into trenches round the city  will be taking on a similar role .  secondly  inside a hill at holy wood  there is a gigantic knight in golden armour lying on a dusty slab in front of a silver screen  and beside him is the gong to wake him .  and thirdly  in the limestone caverns under koom valley  there is the kings    cave  where dwarf king and troll king  encased in stalactites  sit eternally at their game of thud  as they were when death overtook them   there was the dwarf king  slumped forward across the board  glazed by the eternal drip  his beard now rock and at one with the stone  but the diamond king had remained upright in death  his skin gone cloudy  and you could still see the game in front of him .  it was his move  a healthy little stalactite hung from his outstretched hand .   thud .    many european traditions tell of an ancient king who lies asleep inside a mountain .  some say he will awake in the hour of his country   s greatest need  and return to save his people  others  that when he wakes it means the end of the world is near .  in france  he is charlemagne  in britain  king arthur  in denmark  holger danske  in germany  the emperor frederick barbarossa     red beard     .  barbarossa is in mount kyffhausen   he sits on a bench at a round stone table  resting his head on his hand  sleeping  nodding his head and blinking his eyes .  his beard has grown long     according to some  right through the stone table .  but according to others  the beard grows around the table  and when it has encircled it three times it will be the time of his awakening .  it has now grown around twice .   a shepherd was once led into the mountain by a dwarf .  the emperor rose and asked him     are the ravens still flying round the mountain .     when the shepherd assured him that they were  he cried     now i am going to have to sleep for another hundred years .      german legends of the brothers grimm         no .      transl .  donald ward         in britain  the sleeper is king arthur .  many people claim to know the very place where he and his knights are lying in some cavern under a hill  with their horses and hounds beside them     inside alderley edge in cheshire  inside cadbury hill in somerset  under sewingshields crag in northumberland  under richmond castle in yorkshire  in the eildon hills near edinburgh .  if you can find your way in and reach the place where arthur sleeps  you may see a pile of gold  you are allowed to take some once  but don   t ever go back to get more .  there will certainly be significant objects     maybe a bell  maybe a sheathed sword  a garter  or a horn .  there are just two problems  first  you have to know whether you must or must not touch them in order to wake the king  assuming that is what you want to do   and then  you have to keep your nerve .  so far  things have never worked out properly .  at richmond castle  one man who found his way down to the sleepers    vault saw a sword and a hunting horn .  he drew the sword half out of its scabbard  and the sleepers began to stir  but this terrified him so much that he thrust the blade back .  an angry voice called out   thompson  potter thompson   if you   d drawn the sword or blown the horn   you   d ha    been the luckiest man  that ever yet was born .   the man who got into the vault at sewingshields did a bit better .  he saw a sword  a garter  and a bugle .  he drew the sword right out of the scabbard  and arthur and the knights opened their eyes .  then he cut the garter  and this too was the right thing to do  and they slowly sat up .  but then he stopped .  the spell took hold again  and the king and his warriors sank back on their couches  but not before arthur had cursed the man   o woe betide that evil day  on which this witless wight was born  who drew the sword  the garter cut   but never blew the bugle horn .       the gnarly ground   gnarly ground is hard to see  let alone describe .  there   s a patch of it on the highest part of the moorlands  beyond the forest and among the mountains .  if you look at it in one way  it   s just a pathless stretch of heather and furze  less than a mile across  even if the furze is horribly matted and thorny   and at one point there   s a little stream which has cut a groove among the rocks  scarcely more than a foot deep .  you could easily jump it .  yet somebody has laid a broad stone slab across it  as a bridge .  now look at the scene the other way     you see an endless  nasty looking  desolate expanse  a long  narrow  dizzying bridge spanning a ravine  a raging torrent far below .  they say a deer will sometimes run on to gnarly ground if hard pressed in the hunt  but it has to be pretty desperate .      what is gnarly ground .     said agnes .      there   s a lot of magic in these mountains  right .     said nanny .     and everyone knows mountains get made when lumps of land bang together  right .  well  when the magic gets trapped you     sort of     get a bit of land where the space is     sort of     scrunched up  right .  it   d be quite big if it could  but it   s like a bit of gnarly wood in an ol    tree .  or a used hanky     all folded up small but still big in a different way .      carpe jugulum   in carpe jugulum  granny weatherwax sets out alone to cross the gnarly ground  and the younger witches go after her .  their socks  knitted from lancre   s toughest  most wiry wool  protect them from the savage spikes of furze .  but then comes the gorge  an abyss so deep one can barely see the river below  and a high  slender bridge that shifts and creaks underfoot .  and then a cavern  some tunnels  a flash of fire .   it is a strange  perilous journey  but not unparalleled .  time and again  in myths and folk tales from all parts of the multiverse  those who take the road to the otherworld must pass a water barrier by way of a bridge perilous .  a scottish ballad describes one leading from purgatory to paradise   the brigge was as heigh as a tower   and as scharpe as a rasour   and naru it was also   and the water that ther ran under  brennd of lightning and of thunder   that thought him mikle wo .   the closest match for granny   s journey is the strange medieval funeral chant known as    the lyke wake dirge     which yorkshire women sang  as late as the sixteenth century  as they kept watch over a corpse .  the tale it tells was already old  it had begun  in so far as such things can be said ever to begin  four hundred years before  as a vision which came to a german monk called gottskalk in december       as he lay sick of a fever .  he saw the souls of the dead gathering on the edge of a great wild heath covered with thorns and furze .  there was a tree nearby  its branches loaded with pairs of shoes  but the newly dead soul must cross the thorny ground barefoot     unless  while alive  he or she had given socks and shoes as alms to the poor .  and so the yorkshire women sang   if ever thou gavest hosen or shoon   every night and all   sit thee down and put them on   and christ receive thy soul .   if hosen and shoon thou never gave none   every night and all   the whinnies shall prick thee to the bare bone   and christ receive thy soul .   having passed over whinny moor  the soul comes to the bridge of dread  which is    no broader than a thread     and finally to purgatory fire .  those who once gave food and drink to the needy will not shrink from its flames  those who never did will be burned to the bare bone .  the song stops at this point  but since in christian belief purgatory is never a final state  simply the last stage on a sinner   s journey to god in heaven  we can assume a happy ending .   as for granny weatherwax  the message she sends the world is  i ate   nt dead yet .       beliefs of lancre   the people of lancre are  on the whole  remarkably free from irrational beliefs .  things which in another universe would be considered superstitions are plain commonsensical everyday facts in lancre .  people there don   t believe that a horseshoe over the door keeps you safe from elves  they know it  and if you ask them why it works they can explain just why  the magnetic effect of iron disrupts the sixth sense so vital to an elf   s well being  .  beekeepers are careful to tell their bees everything important that concerns the family and household     births  marriages  deaths  a new set of curtains  and suchlike .  but that   s not superstition  just the practical observation that if you don   t tell them  they will fly indoors to find out for themselves .   or take the matter of controlling horses .  on the earth  there were farriers and farm workers who had learned the secret magic of the    horseman   s word    .  they could make any horse follow them  or utterly refuse to move on  by whispering it into its ear .  to become a horse whisperer or toadman wasn   t easy .  in scotland  you had to be initiated into a secret society and swear blood curdling oaths .  in east anglia  you had to kill a toad  leave it on an ant hill for a month till the bones were picked clean  then on the next night of the full moon put the bones in a stream  ignoring the eldritch sounds which would break out just behind you  .  one single bone would float upstream .  take it home  rub it with oils  grind it to powder .  that powder holds the power .   in lancre  the blacksmith and farrier jason ogg has no need of all that palaver  but he does have a more immediately practical approach .  he can calm the wildest stallion by whispering a definitely non magical word in its ear     he simply points out what all those pliers and hammers could be used for     if you don   t stand still right now  you bugger    .       royal phantoms   curiously  the royal family of lancre have one strong superstition  though it only affects them once they are dead .  they believe that they are bound to the stones of their ancient castle  especially if they happen to have been murdered on the premises   and must haunt it indefinitely .  when this happened to king verence i  he found he disliked most of his fellow ghosts   champot was all right  if a bit tiresome .  but verence had backed away at the first sight of the twins  toddling hand in hand along the midnight corridors  their tiny ghosts a memorial to a deed darker even than the usual run of regicidal unpleasantness .   and then there was the troglodyte wanderer  a rather faded monkeyman in a furry loincloth who apparently happened to haunt the castle merely because it had been built on his burial mound .  for no obvious reason a chariot with a screaming woman in it occasionally rumbled through the laundry room .   wyrd sisters   being not entirely stupid  king verence found a way of escape .  he persuaded nanny ogg to help him  pleading     pray carry a stone out of the palace so   s i can haunt it  good mother  it   s so bloody boring in here .     so he left the castle  clinging to a bit of rock that nanny broke off the battlements and put in her apron pocket  and took up residence in her cottage .  unfortunately all the other ghosts came along too  but she got used to them in the end .       magpies   creatures which in other parts of the multiverse are a topic for wild rumour and proliferating legend are regarded in lancre simply as rare and interesting species .  to see the occasional phoenix or unicorn is sometimes a surprise  always a pleasure  but never an omen  either for good or ill .   details of these and other remarkable fauna are to be found in the chapter on    beasties    .   but there is one exception     magpies are definitely bodeful .   the magpies which come down into lancre from uberwald are the spies and messengers of a powerful vampire  count de magpyr .  but even apart from that  magpies are unpopular there for their thieving ways and for being omens .   something chattered at them from a nearby branch         good morning  mister magpie     said agnes automatically .      bugger off  you bastard     said nanny  and reached down for a stick to throw .  the bird swooped off to the other side of the clearing .      that   s bad luck     said agnes .      it will be if i get a chance to aim     said nanny .     can   t stand those maggoty pies .             one for sorrow        said agnes  watching the bird hop along a branch .      i always take the view there   s prob   ly going to be another one along in a minute     said nanny  dropping the stick .          two for joy    .     said agnes .      it   s    two for mirth    .         same thing  i suppose .         dunno about that     said nanny .     i was joyful when our jason was born  but i can   t say i was laughin    at the time .      two more magpies landed on the cottage   s antique thatch .      that   s    three for a girl           said agnes nervously .          three for a funeral    is what i learned     said nanny .     but there   s lots of magpie rhymes .                 seven for a secret never to be told        said agnes .          seven   s a devil  his own sel            said nanny darkly .     you   ve got your rhyme  i   ve got mine .      carpe jugulum      things are much the same on the earth  where magpies  also known as pies  pyats  mags  or maggoty pies  are sinister and unpopular birds .  they are shameless thieves  snatching anything bright and glittery and carrying it off to decorate their extremely untidy and badly built nests     behaviour which earned one of them a vital but non singing role in rossini   s opera the thieving magpie .  it is said they will even fly down into hell if there is a bag of gold to be found there .  they love gossiping  chattering  and causing trouble  they are evil birds who know far more than they ought  always peering about and prying into other people   s business .  they have always enjoyed disasters .  even in the days of noah   s flood  the magpie refused to enter the ark  preferring to perch on the roof and jabber with glee at the sight of the drowning world .   magpies are so malicious that spanish peasants say each one has seven bristles from the devil   s beard among its feathers  and seven bladders of bitter gall in its body .  they are the devil   s spies and messengers .  in russia  too  they are considered the devil   s forces  there are said to be forty of them perched on fir trees to guard a bog where he sits enthroned on a white rock .   throughout england and scotland for the past two hundred years and more  there have been rhymes to warn you what to expect if you see magpies flying across your path .  however  as nanny ogg would certainly point out  they are not very reliable  since they are not the ones the magpies know themselves .  there are many versions  all agreeing that a single magpie brings bad luck  but two bring good .  with three and four  there is more choice   one for sorrow   two for joy   three for a girl   and four for a boy .   or   one for sorrow   two for mirth   three for a wedding   four for a birth .   or on the other hand  in the oldest known version  from lincolnshire in       it is   three for a wedding   and four for a death .   after which things become more complicated .  you can have   five for silver  six for gold   seven for a secret never to be told .   or   five for rich  six for poor   seven for a witch  i can tell you no more .   or   five for england  six for france   seven for a fiddler  eight for a dance .   or   five for heaven  six for hell   seven  you   ll see the devil himsel    .   to be on the safe side when a magpie crosses your path  and to turn aside the bad luck  you can draw a cross on the ground  or lay two straws or sticks crosswise  or bow to the bird  saying    good day  mr magpie .      or blow a kiss towards it  or recite this charm   i crossed the magpie  and the magpie crossed me   devil take the magpie  and god save me .       customs of lancre   for some years now  the ankh morpork folk dance and song society has been compiling an archive of old folk customs and fertility rituals from the countryside around .  one summer a lady folklorist arrived on nanny ogg   s doorstep  demanding information .     well     said nanny     there   s only one fertility ritual that i knows of and that   s the one that comes nat   rally .     but the lady said     no  there   s got to be loads of folk stuff hanging on because i am writing a book  and i will give you this handsome silver dollar  my good woman .      so nanny ogg gave her what she reckoned was one dollar   s worth  but no more .  this included the scouring of the long man  as described above  and two or three others  which will be found in a tourist guide to lancre   the seven year flitch .  this is an old custom datin    back to one miscegenation carter who left some money in his will to set it up to provide a flitch of bacon for the deservin    poor .  it is held every five years .  it is open to any man who has been married for more than seven years to appear before the flitch court  which consists of six old married couples  an    swear that in that time he has never had a cross word with his wife or regretted bein    married .  if he does  he is beaten near senseless with the flitch for lying  but brought round with strong drink and the rest of the day is a fair .  so far no man has ever convinced the court an    the flitch is the original one  which is as hard as oak now .   the lancre oozer .  the oozer  attended by people dressed up as his squeasers  dances from house to house in every village on old hogswatch eve until people gives them money to go somewhere else .  it is said that any maiden kissed by the oozer is sure to be pregnant before the year is out but this is an odds on bet in these parts anyway .   the slice mummers    play .  this is performed on the first saturday after marling day  when the characters of old hogfather  death  merry hood and the white knight perform an age old ritual tellin    of the death and resurrection of really bad acting .  this is the high spot of the slice fair and revels .  there is not a lot to do in slice .  well  not that isn   t mostly banned everywhere else .   the similarities to earthly customs here are truly astonishing .  anyone who knows anything about english traditions will recognize the name of the dorset ooser  a large  heavy wooden head with bull   s horns  goggle eyes  and movable snapping jaws .  folklorists found out about it in       at which time it was kept by a family in crewkerne  but could get no information on how it was used .  it has since disappeared  or perhaps it took a dislike to the folklorists and ran away .  its discworld counterpart behaves very much like the may day obby oss at padstow in cornwall  which dances from house to house through the narrow streets  led by a teaser  and accompanied by singers and a massed band of accordions and drums .  this goes on all day .  if the oss catches a woman  she will be married and or pregnant within a year .   mumming plays can be seen in many towns and villages of england  lowland scotland  and parts of ireland around christmas time  or easter  in lancashire  .  they always involve a lot of shouting of bad verse  two or three fights  a death  and a resurrection brought about by a quack doctor .  and then someone takes up a collection from the spectators .  folklorists used to think this was some sort of extremely ancient fertility ritual  but eventually got around to noticing the collection  and the odd fact that performances used to take place outside rich men   s houses  and nowadays at a pub .   as for the seven year flitch  this recalls something which has been going on  off and on  for at least six hundred years at great dunmow in essex .  originally  any man who  having been married for more than a year  could convince the monks at little dunmow priory that he had never once had words with his wife or wished he was single again  would be given a flitch of bacon and carried in procession .  successful claims were few and far between .  when the monastery was closed down at the reformation  successive lords of the manor took responsibility for keeping the custom going  and did so till       when they dropped it .  fortunately  in      the bestselling novelist harrison ainsworth wrote an enthusiastic description  the flitch of bacon  or the custom of dunmow  it can still be found  .  this inspired a revival  which has flourished ever since .  nowadays there is a mock trial  with the wives giving evidence  and the whole thing is treated as a joke .       soul caking   if the lady folklorist from ankh morpork had produced another dollar  she could have learned about the excitements of the soul cake days  which are celebrated in the ramtops and on the sto plains on the first tuesday  wednesday and thursday after first half moon in the month of sektober .  readers attempting to work out this date should bear in mind that on the discworld it is extremely dangerous to utter the magic number    eight     or any of its derivatives  in any language .   according to the discworld almanak  the soul cake days are    celebrated by dwarfs and men with great fires  much noise  and mysterious customs  too many to catalogue  and some too moist to recommend    .  it is known that morris dancing is involved  also that dwarfs play at bobbing for toffee rats on a stick  and human children go trickle treating .  lady folklorists in ankh morpork assume that this is just a local pronunciation of    treacle treating     meaning that the kids who dress up and go from house to house are hoping to be given treacle gob stoppers as their treat .  male folklorists hold the opinion  never mentioned in print  or in the hearing of their female colleagues  that the name arose because people who refuse to hand out any treats later find a rather nasty trickle on their doorstep .   lancre children are also given eggs with funny faces on them  nanny ogg is a dab hand at painting them  .  there must be some connection with the soul cake tuesday duck  a magical creature which lays chocolate eggs for children in ankh morpork  as will be described in a later chapter .  and this in turn links up with the fact that the duck hunting season begins that tuesday .  the good people of ubergigl  in uberwald  mark the date by    the running of the ducks     when maddened untamed ducks run  more or less  through the streets  pursued by young men who vie with one another to snatch the coveted rosette from the beak of the biggest drake .  perhaps their minds have been affected by some floating awareness of the running of the bulls  which is done every july at a fiesta at pamplona in spain .   all of which is well and good  but does not even begin to explain what souls  and cakes  have to do with it .  here  by remarkable coincidence  english traditions can again cast light on the problem .  in the middle ages   november  all souls    day  was the day when christians prayed particularly for the souls of the dead  to speed them on their way from purgatory to heaven  as is still done in catholic countries   on this and the preceding days  it was customary for those who could afford it to give away little cakes to the poor  asking them too to pray for the donor   s dead family and friends .  long after the religious purpose had been forgotten  people made fancy cakes at this time of year  and called them    soul cakes     in the nineteenth century in the rural parts of cheshire and shropshire  the poorer people went from farm to farm asking for money  food or drink  with the song   soul  soul  for a souling cake   i pray you  good missis  for a souling cake   apple or pear  a plum or a cherry   anything good to make us merry .   up with your kettles and down with your pans   give us an answer and we   ll be gone .   they said they were    going soul caking     but secretly they hoped there   d be some beer to go with the cakes  or  better still  some money .  by the end of that century the custom had died out among adults  children  however  were still keeping it up in the     s .  though sometimes they forgot about the cakes   soul  soul  for an apple or two   if you   ve got no apples  pears will do   if you   ve got no pears  ha   pennies will do   if you   ve got no ha   pennies  god bless you .       morris dancing  light and dark   there are some things nanny ogg took good care not to mention to the lady folklorist from the city     the things she calls the    real stuff     things like the dark morris .  the lady would be bound to get them all wrong anyway .   now  even ordinary morris dancing  what we may for convenience call the light morris  is a curious thing  both on earth and on the disc .  a typical dance involves six men in two lines of three  facing each other  they are all dressed alike  usually in white  with coloured baldrics and decorated hats  and possibly with ribbons and rosettes too  they clash sticks in time to the music  miraculously avoiding one another   s fingers by a hair   s breadth  or wave large handkerchiefs  or clap  they have bells strapped to their ankles and knees .  there will be one or two reserve dancers in the team  to replace anyone who retires exhausted or injured  a musician playing an accordion  or a fiddle  or in earlier centuries a pipe and tabor  a fool  and someone to go round taking the collection .   on one level it   s a public display of skill  strength  stamina and sheer bloody mindedness  which some people in lancre think of as entertainment and others as a form of martial art  especially when sticks and buckets are involved  .  there is a definite competitive edge to it .  you can have events like the fifteen mountains all comers    championships  which the lancre morris men have won no fewer than six times .  it gives the teams a chance to dress up and swagger around  to be someone special .   in elizabethan england  the strict puritans thought the swaggering was much too much fun  both for the dancers and the crowd .  in      philip stubbes complained furiously in his anatomie of abuses that at village festivals there would be morris men dressed in    green  yellow  or some other light wanton colour      and as though that were not gaudy enough  i should say  they bedeck themselves with scarfs  ribbons and laces  hanged all over with gold rings  precious stones and other jewels  this done  they tie about either leg twenty or forty bells  with rich handkerchiefs in their hands  and sometimes laid across their shoulders and necks  borrowed for the most part from their pretty mopsies or loving betties  for bussing them in the dark     then march this heathen company towards the church and churchyard  their pipers piping  their drummers thundering  their stumps dancing  their bells jingling  their handkerchiefs fluttering above their heads like mad men  their hobby horses skirmishing among the throng .   on a second level     at any rate in england  where it has flourished  off and on  for at least six hundred years     morris dancing used to be an excellent way for working men in country districts to get free beer and food and some extra cash .  they would appear at seasonal festivals such as may day and whitsun  and also at whichever date the local fair was held  in winter they would go round performing outside the houses of the wealthy .  this was a great asset when times were hard  as they so often were in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .  nowadays  morris teams usually perform outside pubs and in town centres  they still take up a collection  but simply to cover their expenses or for a charity .   some english teams used to go out on tour for several weeks  and even visit towns .  at a fair in london in       for example  there was   a group of young rustics attired in garments decorated with numerous bows of ribbon .  they had small jingling bells fastened to their knees and ankles .  some waved white handkerchiefs and others wands     keeping time by striking their wands against one another .   it was so pleasant  wrote another london eyewitness in        to observe the monotony of some long dull street of dingy houses broken by the simple music of the pipe and tabor  and the ringing of the bells on the legs of the morris dancers     there seems a patch of old time merriment in the active motions of the ruddy and sunburnt countrymen .   just how old was the merriment .  when and why did it come to be such an essential part of the rose tinted picture of the happy  simple  country life of old england .  a theory popular in the eighteenth century was that the name    morris    was a corruption of the spanish word morisco     moorish     and that it was a fashion introduced from spain in the fourteenth century .  this would imply that at first it was danced by the upper classes  not among country folk  and that they called it    moorish    not just for being foreign  but because it was so wild and energetic  in contrast to the stately dances of the court .  it is a plausible suggestion  but apart from the name itself there is no actual evidence for it .   then  in the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  a dramatic new theory emerged and became instantly popular and widely accepted .  the origins of the morris  it was claimed  lay in the fertility rituals of prehistoric europe  the noisy bells  the waving hankies  and aggressive sticks were meant to drive away evil spirits  the high leaps into the air were meant to make the crops grow tall .  on this level  the third and for many people the most important one  morris dancing is an immensely ancient magical rite for the promotion of life .  there is no evidence for this either  but as the english scholar keith chandler recently wrote     viewing a dance which is supposedly several thousand years old appears to satisfy some indefinable need in the human psyche    .   whether or not this theory holds good on earth  it is well known to be the truth of the matter on the disc .  there  morris dancing is done to bring good luck and drive bad things away  there   s nothing like the jangle of little iron bells for getting rid of elves .  what   s more  it   s all about the cycles of growth and decay  summer and winter  life and death .  it involves the light morris  yes  but the dark morris too .   this is why there   s one village in the ramtops  the one where they really do know what they are doing  where the morris men dance twice  and twice only  in every year  we shall have more to say on this in the next chapter  .  the first time is at dawn on the first day of spring  and everyone is welcome to watch .  but the second time is in autumn  and it   s private .   on a certain day when the nights are drawing in  the dancers leave work early and take  from attics and cupboards  the other costume  the black one  and the other bells .  and they go by separate ways to a valley among the leafless trees .  they don   t speak .  there is no music .  it   s very hard to imagine what kind there could be .   the bells don   t ring .  they   re made of octiron  a magic metal .  but they   re not  precisely  silent bells .  silence is merely the absence of noise .  they make the opposite of noise  a sort of heavily textured silence .   and in the cold afternoon  as the light drains from the sky  among the frosty leaves and in the damp air  they dance the other morris .  because of the balance of things .   you   ve got to dance both  they say .  otherwise you can   t dance either .   reaper man   this is the dark morris nanny ogg was keeping quiet about .  if it is danced elsewhere in the multiverse     and it surely is     people there are keeping quiet about it too .   well .  not that quiet .  terry is occasionally informed of a sighting  and once saw it danced in chicago .        chapter      the witches  of the chalk      hostility towards witches   in the lowlands and in the chalk country  witches do not receive the same respect as in lancre .  there have been times when they were systematically persecuted  even burned  and though that no longer happens many of the chalk people still distrust them  and are quick to blame them when there is trouble .  so witches who go there are wary  and try not to attract attention .  they wear ordinary clothes  and disguise their true craft behind a slightly more socially acceptable calling  such as teaching .  that is why  when miss perspicacia tick visits the chalk  or surrounding villages  she wears what looks like a simple black straw hat smothered in paper flowers  but is actually a collapsible stealth model .  press a spring  and it unfolds into the classic pointy shape .  among the paper flowers lurks a talking toad which she refers to as her familiar  though so far it has not displayed any magical powers     unlike the toad familiars of english witches in wessex  which are so dangerous that the worst threat their mistress can utter is     i   ll set my toads on    ee .      miss tick   s equipment too looks far from witchy .  she does her scrying by pouring a few drops of ink into rainwater in a cracked saucer which she carries about in one of her many pockets .  also in her pockets are other insignificant objects     twigs  loose beads  string  a reel of cotton  a holed stone  a few feathers  scraps of coloured paper .  these she can thread together to make a    shamble     a powerful magic detector and projector which looks a bit like a particularly complicated cat   s cradle  a bit like a broken set of puppet strings  and a bit like a very untidy dream catcher .  to do this requires high skill in making string figures  an art practised in various parts of the multiverse  and often linked to myths and magic .  on earth  germans call it das hexenspiel     the witch   s game    .   a shamble won   t work if you buy it ready made .  you have to make your own  fresh every time  out of whatever there happens to be in your pockets .  in the centre you put something alive     an egg  say  or a beetle or small worm     and pull the strings  and as the objects twirl past or even through one another  the device works .  in the presence of really powerful magic  it may explode .  but if you pull the right bit of string  it all falls apart in a moment and becomes just a small pile of harmless rubbish .  nothing suspicious .  nothing that makes people say    witch    .   because once people think you   re a witch  things can go terribly  terribly wrong  as they did for poor old mrs snapperly  who died in the snow one winter  but who probably wasn   t a witch at all .  as tiffany aching tells miss tick  mrs snapperly used to live alone in a strange cottage in the woods  and had no teeth  and talked to herself .  and she had a cat  and she squinted .  so when a young boy went riding in those woods one summer day and never came back  people said she   d killed him  and maybe cooked him in her oven too .      and so after he vanished they went to her cottage and they looked in the oven and they dug up her garden and they threw stones at her old cat until it died and they turned her out of her cottage and piled up all her old books in the middle of the room and set fire to them and burned the place to the ground and everyone said she was an old witch .      the wee free men   to make matters worse  this lost boy was the baron   s son  and the baron  whose family had held the chalk for generations without ever changing their minds about anything  was full of taken for granted prejudices .  he too blamed mrs snapperly  and gave orders that nobody was to have anything to do with her  and that any witch found in the country should be tied up and thrown in a pond .  the old woman managed to live through the autumn  begging and stealing food here and there and sleeping where she could  but there came a cold night when no one would open their doors to her  and it snowed  and by morning she was dead .   thankfully  such small rural tragedies are now rare on discworld  but they were common on earth until modern times .  as late as the     s  in one sussex village there was an old widow called betsey shadlow who was forced into isolation by the fears and suspicions of her neighbours .  she was a wicked old woman  they said  and had    powerful books with a deal of evil written in them    .  she lived alone and in poverty  and was crippled with rheumatism  but nobody would help her dig up her potatoes for fear of what she might do to them .  when she went to the farm to buy milk  the farmer wouldn   t let her pass the gate in case she bewitched the cows  so she had to stay in the road and yell until somebody heard her .  there came a time when people realized that they hadn   t seen her around for a couple of weeks  so the rector called at her cottage and found her sick in bed  too ill to move .  the man who told her story to the sussex county magazine in      remembered how it all ended   the workhouse people came next day and took her away .  one of the head men stayed behind to sort out her belongings .  she hadn   t much furniture  but they found a pile of books .  my neighbour  who was very fond of reading and very curious as well  asked the official if he could have them  or at least read them  but we said it wasn   t right  and anyway we didn   t want anyone else learning the secrets and playing us up     betsey shadlow was trouble enough     and we asked the workhouse chap to burn them .  he looked at them  and said they were rubbish anyway .  it   s a strange thing  but when they came to set fire to all the unwanted stuff from the cottage along with those books  we lookers on saw green flames coming from the fire .   the baron   s notion that the thing to do with witches is to throw them into ponds must be one of those thought particles drifting through the multiverse and taking root in any suitable mind .  it echoes a practice once common in many countries of the earth  the    swimming test    .  it began in the middle ages as a way of discovering whether someone was or was not a witch  and reached its peak in the first half of the seventeenth century .  the suspect would be tied up  hands to feet  and thrown in .  it was believed that if she was guilty  water  being a pure and holy element  would reject her  and she would remain floating on the surface  if she was innocent  she would sink     and  hopefully  someone would haul her out before she drowned .  though popular  this was not actually legal  and the vast majority of lawyers and church leaders refused to accept it as evidence in court .  one famous writer who did believe in the test was king james vi of scotland and i of england  who linked it with the idea that witches had rejected the christian faith in which they had been baptized   so it appears that god hath appointed  for a supernatural sign of the monstrous impiety of witches  that the water shall refuse to receive into her bosom those who have shaken off them the sacred water of baptism and wilfully refused the sacred benefit thereof .   there came a time when all laws against witchcraft were dropped  and people could no longer take a woman to court if they thought her spells had harmed them .  so  remembering the old ways  village mobs sometimes took matters into their own hands by    swimming    her themselves  not as a test but as a punishment .  even in victorian england  there were one or two cases where people died of this  by drowning or by pneumonia .  in view of the baron   s decree  it is fortunate that miss perspicacia tick is good at untying knots with her teeth and swimming underwater  and can lurk under the weeds  breathing air through a hollow reed .        witches have a duty   as in lancre  so on the chalk a witch has a duty to her land and her people .  it is because young tiffany aching has an instinctive ability to accept responsibility  to cope with threats to herself and others  that she is a natural born witch .  as the kelda of the wee free men tells her     ye   re the hag noo  the witch that guards the edges and the gateways .  so wuz yer granny  although she wouldnae ever call hersel    one .      granny aching had lived and died as a shepherd .  the chalk and flint were in her bones  the sky was her hat and the wind her cloak .  all spring and summer she stayed out on the hills  sleeping in her old wheeled shepherding hut  which could be dragged across the downs to follow the flocks .  tiffany knew  probably by reading the goode childe   s booke of faerie tales  that any old woman who lived in a house that moved about must be at least slightly a witch .  she was sure of this  even though she had never heard of mrs gogol  the swamp witch in genua whose hut paddled along on duck   s feet  let alone baba yaga in russian fairy tales  whose cottage stood on hen   s legs and spun round and round .   granny aching was a supremely skilful and conscientious shepherd  with all the toil and responsibility this entails .    one would see  granny aching   s light  weaving slowly across the downs  on freezing  sparkly nights or in storms like a raging war  saving lambs from the creeping frost or rams from the precipice .  she froze and struggled and tramped through the night for idiot sheep that never said thank you and would probably be just as stupid tomorrow  and get into the same trouble again .  and she did it because not doing it was unthinkable .   the wee free men   she used no magic  though some shepherds    tricks look like magic if you don   t know how they   re done .  but she had wisdom  and authority  and sometimes anger too  she saw to it that where there was injustice there would be a reckoning  since    them as can do  has to do for them as can   t  and someone has to speak up for them as has no voices .     within two or three years of her death  the memory of her had grown into something larger than life  something like a spirit of the downs   there were always buzzards over the chalk .  the shepherds had taken to calling them granny aching   s chickens  and some of them called clouds like those up there today    granny   s little lambs    .  and tiffany knew that even her father called the thunder    granny aching cussin       .   and it was said that some of the shepherds  if wolves were troublesome in the winter  or a prize ewe had got lost  would go to the site of the old hut in the hills and leave an ounce of jolly sailor tobacco  just in case      no wonder that when monsters and elves from another world appear in the chalk country  tiffany   s first thought is that granny would have known how to deal with them .  but granny is dead .  it is now young tiffany who must become the witch as shepherd  guarding the borders  driving invaders away  keeping an eye on things .  she has a duty .       becoming a witch   how does a girl become a witch .  first  she must have some natural inborn talent  even if she does not yet realize it .  here  heredity can help  and in tiffany   s case it does  the achings  like the weatherwaxes  have witching in their blood .  it might also be significant that she is the seventh daughter .  on the earth it certainly would be  for in that universe many a magical healer and fortuneteller has found that being a seventh son  or daughter  is good publicity .  but the supreme magical number on the discworld is eight  not seven  so it is usually the eighth son  or daughter  who is born with power  as we learn in equal rites and sourcery .   the really unmistakable sign that tiffany is destined to be a witch is her name     a sign all the more powerful for being the result of sheer chance  if there is such a thing as chance  .  in the languages of the discworld    tiffany    has no meaning  but the kelda of the wee free men tells her that in their old speech  a celtic tongue  learned in another universe  its true form is tir far th  inn  meaning    land under wave    .    chalk hills are land which was once under the waves  land formed from the shells of countless millions of sea creatures .  knowing this  and knowing what her name means  is the core of tiffany   s power .   she saw herself set her boots firmly on the turf  and then          and then          and then  like someone rising from the clouds of a sleep  she felt the deep  deep time below her .  she sensed the breath of the downs and the distant roar of ancient  ancient seas trapped in millions of tiny shells .  she thought of granny aching  under the turf  becoming part of the chalk again  part of the land under wave .  she felt as if huge wheels  of time and stars  were turning slowly around her .   she opened her eyes and then  somewhere inside  opened her eyes again .   she heard the grass growing  and the sound of worms below the turf .  she could feel the thousands of little lives around her  smell all the scents on the breeze  and see all the shades of the night      the wheels of stars and years  of space and time  locked into place .  she knew exactly where she was  and who she was  and what she was .   the wee free men   however  even if you are born with an aptitude for magic  there are still skills to be learned  and it is not wise to try to learn witching all by yourself .  get one little thing wrong  and you   re stuck among dangers you don   t understand .  even if you make no mistakes  you   ll be desperately lonely .  unless you can meet people of your own sort  you may end up mad     or bad .   things aren   t so bad for boys who are potential wizards  since they can go to unseen university .  occasionally  in those few times and places in the multiverse where girls have been allowed to study the same things as their brothers  there has been some talk of boarding schools for young witches  and even of co educational establishments .  but on the disc there is nothing like that .  when miss tick tells tiffany that yes  there is indeed such a school     very magical  nowhere else quite like it     this is a trick or test .  the true    school     as tiffany soon understands  is all around you  once you know how to open your eyes and then open them again .  as for the detailed skills of the craft  they are passed on from elderly witches to young ones on a one to one basis  together with some very necessary guidance and protection .  it is miss tick   s responsibility  as a secret witch finder  to pick out girls with talent and make suitable arrangements for them .   so when tiffany was eleven  she left her home in the chalk country and travelled to the mountains  where she went into service with miss level  partly as a maid and partly as an apprentice .  she learned about herbs  and broomsticks  and tried patiently to make a shamble .  she accompanied miss level round the villages and isolated farms doing medicine and midwifery  and learned that though a witch never expects payment and never asks for it  there is a constant interchange of gifts and favours .  there was nothing romantic about this work  nothing dramatic  no magic potions to cure the sick in an instant .  witchcraft  said miss level  was mostly about helping people by doing quite ordinary things .  this has been the task of the true wise woman in every universe  and we can assume  though evidence is lacking  that girls who became wise women on earth learned their skills and duties by some similar informal apprenticeship .   however  cures and advice are more likely to be accepted if they sound magical  as tiffany learned .  miss level had been carefully telling one family that their well was much too close to their privy  so the water was full of tiny  tiny creatures which were making the children sick .  they listened politely  but did nothing .  then granny weatherwax visited them and told them the illness was caused by goblins who were attracted to the smell of the privy  and that very day the man of the house and his friends began digging a new well at the other end of the garden .  a story gets things done .   yet there was part of tiffany   s mind which hankered for power and drama and picturesque paraphernalia .  this is a very common weakness in young witches  and tiffany meets one group of girls who practise    the higher magik    .      magic with a k .     said tiffany .     magikkkk .         that   s deliberate     said annagramma coldly .     if we are to make any progress at all we must distinguish the higher magik from the everyday sort .         the everyday sort of magic .     said tiffany .      exactly .  none of that mumbling in hedgerows for us .  proper sacred circles  spells written down .  a proper hierarchy  not everyone running around doing whatever they feel like .  real wands  not bits of grubby stick .  professionalism  with respect .  absolutely no warts .  that   s the only way forward .      a hatful of sky   annagramma has learned this approach from mrs letice earwig  a tall thin witch who wears so much silver that she gleams  uses words like    avatar    and    sigil     and writes books .  this has earned her granny weatherwax   s heartfelt contempt .     that   s just wizard magic with a dress on     and    she thinks you can become a witch by going shopping     are two of granny   s milder comments .   annagramma runs a coven of young girls  whom she bullies and sneers at  and chivvies through complex ceremonies involving such things as the wand of air  the cauldron of the sea  the shriven chalice  the circlet of infinity .  they all go in for robes and occult jewellery  and patronize the very expensive shop of zakzak stronginthearm  a dwarf craftsman who supplies everything the higher magikkkkian might require  wands of metal or rare woods  elaborately pretty ready made shambles  crystal balls  luxurious cloaks  star spangled hats  rings  pendants  your personal grimoire     book of night     or    book of shadows     bound in heavy leather with an actively rolling eye on the cover .   it is really remarkable how similar ideas spring up across the multiverse .  on the earth groups like this have become common over the past hundred years or so .  there too  some of them insist on an eccentric spelling for what they do  calling it magick  to make sure that nobody mistakes it for that boring old fashioned folk magic .  they go in for formal initiations  oaths  grades  and hierarchies  and their founders and leaders  generally men  are notably authoritarian .  they take grandiose names for themselves  their organizations  their ritual ceremonies  and the objects used in ritual .  and the zakzaks of our world do very good business .  well  whatever     but one instinctively feels that granny   s    every stick is a wand  every puddle is a crystal ball    is closer to the truth .  or a truth  at least .          see me      the most remarkable of tiffany   s abilities was one which she ought really to have mentioned to miss tick  but she didn   t  being too young and inexperienced to know how unusual  and how risky  it was .  closing her eyes and concentrating  she would say    see me    .  then  reopening her eyes  she would find herself standing a few feet away from herself .  she had walked out of her own body  and now her detached self could move around  looking at her physical self from every side .  when she had seen all she wanted  she would say    see me not     and the two selves were instantly reunited .   as a child  tiffany simply thought of this as a handy little trick to use if you didn   t have a proper mirror .  she had no notion that it is the basis of borrowing  that supreme skill of great witches .  still less did she suspect that if you just walk out of your body and leave it there  without taking proper precautions  there are creatures only too ready to move in and take control .   this ability  or something very like it  has been observed elsewhere in the multiverse  though not under the deliberate control of those who have it .  one form is the    near death experience     much discussed nowadays on the earth .  people who are semi conscious from heart failure or anaesthetic  and almost on the point of death  feel the mind detaching itself from the inert body and floating upwards  they can watch the body from above  and see what is going on around it  but eventually are reunited with it and regain consciousness .   older earthly sources speak of the soul  rather than the mind  separating itself from the sleeping body and wandering off on its own .  according to folk tradition  it is possible for an observer to see this happening  for the soul emerges in visible form  as a small animal  an insect  or a puff of smoke .  this is said to have happened once to king guntram of the franks  who ruled burgundy from     to      the story was written down some two hundred years later .   one day  guntram felt tired while out hunting  and took a nap under a tree  while a courtier kept watch .  this man saw that while the king was asleep a little animal slithered out of his mouth and went down to a tiny brook  where it ran to and fro on the bank  looking for a way to cross .  amused at this  the courtier laid his sword across the brook .  the little creature crossed at once  and disappeared into a hole on the opposite bank .  after a bit  it returned across the sword bridge  and slipped back into the king   s mouth .  then guntram woke up  and said to his companion     i must tell you what a strange dream i   ve just had .  i saw a very large  very wide river  and across it a great iron bridge had been built .  i crossed the bridge  and went into a cave in the side of a towering mountain  and it was filled with treasure .     then the courtier told the king what had actually happened  and they decided to dig into the bank of the brook  and sure enough  there was a treasure buried there .   it is important that no one should touch or shake or shift the unconscious body while its soul is away  because if the soul cannot find its way back  the person will die .       making a myth of oneself   tiffany   s next post is as apprentice to an extremely odd     nay  terrifying     witch named miss eumenides treason  one hundred and thirteen years old  quite blind  and quite deaf .  yet these disabilities scarcely bother her  because she is skilled at borrowing and uses the eyes and ears of any nearby animal as if they were her own .  on occasion  she even borrows tiffany   s eyes  which is rather irritating of her .   whereas miss tick is a stealth witch  miss treason flaunts witchery in every detail of her lifestyle .  all witches like wearing black  but she has gone further  the walls and floors in her cottage are black  and so  of course  are her candles  she keeps black goats and black hens  even cheeses must be coated with black wax .  everything has been carefully crafted to match images stamped deeply into the human psyche by the force of narrativium  since it is her aim to turn herself into a myth  in life and in death .  she knows exactly how to do it .   every witch has her particular skill  and miss treason   s is to deliver justice .  people would come to her from miles around with disputes about land  or cows  or rent  or legacies  and she would sit in judgement .  so  how does the image fit the role .   first  blindness .  everyone knows that when justice is personified she wears a blindfold  and so does miss treason     a black one  naturally .  so indeed does blind io  chief of the gods  who has blank skin where his eyes should be and an impressive number of detached eyeballs floating round him .  it is not known whether miss treason is deliberately mocking him  it is not impossible  for witches don   t have much respect for gods .  what is quite certain is that she strikes terror into the hearts of disputants when she removes the blindfold from her pearly grey eyes and prepares to give judgement  saying     i have heard .  now i shall see .  i shall see what is true .     her blind eyes seem to look right into the soul .  people say if you lie to her  you   ll be dead in a week .   then there is her name  eumenides  which she must have found in the pages of chaffinch   s ancient and classical mythology     one of her favourite books  crammed full with bookmarks .  on the earth  in ancient greece  this was the polite name for the erinyes or avenging furies  terrifying goddesses whose function was to hound the guilty to death  it literally means    sweet tempered ladies    and was meant to be flattering to them and reassuring to us  but nobody was ever fooled by that .  her chosen hobby is weaving  which  like the spinning of the fates  is a traditional metaphor for the way supernatural beings decide human destinies .  one tale from the earth  the medieval icelandic njal   s saga  tells how twelve valkyries were seen setting up a gruesome loom  just before the great battle of clontarf between vikings and irishmen in      .  as they worked  they sang   we weave  we weave a web of war .   human guts our warp and weft   skulls our loom weights  spears our shuttles   swords to beat the blood stained cloth .   we decide who lives  who dies .   we weave  we weave a web of war .   next  her birds .  at the time tiffany was living with miss treason  she kept two ravens  which had once worked for blind io  one would sit on each side of her head on a wooden perch which fitted like a yoke across her shoulders .  the effect was very witchy  and mythic too  no doubt she had been reading about the norse god odin and his ravens huginn and muninn     thought    and    memory      which perched on his shoulders and told him everything they had seen as they flew round middle earth .   before the ravens  she had kept a pet jackdaw .  there are no links between jackdaws and justice  but good precedents for their use as magical familiars .  the medieval english chronicler william of malmesbury wrote in his gesta regum anglorum        of a witch who had lived at berkeley in gloucestershire some sixty years before his time  in the year      .  she was skilled in interpreting omens  and had a tame jackdaw as her very great favourite  one day  the bird chattered more loudly than usual  and she turned pale  knowing this was a warning that her own death was at hand .   a discworld witch wouldn   t mind knowing this  but the witch of berkeley had made a pact with the devil  so for her it was not good news .   in much more recent times  in the     s  to be precise  a well known witch in the new forest in hampshire  mrs sybil leek  would always appear in public with a tame jackdaw called hotfoot jackson perching on her shoulder .  very eye catching  but  like miss treason  she did have to put up with mess down the back of her cloak .   myth making is a communal activity  even if most people involved don   t see that that   s what they   re doing .  it   s built up from fears  rumours  thrills and stories  all driven by powerful doses of narrativium .  miss treason takes a keen interest in the process  since she has a reputation to keep up .  she asks tiffany      have you heard the stories about me  child .             er  that you have a demon in the cellar .     tiffany answered        and you eat spiders .  and get visited by kings and princes .  and that any flower planted in your garden blooms black .         oh  do they say so .     said miss treason  looking delighted .     i haven   t heard that last one .  how nice .  and did you hear that i walk around at night in the dark time of the year and reward those who have been good citizens with a purse of silver .  but  if they have been bad  i slit open their bellies with my thumbnail like this .      tiffany leaped backwards as a wrinkled hand twisted her round and miss treason   s yellow thumbnail scythed past her stomach .  the old woman looked terrifying .      no .  no  i haven   t heard that one     she gasped  pressing up against the sink .      what .  and it was a wonderful story  with real historical antecedents .     said miss treason  her vicious scowl becoming a smile .     and the one about me having a cow   s tail .         a cow   s tail .  no .         really .  how very vexing     i fear the art of story telling has got into a pretty bad way in these parts .  i really shall have to do something .      wintersmith   it is to be hoped that she did  for they are indeed splendid stories  and it would be a great pity if they were forgotten .  their historical antecedents have deep roots in the scandinavian and german speaking parts of the earth .  the cow   s tail is characteristic of elf women in the mountain forests of norway and sweden .  from in front  they look beautiful  and many a human huntsman or charcoal burner has been seduced into making love with one of them .  but if he gets a glimpse of her back  he will see either that it is hollow  mossy and rotten like an old tree stump  or that it ends in a long  dirty cow   s tail .  if he runs off in horror  she will chase him  and if she catches him she will tear him to bits .  they are not to be trifled with  these forest elf women .   as for the stomach slitting  here miss treason is surely thinking of some discworld equivalent of a famous supernatural hag known as frau holle in germany and frau perchte or frau berthe in bavaria  austria and switzerland .  stories about her go back at least a thousand years .  some say she lives on a mountain peak  but others say up in the sky  when it snows in the human world everyone knows that she   s shaking out her feather beds until the feathers drift about in the wind .  in midwinter  during the twelve days of christmas  she comes to earth and travels round the countryside  checking on whether children have been good and obedient  and whether the village girls have worked hard on the farms  and spun as much flax or wool as they should have done in the course of the year .  then comes twelfth night itself  sometimes called perchtanacht and reckoned to be the last night of the year .  at midnight she comes into every house .  those who have been good and done their work properly may find a silver coin in their shoes  or in the milking pail .  but as for those who haven   t  she will slit their bellies open  remove the contents  and fill them up with chopped straw  pebbles and dirt .  then she sews them up again  using a ploughshare as a needle and an iron chain as thread .   another notion which miss treason picked up from the tales of earth is that of the external soul .  a good example is the legendary russian evil wizard koshchei the deathless  who placed his life or soul in an egg .  the egg was inside a duck  and the duck was inside a hare  and the hare was lying in a great hollow log floating in a pond in a forest on an island far  far away from koshchei   s palace .  miss treason   s version is less complicated .  she wears a heavy iron clock on her belt  and is always winding it up .  there is a story in the villages that this clock is her heart  which she has used ever since her first heart died .      miss treason     said tiffany severely     did you make up the story about your clock .         of course i did .  and it   s a wonderful bit of folklore  a real corker .  miss treason and her clockwork heart .  might even become a myth  if i   m lucky .  they   ll remember miss treason for thousands of years .      she is brilliant at stage setting too .  her all black cottage is thick with cobwebs  though there are no spiders to be seen .  the black candles by the loom are set in two skulls  and dribble wax all down them  one skull is carved with the greek word for    guilt     the other with the greek for    innocence    .  this is the kind of thing people expect of her  and it all helps to build her reputation .  but the skulls hold a secret .  there is a label underneath  and it says   ghastly skull no .    price    .     the boffo novelty and joke shop  no .     tenth egg street  ankh morpork     if it   s a laugh     it   s a boffo .      the cobwebs also came from there  and boffo does masks and warts and green bubbling cauldrons too .   so  where is the difference between miss treason buying skulls from boffo   s catalogue and mrs earwig buying silver pendants and crystals at zakzak   s shop .  the point is this .  mrs earwig thinks that power comes from elaborate devices  and to think this is to misunderstand the whole essence of the craft .  but miss treason knows that you don   t need a wand or a shamble or even a pointy hat to be a witch  but that it helps a witch if she puts on a show .  give people what they expect to see .  it   s all a form of    headology     like the hat or granny weatherwax   s bottle of coloured water .  that way  you get respect .   looking back on her life   s work as death approaches  miss treason muses      oh  my silly people .  anything they don   t understand is magic .  they think i can see into their hearts  but no witch can do that .  not without surgery  at least .  no magic is needed to read their little minds  though .  i   ve known them since they were babes     i see their lies and excuses and fears .  they never grow up  not really            i   m sure they   ll miss you     said tiffany .      ha .  i   m the wicked ol    witch  girl .  they feared me  and did what they were told .  they feared joke skulls and silly stories .  i chose fear .  i knew they   d never love me for telling    em the truth  so i made certain of their fear .  no  they   ll be relieved to hear the witch is dead .      as a roman general said long ago  oderint dum metuant        let them hate me  so long as they fear me .      if you want to be remembered for generations in folk tradition  whether as a hero  a saint  or a sage  a good death scene is vitally important .  now  one of the minor benefits of being a witch is that you know  months or even years in advance  exactly when you are going to die  so you can stage manage the event to perfection .   on earth  legend says that exceptionally holy people have this privilege too .   having done all the obvious things  cleaned the cottage  made a will  destroyed any embarrassing old letters or spells still lying around   you can throw a really good    going away party    .  this is like a wake  but with yourself as guest of honour  still taking a keen interest .  people  especially other witches  come from miles around to enjoy the food  as nanny ogg says  you cannot go wrong with a ham roll  and to let it be discreetly known that they have always rather admired your brass candlesticks  or your big carving dish with the blue and gold border .  it saves a great deal of squabbling if you  the soon to be late witch  can organize the distribution of these little mementoes yourself .   and then  when everyone has gone home and there   s been a few hours of peace and quiet  you just head for the garden  where some helpful neighbour has dug a neat grave  in miss treason   s case  it was the nac mac feegles who did the job   climb down into it  watched by an awed but appreciative audience of village folk   lie down carefully  and wait     it is a fine thing to be able to organize your own rite of passage  and miss treason pulls it off perfectly .   and she succeeds in her aim of turning herself into a myth .  within a few weeks of her death  her grave was covered with scraps of paper pegged down with sticks  each bearing a message      miss treason please keep my boy joe save at see .         miss treason  i   m goin bald please help .         miss treason  please find our girl becky what run away i   m sorry .      even though there was a new young witch dispensing justice     and quite impressively too  in her own way     people still put their trust and hopes in what they knew .  they brought their small prayers to miss treason   s grave  just as the shepherds of the chalk left packets of jolly sailor tobacco where granny aching   s old shepherding hut used to stand   they didn   t write their petitions down  but they were there  all the same  floating in the air      granny aching  who herds the clouds in the blue sky  please watch my sheep .  granny aching  cure my son .  granny aching  find my lambs .      and so a witch  or a shepherdess  can indeed turn into a myth     a local saint     maybe even a goddess .  it   s been known before  and it still goes on  and not just on the discworld .  go visit biddy early   s cottage .     regrettably  some things don   t change .  terry recalls a case in the usa some years ago when a somewhat new age lady got a visit from her local sheriff after a neighbour reported that she was    saying spells    in her garden .  she   d been singing a christian hymn     in latin .      but in the languages of earth it comes from the same greek root as    epiphany     meaning    revelation of god    .       chapter      the chalk      the land   the region known to its people simply as    the chalk    lies on the sto plains about fifty miles from lancre .  it is a land of gentle  rolling  turf covered hills with occasional patches of woodland  small villages and scattered farmsteads .  above all  it is good land for sheep .   no other place on discworld is so patently a thinly disguised part of earth .  the tiffany aching wee free men books are  whatever other splendid things they may be  a hymn to a time and a landscape .  and here it   s found as it was in the time of our great grandfathers     open country  unfenced  unploughed  turf covered  a land fit for sheep .   green downlands roll under the hot midsummer sun     the flocks of sheep  moving slowly  drift over the short turf like clouds on a green sky .  here and there sheepdogs speed over the turf like comets .   and then  as the eyes pull back  it is a long green mound  lying like a great whale on the world      the wee free men   in both worlds  these lands are full of memories of distant times   men had been everywhere on the chalk .  there were stone circles  half fallen down  and burial mounds like green pimples where  it was said  chieftains of the olden days had been buried with their treasure .  no one fancied digging into them to find out .   there were odd carvings in the chalk  too  which the shepherds sometimes weeded when they were out on the downs with the flocks and there was not a lot to do .  the chalk was only a few inches under the turf .  hoofprints could last a season  but the carvings had lasted for thousands of years .  they were pictures of horses and giants  but the strange thing was that you couldn   t see them properly from anywhere on the ground .  they looked as if they   d been made for viewers in the sky .   the oldest and most magical of the carvings on the chalk is the white horse  on a steep hillside at the head of a little valley  on earth  the place is called uffington  in berkshire  and it is on the north slopes of the berkshire downs  .  it was cut out of the turf way back in the earliest times  perhaps by the same folk who raised the stone circles and buried their dead in the mounds  and for generation after generation people have kept it clear of grass and weeds .  it doesn   t look much like a horse  not unless you look at it in the right way .  it   s just lines     long  flowing lines that don   t even join up     but  as granny aching told tiffany   s father when he was only a little boy        tain   t what a horse looks like  it   s what a horse be .     and if the chalk has a guardian spirit  this is it .   the landscape is full of stories .  a hill near tiffany   s home  for instance   there was a flat place at the top where nothing ever grew  and tiffany knew there was a story that a hero had once fought a dragon up there and its blood had burned the ground where it fell .  there was another story that said there was a heap of treasure under the hill  defended by the dragon  and another story that said a king was buried there in armour of solid gold .  there were lots of stories about the hill  it was surprising it hadn   t sunk under the weight of them .   in our world  there is just such a dragon hill  with just such a flat  bare top where a dragon   s blood was spilled     in that case  by st george .  it is at uffington  alongside the white horse .  elsewhere  on the south downs  there are many hills and burial mounds in which  according to local tales  there are pots of gold  or dead men lying in their golden armour .   interesting things can be found in or on the chalk .  there are small sharp flint arrowheads  made by men thousands of years before  on the discworld  though alas not on our chalk  shepherds still have the skill of chipping flints into very sharp little knives  for their own amusement  it is said that a good flint is sharper than a scalpel  .  occasionally  one can pick up a stone with a hole in it  these are called    dobby stones     just as they are in the yorkshire dales  and are said to be lucky .  tiffany keeps one in her pocket  though she is unsure what use it is  if she lived in yorkshire  she would know you can hang them at your door or window to keep evil spirits out  and over your bed to prevent nightmares .  she also keeps a fossilized sea urchin  which she once used as part of a shamble  it is the sort which looks like a bun with grooves on it making a five pointed star  which on the sussex downs is called a    shepherd   s crown    .  it   s said that if you put them on the kitchen windowsill they will keep thunderstorms away and prevent milk from going sour .       the shepherds    life   iron wheeled shepherding huts like the one granny aching used were once common all along the south downs  and indeed in other sheep rearing regions too .  shepherds lived in them at lambing time  when it was essential to stay near the ewes day and night  they were also used at other times of year  but less regularly .  they were sturdy wooden structures  warmed by a small stove  with a chair  a table  a simple bunk bed  and plenty of shelves  boxes and hooks to hold the shepherd   s gear     a horn lantern  crooks  shears  knives  a hay fork  a feeding bottle for sickly lambs and a saucepan to warm the milk for them  tins and bottles of sheep medicines  one or two spare sheep bells  and so on .  the huts would be set up close to the lambing fold  farm horses could draw them from place to place  if need be .  the stove made the hut very cosy indeed  though sheep tended to creep under it on cold nights  their stomachs gurgling and rumbling till the dawn     but the shepherd would probably snooze in his chair at busy times  and be too tired to notice .   to count their flocks  discworld shepherds have special words and a special way of reckoning  known only to them  and to the nac mac feegle  .  it begins with    yan tan tethera    for    one two three     and goes up as far as    jiggit    for twenty .  there it stops .  the same system was used by english shepherds  and sometimes also by fishermen reckoning their catch and women counting the stitches of their knitting .  bits of it are still remembered by children when they are    counting out    to start a game .  the names of the numbers vary a bit  but they are always grouped in fives and make a kind of rhyme  for instance   yan  tan  tethera  pethera  pimp   sethera  lethera  hovera  dovera  dick   yaner dick  taner dick  tether dick  pether dick  bumfit   yaner bumfit  taner bumfit  tether bumfit  pether bumfit  jiggit .   maybe one reason children have remembered this ditty is that some of the words do sound a bit rude .   when he reached    jiggit     the shepherd would cut a notch on a stick  or put a stone in his pocket  and start over again .  when all the sheep were counted  he would reckon up his notches or stones  suppose there were     sheep  this would mean six notches  plus three extra beasts        six score sheep and three    .   it sounds cumbersome  but in fact comes easily to any creature that has two hands  with five fingers on each hand .  the idea of reckoning by twenties has left traces on the english language even where the special words are not used  as when a psalm says     the days of our age are threescore years and ten  and though men be so strong that they come to fourscore years  yet is their strength but labour and sorrow .     in french too  the word for    eighty     quatrevingts  means literally    four twenties    .  come to that  in english currency there used to be twenty shillings to the pound .   at lambing time  shepherds are extremely busy  too busy to come down off the hills .  and so they are at sheep dipping time  sheep washing time  sheep shearing time  and in the run up to sheep fairs .  this rather gets in the way of regular religion  and may cause offence to some of the more touchy gods  who dislike being neglected .  to make sure there were no unwelcome consequences in the afterlife  precautions were taken at the funerals of discworld shepherds   granny aching had been wrapped in a woollen blanket  with a tuft of raw wool pinned to it .  that was a special shepherd thing .  it was there to tell any gods who might get involved that the person being buried there was a shepherd  and spent a lot of time on the hills  and what with lambing and one thing and another couldn   t always take much time out for religion  there being no churches or temples up there  and so it was generally hoped that the gods would understand and look kindly on them .   the wee free men   this was done on earth  too  in some villages of the south downs up to the     s shepherds were buried with a lock of wool in their hands  so that at the last judgement they could prove what their work had been  and why they had so often missed church on sundays .  occasionally  a crook  shears and a sheep bell were also put in the coffin .  it all added up to the same thing  a hope and also perhaps a belief that one good shepherd would recognize another .   granny aching   s grave was dug on the hill  alongside her hut  and after the funeral there was an additional and very unusual ceremony     the hut was burned .  there wasn   t any shepherd  anywhere on the chalk  who would use it after her .  this was a mark of respect  almost unparalleled on earth  where only gypsies would think of making such a gesture .       the watching of the dead   a newly dead corpse must be carefully prepared  watched over  protected     and treated with caution  for it might become dangerous .   people died .  it was sad  but they did .  what did you do next .  people expected the local witch to know .  so you washed the body and did a few secret and squelchy things and dressed them in their best clothes and laid them out with bowls of earth and salt beside them  no one knew why you did this bit  but it had always been done  and you put two pennies on their eyes    for the ferryman    and you sat with them the night before they were buried  because they shouldn   t be left alone .   exactly why was never properly explained  although everyone had been told the story of the old man who was slightly less dead than everyone thought and rose up off the spare bed in the middle of the night and got back into bed with his wife .   wintersmith   things were done in much the same way on earth  in the days when people died at home  not in a hospital  and were laid out at home  not in an undertaker   s parlour  .  laying out the corpse was both a practical necessity and a social duty  it was a woman   s task  and was often done by the local midwife .  it involved washing the body  plugging its orifices  and closing the eyes and mouth     and ensuring that they remained closed  by laying a penny on each eye  and tying up the jaws with a bandage under the chin which was knotted on top of the head .  a man would be shaved  a woman would have her hair braided .  then the body would either be dressed in good clothes or wrapped tightly in a winding sheet  with its legs straightened and tied at the ankles and its arms crossed over the chest .  the face would not be covered .  that way  everything looked clean and decent when family and neighbours came to    view the body    before it was coffined .   these actions were not just practical .  washing the body could be seen as a purification which echoes baptism  like the catholic custom of sprinkling a corpse with holy water  a suffolk woman who used to lay out the dead told the social historian ruth richardson in      that    the washing is so you   re spotless to meet the lamb of god    .   the pennies had once had a mythical meaning too .  in england in the seventeenth century  the antiquarian john aubrey reported that some old fashioned people still put a coin in the mouth of the dead    to give to st peter    at the gates of heaven .  way back in ancient greek and roman times people used to put a coin into the dead person   s mouth    to pay the ferryman     his name was charon  and he would row the dead across the river styx  which was the boundary of the underworld .  and so too in the discworld there is also  sometimes  a styx to be crossed  and a cowled ferryman to be paid .      i have the money     roland repeated .     two pennies is the rate to cross the river of the dead .  it   s an old tradition .  two pennies to put on the eyes of the dead  to pay the ferryman .      wintersmith   nobody had given tiffany any explanation for the bowls of salt and earth which she had to set down beside the corpse .  in many countries on earth the same thing was done  and various reasons were offered .  the most common was that it prevents the body swelling     which might well work  if the dishes were heavy enough and were laid actually on the chest or belly  as they generally were .  as one welsh woman said     there   s no weight so heavy as salt gets when it is on the dead .     other people gave a religious explanation .  in highland scotland in the mid eighteenth century  people said the earth was an emblem of the corruptible body  and the salt of the immortal spirit .  in nineteenth century sussex  they said that to sprinkle a good handful of salt over the body would prevent the devil flying away with it .  it is common for salt to be used in religion and magic to drive away evil spirits  this may be because it resists decay     salted meat and fish last much longer .   western people now  who worry that too much salt is bad for one   s health  might find it hard to believe how important the getting and keeping of salt was to their ancestors .    the unspoken reason behind much of the ritual  on the disc and on earth too  is the need to prevent any demons who might be around from getting at the corpse before it is safely buried  and to stop the corpse itself from reviving as a malevolent zombie or vampire .  so the dead must never be left alone  someone should sit with them  night and day  and there must always be candles or lamps burning .  these keep the evil spirits and ghosts away  and light up the deceased   s journey to the otherworld .  and they keep the watcher safe .   because sitting up with the dead is     well  just a little strange .  sometimes the body makes little noises in the night  or moves just a bit  and you have to remind yourself firmly that it   s simply because it   s cooling down .  and there are so many stories of worse things .  suppose the candle goes out  and the corpse sits up  saying     isn   t it fun in the dark .     they say that happened once in iceland  luckily the watcher was a strong man  who flung himself on the corpse  forced it on to its back  and held it down till daybreak .  or suppose the devil gets into the house and tries to carry off the body .  or suppose that  as petunia tells tiffany  a thousand vampire demons arrive  each with enormous teeth .   never chronicled  as far as we know .    all things considered  it   s not surprising that in many parts of the multiverse people prefer to do their corpse watching in groups and make a proper wake of it  with cards  tobacco  and a nip of whisky to get them through the night .  and a prayer or two doesn   t come amiss .       an incursion of monsters   all regions of the discworld are at risk of invasion by predatory races from elsewhere in the multiverse  since one universe quite often collides with another .  when this happens  the roaming predators may well find some weak or    thin    place  where people are off their guard  and where they can open a door between the worlds .  in the case of the chalk  as we learn from the wee free men  it is the queen of the fairies who finds a way through from her own small and icy world  where nothing grows and no sun shines  and everything has to be stolen from elsewhere .  and with her come the monsters .      d   you know what   ll be turning up .     asked miss tick .     all the things they locked away in those old stories .  all those reasons why you shouldn   t stray off the path  or open the forbidden door  or say the wrong word  or spill salt .  all the stories that give children nightmares .  all the monsters from under the biggest bed in the world .      the first to arrive is jenny greenteeth  erupting out of a shallow stream  and trying to snatch tiffany   s little brother .  she has long skinny arms  a thin face with long sharp teeth  huge eyes  and dripping green hair like waterweed .  she is  as miss tick explains  nothing more than a grade one prohibitory monster     that is to say  a creature deliberately invented by adults to scare children away from dangerous places .  but though the adults don   t believe they   re real  the children do  and so they become real .   this also happens in ankh morpork  as we shall see later .    on earth too  adults have invented many prohibitory monsters  also called nursery bogeys   including a jenny or ginny greenteeth who lurks in deep pools of stagnant water  hiding under the duckweed .  she was well known in lancashire  cheshire and shropshire .  even in the     s  elderly people remembered being warned against her as children .  in his plant lore        the botanist and folklorist roy vickery records what one merseyside woman told him      as i recall  ginny only lived in ponds which were covered in a green weed of the type that has tiny leaves  and covers the entire surface of the pond .  the theory was that ginny enticed little children into the pools by making them look like grass and safe to walk upon .  as soon as the child stepped on to the green  it of course parted  and the child fell through into ginny   s clutches and drowned .  the green weed then closed over  hiding all traces of the child ever having been there .  this last point was the one which really terrified me and kept me well away from ponds .  as far as i know ginny had no known form  due to the fact that she never appeared above the surface of the pond .      but another merseyside woman knew exactly what the jenny greenteeth who inhabited two pools in fazakerley looked like     pale green skin  green teeth  very long green locks of hair  long green fingers with long nails  and she was very thin with a pointed chin and very big eyes    .  jenny was not the only creature of this species in england .  in leicester there was a polly long arms hiding in the green murky water of the canal  waiting to drag in any child that came near the edge .   the next menacing creature to arrive in the chalk country is a dark rider  a horseman who has no face     since he has no head to hang a face on .  now  ghosts that appear as headless horsemen are quite common in the earthly world  but this creature might be something worse than a mere ghost .  especially as it breathes through the windpipe it hasn   t got  making a wheezy whistling noise which one really would rather not be hearing .  earthbound headless horsemen tend to be more spectral .   later  the queen sends three of her grimhounds     big heavy built black dogs with orange eyebrows  eyes of red fire  and teeth like razor blades .  they are said to haunt churchyards .  this would imply a connection with the church grim  a sinister animal which  according to earthly tradition  patrols graveyards and is an omen of death for anyone who sees it .  in britain the grim is a black dog  in scandinavia  there are also grims which are lame grey horses  three legged lambs or black pigs .  they are said to be the ghosts of real animals deliberately killed when a churchyard was established and buried on the north side  to be its guardian .  if this wasn   t done  people thought that the first person buried there would not enter heaven but would have to remain on duty as a ghostly sentinel till the end of the world .   most of the black dogs of our world are grim creatures  in nature if not in name  some are ghosts  of humans or of dogs   but the majority are demons and devils in animal form .  indeed  the black dog or hell hound is a universally recognized image of evil in european and american folklore .  they are generally large  shaggy creatures with huge fiery eyes  unless they happen to be headless   they may wear collars of flame  or drag heavy clanking chains .  however  their eyebrows are never mentioned .  only in the folklore of estonia is it said that a dog  a real flesh and blood one  not a demon  which has patches of different colour on its eyebrows has    four eyes     and can detect and attack beings that are invisible to humans .  this would appear to be a good thing .  nevertheless  the principle    never trust a dog with orange eyebrows     discovered on the discworld  is so self evidently true and useful that it will surely spread .       found in a fish   and then there was that odd business with the fish  as told in wintersmith .  you would really think that if someone drops or throws into deep water something small but too heavy to float  a ring  say  or a key   that   s the last he or she will ever see of it .   in fact you probably wouldn   t  depending on your childhood reading .  you might already know that a powerful narrative drive decrees that it will be swallowed by a fish  and one day that fish will be caught  and when it   s being gutted something glittery will be found in its belly  and will be brought to the very person who lost it in the first place .  which is precisely how tiffany   s precious silver horse pendant returned to her  although she had thrown it into a river .   here on earth  such things have been happening  off and on  for many centuries .  polycrates  who ruled in samos some two and a half thousand years ago  was so rich and had such constant good luck that they say a friend warned him that the gods would soon be jealous  and advised him to create some deliberate bad luck by losing something he really valued .  so polycrates took a magnificent seal ring  the finest of his jewels  and threw it into the sea .  but a few days later someone sent a beautiful big fish as a gift for the king   s table  and in its belly     it was not long before polycrates was treacherously captured and killed .   or again  in ireland in st patrick   s time  there was a robber called macaldus who tried to trick the saint and make a fool of him  but then repented  and promised to do whatever penance was fitting .  st patrick wrapped a chain round him and padlocked it and threw the key in a river  and then set macaldus adrift in a small boat  telling him to go wherever god sent him  and to wear the chain until the key was returned to him .  the boat floated out to sea  and finally came to the isle of man  where macaldus was taken into the bishop   s household and led a holy life .  one day the bishop   s cook was puzzled to find a key inside a fish he was cleaning     so macaldus was able to take the chain off .  he eventually became bishop of man himself  and is reckoned to be a saint .  there was also st egwin  founder of evesham abbey and bishop of worcester from     till his death in     .  falsely accused of crimes  he put fetters on his legs  threw the key into the avon  and set off on pilgrimage to rome to convince the pope of his innocence .  and there  in the market  he happened to buy a fish     the pope duly cleared him of all charges and restored him to his diocese .   it is particularly striking that the fish which swallowed tiffany   s pendant should be a pike  for in the yorkshire town of pickering people say it got its name because pendirus  a legendary king of the britons who is alleged to have reigned there about     bc  lost his ring while bathing in the river costa  but later recovered it from the belly of a pike .  everyone knows pikes will swallow just about anything .  so will some people .  nevertheless  there is a comfort in these stories  even for the godless .  they suggest a kind of cosmic rightness .  and they still turn up  every few years .   ps  an odd thing happened to terry once .  he bought a ring in a small shop in pike place market  seattle .  it was slightly over sized and he soon lost it  and couldn   t find it anywhere .  a year later he was back in the city  went to the same shop to buy a replacement  and in reaching into his jacket pocket  a jacket which  of course  he   d worn many times during the year  for some loose change  he put a finger through the very same ring .  how could it have been otherwise .  rings try to find their way back to their owner .  someone ought to write a book about it .       the dance of winter and summer   it has long been believed  and may very well be true  that the whole multiverse moves in one perpetual dance  though almost all its motions are either too swift or too slow for the human mind to grasp .  whirling electrons  wheeling galaxies  cycles of time  cycles of energy  the pulsations of the blood  angels in the skies or on the head of a pin     all make patterns in the cosmic dance .  this is not a matter of couples moving independently  like a waltz   nor of a group simply dancing hand in hand in a ring  it involves complicated figures in which dancers change places and partners  advance and retreat  meet and part and meet again .   many poets have written about this .  sir john davies in his orchestra        declared that everything in heaven and earth dances   kind nature first doth cause all things to love   love makes them dance  and in just order move .   and so the sun dances with the earth  flowers with the wind  the tides with the moon   and lo the sea  that fleets about the land  and like a girdle clips her solid waist   music and measure both doth understand   for his great crystal eye is ever cast  up to the moon and on her fix  d fast .   and as she danceth in her pallid sphere   so danceth he about his centre here .   in john milton   s comus         a magician boasts that by dancing while others sleep  he and his companions are echoing the dance of time and nature   we that are of purer fire  imitate the starry choir   who  in their nightly watchful spheres  lead in swift round the months and years .   oceans and seas  with all their finny drove   now to the moon in wavering morrice move      others too have sensed that the morris has a particular affinity with the cycles of nature .  t .  s .  eliot wrote in east coker        of glimpsing ghostly morris men round a bonfire on a summer midnight  with their    music of the weak pipe and the little drum      keeping time   keeping the rhythm in their dancing  as in their living in the living seasons  the time of the seasons and the constellations  the time of milking and the time of harvest  the time of the coupling of man and woman  and that of beasts .  feet rising and falling .   eating and drinking .  dung and death .   in wintersmith we learn more about the dark morris  first brought to our attention in reaper man  when tiffany is taken one icy midnight to a clearing in a leafless wood  where six men  their faces blacked and wearing black clothes  dance to the powerful beat of a silent drum  while shadowy forms look on .  she already knows the white clad morris teams that dance on the village green to bring summer in  but what is this .  unable to resist the beat  she runs forward and jumps into the dance  weaving to and fro in the space where a team   s fool should go  and becoming aware for a few seconds that someone other than human is dancing with her .   what she has seen is part of the never ending dance of the seasons  in which the wintersmith and the summer lady meet and change places in spring and autumn .  explaining this  miss treason shows her a picture in chaffinch   s ancient and classical mythology of a tall  blonde  beautiful summer  carrying a cornucopia and dancing with old grey winter  who has icicles in his beard .      the year is round .  the wheel of the world must spin .  that is why up here they dance the dark morris  to balance it .  they welcome the winter because of the new summer deep inside it .      the spring and autumn morris dances are a way of marking the moment when the season of ice and the season of fire meet briefly to exchange their dominion over the world .  in our world  other ways have been found of bringing summer in     a young man dressed in leaves and flowers fights and defeats an older man dressed in furs  girls carry an ugly straw figure called winter or death out of the village  tear it to bits or throw it into a river  and come back carrying leafy branches  people bring in the maypole .  frazer   s the golden bough has much to say about all this .  at the other end of the year  the secrets are better kept  yet even so one can guess that in the season of bonfires and fireworks  nuts and apples  beer  beef  and new wine  there is an underlying celebration that winter is taking over the power that is rightfully his     for a while .  and at midwinter  there is guising  feasting  mummers    plays  and yes  morris dancing again .  the wheel spins .   but tiffany has made a serious mistake by entering the dance herself .  she has taken the place of the summer lady  attracting the attention of the wintersmith  and now is trapped in her role .  she is turning into a goddess  or at least an avatar  or an anthropomorphic personification .   the first symptom is that she develops    fertile feet        wherever she treads with bare feet  flowers spring up .  even the floorboards in nanny ogg   s cottage  being wood  start sprouting leaves .  much the same thing happened to prince teppic of djelibeybi as soon as the spirit of his father  a recently deceased pharaoh  entered into him  as is told in pyramids .  even on the cobbled streets of ankh morpork grass appeared where he put his feet  and in the bakers    shops loaves cracked open and grew wheat .   on earth too  avatars of spring or summer are  very understandably  credited with the gift of fertile feet .  in the medieval welsh tale of    culhwch and olwen    in the mabinogion  it is said of the lovely young heroine that    four white trefoils sprang up behind her wherever she went  and for that reason was she called olwen        which means    white track    .  the italian painter botticelli represents primavera  spring  as a beautiful woman walking across a flower filled glade  throwing down more flowers as she goes  which is the closest a painter can get to the idea that they spring up as she passes .  and then there are four famous lines from a poem written by alexander pope in       when he was only sixteen   where   er you walk  cool gales shall fan the glade   trees  where you sit  shall crowd into a shade   where   er you tread  the blushing flowers shall rise   and all things flourish where you turn your eyes .   the poem is one of a set of four seasonal love poems  and is entitled    summer    .  these particular lines are so famous because handel set them to music in his opera semele  as a song addressed by the god jupiter to the human girl he loves .  they are so appropriate to tiffany   s situation that they cross over into the discworld and into the mind of the schoolmistressy witch  miss tick      the myth of the summer lady says that flowers grow wherever she walks     said granny weatherwax .      where e   er     said miss tick primly .      what .     snapped granny  who was now pacing up and down in front of the fire .      it   s where e   er she walks  in fact     said miss tick .     it   s more     poetical .         hah     granny said .     poetry .      wintersmith   the next sign of tiffany   s new status is that a cornucopia  aka horn of plenty  crash lands in the garden .  it is a curly shell like object  of magically variable size  containing every kind of fruit  vegetable and grain     in fact  it turns out  anything and everything one can eat or drink .  these things it produces on request  in lavish quantities .  it is a definitely mythological object      according to chaffinch      tiffany  said  with the mythology open on her lap          the god blind io created the cornucopia from a horn of the magical goat almeg to feed his two children by the goddess bisonomy  who was later turned into a shower of oysters by epidity  god of things shaped like potatoes  after insulting resonata  goddess of weasels  by throwing a mole at her shadow .  it is now the badge of office of the summer goddess .      the corresponding myth in ancient greece is not quite so complicated .  as a baby  the god zeus had to be hidden from his murderous father in a cave in crete  where he fed on the milk of a nanny goat called amalthea  unless this was the name of the nymph who owned her  .  later  when he became ruler of the gods  he showed his gratitude by placing the goat among the stars as the constellation capricorn .  but first he broke off one of her horns  it became the cornucopia  which supplies whatever food or drink one desires .  this horn later belonged to demeter  also called ceres  goddess of the harvest  and was sometimes carried by flora  the flower goddess  who scattered corn and wine and fruit and flowers from it .  painters and sculptors are very fond of it  it   s such a pretty shape .   tiffany struggles to cope with these rather embarrassing attributes  and the even more embarrassing compliments lavished on her by the wintersmith .  but where  meanwhile  is the real summer lady .  it turns out that  like many a goddess before her  she is trapped in the underworld  powerless to return .  without her presence  the disc will suffer permanent and catastrophic discal cooling  with incalculable environmental repercussions .  it is  in short  time for a hero and a descent into the underworld .   this descent is one of the most powerful stories in the multiverse .  on earth  for example  it can be found in one form or another in at least a dozen mythologies from ancient babylonia onwards .  sometimes it is a god or goddess who descends  sometimes a human .  sometimes the purpose is to gain foreknowledge by questioning the dead  sometimes it is to learn the secret of immortality  or to carry off a magical object  but most often  it is to rescue a captive .  there have been missions that were entirely successful  as when odysseus went down to consult the dead seer tiresias or when herakles  hercules  brought queen alkmene back from the dead  and others that failed  most famously when orpheus lost his beloved eurydice when they had very nearly reached the land of the living  because he looked back at her .   and some myths tell of partial successes     and these  curiously  are linked to the cycle of the seasons  just like the rescue of the disc   s summer lady .  the oldest comes from ancient sumeria  about      bc  and tells how the great goddess ishtar went into the underworld   to the land of no return  the realm of ereshkigal   to the house which none leaves who has entered it   to the road from which there is no way back   to the house wherein the entrants are bereft of life   where dust is their fare and clay their food   where they see no light  residing in darkness   where they are clothed like birds  with wings for garments   and where over door and bolt is spread dust .    ishtar   s descent  transl .  john gray   she was seeking her human lover tammuz  who had apparently been kidnapped by ereshkigal  queen of the underworld  and was now among the dead .  ishtar fought ereshkigal  but was defeated  tortured  and held captive in a corpse like condition .  without her  there was nothing but famine and sterility on earth  so the high gods forced ereshkigal to sprinkle ishtar with the water of life and let her go free .  tammuz too was revived and freed  but not entirely  every year he died again during the long sterile drought season  and the people wept for him .  but then  with the coming of the rains  he returned to life .   similarly in classical greece and rome  myths told how demeter  ceres   the goddess of fertile crops and harvest  was distraught with grief when her daughter persephone  proserpina  was kidnapped .  neglecting her divine duties  demeter went searching everywhere for persephone  until she found her girdle floating in a pool near a great crevice which was known to be an entrance to the underworld .  this remarkably fortuitous clue proved that it was hades  pluto   god of death  who had carried her off .  demeter did not descend into the underworld herself  but appealed to zeus for justice .  zeus knew that without demeter   s care all crops would fail  so he decreed that persephone could return to earth  provided she had eaten nothing while in the realm of hades .  but  alas  she had eaten     a mere trifle  just six pomegranate seeds     but because of this zeus ruled that she must spend six months of the year in the underworld  though she could come back to earth for the other six .  which is why there are six months of summer and six of winter .      they are ancient stories .  they have a life of their own .  they long to be repeated .  summer rescued from a cave .  very old     said granny weatherwax .   so tiffany   s friend roland de chumsfanleigh  pronounced chuffley  makes the descent  accompanied by feegles  and passes through a cave into a gloomy land of shadows and mindless people whose memories have been stolen by bogles .  there is a dark river and a dark ferryman who as we have seen has to be paid with two pennies from the eyes of the dead  just as in earthly myth there is the river styx and charon the ferryman who takes coins from the mouths of the dead .  and then   there was a big pile of bones on the path .  they were certainly animal bones  and the rotting collars and lengths of rusted chain were another clue .      three big dogs .     said roland .      one verrae big dog wi    three heids     said rob anybody .     verrae popular in underworlds  that breed .  can bite right through a man   s throat .  three times .     he added  with relish .     but put three doggy biscuits in a row on the groound and the puir wee thing sits there strainin    and whinin    all day .  it   s a wee laff  i   m tellin    ye .      in the classical myths of earth  the representative of this three headed breed is called cerberus .  it is his task to guard the entrance of the underworld so that no one alive may enter  nor may any of the dead escape     but his attention can be distracted by throwing him soft cakes sweetened with honey  and  preferably  also laced with poppy juice  .  he was also once lulled by the music of orpheus  and once he was overwhelmed by the physical strength of herakles .  but mostly he is just sitting there  on guard .   despite all perils  roland brings the summer lady back to the upper world  and tiffany finds a way to dismiss the wintersmith .  the dance of the seasons resumes  in which summer and winter must each die and sleep and wake again  year after year .  no one should meddle with it .      here is the heart of the summer     hissed the voice of the summer lady .     fear me as much as the wintersmith .  we are not yours  though you give us shapes and names .  fire and ice we are  in balance .  do not come between us again             chapter      heroes .       we   re not talking about small h heroes  here .  given a smidgeon of courage and a suitable crisis  practically anybody could turn out to be a small h hero .  but a capital h hero is a star in the firmament of myth and legend  a precious asset to any bard or storyteller who happens to meet him .  people hoping for a quiet life are less enthusiastic  since a considerable amount of mayhem erupts wherever a hero passes  even one who is seeking justice rather than  say  the green eye of the little yellow god .   heroes come in two main types  the heir to the kingdom  and the barbarian .  both are recognizable by certain signs  well known to anyone who knows anything about folklore and the power of narrativium  and abound in the semi historical legends of many nations .  less common is the first  or culture  hero  found on the discworld and in certain earthly mythologies .  yet since he is the most ancient of the three  it is only right to begin with him .       the first hero   in the myths and folklore of some lands there are tales of a first hero who walked the earth at the dawn of time  bringing mankind essential gifts and skills without which society could not survive .  such a hero is more than human  but he is not a god  indeed  he may be acting in defiance of gods who wish to keep men helpless and ignorant .  in one way he is the opposite of the barbarian hero  since he brings civilization  not mere pillage and carnage  some therefore call him the culture hero .  his courage is the courage of endurance .   on the disc  the first hero   s name is mazda     a remarkable coincidence  since on earth there is a morally admirable deity called mazda who is the god of light  truth  and justice in zoroastrianism  the ancient religion of persia  iran  .  he is the power of good  locked in combat with the evil ahriman  whom he will defeat at the last day .  the discworld   s mazda is not so exalted  but he too worked for good  and suffered for it .  of course  much depends on the point of view  since an unsympathetic mind would say that what he did was theft .  he stole fire from the gods .      i thought i   d start off with the legend of how mazda stole fire for mankind in the first place     said the minstrel .      nice     said cohen .      and then a few verses about what the gods did to him .         did to him .  did to him .     said cohen .     they made him immortal .         er     yes .  in a way  i suppose .         what do you mean     in a way    .         it   s classical mythology  cohen     said the minstrel .     i thought everyone knew .  he was chained to a rock for eternity and every day an eagle comes and pecks out his liver .         i   m not much of a reader     said cohen .     chained to a rock .  for a first offence .  he   s still there .         eternity isn   t finished yet  cohen .         he must   ve had a big liver .         it grows again every night  according to legend     said the minstrel .   cohen stared at the distant clouds that hid the snowy top of the mountain .     he brought fire to everyone  and the gods did that to him  eh .  well     we   ll have to see about that .      the last hero   this is indeed  as the minstrel says  a classical myth .  in ancient greece  it was the story of prometheus  the benefactor of mankind     maybe even the creator of mankind  for some old writers claimed that he formed the bodies of the first men and women from water and clay  after which the goddess athene breathed life into them .  whether that is true or not  all agree that he brought them civilization  teaching them the skills he had himself learned from athene     metal working  building  mathematics  astronomy  medicine     to the great anger of zeus  who had intended them to remain ignorant .  and then  to cap it all  prometheus stole fire from the gods .  he lit a torch from the chariot of the sun  broke off a smouldering ember  hid it in a hollow stalk of fennel  and so carried it down to the earth as a gift to humanity .   furious  zeus had prometheus stripped naked and chained to a rock in the caucasian mountains .  every day at dawn a monstrous bird  part griffin and part vulture  would fly down and tear his body open  pecking out and eating his liver  every night  as he lay freezing  his liver would grow again  ready for the dawn .  yet he knew he would be released one day .  and so it was .  when prometheus had spent a thousand years fettered to the rock  or  some say  ten thousand   herakles  a hero of the wild and monster slaying type  persuaded zeus to let him shoot the griffin vulture through the heart and set prometheus free .  the barbarian hero came to the rescue of the culture hero  on earth as on the disc .       the royal heir   the people of ankh morpork know all about heirs who arrive incognito to claim their rightful kingdom and turn out to be ideal rulers  brave  wise and just   the throne had been empty for more than two thousand years  since the death of the last of the line of the kings of ankh .  legend said that one day the city would have a king again  and went on with various comments about magic swords  strawberry birthmarks  and all the other things that legends gabble on about in these circumstances .   sourcery   what is more  pretty well all of them know the rumour that such an heir is currently living in the city  as a mere watchman .  and they can put a name to him  captain carrot ironfoundersson  a conspiracy to groom nobby nobbs for the role failed utterly  .  in fact  the only person who seems unaware of the rumour is carrot himself .  he is a foundling  he has a strong sword  well used  though quite unmagical and lacking any mysterious inscriptions  he has an oddly shaped birthmark  rather like a crown .  but still he resists the pressures of narrativium  and goes around ignoring his manifest destiny in a most irritating manner .   perhaps there have been carrots on earth  but if so  their strategy has been so successful that nobody has ever heard of them .  in that universe  the nearest thing to carrot   s attitude is the na  ve simplicity of the teenage arthur .  as is well known  he had no idea he was a dead king   s son  and was simply acting as squire to his elder foster brother sir kay .  kay needed a replacement sword to use in a tournament  and sent arthur to find one .  arthur wandered off into a churchyard  where he noticed something which he thought would come in useful .  as malory writes in his morte d   arthur   there was seen in the churchyard     a great stone four square  like unto a marble stone  and in the midst thereof was like an anvil of steel a foot on high  and therein stuck a fair sword naked by the point  and letters there were written in gold about the sword that said thus     whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil  is rightwise king born of all england .   without bothering to read the inscription  arthur casually pulled the sword out and took it to kay .  when people realized where it had come from  and also that when it was put back nobody but arthur could get it to move at all  he was acknowledged to be the long lost heir .   one might easily assume that this was the famed excalibur which arthur always bore in battle  but malory says not     according to his account  the sword drawn from the stone was broken two or three years later in a duel between arthur and pellinore  but merlin promised to find him another   so they rode till they came to a lake  the which was a fair water and broad  and in the midst of the lake arthur was    ware of an arm clothed in white samite  that held a fair sword in that hand .  lo .  said merlin  yonder is that sword that i spake of .  with that they saw a damosel going upon the lake .  what damosel is that .  said arthur .  that is the lady of the lake  said merlin     speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword     and so they went into the ship  and when they came to the sword that the hand held  sir arthur took it up by the handles  and took it with him  and the arm and the hand went under the water .   this is the true excalibur  the one which the dying arthur ordered sir bedivere to throw into a lake   then sir bedivere  took up the sword and  went to the water side  and there he bound the girdle about the hilts  and then he threw the sword as far into the water as he might  and there came an arm and an hand above the water and met it  and caught it  and so shook it thrice and brandished  and then vanished away the hand with the sword in the water .   whether king arthur ever really died is a mystery .  true  there was a tomb for him in the medieval glastonbury abbey  but it was a fake  and rumours abounded .  as malory wrote   some men say in many parts of england that king arthur is not dead  but had by the will of our lord jesu into another place  and men say that he shall come again  and he shall win the holy cross .  i will not say it shall be so  but rather i will say  here in this world he changed his life .  but many men say that there is written upon his tomb this verse  hic jacet arthurus  rex quondam rexque futurus    here lies arthur  former king and future king     .   this is no longer the tale of a lost heir .  this is a hero of another sort  the sleeping king under the mountain  the king who will come back from    another place    to save his people and achieve heroic feats     a tale we have met already in lancre and elsewhere .  it is a powerful narrative pattern  widely scattered through the multiverse as a consolation and a source of inspiration and hope .       the barbarian hero   there was no mistaking that shape .  the wide chest  the neck like a tree trunk  the surprisingly small head under its wild thatch of black hair looking like a tomato on a coffin     hrun was one of the discworld   s more durable heroes  a fighter of dragons  a despoiler of temples  a hired sword  the kingpost of every street brawl .  he could even speak words of more than two syllables  given time and maybe a hint or two .   the colour of magic   hrun dresses only in a leopard skin loincloth and numerous gold arm bands and anklets .  it goes without saying that he is totally fearless and unimaginative  while being at the same time as alert to any danger as a cat and as lithe as a panther .  his life is one long string of adventures  which don   t surprise him in the least      oh     said hrun     i expect in a minute this dungeon door will be flung back and i   ll be dragged off to some sort of temple arena where i   ll fight maybe a couple of giant spiders and an eight foot slave from the jungles of klatch and then i   ll rescue some kind of princess from the altar and then kill off a few guards or whatever and then this girl will show me a secret passage out of the palace and we   ll liberate a couple of horses and escape with the treasure .      hrun leaned back on his hands and looked up at the ceiling  whistling tunelessly .      all that .     said twoflower .      usually .      earth too knows heroes of this type  notably conan the barbarian from cimmeria  whose many adventures as pirate  mercenary  and eventual war lord and emperor were chronicled in america in the     s by the fantasy writer robert e .  howard and others .  an admirer wrote     conan is a true hero of valhalla  battling and suffering great wounds by day  carousing and wenching by night  and plunging into fresh adventures tomorrow .     besides ordinary human enemies  he is forever attacking  or being attacked by  evil lords  sorcerers  witch queens  magical monsters  dark gods .  an indestructible stone toad thing as bulky as a buffalo  with seven green glowing eyes  crouching on an altar in a temple of lustreless black stone whose geometry obeys no human laws  is just the kind of thing he would meet .  he always wins .   a barbarian hero  like his kingly counterpart  often possesses a remarkable sword .  hrun   s is called kring  and he stole it from the impregnable palace of the archimandrite of b   ituni .  it is forged from black meteoric iron  with highly ornate runes on the blade and rubies on the pommel .  not only does kring have a name of its own  it has a soul  it talks incessantly in a voice like a claw being scraped across glass  and it has a very irritating personality .  in the course of its multidimensional existence it has of course starred in numerous battles  and at one point belonged to a pasha who used it to cut silk handkerchiefs in mid air  on the other hand  it once spent two hundred years at the bottom of a lake  which was not really fun .  can this possibly mean that kring has existed on earth too     that kring and excalibur are aspects of a single entity .  and is that why kring remarks  when stuck in a tree branch  that    it could have been worse  it could have been an anvil    .   come to think of it  even the tree could be significant .  the volsungs  a family of norse and germanic heroes  had as their heirloom a sword which came to them by way of a test very like arthur   s .  odin  the god of war  had driven it up to the hilt into a tree trunk  challenging kings and warriors to pull it out     whoso draweth this sword from this tree shall have the same as a gift from me  and shall find in good sooth that never bare he better sword in hand than this .     sigmund the volsung was the only one who could draw it out  and it served him well until in his last battle it broke against the spear shaft of odin himself .  but when sigmund   s son grew up  he is called sigurd in iceland  and siegfried in germany   he reforged the blade that was broken  naming it gram  and became an even greater hero than his father had been .  perhaps this too is something kring knows about .   many heroes undertake adventures just for the fun of it  while others  young nijel in sourcery  for instance  see themselves as ruled by a special kind of destiny called a    geas    .  this is a form of the irish word geis  and has nothing at all to do with large  waddling  grey or white birds .  it means an obligation  enforced by magical penalties  to do or not to do some particular thing .  a hero may be born with a geis  or more than one   or someone may lay it on him .  either way  it usually spells trouble  especially if he gets into a situation where two of his geissa clash .  one great irish warrior  c   chulainn  was trapped in this way .  he was under two obligations  one was never to eat dog   s flesh  which seems simple enough  but the other was never to refuse an offer of food and hospitality .  so when an enemy  knowing this  invited him to a meal of dog stew he was forced to break either one rule or the other  and was doomed .  nijel  luckily  has no such dilemma .   the greatest by far of the discworld   s barbarian heroes is cohen .  anything others have done  he has done better  faster  more often .  he is the bravest  the most famous .  he has been an emperor in the counterweight continent  and during this phase of his career was respectfully referred to as genghis cohen .  there is just one small problem     he is now somewhere around ninety years old .  most of the friends and foes of his younger days are dead .  his surviving companions are now known as the silver horde .  like him  they suffer a variety of age related afflictions  piles  deafness  toothlessness  stiff joints   and like him they will never cease to be heroes .   and yet  in the long run  what does the life of a hero amount to .  standing on a mountain peak  cohen surveys the kingdoms of the world as he sets out on his last and greatest enterprise  accompanied by the silver horde and a very puzzled minstrel .      i bin to everywhere i can see     said cohen  looking around .     been there  done that     been there again  done it twice     nowhere left where i ain   t been .      the minstrel looked him up and down  and a kind of understanding dawned .  i know why you are doing this now  he thought .  thank goodness for a classical education .  now  what was the quote .          and carelinus wept  for there were no more worlds to conquer        he said .      who   s that bloke .  you mentioned him before     said cohen .      you haven   t heard of the emperor carelinus .         nope .         but he was the greatest conqueror that ever lived .  his empire spanned the entire disc .      well  when he got as far as the coast of muntab  it was said that he stood on the shore and wept .  some philosopher told him there were more worlds out there somewhere  and that he   d never be able to conquer them .  er     that reminded me a bit of you .      cohen strolled along in silence for a moment .      yeah     he said at last .     yeah  i can see how that could be .   only not as cissy  obviously .      the last hero   and later  trying to explain why he and his companions mean to blow up the mountain of the gods  though they themselves will be killed doing it  cohen remembers the rage and frustration of carelinus that the unjust gods have granted such short lives to men      i ain   t much good with words  but     i reckon we   re doing this    cos we are goin    to die  d   yer see .  and    cos some bloke got to the edge of the world somewhere and saw all them other worlds out there and burst into tears    cos there was only one lifetime .  so much universe  and so little time .  and that   s not right .      carelinus  the mighty conqueror of distant kingdoms  has a counterpart in the history of ancient greece .  his name was alexander the great  and there are strange similarities in the careers of these two great men .  the knotty problem  for one .  carelinus once came to the temple of offler in tsort  where there was a huge  complicated knot tying two beams together  and it was said that whoever untied it would reign over the whole continent  carelinus simply sliced right through it with his sword  and went on to build a huge empire .  was this cheating .  cohen thinks it wasn   t      it wasn   t cheating  because it was a good story .  i can just imagine it  too .  a load of whey faced priests and suchlike standin    around and thinkin        that   s cheatin     but he   s got a really big sword so i won   t be the first to point this out  plus this damn great army is just outside .          amazingly  exactly the same thing happened to alexander .  as a young general  he led his army into the town of gordium  near modern ankara  in turkey   where there was an ancient ox cart which their first king had dedicated to zeus after tying up its axle tree with a weirdly knotted rope .  it was prophesied that anyone who could untie it would rule all asia  but nobody had managed it in over a hundred years .  alexander tried  failed  and then drew his sword and cut it .  that night there was a terrible thunderstorm .  the priests of zeus wisely decided this showed the approval of the gods .   another story told of him  if properly understood  shows that he felt just the same way as carelinus and cohen did about the limits of his achievements .   it is popularly said that alexander  at the height of his power  stood on the shores of the indian ocean and    wept to think that there were no worlds left for him to conquer    .  like so much that is popularly said  this is nonsense  it is a medieval legend  not to be found in any ancient source .  alexander was no fool .  he knew perfectly well that though he had conquered afghanistan  reached the borders of kashmir  and then marched down the indus valley to the sea  there remained many more kingdoms in asia and india which he had not defeated .  come to that  there were large tracts of europe itself  to the north and west of greece  where his armies had never set foot .  no way could he have thought there was nothing left for him to conquer .   this medieval legend distorts an older and more subtle anecdote  which is to be found in the ancient greek author plutarch     not in his full scale life of alexander  but in an essay    on contentment of the mind    in his collection of moralia .  among the members of alexander   s court was a philosopher named anaxarchus  who by pure reasoning achieved a remarkably modern understanding of the nature of the multiverse .  according to plutarch     alexander wept when he heard anaxarchus speak about the infinite number of worlds in the universe .  one of alexander   s friends asked him what was the matter  and he replied     there are so many worlds  and i have not yet conquered even one .          cohen is not alone in sharing the frustration of carelinus and alexander .  so  in a different way  does the normally cheerful tourist twoflower  standing at the rim of the disc and staring out at the stars .      sometimes i think a man could wander across the disc all his life and not see all there is to see     said twoflower .     and now it seems there are lots of other worlds as well .  when i think i might die without seeing a hundredth of all there is to see it makes me feel     he paused  then added     well  humble  i suppose .  and very angry  of course .      the colour of magic   it is also intriguing to note how fortune  lady luck  decided the fate of both alexander and cohen by a throw of the dice .  writers in antiquity and in the middle ages argued about the influence of fortune on the life of alexander     he had been amazingly successful as a conqueror and ruler  yet he was only    when he unexpectedly died  struck down by sickness or  some believed  treacherously poisoned .  so was fortune on alexander   s side or not .  did he owe his achievements to her  or to his own virtues .  did she turn against him in the end .  in chaucer   s canterbury tales  the monk is certain that she did .  he laments over the long list of great men who first enjoyed fortune   s favours  but whom she then betrayed .  one of them is alexander  at one time    the heir of her honour     till she destroyed him in a game of dice where she magically transformed his winning throw  a six  into the lowest possible one .   o worthy  noble alexander  o alas  that you should ever fall in such a case .   poisoned by people of your own you were .   your six did fortune change into an ace   and yet she never wept for you one tear .   in the discworld  cohen accepts a challenge to roll dice against the harsh god fate  not against fortune  the lady  .  fate throws a six  and tells cohen that to win he must throw a seven     though the die is a perfectly normal one with only the regulation six sides .      so     seven and i win     said cohen .     it comes down showin    seven and i win  right .         yes .  of course     said fate .      sounds like a million to one chance to me     said cohen .   he tossed the die high in the air  and it slowed as it rose  tumbling glacially with a noise like the swish of windmill blades .   it reached the top of its arc and began to fall .   cohen was staring fixedly at it  absolutely still .  then his sword was out of its scabbard and it whirled around in a complex curve .  there was a snick and a green flash in the middle of the air and          two halves of an ivory cube bounced across the table .  one landed showing the six .  the other landed showing the one .   the last hero   the situation is not without precedent on the discworld  a five thrown by the lady turns into a seven in the colour of magic   or even in our own world  where it is said that king olaf of norway played dice against the king of sweden for a disputed island  and won when his die accidentally split in half  one face showing the six and the other the one .  nevertheless fate accuses cohen of cheating  and would have reneged on the bargain if the lady     whom none of the gods ever opposes     had not intervened on cohen   s behalf .  but cohen does not appreciate the favour .      and who are you .     snapped cohen  still red with rage .      i .  i     am the million to one chance     she said .      yeah .     said cohen  less impressed than the minstrel thought he ought to be .     and who are all the other chances .         i am those  also .      cohen sniffed .     then you ain   t no lady .         er  that   s not really       the minstrel began .      oh  that wasn   t what i was supposed to say  was it .     said cohen .     i was supposed to say     ooh  ta  missus  much obliged    .  well  i ain   t .  they say fortune favours the brave  but i say i   ve seen too many brave men walkin    into battles they never walked out of .  the hell with all of it .      the last hero   nothing  not even a marvel that has saved his own life  can persuade cohen to give up his fury at the injustice of old age and inevitable death .   those who want a happy ending every time had better steer clear of epic poetry and heroic sagas  for the wages of heroism is death .  true  there are a few legendary heroes who vanish into fairyland  but the great majority die by violence  and their deaths are at least as memorable as their lives .  some fall in battle against overwhelming odds  as did charlemagne   s noble warriors roland and oliver facing a saracen army at roncevalles  some  like the irish c   chulainn and the danish hrolf kraki  die because the enemy host is strengthened by the spells of evil magicians and malevolent deities  some are murdered by the treachery of trusted relatives or comrades  as were sigurd the dragon slayer and robin hood .   on the other hand  death is what offers a hero the finest chance to display his mettle .  an anglo saxon poet put these words into the mouth of an ageing english warrior facing certain defeat and death in battle against vikings at maldon in essex in       our minds shall mount higher  our hearts beat harder   our spirits grow stronger  as strength dwindles .   always at the last there is the burial mound  the funeral pyre  the death ship     which may be set on fire  or simply pushed out to sea  as was done for scyld scefing  a legendary danish king   the prince   s ship with curving prow   glinting with hoar frost  eager to leave   lay in the harbour .  they laid their dear lord   their ring giver  in the ship   s bosom  beside the mast   and treasures too  from far off lands .   high over his head a banner hung   gold embroidered .  they let the waters bear him away   trusted him to the ocean .  sad were their hearts .   beowulf   or  as cohen puts it  remembering one of his old comrades      where would he have been if we weren   t there to give him a proper funeral  eh .  a great big bonfire  that   s the funeral of a hero .  and everyone else said it was a waste of a good boat .      the last hero   and where was the boat heading .  well  there was always the possibility of valhalla or the elysian fields or the happy isles  but ancient epics and sagas have little to say on this point .  what mattered far more was that the hero should be remembered .  it was said of sigurd that    his name will last as long as the world endures     and the same was     or should be     true of every hero .  as the old icelandic poem h  vam  l puts it   cattle die  kinsmen die   and each man too shall die .   i know one thing that never dies   a dead man   s reputation .   an eye catching grave is useful publicity too  not for nothing did beowulf   s people cover his ashes with a large mound  high on a headland where every passing ship would see it .  but the centuries roll on  and memories fade .  we can make a fair guess at who lies in the royal barrow at sutton hoo in suffolk  but there are dozens upon dozens of mounds along the south downs and on salisbury plain that were raised for men whose names and deeds are now utterly forgotten .  which is wrong .  which is why cohen is found one day sitting on an ancient burial mound and refusing to come back into camp for dinner  because he    hadn   t finished    .      finished what  old friend .         rememb   rin        said cohen .      remembering who .         the hero who was buried here  all right .         who was he .         dunno .         what were his people .         search me     said cohen .     did he do any mighty deeds .         couldn   t say .         then why    .         someone   s got to remember the poor bugger .         you don   t know anything about him .         i can still remember him .      the last hero   time also creates a problem for the rare hero who does not die young .  is it fitting for him to settle down quietly  while old age  the enemy he can never conquer or outwit  advances steadily upon him .  is he to lie in his bed  old and sick  meekly waiting for death     a straw death  as vikings would mockingly call it .  of course  fate might send him  even in old age  the chance of a last good fight  beowulf had been a king for fifty years when he went to face the dragon .  but if not     well  it is in the nature of heroes to rage against the dying of the light .   in history  one of the great medieval warlords of asia was the mongolian timur i lenk  called tamerlane by westerners  who was descended on his mother   s side from genghis khan .  his empire was centred in samarkand  and stretched from turkey to the ganges valley and the borders of china  he died a natural death in      at the age of seventy two  while making plans to invade china itself .  according to legend  as told by the elizabethan playwright marlowe  who called him tamburlaine   on his deathbed he declared war on the gods for striking him down   what daring god torments my body thus   and seeks to conquer mighty tamburlaine .   shall sickness prove me now to be a man   that have been termed the terror of the world .   techelles and the rest  come  take your swords   and threaten him whose hand afflicts my soul .   come  let us march against the powers of heaven   and set black banners in the firmament   to signify the slaughter of the gods .   he may not have been the only one who refused to go quietly .  odysseus may have done the same  though less fiercely .  in homer   s odyssey we hear how this resourceful hero  whose cleverness led to the greek victory in the trojan war  eventually got home to his island kingdom of ithaca after ten years of struggling against monsters  enchantments  and shipwrecks .  and there homer leaves him  happily reunited with his wife penelope  to grow old in peace .  but did he .   a thousand years later dante  who  like all italians  called him ulysses  thought his story ended differently .  the bonds of family and homeland could not overcome his passion to learn more about the world .  so he set sail with a small band of his faithful comrades  all grown old  urging them on towards the lands beyond the sun  men were not made to live like brutes  he said  but to pursue knowledge and excellence .  they sailed through the straits of gibraltar and out into the deep ocean  past the equator  and far southwards  till they saw a towering mountain     which  though they did not know it  was the mount of purgatory crowned with the earthly paradise .  but there came a whirlwind from this unknown land  and spun their ship three times round  and sank it .  and thus ended the life of ulysses .   in victorian times  tennyson took up the theme .  in his poem    ulysses    the aged hero looks back on a life spent    always roaming with a hungry heart     and resolves never to pause  never to make an end  but still  to follow knowledge like a sinking star   beyond the utmost bound of human thought .   he gathers his former comrades  urging them to defy the years and the approach of death  and join him on a last voyage into the unknown   for my purpose holds  to sail beyond the sunset  and the baths  of all the western stars  until i die .   it may be that the gulfs will wash us down   it may be we shall touch the happy isles   and see the great achilles  whom we knew .   though much is taken  much abides  and though  we are not now that strength which in old days  moved earth and heaven  that which we are  we are   one equal temper of heroic hearts   made weak by time and fate  but strong in will  to strive  to seek  to find  and not to yield .   cohen and the silver horde would have understood .       chapter      lore  legends  and truth      the foundation legends   any self respecting city has to have a legend about its own foundation .  ankh morpork  as is right and proper for the oldest and greatest city on the disc  has two .   the first is the official one .  according to this  there were once two orphaned brothers  mere babies  who had been left on the shores of the ankh to die .  there they were found by a she hippopotamus  who suckled them .  when they grew up  they decided to build themselves a home  and so founded what must at the time have been a very small city indeed .  in memory of this  the shield on the coat of arms of ankh morpork has as its supporters deux hippopot  mes royales b  illant  un enchain    un couronn   au cou .  which  stripped of its aristocratic herald speak  means two royal hippos yawning  one wearing a chain and the other with a crown round its neck .  the conventions of heraldry do not permit the sex of the beasts to be clearly indicated  but in view of the tale we can safely state that at least one of them is female .  the legend is also commemorated by eight hippo statues on the city   s brass bridge  facing out to sea .  it is said that if danger ever threatens the city they will run away .   some people have expressed doubts over this ancient and uplifting tradition .  why and how  they ask  would a she hippo suckle human babies .  and how could they thrive on this eccentric diet .  did they but know it  these doubters could find a tale on earth proving that such things are perfectly possible .  it tells of twins  romulus and remus  who were the sons of mars the god of war and a human princess .  their evil great uncle  having just usurped his brother   s throne  seized the boys and threw them into the tiber  for fear they might grow up to challenge him .    but the river washed them safely to the bank  where a she wolf fed them with her milk until a kindly shepherd found them .  later  they built the city of rome .  considering what wolves normally eat  this tale is even more wondrous than that of the hippo  but the romans had no difficulty in believing it .  and  naturally  making a statue about it .   the second legend is not told quite so often by the citizens of ankh morpork  but is surprisingly widespread in other towns .  it is said that way back in the fogs of time there was once a great flood sent by the gods  and that a group of wise men survived by building a huge boat into which they crammed two of every type of animal then existing on the disc .  after a few weeks the combined manure was beginning to weigh the boat low in the water  so     the story runs     they tipped it over the side and called the heap ankh morpork .  anybody who doubts the truth of this should go and stand on one of the bridges over the ankh  preferably on a warm day  and breathe deep .       sunken cities and vanishing islands   there is also the legend of the lost city  the city before the city .  it is not an uncommon tale     indeed  there are variants in all the cities of the sto plains     but hardly anyone takes it seriously .   there had been a city once  in the mists of pre history     bigger than ankh morpork  if that were possible .  and the inhabitants had done something  some sort of unspeakable crime not just against mankind or the gods but against the very nature of the universe itself  which had been so dreadful that it had sunk beneath the sea one stormy night .  only a few people had survived to carry to the barbarian peoples in the less advanced parts of the disc all the arts and crafts of civilization .   moving pictures   according to the dreaded grimoire necrotelecomnicon  there had been a hill at the edge of the city       and in that hill  it is said  a door out of the world was found  and people of the city watched what was seen therein  knowing not that dread waited between the universes     for others found the gate of the holy wood and fell upon the world  and in one nighte all manner of madnesse befell  and chaos prevailed  and the citie sank beneath the sea  and all became one with the fishes and the lobsters  save for a few who fled .   the hill is still there  on a lonely stretch of coast about thirty miles from ankh morpork .  it is not very high  yet high enough to be visible for miles  standing out from the wind blown sand dunes all around .  it is covered with wretched scrubby trees .  people call it holy wood .  and they say that if you stand on the beach at holy wood on a stormy night  you can still hear the bells of old temples ringing under the sea .  the events chronicled in moving pictures would suggest that there is after all rather more than a grain of truth in these old tales .   there are many  many legends about sunken cities on earth  where islands bob up and down like the chorus in hms pinafore .  the oldest on record was told by the greek philosopher plato about       years ago  and according to him it was true  and had happened some       years before that .  and it was not just one city that had sunk  but the whole large island of atlantis     rich  civilized  with many mighty cities  harbours and palaces .  there  men had at first been wise and virtuous  but in time they became obsessed with wealth and power  so the gods destroyed their land in a single day and night .   there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods  and one grievous day and night befell them when the whole body of warriors was swallowed up by the earth  and the island of atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished  wherefore also the ocean at that spot has now become impassable and unsearchable  being blocked up by the shoal of mud which the island created as it settled down .   plato  timaeus  transl .  r .  g .  bury   plato does not mention any door or gate  for the large scale destruction he describes must have involved some great natural disaster     an earthquake  a volcanic eruption  a tsunami     and was the direct work of the gods .  there are other  more recent traditions along the sea coasts of western europe telling of lands and towns submerged by the foolish or treacherous act of someone who opened a sluice gate .  in wales  for instance  they talk of the lost land of cantre   r gwaelod under the waters of cardigan bay     forty miles long by twenty wide it was  with sixteen fine towns on it .  there was a great dyke protecting it from the sea  but seithenhin  the keeper of the dyke  was a drunkard  and one night forgot to close the sluice gates .  the way others tell it  seithenhin was lord of the land  and it was his daughter who let in the sea  curses upon her .  or it was god   s doing  because seithenhin was a proud and presumptuous ruler .  whatever  you can still see the pebble ridge which was once the protecting wall  you can still hear bells ringing underwater .   then there is the breton tale of the drowning of k  r is .  this  they say  was a magnificent city built on land reclaimed from the sea in what is now the bay of douarnenez in brittany  and ruled by a king grallon or gradlon .  he himself was a virtuous man  but his courtiers and subjects were drunken and debauched  though a holy man warned them that there would be a reckoning   after happiness  grief .   anyone who eats the meat of the fish   by the fish he will be eaten .   and anyone who swallows will be swallowed .   and anyone who drinks wine and mead  will drink water like a fish   and anyone who doesn   t know will learn .    livaden geris  transl .  james doan   yet the king let the revellers go on feasting  while he took himself quietly to bed .  now  the king had a daughter named dahut  and she had a lover  some say he was the devil himself  but they always say that sort of thing  who coaxed her into stealing the golden key which her father wore on a chain round his neck as he slept .  this was the key to the gate in the dykes protecting the city from the sea .  they were opened  and the ocean swept in and submerged everything  only grallon himself escaped  thanks to the saint   s warning and to his fine horse .  dahut tried to mount behind him  but the saint miraculously appeared and struck her with his crozier  so that she fell into the raging waters and drowned .  as for the sunken city  its buildings can sometimes be glimpsed when the sea is calm and clear  and its bells are heard ringing .  legend loves the sound of sunken bells .   in cornwall  tradition tells of the lost land of lyonesse  which once stretched all the way from land   s end to the scilly isles  though no one now remembers just why it sank .  the strange rocky outcrop of st michael   s mount overlooks mount   s bay  where the lost land once began and where one can still  at very low tides  find fossilized bits of wood from the trees which once grew there .  in the cornish language  four hundred years ago  the mount was called carrack looz en cooz     the grey rock in the wood    .  the drowned forest was important  once .  maybe it was a holy wood .   such legends have always been particularly popular among fishermen .  they are the ones who  peering down through unusually clear water  sometimes glimpse curious structures that look more like streets and ruined buildings than simple rocks  they are the ones whose nets sometimes snag on underwater obstacles where  according to their charts  no obstacles should be .  oddly  the fishermen of ankh morpork do not have such legends .  so it came as a total surprise to solid jackson and his son  out fishing by night in the middle of the circle sea  when a sound came from below the surface  the sound of a bell or gong slowly swinging     followed by a weathercock     a tower     a surge of huge  weed encrusted buildings     a whole malevolent looking city on an oozy  weedy island rising up out of the sea .  they had discovered the lost island and city of leshp .   they did not like it .  in fact  it gave them the willies .  partly  this was because of the smell of sulphur and rotting seaweed .  partly  because of nasty little ripples and soft splashing noises in the dark pools that lingered in the deeper cellars .  but mainly it was because of the city itself .  there were some buildings which looked more or less as human buildings should  with pillars and arches and steps and suchlike  and nice tiled floors with patterns of shells and squid and octopuses .  but besides these  there were the remains of massive structures which had nothing to do with human architecture .  it came as a relief when the island  after a few weeks  settled back down on to the seabed .   some faint awareness of these events  chronicled in jingo  may have reached parts of the earth .  there is talk there of a    green land of enchantment    which occasionally rises to the surface in the bristol channel  and then vanishes again .  a certain captain jones had a curious experience in the     s which was reported in the pembroke county guardian   once when trending up the bristol channel and passing grassholm island  in what he had always known as deep water  he was surprised to see to windward of him a large tract of land covered with a beautiful green meadow .  it was not  however  above water  but just a few feet below  say two or three  so that the grass waved and swam about as the ripple flowed over it  in a way quite delightful to the eye  so that as one watched it made one feel quite drowsy .     you know     he continued     i have heard old people say there is a floating island off there  that sometimes rises to the surface  or nearly  and then sinks down again fathoms deep  so that no one sees it for years  and when nobody expects it comes up again for a while .  how it may be  i do not know  but that is what they say .      there are similar tales of intermittent islands off the coasts of norway and ireland .  if you want to make them stay permanently above water  since they offer good grazing   the thing to do is to throw a knife  or a burning torch  or a lit tobacco pipe on to them before they can sink again  but this is very hard to achieve .  the largest and loveliest norwegian one is called utr  st  inhabited by kindly beings  it only becomes visible to humans if their lives are in deadly danger  when its harbour offers them safety .  those who shelter there will have good luck all their lives .   these are nice islands  of course  even if they are imaginary .  one that was undoubtedly real and very leshpian in its effects appeared in july      .  it was a pumice island  and it rose to the surface off the coast of sicily  due to volcanic action .  a british fleet landed on it and claimed it for britain  naming it graham island  but the italians also claimed it  naming it ferdinandea .  the french and spaniards showed interest too .  the ensuing diplomatic dispute was still not settled when the island sank back into the sea in december of the same year  which was rather a shame  but averted a possible war .   finally  it should be noted that an island which pops up and then sinks again is  as leonard of quirm remarked  rather like a certain type of folklore current among sailors on the discworld      it puts me in mind     said leonard     of those nautical stories of giant turtles that sleep on the surface  thus causing sailors to think they are an island .  of course  you don   t get giant turtles that small .      jingo   in our world  in the absence of any turtles larger than  say  a decent sized dining table  traditional nautical lore warns instead of the risks involved in landing on a really  really big fish or whale which happens to be dozing on the surface .  in particular  it is very unwise to light a small fire and start cooking breakfast .  st brendan the navigator  who was abbot of clonfert in ireland in the sixth century  is said to have done just that while sailing far out in the atlantic .  suddenly what he   d thought was an island began to twitch  and then to sink .  brendan and his crew were lucky to get back to their ship in time .   exactly the same thing happened to sindbad the sailor on his first voyage in the indian ocean  as is told in the thousand and one nights .  the ship came to a little island which seemed as fair as the garden of eden  where the passengers disembarked  some wandered off to explore  while others busied themselves cooking  eating and drinking .   while we were thus engaged we suddenly heard the captain cry out to us from the ship     all aboard  quickly .  abandon everything and run for your lives .  the mercy of allah be upon you  for this is no island but a gigantic whale floating on the bosom of the sea  on whose back the sands have settled and trees have grown since the world was young .  when you lit the fire it felt the heat and stirred .  make haste  i say  for soon the whale will plunge into the sea and you will all be lost .      transl .  n .  j .  dawood   according to the poet milton  the enormous creature is none other than leviathan  mentioned in the bible          that sea beast  leviathan  which god of all his works  created hugest that swim the ocean stream .   him  haply slumbering on the norway foam   the pilot of some small night foundered skiff   deeming some island  oft  as seamen tell   with fix  d anchor in his scaly rind  moors by his side under the lee  while night  invests the sea  and wish  d morn delays .   atlantic  indian ocean  seas off norway     the monster  or the story  certainly does get around .   in cambridge university library and in the british library there are manuscripts of a latin bestiary  that is  a book of beasts  dating from the early twelfth century .  it includes a section about the sea monster which gets mistaken for an island  beginning thus   there is an ocean monster which is called an aspido delone in greek .  on the other hand  it is called an aspido testudo in latin .  it is also called a whale     this animal lifts its back out of the open sea above the watery waves      transl .  t .  h .  white   testudo is latin for    tortoise    .  delone makes no sense  and must be a mistake for chelone  which is indeed a greek word  meaning    turtle    .  why on earth should english monks a thousand years ago get the traditional whale mixed up with tortoises and turtles .  some echo from the discworld  maybe .  as for aspido  this must refer to a snake of some sort  so it would seem that the sea serpent has somehow got into the mix .  it makes a good yarn even better .       kings and heroes   a certain legendary glow surrounds the  rather vague  memory of the kings of ankh  a dynasty which came to an end some       years ago .  they are said to have been thoroughly wise  just  charismatic  and so on  plus being of course extremely powerful .  as for the later kings of ankh morpork  they are remembered in many a merry anecdote  for recurrent lunacy  sadistic cruelty  and general bloody mindedness .   these anecdotes  being factually accurate  do not count as folklore .   if a ruler made himself too disagreeable to the rest of the aristocracy  the guild of assassins would eventually be contacted  and he would be discreetly inhumed .  curiously  this tactful and civilized procedure is seen by some as the survival of something extremely archaic   there was a tradition once  far back in the past  called the king of the bean .  a special dish was served to all the men of the clan on a certain day of the year .  it contained one small hard baked bean  and whoever got the bean was  possibly after some dental attention  hailed as king .  it was quite an inexpensive system and it worked well  possibly because the clever little bald men who actually ran things and paid some attention to possible candidates were experts at palming a bean into the right bowl .   and while the crops ripened and the tribe thrived and the land was fertile  the king thrived too .  but when  in the fullness of time  crops failed and the ice came back and animals were inexplicably barren  the clever little bald men sharpened their long knives  which were mostly used for cutting mistletoe .   and on the due night  one of them went into his cave and carefully baked one small bean .   of course  that was before people were civilized .  these days  no one has to eat beans .   night watch   that  at any rate  is a theory of kingship put forward by speculative folklorists in ankh morpork  and enthusiastically adopted by people who feel tradition must always be bloodthirsty  or about sex  or  preferably  both .  naturally  when dealing with such a remote period one can   t expect to find documentary evidence to back up one   s hypothesis  cave dwelling clans don   t keep diaries or committee minutes  .  but quoth the raven  who is a member of an occult species with links to the gods and therefore knows what he   s talking about  does mention a midwinter custom  thousands of years ago  which sounds rather similar .  it involved some poor bugger finding a special bean in his food at the hogswatch feast .  it made him king  but also meant he   d be killed off a few days later .  a merry reign  but a short one .   we have more to say about this in the section on the hogfather .    to return to the early kings of ankh .  theirs was a golden age  from which little remains     some well built ancient sewers  a few ruined walls  a worm eaten throne  and  if legend can be believed  a very special sword .  nobody has set eyes on it for centuries  and many think it must be lost .   and yet  there are always rumours .  although they are so proud of being modern and living in an age of reason  the citizens of ankh morpork have surprisingly romantic imaginations .  their minds are littered with mangled myths and fragmented fairy tales .  deep down  they feel sure that one day a long lost heir will turn up  brandishing the sword and displaying a birthmark  to claim the throne .  he will right all wrongs  and the golden age will return .   since the rules of fairytale narrative are known to every child in the multiverse  even in worlds where the books of grimm and andersen are not to be found   the people of ankh morpork naturally assume that the heir will have begun life as a humble swine herd  and or revived a princess who has been asleep for a hundred years  and or proved how royal he is by sleeping on a huge pile of mattresses and a few very small peas .  his hands will have sensational  but highly specialized  healing powers  though there appears to be some uncertainty about what exactly it is that he cures .  some citizens think a true king can cure baldness by his touch  while the aristocratic lord rust mentions dandruff  and scrofula  a disease of the throat glands .  on earth  it was definitely scrofula  which was therefore known as    king   s evil    .  several kings of england  from the time of edward the confessor to the end of the stuart dynasty  made a point of ceremonially touching sufferers  so did the kings of france .   best of all  if the heir to a kingdom encounters a dragon he will most certainly slay it .  as cut me own throat dibbler says to the sceptical vimes      you   ve got no romance in your soul  captain .  when a stranger comes into the city under the thrall of the dragon and challenges it with a glittery sword  weeell  there   s only one outcome  ain   t there .  it   s probably destiny .      guards .  guards .    in the same way  people know just how things will go if a dragon appears .  it will fly around  flaming and ravening  it will want a pile of gold to sleep on  it will expect people to give it virgins to eat  chained to rocks  it will speak  quite likely in riddles  but  it will have one vulnerable spot  which a good archer can hit as it flies overhead .  that   s what always happened in the old stories  and so that   s what will happen again .   these expectations are moulded by all the dragon lore which has been drifting from one universe to another from the dawn of time .  there is no mythology in any world which doesn   t have dragons in it  together with gods or heroes to kill them .  the tales known in ankh morpork are just as famous on earth .  there  it was the ancient greek hero perseus who was the first to rescue a virgin who had been left chained to a rock for a dragon to eat  her name was andromeda .  later  st george did the same  though he  being a saint  didn   t marry the girl .  several great warriors of anglo saxon and scandinavian legend     beowulf  for instance  and the two volsung heroes  sigmund and sigurd  whom germans call siegfried      slew dragons which lay on hoards of treasure .  one of these  the one named fafnir which sigurd killed  did indeed speak  and could ask and answer riddles .   as for the one vulnerable spot  this is sometimes on the belly  as it was with fafnir  and with smaug in the tale of bilbo the hobbit .  more often  it is when a dragon opens his mouth that he becomes vulnerable to a well aimed spear or arrow going down his gullet and into his vitals  this technique was pioneered by the babylonian god marduk  who destroyed the primeval dragoness tiamat by hurling deadly winds down her throat .  and then there is the sad case of the yorkshire dragon of wantley  whom more of more hall kicked in the arsehole with a spiked boot      murder  murder .     the dragon cried      alack  alack for grief .   had you but missed that place  you could  have done me no mischief .      then his head he shaked  trembled and quaked   and down he laid and cried   first on one knee then on back tumbled he   so groaned  kicked  shat  and died .         some more legends   many town dwellers have  lurking in the corners of their minds  various half remembered tales and no longer properly believed beliefs which pop up again in the right circumstances .  the tale of the shifting shop  for instance   glod looked up at a blank wall .      i knew it .     he said .     didn   t i say .  magic .  how many times have we heard this story .  there   s a mysterious shop no one   s ever seen before  and someone goes in and buys some rusty old curio  and it turns out to           glod              some kind of talisman or a bottle full of genie  and then when there   s trouble they go back and the shop           glod    .            has mysteriously disappeared and gone back to whatever dimension it came from    yes  what is it .         you   re on the wrong side of the road .  it   s over here .      soul music   but in fact glod was right .  this shop was magic  and contained  among other things  a flute which you mustn   t blow unless you want to be knee deep in rats  a trumpet which can make the world end and the sky fall down  and a gong which can make seven hundred and seventy seven skeletal warriors spring up out of the earth .  two out of the three would work on earth too .  not the gong  since according to greek myth  the correct way to make warriors spring up out of the earth is to sow the ground with dragon   s teeth  as the heroes cadmus and jason did .  but the bible does mention a last trump with which  according to prophecy  an angel will announce that doomsday has come  and the flute is clearly a pair to the fife with which the pied piper of hamlin summoned rats .   the hamlin story is a fine example of the weird power of narrativium .  it seems reasonably certain that something did happen in the german town of hamlin in       something involving a stranger and the children of the town  and that everyone found it very upsetting .  there are sober  reliable chronicles  written less than a hundred years after the event  which declare that someone marched into the town on    june in      and marched away with     of its children .  but they do not say anything about rats  or a pipe  or curiously coloured clothes .  in fact  there   s no magic involved at all .  he marches in  he marches away  taking the children     that   s all there is to it  at first .   but that won   t do .  surely  people thought  something so terrible as the loss of all those children must have more to it than that .  it must be due to sorcery  or a punishment for some sin     or both .  now  it was widely believed throughout europe that some men had an uncanny power over snakes  or rats  or mice  they would summon the vermin by playing on a flute or pipe  and then lead them into deep water or order them to leap into a bonfire  and so destroy them all .  perhaps a man who could lure rats could also lure children .  could one of these legendary ratcatchers have come to hamlin in great great grandfather   s time .  could something have angered him .  maybe the townsfolk tried to cheat him of his pay  and he took his revenge .   and so the story of the pied piper was born .  back in       people said  the town had been overrun with rats  until a stranger arrived  proclaiming himself a ratcatcher .  he was dressed in a multi coloured coat and carried a small fife  so they called him the pied piper  and promised him a great deal of money if he would help them .  as soon as he started playing rats came running out of every house  and followed him as he marched out of town .  he led them down to the river weser and waded in  they followed  and drowned .  but then the citizens regretted having promised so much money  so they made excuses not to pay  and he went off in a furious rage .  on    june he returned  this time dressed as a hunter .  again he played his fife  but this time it was children who came running to him  and he led them out of the town  where they disappeared with him into a cave in a mountain  and were never seen again     though some said they came out alive  hundreds of miles away  in transylvania .   by the middle of the sixteenth century this had become the official explanation .  the mayor had the entire story illustrated in stained glass windows in the main church  a new city gate erected in      carried an inscription stating that it was put up        years after the sorcerer abducted     children     another inscription on the city hall commemorated        children lost by a piper inside a mountain    .   of course  there are always some people who prefer a rational explanation to a magical one .  with the hamlin story  it   s not difficult to think of something that could fit  and many modern commentators have offered suggestions .  there were wars going on in thirteenth century germany  so maybe a recruiting sergeant passed through the town and led away     young men  and maybe they were all killed in battle .  or maybe the date is wrong  and the story really recalls how friars came preaching wild sermons to get youngsters to join the so called children   s crusade to jerusalem in       they never got there  and those who did not die on the road ended up as slaves .  or maybe it refers to the forced emigration of local families to colonize new territories far away .  for example  bishop bruno of olm  tz recruited families from lower saxony to build up a german population in his diocese in bohemia  a comparison of city records in hamlin and olm  tz reveals a startling agreement in the family names in each place  which bears out the rumour that the lost children of hamlin reappeared safe and sound in transylvania .   be that as it may  it   s the rats  the pipe  and the pied coat that we remember now .  and only a beastly spoilsport would point out that rats can swim .   as for drums      there was even an ankh morpork legend  wasn   t there  about some old drum in the palace or somewhere that was supposed to bang itself if an enemy fleet was seen sailing up the ankh .  the legend had died out in recent centuries  partly because this was the age of reason and also because no enemy fleet could sail up the ankh without a gang of men with shovels going in front .   soul music   there is a curiously close parallel here with the patriotic english legend of drake   s drum .  after the great elizabethan seaman sir francis drake died off panama in      a drum painted with his coat of arms was brought back to his home at buckland abbey in devon  and is still kept there .  it is traditionally believed to have come from the ship on which he had once sailed round the world .  in       for the three hundredth anniversary of the hero   s death  sir henry newbolt wrote a vigorous poem telling how drake on his deathbed promised that if the drum was struck when england was in danger  he would return to save the country once again  as he had done when the spanish armada came .   drake he was a devon man an    ruled the devon seas    capten  art tha sleepin    there below .    rovin    tho    his death fell  he went wi    heart at ease   an    dreamin    arl the time o    plymouth hoe .      take my drum to england  hang et by the shore   strike et when your powder   s runnin    low   if the dons sight devon  i   ll quit the port o    heaven   an    drum them up the channel  as we drummed them long ago .      in       when england was at war  a poet named alfred noyes gave this story an even stronger patriotic twist .  writing an article in the times about submarine warfare  he declared that devon fishermen believed that the drum had sounded of its own accord in times of crisis  and that drake would always hear and answer its call .  it had been heard when nelson   s fleet went to meet the french at trafalgar  and again in that very year of      before the naval battle of jutland in the north sea .  and this  the fishermen said  showed that drake had returned to inspire nelson and admiral jellicoe and guide them to victory .  whether noyes really had heard devon fishermen saying this  or whether he made it up himself  hardly matters .  it   s folklore now .  and now people say drake   s drum was heard in      at the evacuation of dunkirk .   the citizens of ankh morpork show in their legends an appreciation of virtue which is rarely evident in their lives .  they can in fact be downright sentimental .  take the story of the famous dog gaspode     not to be confused with the mangy  flea ridden speaking cur of the same name  who was simply called after him .  the reason the famous gaspode is famous is his devotion to his master .      it was years and years ago .  there was this ole bloke in ankh who snuffed it  and he belonged to one of them religions where they bury you after you   re dead  an    they did  and he had this ole dog           called gaspode .         yeah  an    this ole dog had been his only companion  and after they buried the man he lay down on his grave  and howled and howled for a couple of weeks .  growled at everybody who came near .  an    then died .      moving pictures   strangely  there are two cities on earth     edinburgh and tokyo     where almost the same story is told  the main difference being that the dog survives for many years  fed by passers by  though still faithfully grieving .  in edinburgh  this model of doggy devotion is a terrier called greyfriars bobby  after the graveyard where his master  a night watchman called john gray  was buried in       and where there is now a statue of him  the dog  that is  not john gray  .  he lived on for fourteen years  some say he spent all day at his master   s grave  but others say he was regularly fed in a nearby restaurant .  when he died  a place was found for him near the entrance of greyfriars kirkyard  though not actually in consecrated ground .  the stone is inscribed     let his loyalty and devotion be a lesson to us all .      in tokyo  the faithful dog  named hachi koh  used to go daily to shibuya station to meet his master  a professor  when he got off the train on his return from work .  the professor died in       but the dog lived on for ten years more  loyally meeting the train every day at the usual time  and resisting all attempts to re home him .  a statue of him was set up in the station even in his lifetime  and a special section of the concourse was set aside as his home  his stuffed body is now in the natural science museum in tokyo  and his statue is always garlanded with flowers on the anniversary of his death .   what gaspode     the modern  mangy  flea bitten gaspode     would make of these stories is not hard to guess  considering his cynical ideas about his famous namesake      that   s very sad     said victor .      yeah .  everyone says it demonstrates a dog   s innocent and undyin    love for    is master     said gaspode  spitting the words out as if they were ashes .      you don   t believe that  then .         not really .  i b   lieve any bloody dog will stay still an    howl when you   ve just lowered the gravestone on his tail     said gaspode .   the modern gaspode takes good care to keep his skills hidden  which is relatively easy since most people refuse to believe that any dog can talk .  even so  rumours get around .  william de worde  editor of the ankh morpork times  who is professionally inclined to scepticism  struggles  in vain  against that strange phenomenon  the urban myth   a couple of months ago someone had tried to hand william the old story of there being a dog in the city that could talk .  it was the third time this year .  william had explained that it was an urban myth .  it was always the friend of a friend who had heard the talk  and it was never anyone who had seen the dog     there seemed to be no stopping that kind of story .  people swore there was some long lost heir to the throne of ankh living incognito in the town .  william certainly recognized wishful thinking when he heard it .   the truth   alas for william  who has chosen the wrong city in which to be an enlightened thinker      meanwhile  other people  even more cynical  know how to take a legend and turn it into a nice little earner .  one is the con man known as the amazing maurice  who may in fact  according to rumour  be a remarkably cunning cat  .  he travels from town to town with his gang of educated rodents  who infiltrate the buildings .  a musical confederate then undertakes  for a good fee  to summon them with his magic pipe and lead them all far  far away .  it has always worked .  here  we know this as a rather inverted version of the pied piper story .       treacle mines   embedded in place names  lurking like hidden diamonds  are precious traces of past history and traditions .  there is  for example  a street in ankh morpork called treacle mine road  running from misbegot bridge to easy street .  it takes its name from the treacle mines which used to be worked in this area  which are ancient  very ancient indeed .  the deepest levels contain the remnants of pig treacle measures that are estimated to be         years old  intermingled with basalt slabs carved with archaic trollish pictograms .  the mines were abandoned many years ago  and most people believe that this was because they were exhausted .  however  when some deep down dwarfs  grags  bought property on that street and began mining below it  for reasons of their own  as told in thud .    they reopened old tunnels and galleries  and their bores struck some residue of deep treacle .   up in the mountains  on the borders of uberwald  there are still very productive treacle mines  enabling the dwarfs of that region to make a handsome profit exporting both raw pig treacle and luscious treacle based confectionery to the cities of the plain .  far away in the hot and swampy realm of genua  there are lakes of liquid treacle fermenting happily only a little way underground  and occasionally bursting out under pressure to create springs of rum .  near quirm  there are toffee beds .  the origin of all this succulence goes back to the dawn of time  when the fifth elephant collided with the disc with so great an impact that thousands of acres of prehistoric wild sugar cane was buried under massive landslides  and compacted into a dense crystalline mass .   those who study the effects of cosmic resonance in the space time continuum of the multiverse often cite the treacle mine phenomenon with amazement and awe  for it has been shown without doubt that these mines  which are a plain fact of geography on the disc  have insinuated themselves into the folklore of a world where they do not actually exist  and never have done .  in england  there are at least thirty villages reputed to have a secret treacle mine tucked away somewhere on their territory .  even more astonishing  there is one place  the village of patcham in east sussex  where people have a fairly accurate idea of how the treacle was formed  allowing for the fact that this world sadly lacks any cosmic elephants  .  a mrs austen told the west sussex gazette in      the tale she knew  and had passed on to her children   millions of years ago  when england was a tropical country  before the ice age  sugar cane grew here .  year after year it grew  ripened and rotted unharvested  the molasses draining away down into the folds of the hills  where it accumulated above an impermeable layer of clay .  the centuries passed  the colder weather came  and sugar cane no longer grew on the downs  but the underground layer of treacle lay patiently waiting until in      peter jones  a scientist who had long suspected its existence  sank the first shaft .  the ensuing treacle gusher spouted for three days  covering the countryside for several miles around with a fine rain of treacle  until it was at last brought under control .   elsewhere  other explanations are offered .  at chobham in surrey  military incompetence is alleged to be the cause .  it is said that soldiers who encamped on chobham common before setting out to the crimean war  others say  american troops stationed nearby during the first world war  buried vast stockpiles of supplies  including drums of treacle and molasses  and forgot to remove them when they left .  the drums corroded  and a subterranean reservoir of treacle was formed .   other places do not attempt to account for the origin of the precious substance  but tell ingenious tales about its discovery and use .  the mine at jarvis brook near crowborough  sussex  was supposedly begun by the romans  who carved the solid treacle rock into jewellery  but never found out how sweet it was  this was discovered accidentally when a medieval baby prince was visibly soothed by sucking his mother   s necklace .  at sabden  lancashire  it is claimed that boggarts  a species of goblin  are employed in the mine to lick up any spilt treacle  cards and souvenirs about the mine are sold to tourists .   yet  sad to say  the people who tell these tales do not take them seriously .  it is all a poker faced joke  a hoax  a leg pull  used by the locals to hoax gullible outsiders  by parents to entertain their children  by older children to make fools of young ones .  while all the time  did they but know it  the remains of a real treacle mine lie below the streets of ankh morpork .       wizardry and ceremonial magic   any comment upon wizardry in a book with    folklore    in the title will have to be made very quietly  since there is nothing that infuriates a scholar more than to be mistaken for a member of the folk  after he has spent all his waking hours for the past fifty years with his nose in a book  mealtimes partially excepted  .  naturally  he may have come across the odd scrap of folklore in the course of his reading  but he will make it very plain that he does not believe it .  arch chancellor ridcully  for example  has heard of the kind of monster called a sciopod by ancient greeks and a uniped in latin  a humanoid with only a single leg and foot  this being so huge that if it lies on its back and sticks its leg in the air  the foot makes an excellent sunshade .  but he thinks it   s just something travel writers invented .      they always make up that sort of thing .  otherwise it   s too boring .  it   s no good coming home and just saying you were shipwrecked for two years and ate winkles  is it .  you have to put in a lot of daft stuff about men who go around on one big foot and the land of giant plum puddings and nursery rubbish like that .      the last continent   magic as actually practised by wizards generally consists of transformation spells  the skilled hurling of fireballs  the creation of illusions  and the occasional summoning of demons or  in extreme cases  of death himself .  these things are done as rarely as possible .  but the theory underpinning these few simple acts is immense  and subdivided into innumerable branches     divination  theurgy  runes ancient and modern  cabbalistic rites  gramarye  knowledge of amulets and talismans  magianism  thaumatology  astrology  morbid spellbinding  sortilege  invisible writing     and so on and so forth .  not necromancy  however  this is frowned upon  and has been replaced by a far more acceptable department of post mortem communications .  the very heart and soul of unseen university is its library .  with over        volumes of grimoires and magical texts  it is by far the largest concentration of magical scholarship anywhere in the multiverse  and so dangerous that most of the books have to be chained up .   folklore .  oral tradition .  old wives    tales .  tchah .  it is an insult to the grand intellectual achievements of wizardry to think their work has anything in common with the foolish ways of the peasantry .   no doubt the famous and learned occultists of medieval and renaissance europe     such men as albertus magnus in the thirteenth century  or paracelsus  cornelius agrippa  and dr john dee in the sixteenth     would have been just as dismissive .  they wrote books which straddled the ill defined boundaries between magic  science and philosophy     massive  expensive tomes in latin  the international language of the wise .  albertus  for instance  wrote a treatise on the practical procedures of alchemy  and was also reputed to be the author of a much simpler book of secrets which described the magical properties of stones  herbs  and beasts .  for example   if thou wilt know whether thy wife be chaste or no .  take the stone which is called magnet  in englishe the loadstone .  it is of a sadde blew colour  and it is found in the sea of inde  and sometime in part of almaine .  lay this stone under the head of a wife .  and if she be chaste  she will embrace her husband .  if she be not chaste  she will fall forth of her bed      if thou wilt overcome thine enemies .  take the stone which is called draconites  from the dragon   s head .  and if the stone bee drawne out from him alive it is good against all poisons  and he that beareth it on his left arme shall overcome all his enemies      the marygold .  the vertue of this herbe is marvellous for if it be gathered  the sunne being in the signe leo in august  and wrapped in the leafe of a lawrell  or may tree  and a wolf   s tooth added thereto  no man shall be able to speake one word against the bearer thereof  but only words of peace .  if anything bee stolen  and the bearer of the things before named shall lay them under his head in the night  he shall see the theefe in a vision .   and so on .  it must remain one of the mysteries of trans dimensional correspondence whether this albertus magnus of medieval europe has any connection with alberto malich  the exceptionally powerful wizard who founded unseen university some two thousand years ago  and disappeared while performing the rite of ashkente backwards .  he had intended to achieve immortality  and so he did  in a way .  he now exists  one can   t quite say    lives     as cook  valet and gardener in the house of death  which suits him nicely .   on earth  grimoires were often attributed to prestigious figures from legendary times  such as king solomon the wise and hermes trismegistus .  as time went on  the practice of magic slid down the social scale  by the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries cheap  simple books of spells and conjurations were selling in thousands to village cunning men and wise women  and to ordinary households .  in germany  there was the sixth and seventh books of moses  in france  le grand albert and le petit albert  le dragon rouge  la poule noire  and the splendidly named abracadabra monumentissima diabolica .  intellectual wizardry was being drawn into the vast melting pot of folk tradition .   this has not happened in ankh morpork  nor is it likely to  so long as the librarian has an ook to say in the matter .  nevertheless  far outside the hallowed walls of unseen university  lurking in shadowy and insalubrious back alleys and keeping out of sight of qualified wizards  are magical practitioners of a lower sort .  their ambitions are great  their skills are not .  they know far less than they suppose .  they band together in secret societies with imposing titles  and attach vast importance to ritual  ceremony  and magical tools .  they are led by pompous  bullying men  calling themselves supreme grand masters .  such are  for instance  the elucidated brethren of the ebon night  guardians of the sacred knowledge since a time no man may wot of .   such groups would be just as indignant as the academic wizards at the notion that what they were doing had anything in common with folk magic .  no  their grand master had been taught profound secrets from the heart of being while undergoing tuition from hidden venerable sages on a distant mountain .  furthermore  the sages had given him a book of ancient wisdom     actually  he had arranged for it to be stolen from the unseen university library  but no matter  it was a book .  and it was ancient .   but it would be a mistake to think that everyone in ankh morpork has such a highbrow approach to magic .  there are people who need no books  no apparatus  no complex rituals     people with a natural inborn talent for the occult  like the redoubtable medium mrs evadne cake  noted for her precognition and her numerous spirit contacts .  in some ways she is very like a witch  and every community needs its witch .   even in unseen university itself the housekeeper  mrs whitlow  dabbles in the occult .  she loves trying to peer into the future  and owns a crystal ball which she keeps under a sort of pink frilly tea cosy  several sets of divinatory cards  a pink velvet bag of rune stones  an ouija board  and special dried monkey turds which can be thrown in such a way as to reveal all the secrets of the universe .  granny weatherwax  for purposes of her own  offered mrs whitlow her services as a reader of tealeaves .  no doubt she had her own opinion of such amateurish goings on  but she kept it to herself .       sator square   most of those who walk through the streets of ankh morpork never pause to wonder why the square in front of unseen university is named sator square .  there is indeed a reason  though you have to search the annals of a different universe to discover it  on earth  sator square is the most famous of all magic squares .  but it   s no use looking for it on the street map of any city  for it is not that sort of square .  it is a palindromic word square .   these are talismans  difficult to invent  but very powerful .  you have to choose a group of words which can be laid out as a square of letters and which  this is the hard bit  will remain the same whether you read it downwards  upwards  from the left or from the right .  most of them are mere gibberish  but the sator formula does make sense  of a sort .  it goes   s  a  t  o  r    a  r  e  p  o    t  e  n  e  t    o  p  e  r  a    r  o  t  a  s    four out of the five are normal latin words  meaning    the sower holds the works  and  the wheels     but arepo is either pure nonsense or the mysterious  mystical name of the mysterious  mystical sower who controls the wheels  of fate .  of the heavenly spheres .   .  the earliest known example of the square is in one of the houses of pompeii  buried by the eruption of vesuvius in ad     another early one was found scratched on wall plaster in a roman villa at cirencester in gloucestershire .  at these dates  both homes could have belonged to christian families  and the square could have served as a coded signal of their faith .  it can hardly be a coincidence that its letters can be unpacked to reveal the first words of the our father  pater noster  twice over  plus a and o twice .  the latter could mean alpha and omega  the beginning and the end  which is a title of christ in the apocalypse  the bible   s book of revelation .  what   s more  the whole thing can be laid out as a cross  thus     the sator arepo square was known all over medieval europe  and in some countries  russia  america and germany  for example  was still being used in folk magic right up to modern times  almost two thousand years after it was invented .  people said it would put out a fire  if you wrote it on a piece of wood and threw the wood into the flames  if you cut it into dough  baked it  and swallowed it  it would cure the bite of a mad dog  in the united states in the nineteenth century  a cheap book of spells recommended it as a fire precaution  a detector of witches  a protection against disease  and good for the cows .   some echo of all this must surely have filtered through to the wizards of unseen university  but whether they actually use word squares themselves remains unknown .       the black school   for centuries  earth has known rumours of a black school where magic was taught  though none quite matches the venerable antiquity of the disc   s unseen university  now some two thousand years old .  the only possible contenders would be certain secret academies where  if we can believe the rather unreliable roman author pomponius mela in the first century ad  druids trained pupils for twenty years on end    in sequestered and remote places  whether in a cave or in secluded groves    .   once real universities became established in the middle ages  there soon grew up the legend of their secret counterpart  a college called the black school where one could learn all the occult arts .  it was deep underground  windowless  and pitch dark .  nobody ever saw the teacher  for that was the devil himself .  students never went outside .  every evening  they would say aloud what they wanted to learn  and by next morning the right books would have appeared magically on their desks  written in fiery letters that glowed in the dark  or the information would be written in fire upon the walls .  and when the course of studies ended  the students would rush to escape through the single door  for it was known that the devil would take the hindmost     unless he was cunning enough to trick him into seizing his cloak  or his shadow  instead .   and where was this wondrous black school .  usually it was said to be in one of the great medieval universities  but not of course in one   s own country .  the learned french scholar and scientist gerbert d   aurillac               who became pope sylvester ii  was rumoured to have studied magic at the islamic university in cordoba  spain .  the icelander s  mundur the learned               was said to have attended a black school somewhere in france .  in romania  folk tradition tells of an underground academy called scholomance  near sibiu in the mountains of transylvania  bram stoker had heard of this  .  others have talked of a black school in paris  padua  salamanca  prague  or wittenburg  faust studied there  .  probably students at wittenburg and prague whispered about the fearful occult activities at oxford and cambridge .   an aside  it has been suggested by the learned science fiction writer isaac asimov that the general western antipathy towards witches is at least partly to do with teeth and beards .  the hypothesis runs like this  until the advent of modern dentistry  people who lived to a great age tended to lose their teeth     to get gummy  in fact .  for the old widow  perhaps with no family to care for her  that added another problem .  she looked like a crone  with the lower part of the face dished in and the nose appearing to hook .  of course  the same thing happened to the old men  but they could grow long white beards to hide the wrinkles behind  and looked as wise as an old testament prophet .  wise wizard  wicked witch     what a difference a razor makes .      tyrants insist on doing this  despite the fact that it never works .      it   s the little details that charm .       chapter      more customs   nautical lore and  military matters      there is a widespread feeling among folklorists that city dwellers do not have customs .  maybe there had been some in the very old days  when the city was little more than a collection of villages  but they are long forgotten now .  of course there are various civic and academic occasions which require serious minded men to process through the streets in outdated ceremonial robes and plumed helmets  but these aren   t proper folk customs .  they are all too obviously well organized and official .  they are not archaic and bloodthirsty  nor  on the other hand  do they involve jolly yokels and winsome maidens prancing around with many a merry fol de rol .  folklore collectors therefore feel free to ignore them .   however  there comes a time in the history of most cities when somebody says     we really ought to have a few customs .  they could do wonders for the tourist trade .     books are consulted .  ideas from elsewhere are forcibly uprooted and shamelessly reworked to fit their new environment .  and lo .  suddenly  there are morris dancers everywhere  and age old traditions spring up overnight like mushrooms .   this is beginning to happen in ankh morpork .  there is a team of folk dancers who have revived the morris     probably more than one  since morris dancing is essentially a competitive pastime  sometimes quite dangerously so .  nobby nobbs is known to be a participant .  there are also enthusiastic and delightfully melodious wassailers  who put in weeks of practice before setting out to spread seasonal cheer through the streets of ankh morpork at hogswatch .   the custom was referred to by anaglypta huggs  organizer of the best and most select group of the city   s singers  as an occasion for fellowship and good cheer      the singers were halfway down park lane now  and halfway through    the red rosy hen greets the dawn of the day    in marvellous harmony .  their collecting tins were already full of donations for the poor of the city  or at least those sections of the poor who in mrs huggs    opinion were suitably picturesque and not too smelly and could be relied upon to say thank you      in fact the hen is not the bird traditionally associated with heralding a new sunrise  but mrs huggs  while collecting many old folk songs for posterity  had taken care to rewrite them where necessary to avoid  as she put it     offending those of a refined disposition with unwarranted coarseness    .  much to her surprise  people often couldn   t spot the unwarranted coarseness until it had been pointed out to them .   sometimes a chicken is nothing but a bird .   hogfather   thanks to the humorous workings of narrative necessity  these well bred singers  so beautifully free from anything that could distress either the musical ear or the moral susceptibilities of their audience  find themselves face to face with what may well be the last vestige of pure  raw wassailing in the city  the makers of the rough music of time     foul ole ron and the canting crew of deranged beggars  singing and swearing at the tops of their voices  and banging saucepans together .  the beggars are not well versed in folkloric theory  but they do know this is the sort of thing one does at midwinter  and have good reason to believe that if you make enough din people will give you money to stop .   those who have looked into the history of folklore of western europe over the last couple of hundred years will notice some quite astonishing similarities to this situation .  there too  some genteel victorian collectors  while professing their deep love of tradition  took for granted that it must be stripped of all coarseness and daintily repackaged .  there too  some customs slipped down the social scale till they were little more than a way for the poorest of the working class  or even beggars  to extract a little beer money from their betters at festive seasons .  and there too  these same customs might be rediscovered  imitated  revived and updated by later and more sophisticated generations .   as soon as people begin to notice a custom  as opposed to just doing it   they start wondering where  when and why it began .  they weave wonderful theories .  but this is futile  since folklore is almost always unaccountable   very few people do know how tradition is supposed to go .  there   s a certain mysterious ridiculousness about it by its very nature     once there was a reason why you had to carry a posy of primroses on soul cake tuesday  but now you did it because that   s what was done .   jingo   the ceremony still carries on  of course .  if you left off traditions because you didn   t know why they started you   d be no better than a foreigner .   hogfather   in both worlds  old customs discarded by adults are often kept going for a few generations by children .  according to the bursar  when he was a boy there was a custom on soul cake tuesday that children would roll boiled eggs down the tump  a large steep hill on the outskirts of the city .  naturally  nobody can say what the point of it is  apart from the fairly obvious fact that it is fun  and that the eggs are nice to eat  even if they are a bit cracked and muddy .  as nanny ogg would say  with surprising biblical insight     we all have to eat a peck of dirt before we die .      since children in lancre and other rural areas also get given eggs on this date  as we mentioned earlier  there is every reason to think the custom is genuinely folksy     possibly even mythic  if the soul cake duck is involved .  if so  it would have begun as something serious  to be done by adults .  there are some people  including the compiler of the discworld almanak  who claim that the duck plays a major role in primeval mythology   curiously written out of early legends of the creation of the universe is the great duck  from whose single egg the whole of creation was hatched .  however  truth will out  and it is now known that  from the outside  infinity is duck egg blue .   it turns out that this was written in haste by a member of the almanak staff to justify an error elsewhere in the book  but there once were similar myths scattered throughout our own world  in ancient egypt  finland  india  greece and persia  for example   telling how the universe was hatched from an egg laid by some great bird  often a duck or goose .  and that  in a roundabout sort of way  might explain those chocolate eggs people buy at easter  without quite knowing why .   folk custom also explains why one occasionally sees visitors to ankh morpork leaning over the brass bridge in a meaningful manner .  they are acting upon an old superstition that if you throw a coin into the ankh you   ll be sure to return to the city     or is it if you just throw up into the ankh .  probably it is a coin after all  since a remarkable number of supposedly rational species in various worlds feel compelled to toss coins into rivers  fountains  wishing wells  and even oddly shaped cascades in airport terminals  in a vague expectation of good luck and wishes fulfilled .  why .  well  in the case of airports it is a convenient way of getting rid of small change you won   t need in sydney while at the same time getting a small smug feeling of having done some good  but in the other cases .  what mechanism is operating here  in the twenty first century .  on the discworld  though  they know why .  the lady is a real presence .      unseen university has a whole clutch of traditional ceremonies and festivals of its own  carried out with unfailing regularity .  these of course have nothing whatever to do with anything or anybody beyond the university   s walls .  they are    gown     not    town     and emphatically not    folk    .  those which involve processing through the public streets do so as a way of inspiring due respect in the uncultured masses .  a prime example is the convivium  when the archchancellor  council  and entire senior staff proceed ceremonially from the university to the opera house  where new graduates are awarded their degrees in the presence of the patrician .  the procession then returns  rather more quickly  for a large banquet .   but one ceremony which has a certain impact on the townsfolk is the beating of the bounds every    grune .  this involves a choir  all able bodied members of staff  and a gaggle of students retracing the exact route of the boundaries of the university  as originally laid down centuries ago .  they walk through or if necessary climb over any buildings that have since been built across the route  while ceremonially striking members of the public with live ferrets  in memory  for reasons unknown  of a long ago archchancellor buckleby  .   any red headed men encountered are seized by several strong young men and given a    plunking     this tradition has  most unusually     and subsequent to an incident which left three wizards hanging precariously from a gutter     been amended to read    any red headed men except of course captain carrot ironfoundersson of the watch    .  after the progress  the entire membership of the university heads back to the great hall for a huge breakfast at which duck must be served .   the discworld companion   why red heads .  in ankh morpork the reason  if there ever was one  is forgotten .  on earth  folklore asserts that red hair was the mark of judas  and is found in descendants of jews and of viking raiders .  they were distrusted  though there is no record of people plunking them .   in britain and europe  processions to beat the bounds  also known as rogation processions  were mainly found in country districts  where priests led the people round the parish boundaries  blessing the fields and praying for a good harvest .  the custom was legally useful too  when local administration was organized by parishes  it was important that everyone knew just where one parish ended and another began .  that way  taxes and tithes could be fairly assessed  and if a penniless beggar dropped dead on the road one knew whose job it was to bury him .  boundary markers on walls  stones or trees were inspected  renewed if necessary  and ritually    beaten    with rods .  sometimes boys were upended and beaten too  to make sure the next generation remembered everything quite clearly .   the custom does not often survive in towns  but in oxford on ascension day two parishes still provide a spectacle remarkably similar to what can be seen in ankh morpork  but without the ferrets  alas  .  in the words of folklorist steve roud   the boundary markers in oxford can be set into walls  high or low  or even into the floor  and can be down narrow alleyways  in basements  and behind or inside buildings .  the routes take in the college buildings within the parish as well as shops and pubs  much to the surprise of people they meet on the way .  they stop for refreshments at various locations  and at one point students throw coins and sweets for the choristers to scramble for .   the english year          in ankh morpork there are also traditional student activities  notably the dreaded rag week  which has all the normal perils of student humour with the additional seasoning of magic .  prudent citizens take evasive action  but the event is welcomed by the landlords of the mended drum  the bunch of grapes  and other hostelries  since much alcohol is traditionally consumed .   the even more dreaded mass football match is now discontinued .  this used to involve teams of fifty students apiece from the university itself and from each of the guild colleges attempting to kick or carry a football from the outskirts of the shades to the tower of art .  goals were scored by kicking the ball through the door  or more often the window  of landmarks along the way  most of them having names like the mended drum  the bunch of grapes  etc .  the scoring team had then to be bought drinks by the other teams .  much alcohol was traditionally consumed .  there were occasions when the match went on for a month .   something very similar used to happen on earth  and in some cases still does .  for  just as there is a whole area of folklore that concerns singing very loudly until being given money to stop  or at least to go away and infest some other street  so there is an area chock full of folk games that consist of two sides trying to get a ball  or similar token  into an opposing goal by means of  apparently  a bout of allin wrestling .   in many towns of britain  some five or six hundred years ago  the streets would periodically be jammed tight with a heaving mass of young men shoving  kicking and head butting one another .  if you watched long enough  you would probably work out that it was not a fight after all  but some kind of game played between two teams .  somewhere down out of sight there would be a ball being kicked or carried  for this was the true  the original  form of british football .  no rules worth mentioning  no limit on the number of men crazy enough to play for one team or the other .  no goal posts either  the    goals    would be at opposite ends of the town  at least a mile apart  and might just as likely be ponds or streams as buildings .  it was a wild  violent type of game  and might very well last all day .  in derby in      a writer explained how it was done   the game commences in the market place  where the partisans of each parish are drawn up on each side  and about noon  a large ball is tossed up in the midst of them .  this is seized on by some of the strongest and most active men .  the rest of the players immediately close in upon them  and a solid mass is formed .  it then becomes the object of each party to impel the crowd towards their own particular goal .  the struggle to obtain the ball  which is carried in the arms of those who have possessed themselves of it  is violent     it would be difficult to give an adequate idea of this ruthless sport .  a frenchman passing through derby remarked that if englishmen called this playing  it would be impossible to say what they called fighting .   if you asked the players what the point was  they   d probably tell you it celebrated the defeat of some scotsmen  or englishmen  or vikings  according to taste   whose heads were then kicked round the battlefield .   the tough young fellows who played it absolutely loved it .  others were less enthusiastic .  people got injured  as the respectable citizens of chester complained in the     s     some having their bodies bruised or crushed  some their arms  heads or legs broken  and some otherwise maimed or in peril of their lives    .  worse still  windows got broken  which was expensive .  the town authorities stopped the chester game in       but in some other places people were more stubborn  in derby it took soldiers  special constables  and the reading of the riot act to finally subdue the footballers in      .  some towns kept their mass football till late in the nineteenth century .  indeed  there are a few places where it is still vigorously played .  it can be seen at alnwick in northumberland and ashbourne in derbyshire every shrove tuesday  and at kirkwall in orkney at the new year .   the    haxey hood game    at haxey in lincolnshire every january is similar  though it is surrounded by more ceremonial  and though the object tussled over is not a ball but a roll of leather  like a truncheon .  allegedly  this represents the hood of a long ago medieval lady which blew off  causing twelve or thirteen labourers to go chasing after it .  who knows  but for that unthinking piece of gallantry we might now be watching association archery on saturday afternoons .       ghost ships   in small gods there   s a description of a shipwreck .  when the captain cries     we   ll have to abandon ship .     death replies  no .  we will take it with us .  it is a nice ship .  and so  though the ship has been completely smashed up and everyone aboard is drowned  it seems to become whole again  in a way  and sails away  grey and slightly transparent  through darkness and silence  bearing the ghosts of men and of rats .   sailors on earth also find it perfectly natural that a ship can become a ghost  since before it sank it had been a living creature  with a soul of its own     a    she     in fact  not an    it    .  she   s got a name  hasn   t she .  and wasn   t she christened  just like a human being  with somebody blessing her and smashing a bottle of champagne over her .  in french fishing villages  there would be a full scale religious ceremony for a new boat  with a godfather and godmother  and a priest to sprinkle holy water  everyone was given blessed bread  including the boat herself     scraps of the bread would be put into holes in the mast .   many also thought that a ship had a guardian spirit .  some said it lived in the figurehead .  others  from ancient egypt to modern china and the mediterranean  have painted huge eyes on the prow  these are the eyes of its guardian  to bring luck  to see the way ahead  and to outstare any evil spirits .  the swedes have a different notion  they say that when boat builders cut a tree down to make the keel  the tree   s guardian gnome follows it  and becomes the boat   s luck bringer .   ships and death go well together .  vikings thought a dead man should sail in his own boat to the land of the dead .  so some of them buried or burned the man and the boat together  others lit a pyre for the corpse on board a ship  which was then set drifting out to sea  others marked the site of the man   s grave by an oval of standing stones  forming the outline of a boat .  an english poet  d .  h .  lawrence  wrote in the     s of    the ship of death      we are dying  we are dying  so all we can do  is now to be willing to die  and to build the ship  of death to carry the soul on its longest journey .   a little ship  with oars and food  and little dishes  and all accoutrements  fitting and ready for the departing soul .   there are also the phantom ships doomed to sail the seas of earth for ever  because of some crime or sin committed on board  or because of the tragic circumstances in which they sank .  to see one is an omen of disaster  or at least of very bad weather .  you can recognize them because they are sailing at full speed against the wind  or when there is no wind at all .  often they have no crew  if there is one  they are skeletons .  they never reach a port  they never answer when hailed .  there is at least one  at porthcurno in cornwall  which has been seen to sail straight for the shore at dusk  rise up into the air  and go on sailing across dry land .   the most famous of the phantom ships is the flying dutchman .  she haunts the seas around the cape of good hope  because her captain blasphemously swore he would round the cape  despite a gale  even if it took him till doomsday .  in britain  several ghost ships haunt the solway firth  as a result of crimes .  two were pirate vessels  one was deliberately wrecked by a jealous murderer as it carried a bridal party  one was a slave trader  homeward bound  whose rich but godless captain refused to go ashore to attend church on christmas day .  there is also the lady lovibund  which is supposed to appear on    february once every fifty years  heading for the goodwin sands  in the channel  off deal   because the first mate deliberately ran it aground there  being driven crazy with jealousy because he was in love with the captain   s newly wedded bride .  this is said to have happened in       and some people claim the spectral ship was sighted at fifty year intervals up to and including      .  oddly  when boatloads of journalists went looking for it in       it failed to appear .   the derelict ghost ships in going postal are real  or rather  the way they hang suspended in the depths of the sea was once thought to be a real scientific possibility .  but the wonderful image of skeletons crewing rotting hulks faded in the light of deep oceanic research in the nineteenth century .  until then  it was quite respectable to assume that water  like air  got denser with depth  and that a stricken ship would sink only until it encountered water at a density slightly higher than its own  where it might then drift on the interface until it rotted .  in fact water does not compress like air  which is why fish at the bottom of the sea don   t have to drill holes in it .  when you sink  you sink .       female soldiers   folk songs  most notably    sweet polly oliver     keep alive the theme of the cross dressing girl who goes off to war in men   s attire   as sweet polly oliver lay musing in bed   a sudden strange fancy came into her head      nor father nor mother shall make me false prove   i   ll    list for a soldier and follow my love .      so early next morning she softly arose   and dressed herself up in her dead brother   s clothes .   she cut her hair close  and she stained her face brown   and went for a soldier to fair london town .   the songs were based on fact  and monstrous regiment was only an exaggeration for comic effect     very little which is said in that book about the girls    cross dressing experiences was made up .   there are plenty of references to such women in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries    up to       of them in the american civil war  it has been suggested  but     or fewer seems more acceptable  .  they made the decision out of love  for adventure  or from a desire to escape from a burdensome life .  they came to light as a result of falling in love  betraying themselves by lack of acting skill  or being wounded somewhere that obliged the surgeon to remove the patient   s trousers  or  quite often  by proudly admitting it much later on .  when some of them were grandmothers .  obviously  we will never know about ones who didn   t own up .   the subject is a fascinating one  and well documented .  we give a couple of titles in the bibliography  but there are many more .  what is interesting is how easily women could get away with it  after the not really serious were weeded out very early on  .  the pollys often did well  acting as spies  where their wonderful skill at dressing up as women was a great help  and even getting promoted .  there is a whole slew of explanations as to how they kept their secret while living with hundreds of men  and some of these turn up in monstrous regiment .  for instance  in an age long before unisex fashions  trousers meant    man    and skirts meant    woman    .  trousers plus high pitched voice meant    young man    .  people didn   t expect anything else  and saw what they expected to see .  many pollys joined up as boys  and if the lad was a little shy  no one thought that odd .  people did not often see one another naked  and the surgeon amputating a foot might only roll the trouser leg above the knee .  but the big reason is that  if they are determined and careful  women can easily fool men .   however  there was one thing  according to accounts  that many of them just could not manage .  it was swearing .  many could not bring themselves to cuss  and found the ripe language of their comrades hard to bear  let alone imitate .  so     a bit of a change there  at least .      indeed  more or less throughout recorded history  but this is when it happened in a major way .       chapter      kids    stuff     you  know  about     orrid murder and  blood      there are many links between folklore and the mental world of children  but they do not always follow the paths one might expect .  theoreticians in the ankh morpork folklore society  and indeed in similar institutions here  love to think that some age old memory  preferably of something quite horrible  lurks in the background of the simplest rhyme or game .  they claim  for example  that when children shape big fat figures out of piled up snow and push in lumps of coal as eyes  these are    obvious survivals    of primitive idols representing the dreaded ice giants with their tiny  deep set black eyes who  according to mythology  will one day overwhelm the world .  of course  the children say they just do it for fun     they would  wouldn   t they .  but a theoretical folklorist rarely if ever takes note of what the folk themselves have to say .  it stands to reason that he or she is far better equipped than they are to roll back the mists of time .  and in two shakes of a duck   s tail  the theory is accepted as a proven fact .  if the moving pictures enterprise once begun at holy wood had succeeded  by now every audience in ankh morpork would know that when a film maker shows a brief shot of a snowman he means everyone to shudder at this sinister symbol of ecological doom and the imminent end of the world .  meanwhile  the kids go on throwing snowballs and lumps of coal around  regardless .   in our earthly culture  many parents and teachers worry whether fairy tales and nursery rhymes and children   s games and customs are respectable  morally and educationally sound  and fully in accord with health and safety regulations .  judging from existing records  few adults on the disc are bothered by these issues .  there  at least in the poorer parts of ankh morpork  children freely play brutal and unhygienic street games  hallowed by long tradition .  these include dead rat conkers and tiddley rat  though a recent observer has noted that turd races in the gutter appear to have died out  despite an attempt to take them upmarket with the name poosticks .  hopscotch too is popular  especially a variation which captain vimes played in childhood  in which you kicked the least popular kid from one square to another  singing    william scuggins is a bastard        actions and words which do not figure in handbooks designed for games teachers .   throughout the multiverse  parents have repeatedly discovered the useful fact that the best way to control a child is by working on its imagination to create a gruesome anthropomorphic personification     don   t you dare play in the cornfield .  if you do  the corn mother will come with her long iron teeth and her long iron claws  and tear you to bits           behave yourselves while i   m out .  remember that rawhead and bloody bones is watching you .     used in moderation  these frighteners and prohibitory monsters have a great deal to recommend them .  if nanny ogg   s grandchildren believe there   s a demon inside the copper in her wash house    and if country children everywhere are scared of deep pools because there   s something down there with green eyes and big teeth just longing to pull them in  a lot of nasty accidents will be avoided .   but there are snags  particularly on discworld .  even though the adults don   t believe the frighteners are real  the children do  and the high magic quotient built into the very fabric of the disc ensures that whatever is powerfully believed in will  very shortly  exist .      if only people would think before they invent monsters     sighed miss tick  the teacher witch of the chalk country .   the problem seems to be at its worst in cities .  true  there are fewer natural dangers there  but semi sadistic adults still enjoy inducing irrational fears  as susan sto helit found when she became a governess in ankh morpork .  since she was one of the rare adults capable of seeing the resulting monsters  she knew how to deal with them   one of the many terrors conjured up by the previous governess   s happy way with children had been the bears that waited around in the street to eat you if you stood on the cracks  in the pavement  .   susan had taken to carrying the poker under her respectable coat .  one wallop generally did the trick .  the bears were amazed that anyone else saw them      the previous governess had used various monsters and bogeymen as a form of discipline .  there was always something waiting to eat or carry off bad boys and girls for crimes like stuttering or defiantly and aggravatingly persisting in writing with their left hand .  there was always a scissor man waiting for a little girl who sucked her thumb  always a bogeyman in the cellar .  of such bricks is the innocence of childhood constructed .   hogfather   it is impossible to describe what bogeymen look like  since they are skilled shape shifters and mould their appearance to match whatever horrors they find lurking in their child victim   s subconscious .  but one can say how to get rid of them     at any rate  on the discworld .  they are terrified of blankets  especially those with blue fluffy bunnies on .  even a small square of blanket fabric drives them off .  which stands to reason  for if you can protect yourself from a bogeyman by hiding your head under the blanket  how much more effective it will be to drop a blanket on his head .   most of the frighteners exist on earth too .  a poem by a .  a .  milne tells how pavement bears lurked in the streets of london in the     s  sensible children watched their feet as they walked  taking care to tread only on the square paving stones  never on the cracks between them .   the earthly scissor man  a monstrous tailor  was first described in nineteenth century germany by heinrich hoffman in struwwelpeter  a book of verses known in english as shock headed peter .  there  he is a tailor  a    great  long  red legged scissor man    .   one day mama said     conrad dear   i must go out and leave you here .   but mind now  conrad  what i say   don   t suck your thumb while i   m away .   the great tall tailor always comes  to little boys that suck their thumbs   and ere they dream what he   s about   he takes his great sharp scissors out   and cuts their thumbs clean off  and then   you know  they never grow again .      on the discworld  he looks different   when susan turned to go up the stairs the scissor man was there .   it wasn   t man shaped .  it was something like an ostrich  and something like a lizard on its hind legs  but almost entirely like something made out of blades .  every time it moved a thousand blades went snip  snip .   its long silver neck curved and a head made of shears stared down at her .      you   re not looking for me     she said .     you   re not my nightmare .      hogfather   then there   s the sandman .  he sweeps right across the world at the speed of dark  just as dusk falls  and gets inside every house where there are children .  it   s up to him to make sure that they go up the wooden hill to bedfordshire the very minute they   re told  and get straight into bed and go straight off to sleep  no fooling about .  if the mother is kind hearted and modern in her views  she will say he does this by sprinkling magic sand which makes them so sleepy that they can   t keep their eyes open .  those who are less soppy know that the bag of sand he carries is small  but heavy  and he doesn   t bother to take any out before he swings it against the child   s skull .   these days  on our world  he has been    dwindled     mums all have the same idea of a nice sandman .  but go back a couple of hundred years  to a time when people really knew how to keep children in a constant wholesome state of terror  and listen to what a nanny says in a story by another german author  e .  t .  a .  hoffman      oh  the sandman is a wicked man  who comes to little children when they won   t go to bed  and throws handfuls of sand in their eyes  so they jump out of their heads all bloody  and he puts them in a bag and takes them to the half moon as food for his little ones  and they sit there in the nest and have hooked beaks like owls  to pick at the eyes of naughty little boys and girls .      the magic of childhood is not what it was .   thankfully  not all anthropomorphic and theriomorphic personifications are so sinister .  jack frost  an elderly man who draws ferns and paisley patterns on window panes at night  has no dealings with children at all .  the soul cake duck lays chocolate eggs for them  in gardens  on the tuesday of the soul cake days in the month of sektober  she hides them well  but not too well   so that the kiddies can have fun hunting for them .  in spite of her name  she does not lay cakes .  her equivalent on earth is the german and swiss easter hare  who has been laying eggs for children to find since the sixteenth century .  nowadays he is known in britain and america under the name of the easter bunny     a terrible come down .  at first the hare only laid real eggs  often brightly painted  more recently he has been producing chocolate ones .  german and swiss children enjoy building little nests of moss and flowers and hay  ready for the hare to use .  just how a hare     and a male hare at that     can lay chocolate eggs will be no mystery to anyone who has noticed certain little brown oval objects in the corner of the rabbit hutch .   then there are the ever welcome tooth fairies .  everybody knows what they do     when a child loses a tooth  he or she must slip it under the pillow  and a tooth fairy will come in the night to take it away  leaving at least half an ankh morpork dollar as payment .  despite the name  they do not belong to the same species as elves  or even gnomes .  they are human sized  rather plain and dumpy  and none too bright .   fairies aren   t necessarily little twinkly creatures .  it   s purely a job description  and the commonest ones aren   t even visible .  a fairy is simply any creature currently employed under supernatural laws to take things away or  as in the case of the verruca gnome  to bring things .   hogfather   tooth fairies are to be found chiefly in towns  there are at least half a dozen in ankh morpork alone   and then only in moderately well off homes .  this is probably due to socio economic factors  since it is generally supposed that the coins the fairy brings have been recycled  by bogeymen  after being lost in the very same house .  you won   t find many coins under the furniture of a cottage in lancre  where the basic unit of currency is the chicken .  nor  come to that  in the poor quarters of ankh morpork  in a place like cockbill street .  pennies were precious in cockbill street  if you had any spare ones you put them by to get you a decent funeral  you didn   t lose them under the settee  because you didn   t have one .  the tooth fairy rarely visits cockbill street .   actually  it is wrong to speak of the tooth fairy  as if there was only one of her .  the mistake originated in america somewhere around       and has mysteriously leapt across the dimensions in an attempt to gain a footing in the discworld .  fortunately  in ankh morpork violet bottler and her fellow workers are united in loyalty to one another and to their weekly wage  insisting that they are all  each and every one of them  tooth fairies .   in britain  it is certain that fairies  in the plural  have been collecting children   s shed milk teeth from under pillows for about a hundred years  leaving money in exchange .  what happened earlier is a mystery .  victorian folklore books do not mention tooth fairies  but this is probably because the collectors spent their time hunting for excitingly unusual customs and beliefs  it did not occur to them that the everyday stuff in their own homes was interesting too .   nowadays  owing to pervasive american influence  british children believe in one single tooth fairy .  she is immensely popular .  even dentists talk about her  and keep a stock of dinky little envelopes with her picture on  so that when children have a tooth professionally extracted  they can take it home and pop it under the pillow just the same .   so  how long have tooth fairies been around .  there is one small scrap of evidence that in seventeenth century england elves and fairies were already busy collecting pretty little items in the human world and carting them off to fairyland to decorate their dwellings     which answers the question     what exactly do the fairies do with the teeth .     this evidence comes in the poem    oberon   s palace    by robert herrick  number     in his book hesperides        .  the poem describes a charming little cave or grotto where oberon the fairy king goes to make love to queen mab .  they are very small fairies  possibly the same species as are often mistaken for wasps on the disc .  the cave walls are decorated with bits of peacock feathers  fish scales  blue snake skins  dewdrops etc .  the floor is a mosaic of plum tree gum  dice  brown toadstones  human fingernails  warts  and the teeth of squirrels and children    lately shed    .  these bits and pieces  says herrick  are    brought hither by the elves    .  they are not following quite the same procedure as a modern tooth fairy  since they don   t leave money  but they   re well on the way .   there is another way of dealing with shed teeth  and this too goes back to the seventeenth century .  children would just rub the tooth with salt and throw it in the fire .  this was still done in some homes in the     s  especially in the north of england  sometimes with a verse   fire  fire  burn a bone   god send me a tooth again   a straight one  a strong one   a white shiny bright one .   in many parts of europe  especially germany and russia  it wasn   t fairies that took the teeth  but mice or rats .  and what they gave in exchange was not a coin  but lovely new teeth to grow in place of the old     teeth as strong  sharp and well shaped as their own .  so children would shove the tooth as far as they could down a mousehole  with some suitable rhyme   mousey  mousey  mousey   here   s my tooth of bone   mousey  bring a new tooth   a tooth as hard as stone .   tooth mice didn   t care whether a home was rich or poor  and they were one hundred per cent reliable .  no child who put a tooth in a mousehole ever failed to find a new one growing through its gums .   unfortunately  the same magic law of like to like meant that if people were careless about shed teeth  the unlucky child could end up with something very ugly indeed .  according to the folklorist charlotte latham  writing in      about superstitions she had noted in sussex ten years earlier   a servant girl said children   s cast teeth must never be thrown away  because if an animal found and gnawed them  the new tooth would grow just like that animal   s .     look at old master simmons     she said     with that gurt big pig   s tooth in his upper jaw .  he allus says    twas his mam   s fault  she having dropped one of his baby teeth in the hog   s trough  accidental like .      poor master simmons .  if he had lived on the disc  people would have told him how lucky he was to look just like the hogfather  whose teeth are remarkably tusk like .   but there is an older  darker reason why shed teeth must either be entirely destroyed by fire  or be hidden somewhere where nobody can ever lay hands on them .  it has to do with power  and control  and magic     a magic so old and so simple it   s hardly magic at all .  in our world  this is explained by sir james frazer in his famous work the golden bough   the most familiar example of contagious magic is the magical sympathy which is supposed to exist between a man and any severed portion of his person  such as his hair or nails  so that whoever gets possession of human hair or nails may work his will  at any distance  upon the person from whom they were cut .  this superstition is worldwide .   exactly the same principle works on the discworld  as the assassin teatime knows only too well  especially as regards teeth .  so does archchancellor mustrum ridcully  who remarks  with reference to his own toenails      you can   t be too careful .  get hold of something like someone   s nail clippings and you   ve got    em under your control .  that   s real old magic .  dawn of time stuff .      hogfather       hogswatch   in the bleak midwinter  frosty winds make moan .  people  on the other hand  make as much loud and cheerful noise as they can   people have always had the urge to sing and clang things at the dark stub of the year  when all sorts of psychic nastiness has taken advantage of the long grey days and the deep shadows to lurk and breed .  lately people in ankh morpork   s better districts had taken to singing harmoniously  which rather lost the effect .  those who really understood just clanged something and shouted .   hogfather   they also gather to eat and drink and dance  to light bonfires  and to give one another presents .  this happens in many parts of the multiverse  provided the climate is suitable .  obviously  you   ve got to have a midwinter before you can have a midwinter festival  so there   s no point looking for one in hot regions like djelibeybi or the rimward hinterland of klatch  but wherever there   s a cold dark season you can find something pretty much like hogswatchnight .  it   s a way of telling the sun what you expect of him        rise and shine  sun  start to grow strong again  drive back the ice giants  bring us the warmth of spring .     the sun needs a little encouragement  whatever astronomers may say .   the disc is a lucky world in that the sensible arrangement of its sun  its disc  and its supporting elephants has ensured that the dates of its solstices can be easily observed without any need for complicated maths     unlike earth  where the hours of sunrise and sunset stay apparently the same for three or four days around midsummer and midwinter  giving rise to muddled arguments over whether midsummer day is    june or    june  and why the romans chose    december rather than the   st as the feast of the unconquered sun .  it is also lucky for the inhabitants of lancre  ankh morpork and the sto plains that some sensible ruler in ancient times decided that the night of the winter solstice  hogswatchnight  would also count as new year   s eve .  would that all calendars were as simple and rational .  as a result  it is both the time of the darkest shadows  and the time when all the old year   s occult rubbish has piled up and must be cleared away  and the time for the largest  loudest feast of the year .   the name    hogswatch    makes perfectly good sense for the discworld  where the festive fare at midwinter is centred on pig meat in one form or another     roast boar  pork joints  pork pies  sausages  hams  pigs    heads  black puddings     and where the hogfather  the seasonal gift bringer  gallops across the skies in a sledge drawn by wild boars .  this is a world where pigs  at least  certain special pigs on a certain special night  can and do fly .  oddly  in scotland and northern england there is a rather similar sounding name for new year   s eve  hogmanay     a word which has been known since the sixteenth century  but which nobody has managed to explain .  moreover  british methodists call christmas eve and new year   s eve the watch nights  and hold midnight services .  there are parts of europe  notably romania  serbia  sweden and norway  where roast pig or a pig   s head is the thing to eat at christmas .  all this surely proves that echoes of the great discworld festival drifted across the dimensions and became fruitfully confused in receptive earthly minds .   be that as it may  there is a good practical reason why midwinter feasting is so lavish     it   s the season for a mass slaughter of livestock .  why use up large amounts of fodder keeping all your animals alive through the winter .  come the spring  a single young healthy bull  ram and boar will be enough to service all your cows  ewes and sows .  so  kill off the surplus males  and for once everyone can eat as much fresh meat as they like  and then salt or smoke the rest  and with luck they   ll have enough to last all winter .  farmers have been doing this for thousands of years .  the people who built stonehenge  about      bc  left enormous piles of half eaten bones littering a village some two miles away     bones of cattle  and many  many pigs .  the pigs    teeth show they were young beasts  killed at about nine months old  just right for the winter solstice .  and there were so many bones that people must have been gathering from miles around for this annual feast .  whatever its name may have been  it was the hogswatch of its time .   very likely  it went on for more than just one night and day .  there   s not much work needed on farms at midwinter  so why not spread the fun out for as long as possible .  many peoples have had this idea .  the ancient romans managed to turn most of december into one long festive season .  first came the saturnalia  a period of five or six days of revelry beginning on    december and honouring saturn  god of new sown crops .  shops were closed  work was forbidden  except cooking and baking   people gave one another presents  and everyone was expected to be full of jests and japes and jollity .  there were parties  at which men drew lots to see who would preside as    king    of the feast  his word was law  and he could order the guests to do all kinds of ridiculous things     dance naked  for instance  or pick up the flute girl and carry her three times round the room .  often  social distinctions were turned topsy turvy  slaves sat at table and gorged  while their masters waited on them .  we suspect that the slaves were magnanimous in office  though  tomorrow the masters would be the masters again .   then came the feast of the unconquered sun on the   th  a relatively sober affair .  and then the wild three day celebration of the kalends  beginning on new year   s day    january .  all romans  rich or poor  ate and drank the best they could afford .  adults gave one another presents yet again  children are not mentioned  .  houses were decked inside and out with evergreens     holly  ivy  laurel  branches of conifers  whatever was still alive and green in the dead season .  there were torches and lamps everywhere .  people hardly went to bed  but roamed the streets disguised in masks and weird costumes of animal skins .  a great deal of wine was consumed .   so powerful were these traditions that when the roman empire became christian most of its midwinter customs were adapted so as to fit in with the new religion .  christ   s birth was being celebrated on    december in rome as early as the year      while in     a church council at tours laid down that the whole period of twelve days from    december to   january  feast of the epiphany  would be one long festal cycle  during which all but the most essential work must cease .  and so the twelve days of christmas were born .   there are echoes of all this on the disc .  there are songs about what gifts one   s true love sends on the twelve days of hogswatch  involving partridges and pear trees  and others about the rising of the sun and the running of the deer .  homes are decorated with special hogswatch trees  not to mention holly  ivy  mistletoe .  the mistletoe is felt  obscurely  to be especially significant  even in unseen university  where there can be no question of anyone kissing anyone      well  er     it   s     well  it   s symbolic  archchancellor .         ah .      the senior wrangler felt that something more was expected .  he groped around in the dusty attics of his education .      of     the leaves  d   y   see     they   re symbolic of     of green  d   y   see  whereas the berries  in fact  yes  the berries symbolize     symbolize white .  yes .  white and green .  very     symbolic .      he waited .  he was not  unfortunately  disappointed .      what of .         i   m not sure that there has to be an of     he said .      ah .  so     said the archchancellor  thoughtfully     it could be said that the white and green symbolize a small parasitic plant .         yes indeed     said the senior wrangler .      so mistletoe  in fact  symbolizes mistletoe .         exactly  archchancellor     said the senior wrangler  who was now just hanging on .      funny thing  that     said ridcully  in the same thoughtful tone of voice .     that statement is either so deep that it would take a lifetime to fully comprehend every particle of its meaning  or it is a load of absolute tosh .  which is it  i wonder .      hogfather   not tosh  probably .  plants which insist on staying green  and even bearing white berries or red berries  when others are bare and dry are  in their own way  as unconquered as the midwinter sun .  they are life  and they refuse to die .   unseen university observes another age old custom at hogswatch  the appointment of a boy archchancellor .  a first year student is selected to be the archchancellor for a whole day  from dawn till dusk .  during this period he can exert the full powers of that office  and there are many tales of japes played on senior members of the college council .  yet inevitably  inexorably  dusk will come .  for this reason the student selected for the honour is usually the most unpopular boy in the university  and his life expectancy the following day is brief .   on earth too there are traces of this urge to turn normal authority upside down during midwinter and new year celebrations .  at the roman saturnalia  as we have said  slaves feasted while masters acted as servants .  in medieval france  low ranking clergy sometimes took charge of the services in cathedrals on new year   s day or twelfth day and turned them into a feast of fools or asses    feast .  their leader would call himself    bishop    or    pope    for the day .  theologians in paris in      complained that these clerical revellers came into church dressed up in ridiculous costumes and masks  pretending to be women and minstrels  they ran up and down the aisles  leaping and dancing  worse still  they sat round the altar eating black puddings  gambling  and singing wanton songs  and then went out into the streets to entertain the crowds with their foolery .   there was another medieval    reversal ritual    known in towns all over western europe  but this one was absolutely respectable  well controlled  and full of charm     the custom of the boy bishop .  either on   december  the feast of st nicholas  the patron saint of children   or on    december  the feast of the holy innocents  the babies herod killed   the choirboys had a day off  and chose one of their number to be the boy bishop .  he held office until twelfth night .  dressed in full episcopal robes  he could sit in the bishop   s throne and preside at certain services  while the rest of the boys also wore fine robes and sat in the chapter stalls  the real bishop  if present  and the other higher clergy had to go and sit in the choir stalls .  the custom was especially popular in england  where it spread to abbeys  some oxford and cambridge colleges  and many wealthy parish churches .  henry viii forbade it  but it survived  or was revived  in some places .  it is still done in hereford cathedral  where the boy bishop preaches a sermon on st nicholas   s day .   meanwhile  out in the countryside  people have their own little ways  as albert explains when death talks about the    real meaning    of hogswatch      what  you mean that the pigs and cattle have all been slaughtered and with any luck everyone   s got enough food for the winter .      well  when i say the real meaning        some wretched devil   s had his head chopped off in a wood somewhere    cos he found a bean in his dinner and now the summer   s going to come back .      not exactly that  but        oh  you mean that they   ve chased down some poor beast and shot arrows up into their apple trees and now the shadows are going to go away .      that is definitely a meaning  but i        ah  then you   re talking about the one where they light a bloody big bonfire to give the sun a hint and tell it to stop lurking under the horizon and do a proper day   s work .      you   re not helping  albert .      well  they   re all the real meanings that i know .      it is amazing how much of all this used to happen in our world too  in the days when farming was farming  and no one had invented health and safety regulations and prevention of cruelty to animals .  bonfires blazed  burning barrels and cartwheels were rolled down steep hills into watching crowds  men ran through the streets carrying barrels of flaming tar on their heads .  in regions where cider apples were grown  villagers would come at midwinter to    wassail    the trees .  this meant they would beat the trunks with sticks  fire guns up into the branches  pour ale over the roots  yell  howl  and blow horns .  and they told the trees what was expected of them   here stands a jolly good old apple tree .   stand fast  root  bear well  top .   every little bough  bear an apple now   every little twig   bear an apple big .   hats full  caps full   three bushel sacks full .   whoop  whoop  holloa .   blow  blow the horns .   the trees had better take notice  or else      apple tree  apple tree   bear good fruit   or down with your top  and up with your root .   as for    chasing down some poor beast     there was plenty of that too .  in the nineteenth century  bricklayers from sussex towns would get a day off at the end of november  and go in gangs to the nearest woods armed with short  heavy sticks which they would hurl at squirrels and any other small animals they saw .  if they did manage to hit a squirrel  they took it home to eat .  foxes  on the other hand  are quite inedible .  which has never discouraged generations of english from going fox hunting on    december  a date called boxing day or st stephen   s day .   then there was the very curious custom of hunting the wren  which was once widespread in england  france  the isle of man  wales  and especially in ireland  it happened on st stephen   s day  or christmas day  or twelfth day .  one would hardly think this tiny bird worth hunting  even though it is nicknamed    king of the birds    .  what makes it odder still is that on any other date it would be extremely wicked to kill one  a crime which only the lowest coward would stoop to  and which would bring terrible bad luck .   but on the right day  a dead wren was the luckiest thing in the world .  the young men who had hunted and killed it would make a big display of it .  some fastened it to a long pole  with its wings extended  others hung it by the legs between two crossed hoops garlanded with greenery  others carried it on a little bier decorated with ribbons .  then they formed a procession and solemnly carried it from house to house  chanting   we hunted the wren for robin the bobbin   we hunted the wren for jack the can   we hunted the wren for robin the bobbin   we hunted the wren for everyone .   and   the wren  the wren  the king of the birds   on stephen   s day was caught in the furze .   although he is little  his family   s great   i pray you  good lady  give us a treat .   those who did give the    wren boys    money or a drink would get one of the wren   s feathers to keep for luck  and as a charm against shipwreck .   what can all this mean .  was it just a way of getting beer and money .  or a joke  for the humans  if not for the bird   making fun of upper class huntsmen who are so proud of trophies .  or was it a survival of some incredibly ancient magic ritual involving the sacrifice of a sacred animal at midwinter .  on the discworld  there   s no doubt at all  as quoth the raven explains      blood on the snow  making the sun come up .  starts off with animal sacrifice  y   know  hunt some big hairy animal to death  that kind of stuff .  you know there   s some people up on the ramtops who kill a wren at hogswatch and walk around from house to house singing about it .  with a whack fol oh diddle dildo .  very folkloric  very myffic .         a wren .  why .         i dunno .  maybe someone said  hey  how   d you like to hunt this evil bustard of an eagle with his big sharp beak and great ripping talons  sort of thing  or how about instead you hunt this wren  which is basically about the size of a pea and goes    twit    .  go on  you choose .      but killing a bird or beast  however sacred  is not half as impressive as killing a human  especially an important one  especially a king .  the raven says that once  long ago  that   s what used to happen  up to a point     the king was not a real king  presumably because real kings don   t take kindly to being killed off after just one year on the throne  and have bodyguards to see no one tries it .      then they start this business where some poor bugger finds a special bean in his tucker  oho  everyone says  you   re king  mate  and he thinks    this is a bit of all right    only next thing he   s legging it over the snow with a dozen other buggers chasing him with holy sickles so   s the earth   ll come to life again and all this snow   ll go away .      this is a very remarkable piece of information  which probably explains what happened when sir james frazer  that most famous of victorian speculative folklorists  turned his attention to a cheerful  innocent little christmas custom  and came up with a splendidly melodramatic theory .  in england and france  from tudor times onwards  people used to round off the twelve days of christmas with a lavish party on twelfth night .  there was a big  rich cake .  in that cake was a bean .  whoever got the slice with the bean in it would be    king of the bean    for the rest of the day  and would preside at the celebrations .  it was simply a bit of fun     no violence  no sinister implications .  but frazer decided that it was really the survival of a bloodthirsty primitive ritual  long  long ago  in which the king of the bean had been put to death when the revels were over .  he had no shred of evidence  just a powerful hunch that mock kings must somehow also be sacred sacrificial victims .  in the light of what we now know to be the case on the discworld  it seems certain that frazer   s mind had been invaded by some drifting inspiration from that distant universe .     way back in the early centuries of the disc   s existence  the hogfather had been a sacred victim  hunted and slaughtered in animal or human form so that the sun would rise and the snows melt .  he had been the boar  the wren  the bean king .  but times change  and old gods must find new jobs .  nowadays  the hogfather is the midwinter visitor  the gift bringer  and hogswatch is meant to be  on the whole  just for kids .  toys  stockings on the end of the bed  crackers and puddings  holly and cards  jolly little figures of elves and fairies .  but he still lives in a castle of bone  far away in the icy regions near the hub .  people still make offerings to him  of a sort     the glass of sherry and the pork pie left on the mantelpiece  the carrots for the boars that pull his sledge .  his colours are red and white  even if nobody now thinks about blood on the snow .  and he is  still  just a little scary  even when he is handing out toys in a sparkly grotto in crumley   s emporium   happy hogswatch and be good .  i will know if you   re good or bad  you know .  ho .  ho .  ho .      well  you brought some magic into that little life     said albert .   it   s the expression on their little faces i like  said the hogfather .      you mean sort of fear and awe and not knowing whether to laugh or cry or wet their pants .      yes .  now that is what i call belief .   the hogfather   s duties include moral judgement .  has the child been good or bad  naughty or nice .  a good little boy gets  say  a model klatchian war chariot with real spinning sword blades .  a bad little boy traditionally gets nothing but a bag of smelly old bones  though modern and enlightened parents are beginning to back off from this practice  on the grounds that  a  it causes a nasty complex  and  b  you really do not want to be woken up by all this weeping and wailing at six in the morning .   on earth  supernatural midwinter visitors have been around in europe for centuries .  they are a very mixed lot     saints and angels and even the child jesus on the one hand  hags and goblins and mock terrible monsters on the other     and they turn up on various dates from november through to twelfth night .  one of the first to arrive is st martin     november   who comes to antwerp  ypres  and other flemish towns .  he wears a red cloak  and rides a white horse .  children hang up stockings stuffed with hay in their bedrooms  by morning the hay has disappeared  replaced by apples  nuts  and little cakes shaped like horseshoes .  that   s assuming the children have been good  naturally  if they haven   t  all they find is a cane to beat them .   then there is st nicholas  patron saint of children  who brings them gifts either on the eve of his own feast day    december  or on christmas eve .  he is famous in holland and belgium  and in the catholic parts of germany  switzerland and austria .  he comes in the night riding a white horse  or donkey   he is dressed as a bishop in red robes embroidered with gold  and has a fine white beard .  children put out hay and carrots for his steed  and a glass of schnapps for his servant who carries the bag of presents  whose name is scruffy johnny  or black peter .  often there is someone else with them     the hideous krampus or klaubauf  a shaggy monster with horns  black face  fiery eyes  and chains that clank as he moves .  children who know their catechism will be rewarded with sweets  those who don   t had better look out  for krampus and black peter both carry a stick to beat them .   the protestant parts of germany disapproved of saints  so st nicholas is not mentioned there .  instead  it is the christ child  imagined as a radiantly lovely little boy  who comes at midnight on christmas eve to bless the good children and leave presents for them .  however  it wouldn   t do for things to be all sweetness and light .  so in north germany there is also knecht ruprecht  a weird figure dressed in skins or straw  if children have been good and can sing a hymn nicely  he rewards them with apples and gingerbread from his wallet  but if they can   t he beats them with a bag of soot and ashes .  in some parts people call him rough klas or ashy klas  since    klas    is short for    nicholas     they must think he is an avatar of the saint .   nowadays  the mood has changed .  it is not now thought to be good for little children to be scared out of their wits  even if it does make them behave themselves .  so in the course of the twentieth century some of the worst bogey figures have reinvented themselves as comic and kindly .  take the icelandic gryla  for example  who has been around for some seven hundred years .  she is a huge ugly she troll with fifteen tails  carrying a sheepskin sack and accompanied by her thirteen sons  the christmas lads  who are smaller but equally ugly .  until fairly recently  the whole point about gryla was that she was hunting for naughty children  to carry them off in that sack  and eat them  a fine old tradition with the smack of authenticity .  now she brings sweets and goodies in the sack  and the thirteen lads slip into a child   s room  one by one  during the thirteen nights before christmas  to pop something nice under the pillow     they still look like goblins  though .   the best known of all the gift bringers on earth  and most like the hogfather  is the one whom some call father christmas and others santa claus and others le p  re no  l .  he has been around for over     years  and is now stronger than ever .  the myth just grows and grows and grows  since it is powered by money .   when first glimpsed  in england at the end of the middle ages  he had nothing to do with children  and little to do with gifts .  he wasn   t even necessarily called father christmas  but could be    captain christmas        prince christmas     or    sir christmas    .  his job was to personify all the joys of eating  drinking and general jollity .  in the     s the rector of plymtree in devonshire wrote a lively carol about sir christmas singing    nowell  nowell .     outside the door  and urging everybody to drink as much as possible   buvez bien par toute la compagnie   make good cheer and be right merry .   he was still at it in the early seventeenth century  in spite of puritan disapproval   when he was featured in ben jonson   s play christmas his masque         coming on stage followed by his equally jolly sons  whose names were misrule  carol  mince pie  pots and pan  new year gift  mumming  wassail  and baby cake .  he wore doublet and hose and a high crowned hat with a brooch  and had a long thin beard .   it was charles dickens who gave the finest account of a personified christmas spirit who embodies the joys of food and drink  in his a christmas carol        .  he told how scrooge came face to face with a    jolly giant  glorious to see     in a room thickly hung with holly  ivy and mistletoe  and piled high with food   heaped up on the floor  to form a kind of throne  were turkey  geese  game  poultry  brawn  great joints of meat  sucking pigs  long wreaths of sausages  mince pies  plum puddings  barrels of oysters  red hot chestnuts  cherry cheeked apples  juicy oranges  luscious pears  immense twelfth cakes  and seething bowls of punch  that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam .   this spirit looks like a younger version of father christmas  or indeed of the hogfather .  like them  he wears a long simple robe  trimmed with white fur  but in his case it is green  not red  and has no hood  he has long curly brown hair  and is wearing a wreath of holly set with icicles .  and though he takes scrooge on a visionary journey through the night  wandering invisibly from house to house to watch the celebrations  he does not bring presents for the kiddies .   even so  the idea of father christmas as a gift bringer started infiltrating victorian britain  probably from germany .  he became quite a familiar figure     an old man  bearded  trudging through the snow with his sack of presents  dressed in a long hooded gown which was often  but by no means always  red .  he did not have a companion to beat or threaten naughty children  as his continental kinsmen had .   meanwhile  on the other side of the atlantic  something quite extraordinary had been happening .  the dutch settlers in new amsterdam  later renamed new york  had kept up the tradition that st nicholas would come in the night of     december to pop presents in the shoes or stockings of sleeping children  just as he did in their old homeland .  in      the very popular writer washington irving drew attention to this  but transferred the idea to christmas eve .  and then in       suddenly  inexplicably  inspiration gripped a clergyman and professor of hebrew and oriental languages called clement clark moore  and he wrote a little poem for his children .  he called it    a visit from st nicholas     but most people now think of the first line  not the title      twas the night before christmas  and all through the house      moore probably disapproved of saints  and even bishops  since his nicholas is not a bishop in full regalia on a white horse  but a fat little gnome  hurtling through the sky in a miniature sleigh drawn by eight tiny reindeer .   why reindeer .  nobody knows .  there are no reindeer in holland .   he comes and goes by way of the chimney .  he carries a sack of presents .  as for his appearance   he was dressed all in fur  from his head to his foot   and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot      his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow   and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow   the stump of his pipe he held hard in his teeth   and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath   he had a broad face and a little round belly   that shook when he laughed  like a bowlful of jelly .   before too long  the folk imagination got to work .  bishops were forgotten  and the gift bringer   s name was shortened to santa claus .  in the     s the artist thomas nash began drawing him .  nash dropped the furs  preferring the typical dutch costume of a belted jacket  blue breeches  and a flat sailor   s cap .  but by the end of the nineteenth century red became the standard colour  with or without white trimmings   and the cap became a red one  long and floppy .  in the twentieth  santa claus acquired a team of elves as little helpers  and a home near the north pole .   this american santa claus arrived in england in       by way of a fictional story by susan and ann warner     the christmas stocking    .  little by little he became popular  and he and the native father christmas blended together  sometimes using one name  sometimes the other  sometimes in a long robe  sometimes in a jacket .  and now the combined figure is spreading all over the world .   this extraordinary history shows beyond doubt that a truly powerful idea bounces to and fro across space and time  from mind to mind and from one universe to another .  in a way  both santa and the hogfather are communal    shakespearean    creations .  as we point out elsewhere  will would happily drag some fragments of myth and folklore together and weld them into something new in such a way that the end result suits our sense of narrative grammar .   did people in northern europe make sacrifices at the winter solstice .  yes .  human .  could be  long  long ago  to the extent that as a species we have occasionally indulged in human sacrifice  but later the most likely sacrifice would have been a horse or a farm animal .  and the king of the bean .  a good story  which satisfies our desire for a thrilling narrative  but almost certainly untrue .  the evolution of the proto hogfather .  indeed  the person seen by susan going through his different personifications does add up to the    festive spirit    .  and the suggestion that  via some deep visceral means  the colours of the said spirit have become the colours of blood on snow .  that   s a happy coincidence  and a good story  but it   s not folklore .   one final thing .  the coca cola company is often credited with the    modern    look of father christmas  but it is much truer to say that it popularized  over much of the world  one    look    among many that already existed .  exposure wins .   for example  as terry mentions in his introduction  the    magpie rhyme    that introduced the itv children   s series in the late     s and the     s almost certainly did a lot to wipe out the existing regional variations of the rhyme .   but across the channel  at least  older avatars often appear alongside  or even instead of  the red and white demigod of christmas expenditure .  ho .  ho .  ho .      in this particular case  the demonic warning might well be justified .      both the authors discovered frazer in their teens and were bowled over  as probably most readers are  but became more sceptical later on .  folklorists have learned to be careful  if it looks like a jolly good story  it may very well be one .       chapter      death      death may well be the only supernatural entity  strictly speaking  an anthropomorphic personification  which is known and acknowledged throughout the entire multiverse .  his arrival is quite  quite certain     and yet  most people secretly hope that for them and their friends it will be indefinitely delayed  and his actual manifestation generally comes as a surprise .  on the discworld only wizards and witches can foresee his arrival  on earth  only exceptionally holy men and women .   some people try to bargain with him  staking lives on the outcome of a game of chess or cards .  this rarely succeeds  though granny weatherwax did once win against him at cripple mr onion  of course  he knew she would  .  others try to run away .  this is quite hopeless  since death keeps an appointments diary  and knows precisely where and when he is scheduled to find them .   a story is told about this on our world .  it is part of the age old traditions of muslim lands  and reached english speaking countries in the     s through a play by somerset maugham and a novel by john o   hara .  it tells of a servant who was buying food for his master   s household in the street market in baghdad one morning when someone jostled him  and he turned to find himself face to face with death  who made an abrupt gesture .  terrified  the servant ran home  begged his master for the loan of a horse  and galloped off to samarra  which is about    miles away .  the master then went to the market place himself  and there he too saw death .     why did you raise your hand to threaten my servant .     said he .     that was no threat     answered death     only a start of surprise .  i was astonished to see him here in baghdad  for i have an appointment with him tonight in samarra .      something similar happened once on the disc  as we learn from the colour of magic  when rincewind jostled a tall dark figure in the bazaar of ankh morpork  and was told i was expecting to meet thee in psephopololis .  actually  it turned out to be a misunderstanding .   on both the disc and the earth death manifests himself to humans and humanoid races  e . g .  dwarfs  as a very tall human skeleton  every bone pleasantly polished  with remote but piercing points of blue light in his eye sockets .  his deep resonant voice has been compared to many things of a funereal nature  such as the clang of the leaden doors of a crypt when slammed deep underground  yet no comparison really does it justice .  he wears a hooded robe woven of absolute darkness .  normally he carries a scythe  but also owns a sword for use on kings  both weapons have shimmering semi transparent ice blue blades  for separating souls from bodies .  there is usually an hourglass hidden in the folds of his robe  this is a lifetimer  which measures the life span of the person he is about to visit .   on earth there are some countries in whose languages    death    is a feminine word  la mort  morte  muerta  .  this has no effect at all on the manifested appearance of death in those lands .  in any case  it takes a calm  well trained eye to tell a male from a female skeleton  and black hooded robes are unisex attire .   there was a time when death thought it polite to appear in whatever form the client expected     at least  for human clients  what shape he assumes when manifesting himself to  say  a sea anemone  a mayfly  or a nettle is beyond conjecture .  however  he discovered that most people have no clear expectations at all  probably because in their hearts they never really believe they will die .  and those who do think they know what they will see have some pretty strange ideas .  for example  king teppicymon xxvii  pharaoh of djelibeybi  found that the hooded robe lacked a certain something      i understood that death came as a three headed giant scarab beetle     said the king .   death shrugged .  well  now you know .      what   s that thing in your hand .      this .  it   s a scythe .      strange looking object  isn   t it .     said the pharaoh .     i thought death carried the flail of mercy and the reaping hook of justice .      death appeared to think about this .  what in .  he said .      pardon .      are we still talking about a giant beetle .      ah .  in his mandibles  i suppose .  but i think he   s got arms in one of the frescoes in the palace .  seems a bit silly  really  now i come to tell someone .  i mean  a giant beetle with arms .  and the head of an ibis  i seem to recall .      pyramids   there have been times and places on earth where death would have found it just as tricky to fit in with his local image .  for the ancient egyptians  he would have had to appear as anubis  a man with the head of a jackal or wild dog  for certain south american peoples  as a cross between a jaguar and an eagle  for some hindus  as the ferocious many armed goddess kali  adorned with garlands of skulls .  so he decided to stick to what he liked best  using the costume and attributes he had been gradually collecting over the past       years or so .   his starting point was the bible  specifically the sixth chapter of the apocalypse  or book of revelation   which speaks of a    rider on a pale horse    whose name was death  wearing a crown  and flourishing a sword .  the same passage mentions three other riders as his companions  war  famine  and pestilence .  on the discworld too  in suitable circumstances  he teams up with them and they appear together as the four horsemen of the apocralypse  as a sure sign that the world is just about to end     probably .  some of their doings on the disc are recorded in the light fantastic  sourcery  interesting times  and thief of time  and on earth in good omens .   death liked the idea of a horse  and got himself a handsome white steed named binky  who is real flesh and blood  though capable of galloping in the air and across the dimensions as well as on land .  he did briefly experiment with skeletal horses  but found bits kept dropping off  and fiery horses  which tended to burn down the stable .  binky is far more practical  and more reliable .  he is well fed and well groomed  death strongly disapproves of artists who represent the pale horse as a mangy  starving creature  .  from time to time he requires new horseshoes  and on these occasions death takes him to the best farrier on the disc  jason ogg of lancre .  jason   s gift as a craftsman is that he can shoe anything  anything  that anyone brings him     a horse  a goose  a unicorn  an ant .  but the price to be paid for the gift is that he must shoe anything anyone brings .  so on certain nights  when he hears a certain knock and a certain voice  he does as his father and grandfather did before him  he puts on a blindfold  and shoes what must from the feel of it be the finest horse in the world     and certainly the most docile .   as far as is known  death has not made similar arrangements on earth .  but apparently the devil did  once .  it   s said that there was once a blacksmith at keenthorne in shropshire who was so proud of his skill that he boasted that    if the devil himself came to his forge he would shoe his horse for him  aye  and shoe him to rights too .     and then  one dark midnight  a traveller on a great black horse arrived  demanding that it be shod     and the smith noted with horror that the rider himself had a hoof .  the smith ran off in a panic and roused the parson  begging him for help .  the parson answered that he must fulfil his boast  but should accept no payment  for that would be selling himself to the devil .  so the smith did shoe the devil   s horse  most efficiently  but though the devil repeatedly offered him good payment  he would take nothing .  the devil and his horse vanished in a flash of fire .   to return to death .  in the course of the middle ages he became dissatisfied with the idea of himself as the crowned and sword wielding rider of the pale horse .  he disliked the idea of kingship  even though it appealed to many artists and poets     to milton  for example  who in paradise lost describes death as a dark  faceless but menacing shadow   what seemed his head  the likeness of a kingly crown had on .   on one occasion on the discworld  death  who at the time had become more or less human and was calling himself bill door  encountered an entity which had taken on his role  and had adopted much the same wraith like manifestation as milton described .  this filled him with fury   the new death raised his cowl .   there was no face there .  there was not even a skull .  smoke curled formlessly between the robe and a golden crown .   bill door raised himself on his elbows .   a crown .  his voice shook with rage .  i never wore a crown .   you never wanted to rule .   reaper man   and so death went looking for another image from our world .  he decided he liked the look of old father time  an old man carrying a scythe and an hourglass .  this figure had evolved out of a god called cronus in ancient greece and saturn in rome  who carried a sickle or a scythe because he was a god of agriculture  and an hourglass because he had also become the god of time  this happened because    cronus    sounds almost exactly like chronos  meaning    time    in greek  .  now  harvesting and death are two faces of the same thing  depending on the point of view .  if you are the farmer reaping corn or grass  you   re looking ahead to the bread  the beer  the hay for the cattle  and you go home for a cheery harvest supper with plenty of drink and a hey nonny no  and maybe a barn dance .  but if you are the plant being reaped  what you   re going through is death .  seeing the sense in this  death copied the scythe and hourglass of cronus  and adopted the title of the grim reaper .  it was  after all  his job to separate the wheat germ of the soul from the chaff of the mortal body .   both the rider and the reaper were thought of  at first  as having the normal body of a living man .  however  the european middle ages had a rather morbid interest in physical decay  so for a while death adopted the appearance of a rotting corpse  with split belly  peeling skin  and crawling worms  wearing  if anything  a shroud .  many medieval painters and sculptors showed him in this form .  then  little by little  he changed over to something more hygienic     just clean  gleaming bones .  his new idea of himself as a skeleton reaper seeped into the minds of italian artists during the fourteenth century .  he can be seen in this guise  for example  on early packs of tarot cards  he is number    among the greater trumps  which accounts for a lot  .  then  soon after       painters in the netherlands who had to do the illustrations for manuscripts of the apocalypse got the message  and started drawing the rider on the pale horse as a skeleton too .  at first they kept the sword  after all  that   s what the book said   but by the end of the century woodcuts in german bibles were giving him the scythe instead .  and that  give or take a black cloak and hood  is how death still usually chooses to be seen  a skeleton on a white horse  with a scythe and an hourglass .  he allows himself one touch of luxury     the robe is fastened with a silver brooch engraved with an omega  which is the last letter of the greek alphabet and so very definitely signals the end .  also  it   s a pretty shape .   it was also towards the end of the european middle ages that death learned how to dance .  he is famed for it .  any dance  every dance     square dances  round dances  reels  the polka  the mazurka  the waltz  the tango  the quirmish bull dance  oh lay .     a high speed fusillade of hollow snapping noises suddenly kept time with the music .      who   s playing the maracas .      death grinned .      maracas .  i don   t need     maracas .      reaper man   that was on the disc .  he can be just as energetic on earth too  judging by old prints of skeletons wildly leaping about  and by a story told in sussex in the     s  as recorded by charlotte latham   there stood upon the downs close to broadwater an old oak tree  and people said that always on midsummer eve  just at midnight  a number of skeletons started up from its roots and  joining hands  danced round it till cock crow  then as suddenly sank down again .  they said several persons had actually seen this dance of death  one young man in particular  having been detained by business at findon till very late  and forgetting that it was midsummer eve  had been frightened out of his very senses by seeing the dead men caper to the rattling of their own bones .   on other occasions  his dancing is sedate and courtly .  in europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  the dance of death was often painted on the walls of cemeteries and churches  it showed a line of men and skeletons  hand in hand  pacing along in a slow and stately chain dance .  in england there was a famous mural in the cloister of london   s old st paul   s cathedral  the one that burned down in the great fire of        and there is still a set of carvings on the ceiling of roslyn chapel near edinburgh .  the dance was also painted in the margins of prayer books  and acted out in religious pageants .  nowadays  it is best remembered as the closing shot of ingmar bergman   s film the seventh seal .   on the discworld  death has often tried to act in human ways as a relief from his unremitting memory of both past and future  but he rarely gets much satisfaction from it .  fishing  gambling  getting drunk and joining the klatchian foreign legion in order to forget have not really worked for him .  his greatest success was his spell as a farm labourer  harvesting a speciality   as described in reaper man  he also on one occasion enjoyed riding a rather special motorbike   there were two small cart wheels  one behind the other  with a saddle in between them .  in front of the saddle was a pipe with a complicated double curve in it  so that someone sitting in the saddle would be able to get a grip .   the rest was junk .  bones and tree branches and a jackdaw   s bouquet of gewgaws .  a horse   s skull was strapped over the front wheel  and feathers and beads hung from every point .   soul music   death is clearly the patron saint of album covers .  and in some cultures a saint is just what he is     or rather she is  santa muerte  a  female  folk saint .  devotees say she is an offshoot of the catholic church  the church dismisses them as a cult .  the case continues  but one follower delivered a quote with a near discworld pragmatism     it   s better to make her your friend .        sainted or otherwise  death is attracted to mexico  where he takes part in all kinds of human activities  expertly and with great enjoyment .  this is especially obvious around the time of the day of the dead    and   november  .  at this season  streets and shops are full of cheerful images of male and female deaths not just dancing but playing all kinds of musical instruments  flirting  fighting  drinking  showing off their fine clothes  working at any and every trade .  nothing  in short  could be more alive than death  in mexico .   and what of the dead themselves  on the discworld .  what happens when death comes to them .  well  that usually seems to be up to them .  the only group who had no say in the matter were the luckless pharaohs of djelibeybi  mummified and immured in pyramids which were supposed to ensure a blissful afterlife but which simply imprisoned them inside a time distortion .  after centuries of excruciating boredom  they broke free and passed over into death   s world  with great relief  and forming an orderly queue  .  it is not known whether the ancient egyptian pyramids had the same unwelcome side effect on their pharaohs .   on earth  according to the myths of ancient greece  the gods would occasionally  as a mark of great favour  take someone newly dead and turn him or her into stars .  the hero perseus is a constellation now  as is andromeda  the girl he rescued from a sea monster  and indeed cetus the monster too .  so is orion the hunter  lover of at least two goddesses  so is amalthea the goat  who became the constellation capricorn .  some people on the disc are aware of this possibility  though as far as is known the disc gods have never actually done it     cohen and his horde rode for the stars because they wanted to  and gods had nothing to do with it .  in any case  becoming a constellation is not a permanent solution   mrs mcgarry looked up at the stars .      in the olden days     she said     when a hero had been really heroic  the gods would put them up in the stars .      the heavens change  said death .  what today looks like a mighty hunter may look like a teacup in a hundred years    time .   the last hero   there are a few who  when death comes to them  refuse to move on  preferring to become ghosts     certain kings of lancre who haunt their ancestral castle  for example  and dwarfs who may choose to walk the earth in torment if they have not been buried with their finest weapons .  according to the myths and folklore of our world  such situations are pretty common here  people linger as ghosts because they have not been properly buried  or have been particularly wicked  or have died by violence  or are looking for money they buried  or simply can   t bear to leave home .  but nobody  in any universe  can match the obstinacy of the political activist reg shoe  who insists on remaining a zombie in order to campaign for the rights of the dead and the undead .   the normal course of events is that death escorts those who die to the edge of a vast desert of black sand under a brilliant starry sky  where he informs them that what they do next  or what happens to them next  is not his responsibility     for in the universe of the discworld death is never the supreme reality .  it appears that no two people have the same experience  since it will accurately reflect the beliefs and personality of each one .   in small gods  for instance  five deaths are described .  one  a sea captain who believes that the souls of sailors become friendly porpoises  in british lore  it would be seagulls   sails away in search of paradise in a ghostly ship  for ships too have a soul   with a ghostly crew  and ghostly rats  and an escort of ghostly porpoises .  the second and third are soldiers     fri   it  an omnian general who secretly disbelieves the hell fire doctrines of that church  and ichlos  a private who has never given much thought to religion .  both remember a childhood song   you have to walk a lonesome desert   you have to walk it all alone      fri   it asks death     what is at the end of the desert .     and is told  judgement .   the memory stole over him  a desert is what you think it is .   and now  you can think clearly      there were no lies here .  all fancies fled away .  that   s what happened in all deserts .  it was just you  and what you believed .   what have i always believed .   that on the whole  and by and large  if a man lived properly  not according to what any priests said  but according to what seemed decent and honest inside  then it would  at the end  more or less  turn out all right .   you couldn   t get that on a banner .  but the desert looked better already .   fri   it set out .   it is the same for ichlos  though he puts it more simply      my mum told me about this     he said .     when you   re dead  you have to walk a desert .  and you see everything properly  she said .  and remember everything right .      death studiously did nothing to indicate his feelings either way .      might meet a few friends on the way  eh .     said the soldier .  possibly .   ichlos set out .  on the whole  he thought  it could have been worse .   the next who dies is vorbis  the single minded  pitiless  utterly unshakable omnian exquisitor .  when he sees the desert  his certainties drain away .  though he has taken for granted that there would indeed be a judgement according to the rules of his religion  and that he would do very well in it   all he can feel is the echo of his own thoughts  and when he looks inside himself all he can see is the horror of what he has done  and the terror of emptiness and solitude .   the last to die is the compassionate monk brutha .  he too follows death to the black sand under the starry sky .      ah .  there really is a desert .  does everyone get this .     said brutha .   who knows .      and what is at the end of the desert .      judgement .   brutha considered this .      which end .      death grinned and stepped aside .   it   s only natural to want to know what lies at the far end of the desert .  but this  as tiffany told the hiver in a hatful of sky  is something no words can describe  which is why you have to cross the desert to find out .  but before you can even begin  there is something important to be done .  you must face and accept judgement  the judgement you pass on yourself in the light of clear self knowledge and accurate memory .  and that  as brutha guessed  begins as soon as you die  at this end of the desert .   and then brutha sees vorbis  hunched on the sand  too paralysed with fear to have even started the journey .      but vorbis died a hundred years ago .      yes .  he had to walk it all alone .  all alone with himself .  if he dared .      he   s been here for a hundred years .      possibly not .  time is different here .  it is     more personal .      ah .  you mean a hundred years can pass like a few seconds .      a hundred years can pass like infinity .   whereupon brutha  true to his own nature  offers companionship to vorbis  and they set out to cross the desert together .   it may come as a surprise to those whose notion of christian teaching about the afterlife is based on  say  the famous hell fire sermon in james joyce   s portrait of the artist as a young man  that what is described in discworld terms in small gods is pretty well what many modern theologians say     at any rate  as regards brutha  vorbis  and fri   it  though maybe not the ship   s captain .  such teachers say that a lifetime   s daily choices determine what we are at the moment of death  and that god   s    judgement    consists in letting us see  accurately and fully  what we have chosen to become .  he does not hurl punishments  those who suffer  like vorbis  do so because they have imprisoned themselves in their own evil .  it is to be hoped that every vorbis finds a compassionate brutha .   the same point emerges from the post mortem experience of the brutal  murderous  but mentally subnormal thug mr tulip  in the truth  .  death makes him see the value of the many lives he had destroyed  and once he understands the truth about himself he is filled with huge remorse and passes his own judgement on himself  saying he wishes he could go back in time to kill himself before he could do such harm  but as that   s impossible he wants to spend the rest of his afterlife feeling    really sorry    .  as death notes  tulip has    something in him that could be better     given enough time .  his purgatory is not harsh .  since he has been taught to expect reincarnation  reincarnation is what he gets  in a form agreeable to the best part of him  his love of good craftsmanship and beautiful antiques .  he becomes a woodworm in a fine old desk .   however  there is nothing good in the other thug  mr pin  who puts his trust in a lucky potato and whose remorse is simply pretence .  he too reincarnates  but the outcome will not be pleasant .  he becomes a potato  and is fried  since    reincarnation enjoys a joke as much as the next philosophical hypothesis .      but to death  a nature like mr pin   s is no joke .   death sighed deeply .  who knows what evil lurks in the heart of men .   the death of rats looked up .   squeak  he said .   death waved a hand dismissively .  well  yes  obviously me  he said .  i just wondered if there was anyone else .   the truth   one who may have answers to the questions that trouble death   s lonely mind     questions about goodness and evil  and justice     is azrael  his lord .  on earth     azrael    is the name given in the traditions of islam to the angel of death  whose name is nowhere mentioned in the bible itself .  muslims say he is one of the great archangels  equal to michael  raphael or gabriel in rank  and greater than them in wisdom .  his name is arabic  and means    help of god    .   but the nature of azrael is best seen on the discworld .  he is known there as the great attractor  the death of the whole multiverse  the beginning and end of time .  he is so vast that he can only be measured in terms of the speed of light  and whole galaxies are lost in his eyes .  our death  the
