publisher      begin reading     the sun rose slowly  as if it wasn   t sure it was worth all the effort .   another disc day dawned  but very gradually  and this is why .   when light encounters a strong magical field it loses all sense of urgency .  it slows right down .  and on the discworld the magic was embarrassingly strong  which meant that the soft yellow light of dawn flowed over the sleeping landscape like the caress of a gentle lover or  as some would have it  like golden syrup .  it paused to fill up valleys .  it piled up against mountain ranges .  when it reached cori celesti  the ten mile spire of gray stone and green ice that marked the hub of the disc and was the home of its gods  it built up in heaps until it finally crashed in great lazy tsunami as silent as velvet  across the dark landscape beyond .   it was a sight to be seen on no other world .   of course  no other world was carried through the starry infinity on the backs of four giant elephants  who were themselves perched on the shell of a giant turtle .  his name   or her name  according to another school of thought   was great a   tuin  he   or  as it might be  she   will not take a central role in what follows but it is vital to an understanding of the disc that he   or she   is there  down below the mines and sea ooze and fake fossil bones put there by a creator with nothing better to do than upset archaeologists and give them silly ideas .   great a   tuin the star turtle  shell frosted with frozen methane  pitted with meteor craters  and scoured with asteroidal dust .  great a   tuin  with eyes like ancient seas and a brain the size of a continent through which thoughts moved like little glittering glaciers .  great a   tuin of the great slow sad flippers and star polished carapace  laboring through the galactic night under the weight of the disc .  as large as worlds .  as old as time .  as patient as a brick .   actually  the philosophers have got it all wrong .  great a   tuin is in fact having a great time .   great a   tuin is the only creature in the entire universe that knows exactly where it is going .   of course  philosophers have debated for years about where great a   tuin might be going  and have often said how worried they are that they might never find out .   they   re due to find out in about two months .  and then they   re really going to worry     something else that has long worried the more imaginative philosophers on the disc is the question of great a   tuin   s sex  and quite a lot of time and trouble has been spent in trying to establish it once and for all .   in fact  as the great dark shape drifts past like an endless tortoiseshell hairbrush  the results of the latest effort are just coming into view .   tumbling past  totally out of control  is the bronze shell of the potent voyager  a sort of neolithic spaceship built and pushed over the edge by the astronomer priests of krull  which is conveniently situated on the very rim of the world and proves  whatever people say  that there is such a thing as a free launch .   inside the ship is twoflower  the disc   s first tourist .  he had recently spent some months exploring it and is now rapidly leaving it for reasons that are rather complicated but have to do with an attempt to escape from krull .   this attempt has been one thousand percent successful .   but despite all the evidence that he may be the disc   s last tourist as well  he is enjoying the view .   plunging along some two miles above him is rincewind the wizard  in what on the disc passes for a spacesuit .  picture it as a diving suit designed by men who have never seen the sea .  six months ago he was a perfectly ordinary failed wizard .  then he met twoflower  was employed at an outrageous salary as his guide  and has spent most of the intervening time being shot at  terrorized  chased and hanging from high places with no hope of salvation or  as is now the case  dropping from high places .   he isn   t looking at the view because his past life keeps flashing in front of his eyes and getting in the way .  he is learning why it is that when you put on a spacesuit it is vitally important not to forget the helmet .   a lot more could be included now to explain why these two are dropping out of the world  and why twoflower   s luggage  last seen desperately trying to follow him on hundreds of little legs  is no ordinary suitcase  but such questions take time and could be more trouble than they are worth .  for example  it is said that someone at a party once asked the famous philosopher ly tin weedle    why are you here .     and the reply took three years .   what is far more important is an event happening way overhead  far above a   tuin  the elephants and the rapidly expiring wizard .  the very fabric of time and space is about to be put through the wringer .      the air was greasy with the distinctive feel of magic  and acrid with the smoke of candles made of a black wax whose precise origin a wise man wouldn   t inquire about .   there was something very strange about this room deep in the cellars of unseen university  the disc   s premier college of magic .  for one thing it seemed to have too many dimensions  not exactly visible  just hovering out of eyeshot .  the walls were covered with occult symbols  and most of the floor was taken up by the eightfold seal of stasis  generally agreed in magical circles to have all the stopping power of a well aimed halfbrick .   the only furnishing in the room was a lectern of dark wood  carved into the shape of a bird   well  to be frank  into the shape of a winged thing it is probably best not to examine too closely   and on the lectern  fastened to it by a heavy chain covered in padlocks  was a book .   a large  but not particularly impressive  book .  other books in the university   s libraries had covers inlaid with rare jewels and fascinating wood  or bound with dragon skin .  this one was just a rather tatty leather .  it looked the sort of book described in library catalogues as    slightly foxed     although it would be more honest to admit that it looked as though it had been badgered  wolved and possibly beared as well .   metal clasps held it shut .  they weren   t decorated  they were just very heavy   like the chain  which didn   t so much attach the book to the lectern as tether it .   they looked like the work of someone who had a pretty definite aim in mind  and who had spent most of his life making training harness for elephants .   the air thickened and swirled .  the pages of the book began to crinkle in a quite horrible  deliberate way  and blue light spilled out from between them .  the silence of the room crowded in like a fist  slowly being clenched .   half a dozen wizards in their nightshirts were taking turns to peer in through the little grille in the door .  no wizard could sleep with this sort of thing going on   the build up of raw magic was rising through the university like a tide .      right     said a voice .     what   s going on .  and why wasn   t i summoned .      galder weatherwax  supreme grand conjuror of the order of the silver star  lord imperial of the sacred staff  eighth level ipsissimus and    th chancellor of unseen university  wasn   t simply an impressive sight even in his red nightshirt with the hand embroidered mystic runes  even in his long cap with the bobble on  even with the wee willie winkie candlestick in his hand .  he even managed to very nearly pull it off in fluffy pompom slippers as well .   six frightened faces turned toward him .      um  you were summoned  lord     said one of the underwizards .      that   s why you   re here     he added helpfully .      i mean why wasn   t i summoned before .     snapped galder  pushing his way to the grille .      um  before who  lord .     said the wizard .   galder glared at him  and ventured a quick glance through the grille .   the air in the room was now sparkling with tiny flashes as dust motes incinerated in the flow of raw magic .  the seal of stasis was beginning to blister and curl up at the edges .   the book in question was called the octavo and  quite obviously  it was no ordinary book .   there are of course many famous books of magic .  some may talk of the necrotelicomnicon  with its pages made of ancient lizard skin  some may point to the book of going forth around elevenish  written by a mysterious and rather lazy llamaic sect  some may recall that the bumper fun grimoire reputedly contains the one original joke left in the universe .  but they are all mere pamphlets when compared with the octavo  which the creator of the universe reputedly left behind   with characteristic absentmindedness   shortly after completing his major work .   the eight spells imprisoned in its pages led a secret and complex life of their own  and it was generally believed that     galder   s brow furrowed as he stared into the troubled room .  of course  there were only seven spells now .  some young idiot of a student wizard had stolen a look at the book one day and one of the spells had escaped and lodged in his mind .  no one had ever managed to get to the bottom of how it had happened .  what was his name  now .  winswand .   octarine and purple sparks glittered on the spine of the book .  a thin curl of smoke was beginning to rise from the lectern  and the heavy metal clasps that held the book shut were definitely beginning to look strained .      why are the spells so restless .     said one of the younger wizards .   galder shrugged .  he couldn   t show it  of course  but he was beginning to be really worried .  as a skilled eighth level wizard he could see the half imaginary shapes that appeared momentarily in the vibrating air  wheedling and beckoning .  in much the same way that gnats appear before a thunderstorm  really heavy build ups of magic always attracted things from the chaotic dungeon dimensions   nasty things  all misplaced organs and spittle  forever searching for any gap through which they might sidle into the world of men .     this had to be stopped .      i shall need a volunteer     he said firmly .   there was a sudden silence .  the only sound came from behind the door .  it was the nasty little noise of metal parting under stress .      very well  then     he said .     in that case i shall need some silver tweezers  about two pints of cat   s blood  a small whip and a chair        it is said that the opposite of noise is silence .  this isn   t true .  silence is only the absence of noise .  silence would have been a terrible din compared to the sudden soft implosion of noiselessness that hit the wizards with the force of an exploding dandelion clock .   a thick column of spitting light sprang up from the book  hit the ceiling in a splash of flame  and disappeared .   galder stared up at the hole  ignoring the smoldering patches in his beard .  he pointed dramatically .      to the upper cellars .     he cried  and bounded up the stone stairs .  slippers flapping and nightshirts billowing the other wizards followed him  falling over one another in their eagerness to be last .   nevertheless  they were all in time to see the fireball of occult potentiality disappear into the ceiling of the room above .      urgh     said the youngest wizard  and pointed to the floor .      the room had been part of the library until the magic had drifted through  violently reassembling the possibility particles of everything in its path .  so it was reasonable to assume that the small purple newts had been part of the floor and the pineapple custard may once have been some books .  and several of the wizards later swore that the small sad orangutan sitting in the middle of it all looked very much like the head librarian .   galder stared upward .     to the kitchen .     he bellowed  wading through the custard to the next flight of stairs .   no one ever found out what the great cast iron cooking range had been turned into  because it had broken down a wall and made good its escape before the disheveled party of wild eyed mages burst into the room .  the vegetable chef was found much later hiding in the soup cauldron  gibbering unhelpful things like    the knuckles .  the horrible knuckles .      the last wisps of magic  now somewhat slowed  were disappearing into the ceiling .      to the great hall .      the stairs were much wider here  and better lit .  panting and pineapple flavored  the fitter wizards got to the top by the time the fireball had reached the middle of the huge drafty chamber that was the university   s main hall .  it hung motionless  except for the occasional small prominence that arched and spluttered across its surface .   wizards smoke  as everyone knows .  that probably explained the chorus of coffin coughs and sawtooth wheezes that erupted behind galder as he stood appraising the situation and wondering if he dare look for somewhere to hide .  he grabbed a frightened student .      get me seers  farseers  scryers and withinlook men .     he barked .     i want this studied .      something was taking shape inside the fireball .  galder shielded his eyes and peered at the shape forming in front of him .  there was no mistaking it .  it was the universe .   he was quite sure of this  because he had a model of it in his study and it was generally agreed to be far more impressive than the real thing .  faced with the possibilities offered by seed pearls and silver filigree  the creator had been at a complete loss .   but the tiny universe inside the fireball was uncannily   well  real .  the only thing missing was color .  it was all in translucent misty white .   there was great a   tuin  and the four elephants  and the disc itself .  from this angle galder couldn   t see the surface very well  but he knew with cold certainty that it would be absolutely accurately modeled .  he could  though  just make out a miniature replica of cori celesti  upon whose utter peak the world   s quarrelsome and somewhat bourgeois gods lived in a palace of marble  alabaster and uncut moquette three piece suites they had chosen to call dunmanifestin .  it was always a considerable annoyance to any disc citizen with pretensions to culture that they were ruled by gods whose idea of an uplifting artistic experience was a musical doorbell .  .   the little embryo universe began to move slowly  tilting     galder tried to shout  but his voice refused to come out .   gently  but with the unstoppable force of an explosion  the shape expanded .   he watched in horror  and then in astonishment  as it passed through him as lightly as a thought .  he held out a hand and watched the pale ghosts of rock strata stream through his fingers in busy silence .   great a   tuin had already sunk peacefully below floor level  larger than a house .   the wizards behind galder were waist deep in seas .  a boat smaller than a thimble caught galder   s eye for a moment before the rush carried it through the walls and away .      to the roof .     he managed  pointing a shaking finger skyward .   those wizards with enough marbles left to think with and enough breath to run followed him  running through continents that sleeted smoothly through the solid stone .      it was a still night  tinted with the promise of dawn .  a crescent moon was just setting .  ankh morpork  largest city in the lands around the circle sea  slept .   that statement is not really true .   on the one hand  those parts of the city which normally concerned themselves with  for example  selling vegetables  shoeing horses  carving exquisite small jade ornaments  changing money and making tables  on the whole  slept .  unless they had insomnia .  or had got up in the night  as it might be  to go to the lavatory .  on the other hand  many of the less law abiding citizens were wide awake and  for instance  climbing through windows that didn   t belong to them  slitting throats  mugging one another  listening to loud music in smoky cellars and generally having a lot more fun .  but most of the animals were asleep  except for the rats .  and the bats  too  of course .  as far as the insects were concerned     the point is that descriptive writing is very rarely entirely accurate and during the reign of olaf quimby ii as patrician of ankh some legislation was passed in a determined attempt to put a stop to this sort of thing and introduce some honesty into reporting .  thus  if a legend said of a notable hero that    all men spoke of his prowess    any bard who valued his life would add hastily    except for a couple of people in his home village who thought he was a liar  and quite a lot of other people who had never really heard of him .     poetic simile was strictly limited to statements like    his mighty steed was as fleet as the wind on a fairly calm day  say about force three     and any loose talk about a beloved having a face that launched a thousand ships would have to be backed by evidence that the object of desire did indeed look like a bottle of champagne .   quimby was eventually killed by a disgruntled poet during an experiment conducted in the palace grounds to prove the disputed accuracy of the proverb    the pen is mightier than the sword     and in his memory it was amended to include the phrase    only if the sword is very small and the pen is very sharp .      so .  approximately sixty seven  maybe sixty eight percent  of the city slept .  not that the other citizens creeping about on their generally unlawful occasions noticed the pale tide streaming through the streets .  only the wizards  used to seeing the invisible  watched it foam across the distant fields .   the disc  being flat  has no real horizon .  any adventurous sailors who got funny ideas from staring at eggs and oranges for too long and set out for the antipodes soon learned that the reason why distant ships sometimes looked as though they were disappearing over the edge of the world was that they were disappearing over the edge of the world .   but there was still a limit even to galder   s vision in the mist swirled  dust filled air .  he looked up .  looming high over the university was the grim and ancient tower of art  said to be the oldest building on the disc  with its famous spiral staircase of eight thousand  eight hundred and eighty eight steps .  from its crenellated roof  the haunt of ravens and disconcertingly alert gargoyles  a wizard might see to the very edge of the disc .  after spending ten minutes or so coughing horribly  of course .      sod that     he muttered .     what   s the good of being a wizard  after all .  avyento  thessalous .  i would fly .  to me  spirits of air and darkness .      he spread a gnarled hand and pointed to a piece of crumbling parapet .  octarine fire sprouted from under his nicotine stained nails and burst against the rotting stone far above .   it fell .  by a finely calculated exchange of velocities galder rose  nightshirt flapping around his bony legs .  higher and higher he soared  hurtling through the pale light like a  like a   all right  like an elderly but powerful wizard being propelled upward by an expertly judged thumb on the scales of the universe .   he landed in a litter of old nests  caught his balance  and stared down at the vertiginous view of a disc dawn .   at this time of the long year the circle sea was almost on the sunset side of cori celesti  and as the daylight sloshed down into the lands around ankh morpork the shadow of the mountain scythed across the landscape like the gnomon of god   s sundial .  but nightward  racing the slow light toward the edge of the world  a line of white mist surged on .   there was a crackling of dry twigs behind him .  he turned to see ymper trymon  second in command of the order  who had been the only other wizard able to keep up .   galder ignored him for the moment  taking care only to keep a firm grip on the stonework and strengthen his personal spells of protection .  promotion was slow in a profession that traditionally bestowed long life  and it was accepted that younger wizards would frequently seek advancement via dead men   s curly shoes  having previously emptied them of their occupants .  besides  there was something disquieting about young trymon .  he didn   t smoke  only drank boiled water  and galder had the nasty suspicion that he was clever .  he didn   t smile often enough  and he liked figures and the sort of organization charts that show lots of squares with arrows pointing to other squares .  in short  he was the sort of man who could use the word    personnel    and mean it .   the whole of the visible disc was now covered with a shimmering white skin that fitted it perfectly .   galder looked down at his own hands and saw them covered with a pale network of shining threads that followed every movement .   he recognized this kind of spell .  he   d used them himself .  but his had been smaller   much smaller .      it   s a change spell     said trymon .     the whole world is being changed .      some people  thought galder grimly  would have had the decency to put an exclamation mark on the end of a statement like that .   there was the faintest of pure sounds  high and sharp  like the breaking of a mouse   s heart .      what was that .     he said .   trymon cocked his head .      c sharp  i think     he said .   galder said nothing .  the white shimmer had vanished  and the first sounds of the waking city began to filter up to the two wizards .  everything seemed exactly the same as it had before .  all that  just to make things stay the same .   he patted his nightshirt pockets distractedly and finally found what he was looking for lodged behind his ear .  he put the soggy dogend in his mouth  called up mystical fire from between his fingers  and dragged hard on the wretched rollup until little blue lights flashed in front of his eyes .  he coughed once or twice .   he was thinking very hard indeed .   he was trying to remember if any gods owed him any favors .      in fact the gods were as puzzled by all this as the wizards were  but they were powerless to do anything and in any case were engaged in an eons old battle with the ice giants  who had refused to return the lawnmower .   but some clue as to what actually had happened might be found in the fact that rincewind  whose past life had just got up to a quite interesting bit when he was fifteen  suddenly found himself not dying after all but hanging upside down in a pine tree .   he got down easily by dropping uncontrollably from branch to branch until he landed on his head in a pile of pine needles  where he lay gasping for breath and wishing he   d been a better person .   somewhere  he knew  there had to be a perfectly logical connection .  one minute one happens to be dying  having dropped off the rim of the world  and the next one is upside down in a tree .   as always happened at times like this  the spell rose up in his mind .   rincewind had been generally reckoned by his tutors to be a natural wizard in the same way that fish are natural mountaineers .  he probably would have been thrown out of unseen university anyway   he couldn   t remember spells and smoking made him feel ill   but what had really caused trouble was all that stupid business about sneaking into the room where the octavo was chained and opening it .   and what made the trouble even worse was that no one could figure out why all the locks had temporarily become unlocked .   the spell wasn   t a demanding lodger .  it just sat there like an old toad at the bottom of a pond .  but whenever rincewind was feeling really tired or very afraid it tried to get itself said .  no one knew what would happen if one of the eight great spells was said by itself  but the general agreement was that the best place from which to watch the effects would be the next universe .   it was a weird thought to have  lying on a heap of pine needles after just falling off the edge of the world  but rincewind had a feeling that the spell wanted to keep him alive .      suits me     he thought .   he sat up and looked at the trees .  rincewind was a city wizard and  although he was aware that there were various differences among types of tree by which their nearest and dearest could tell them apart  the only thing he knew for certain was that the end without the leaves on fitted into the ground .  there were far too many of them  arranged with absolutely no sense of order .  the place hadn   t been swept for ages .   he remembered something about being able to tell where you were by looking at which side of a tree the moss grew on .  these trees had moss everywhere  and wooden warts  and scrabbly old branches  if trees were people  these trees would be sitting in rocking chairs .   rincewind gave the nearest one a kick .  with unerring aim it dropped an acorn on him .  he said    ow .     the tree  in a voice like a very old door swinging open  said     serves you right .      there was a long silence .   then rincewind said     did you say that .         yes .         and that too .         yes .         oh .     he thought for a bit .  then he tried     i suppose you wouldn   t happen to know the way out of the forest  possibly  by any chance .         no .  i don   t get about much     said the tree .      fairly boring life  i imagine     said rincewind .      i wouldn   t know .  i   ve never been anything else     said the tree .   rincewind looked at it closely .  it seemed pretty much like every other tree he   d seen .      are you magical .     he said .      no one   s ever said     said the tree     i suppose so .      rincewind thought  i can   t be talking to a tree .  if i was talking to a tree i   d be mad  and i   m not mad  so trees can   t talk .      goodbye     he said firmly .      hey  don   t go     the tree began  and then realized the hopelessness of it all .  it watched him stagger off through the bushes  and settled down to feeling the sun on its leaves  the slurp and gurgle of the water in its roots  and the very ebb and flow of its sap in response to the natural tug of the sun and moon .  boring  it thought .  what a strange thing to say .  trees can be bored  of course  beetles do it all the time  but i don   t think that was what he was trying to mean .  and  can you actually be anything else .   in fact rincewind never spoke to this particular tree again  but from that brief conversation it spun the basis of the first tree religion which  in time  swept the forests of the world .  its tenet of faith was this  a tree that was a good tree  and led a clean  decent and upstanding life  could be assured of a future life after death .  if it was very good indeed it would eventually be reincarnated as five thousand rolls of lavatory paper .      a few miles away twoflower was also getting over his surprise at finding himself back on the disc .  he was sitting on the hull of the potent voyager as it gurgled gradually under the dark waters of a large lake  surrounded by trees .   strangely enough  he was not particularly worried .  twoflower was a tourist  the first of the species to evolve on the disc  and fundamental to his very existence was the rock hard belief that nothing bad could really happen to him because he was not involved  he also believed that anyone could understand anything he said provided he spoke loudly and slowly  that people were basically trustworthy  and that anything could be sorted out among men of goodwill if they just acted sensibly .   on the face of it this gave him a survival value marginally less than  say  a soap herring  but to rincewind   s amazement it all seemed to work and the little man   s total obliviousness to all forms of danger somehow made danger so discouraged that it gave up and went away .   merely being faced with drowning stood no chance .  twoflower was quite certain that in a well organized society people would not be allowed to go around getting drowned .   he was a little bothered  though  about where his luggage had got to .  but he comforted himself with the knowledge that it was made of sapient pearwood  and ought to be intelligent enough to look after itself        in yet another part of the forest a young shaman was undergoing a very essential part of his training .  he had eaten of the sacred toadstool  he had smoked the holy rhizome  he had carefully powdered up and inserted into various orifices the mystic mushroom and now  sitting cross legged under a pine tree  he was concentrating firstly on making contact with the strange and wonderful secrets at the heart of being but mainly on stopping the top of his head from unscrewing and floating away .   blue four sided triangles pinwheeled across his vision .  occasionally he smiled knowingly at nothing very much and said things like    wow    and    urgh .      there was a movement in the air and what he later described as    like  a sort of explosion only backward  you know .      and suddenly where there had only been nothing there was a large  battered  wooden chest .   it landed heavily on the leafmold  extended dozens of little legs  and turned around ponderously to look at the shaman .  that is to say  it had no face  but even through the mycological haze he was horribly aware that it was looking at him .  and not a nice look  either .  it was amazing how baleful a keyhole and a couple of knotholes could be .   to his intense relief it gave a sort of wooden shrug  and set off through the trees at a canter .   with superhuman effort the shaman recalled the correct sequence of movements for standing up and even managed a couple of steps before he looked down and gave up  having run out of legs .   rincewind  meanwhile  had found a path .  it wound about a good deal  and he would have been happier if it had been cobbled  but following it gave him something to do .   several trees tried to strike up a conversation  but rincewind was nearly certain that this was not normal behavior for trees and ignored them .   the day lengthened .  there was no sound but the murmur of nasty little stinging insects  the occasional crack of a falling branch  and the whispering of the trees discussing religion and the trouble with squirrels .  rincewind began to feel very lonely .  he imagined himself living in the woods forever  sleeping on leaves and eating   and eating   whatever there was to eat in woods .  trees  he supposed  and nuts and berries .  he would have to        rincewind .      there  coming up the path  was twoflower   dripping wet  but beaming with delight .  the luggage trotted along behind him  anything made of the wood would follow its owner anywhere and it was often used to make luggage for the grave goods of very rich dead kings who wanted to be sure of starting a new life in the next world with clean underwear  .   rincewind sighed .  up to now  he   d thought the day couldn   t possibly get worse .      it began to rain a particularly wet and cold rain .  rincewind and twoflower sat under a tree and watched it .      rincewind .         um .         why are we here .         well  some say that the creator of the universe made the disc and everything on it  others say that its all a very complicated story involving the testicles of the sky god and the milk of the celestial cow  and some even hold that we   re all just due to the total random accretion of probability particles .  but if you mean why are we here as opposed to falling off the disc  i haven   t the faintest idea .  it   s probably all some ghastly mistake .         oh .  do you think there   s anything to eat in this forest .         yes     said the wizard bitterly     us .         i   ve got some acorns  if you like     said the tree helpfully .   they sat in damp silence for some moments .      rincewind  the tree said           trees can   t talk     snapped rincewind .     it   s very important to remember that .         but you just heard        rincewind sighed .     look     he said .     it   s all down to simple biology  isn   t it .  if you   re going to talk you need the right equipment  like lungs and lips and  and           vocal cords     said the tree .      yeah  them     said rincewind .  he shut up and stared gloomily at the rain .      i thought wizards knew all about trees and wild food and things     said twoflower reproachfully .  it was very seldom that anything in his voice suggested that he thought of rincewind as anything other than a magnificent enchanter  and the wizard was stung into action .      i do  i do     he snapped .      well  what kind of tree is this .     said the tourist .  rincewind looked up .      beech     he said firmly .      actually       began the tree  and shut up quickly .  it had caught rincewind   s look .      those things up there look like acorns     said twoflower .      yes  well  this is the sessile or heptocarpic variety     said rincewind .     the nuts look very much like acorns  in fact .  they can fool practically anybody .         gosh     said twoflower  and     what   s that bush over there  then .         mistletoe .         but it   s got thorns and red berries .         well .     said rincewind sternly  and stared hard at him .  twoflower broke first .      nothing     he said meekly .     i must have been misinformed .         right .         but there   s some big mushrooms under it .  can you eat them .      rincewind looked at them cautiously .  they were  indeed  very big  and had red and white spotted caps .  they were in fact a variety that the local shaman  who at this point was some miles away  making friends with a rock  would only eat after first attaching one leg to a large stone with a rope .  there was nothing for it but to go out in the rain and look at them .   he knelt down in the leafmold and peered under the cap .  after a while he said weakly     no  no good to eat at all .         why .     called twoflower .     are the gills the wrong shade of yellow .         no  not really           i expect the stems haven   t got the right kind of fluting  then .         they look okay  actually .         the cap  then  i expect the cap is the wrong color     said twoflower .      not sure about that .         well then  why can   t you eat them .      rincewind coughed .     it   s the little doors and windows     he said wretchedly     it   s a dead giveaway .      thunder rolled across unseen university .  rain poured over its roofs and gurgled out of its gargoyles  although one or two of the more cunning ones had scuttled off to shelter among the maze of tiles .   far below  in the great hall  the eight most powerful wizards on the discworld gathered at the angles of a ceremonial octogram .  actually they probably weren   t the most powerful  if the truth were known  but they certainly had great powers of survival which  in the highly competitive world of magic  was pretty much the same thing .  behind every wizard of the eighth rank were half a dozen seventh rank wizards trying to bump him off  and senior wizards had to develop an inquiring attitude to  for example  scorpions in their bed .  an ancient proverb summed it up  when a wizard is tired of looking for broken glass in his dinner  it ran  he is tired of life .   the oldest wizard  greyhald spold of the ancient and truly original sages of the unbroken circle  leaned heavily on his carven staff and spake thusly      get on with it  weatherwax  my feet are giving me gyp .      galder  who had merely paused for effect  glared at him .      very well  then  i will be brief           jolly good .         we all sought guidance as to the events of this morning .  can anyone among us say he received it .      the wizards looked sidelong at one another .  nowhere outside a trades union conference fraternal benefit night can so much mutual distrust and suspicion be found as among a gathering of senior enchanters .  but the plain fact was that the day had gone very badly .  normally informative demons  summoned abruptly from the dungeon dimensions  had looked sheepish and sidled away when questioned .  magic mirrors had cracked .  tarot cards had mysteriously become blank .  crystal balls had gone all cloudy .  even tea leaves  normally scorned by wizards as frivolous and unworthy of contemplation  had clustered together at the bottom of cups and refused to move .   in short  the assembled wizards were at a loss .  there was a general murmur of agreement .      and therefore i propose that we perform the rite of ashkente     said galder dramatically .   he had to admit that he had hoped for a better response  something on the lines of  well     no  not the rite of ashkente .  man was not meant to meddle with such things .      in fact there was a general mutter of approval .      good idea .         seems reasonable .         get on with it  then .      slightly put out  he summoned a procession of lesser wizards who carried various magical implements into the hall .   it has already been hinted that around this time there was some disagreement among the fraternity of wizards about how to practice magic .   younger wizards in particular went about saying that it was time that magic started to update its image and that they should all stop mucking about with bits of wax and bone and put the whole thing on a properly organized basis  with research programs and three day conventions in good hotels where they could read papers with titles like    whither geomancy .     and    the role of seven league boots in a caring society .      trymon  for example  hardly ever did any magic these days but ran the order with hourglass efficiency and wrote lots of memos and had a big chart on his office wall  covered with colored blobs and flags and lines that no one else really understood but which looked very impressive .   the other type of wizard thought all this was so much marsh gas and wouldn   t have anything to do with an image unless it was made of wax and had pins stuck in it .   the heads of the eight orders were all of this persuasion  traditionalists to a mage  and the utensils that were heaped around the octogram had a definite  no nonsense occult look about them .  rams horns  skulls  baroque metalwork and heavy candles were much in evidence  despite the discovery by younger wizards that the rite of ashkente could perfectly well be performed with three small bits of wood and   cc of mouse blood .   the preparations normally took several hours  but the combined powers of the senior wizards shortened it considerably and  after a mere forty minutes  galder chanted the final words of the spell .  they hung in front of him for a moment before dissolving .   the air in the center of the octogram shimmered and thickened  and suddenly contained a tall  dark figure .  most of it was hidden by a black robe and hood and this was probably just as well .  it held a long scythe in one hand and one couldn   t help noticing that what should have been fingers were simply white bone .   the other skeletal hand held small cubes of cheese and pineapple on a stick .      well .     said death  in a voice with all the warmth and color of an iceberg .  he caught the wizards    gaze  and glanced down at the stick .   i was at a party  he added  a shade reproachfully .      o creature of earth and darkness  we do charge thee to abjure from       began galder in a firm  commanding voice .  death nodded .   yes  yes  i know all that  he said .  why have you summoned me .      it is said that you can see both the past and future  said galder a little sulkily  because the big speech of binding and conjuration was one he rather liked and people had said he was very good at it .   that is absolutely correct .      then perhaps you can tell us what exactly it was that happened this morning .     said galder .  he pulled himself together  and added loudly     i command this by azimrothe  by t   chikel  by        all right  you   ve made your point  said death .  what precisely was it you wished to know .  quite a lot of things happened this morning  people were born  people died  all the trees grew a bit taller  ripples made interesting patterns on the sea        i mean about the octavo     said galder coldly .   that .  oh  that was just a readjustment of reality .  i understand the octavo was anxious not to lose the eighth spell .  it was dropping off the disc  apparently .      hold on  hold on     said galder .  he scratched his chin .     are we talking about the one inside the head of rincewind .  tall thin man  bit scraggy .  the one           that he has been carrying around all these years  yes .   galder frowned .  it seemed a lot of trouble to go to .  everyone knew that when a wizard died all the spells in his head would go free  so why bother to save rincewind .  the spell would just float back eventually .      any idea why .     he said without thinking and then  remembering himself in time  added hastily     by yrriph and kcharla i do abjure thee and        i wish you wouldn   t keep doing that  said death  all that i know is that all the spells have to be said together next hogswatchnight or the disc will be destroyed .      speak up there .     demanded greyhald spold .      shut up .     said galder .   me .      no  him .  daft old           i heard that .     snapped spold     you young people       he stopped .  death was looking at him thoughtfully  as if he was trying to remember his face .      look     said galder     just repeat that bit again  will you .  the disc will be what .      destroyed  said death .  can i go now .  i left my drink .      hang on     said galder hurriedly .     by cheliliki and orizone and so forth  what do you mean  destroyed .      it   s an ancient prophecy written on the inner walls of the great pyramid of tsort .  the word    destroyed    seems quite self explantory to me .      that   s all you can tell us .      yes .      but hogswatchnight is only two months away .      yes .      at least you can tell us where rincewind is now .      death shrugged .  it was a gesture he was particularly well built for .   the forest of skund  rimward of the ramtop mountains .      what is he doing there .      feeling very sorry for himself .      oh .      now may i go .   galder nodded distractedly .  he had been thinking wistfully of the banishment ritual  which started    begone  foul shade    and had some rather impressive passages which he had been practicing  but somehow he couldn   t work up any enthusiasm .      oh  yes     he said .     thank you  yes .     and then  because it   s as well not to make enemies even among the creatures of night  he added politely     i hope it is a good party .      death didn   t answer .  he was looking at spold in the same way that a dog looks at a bone  only in this case things were more or less the other way around .      i said i hope it is a good party     said galder  loudly .   at the moment it is  said death levelly .  i think it might go downhill very quickly at midnight .      why .      that   s when they think i   ll be taking my mask off .   he vanished  leaving only a cocktail stick and a short paper streamer behind .      there had been an unseen observer of all this .  it was of course entirely against the rules  but trymon knew all about rules and had always considered they were for making  not obeying .   long before the eight mages had got down to some serious arguing about what the apparition had meant he was down in the main levels of the university library .   it was an awe inspiring place .  many of the books were magical  and the important thing to remember about grimoires is that they are deadly in the hands of any librarian who cares about order  because he   s bound to stick them all on the same shelf .  this is not a good idea with books that tend to leak magic  because more than one or two of them together form a critical black mass .  on top of that  many of the lesser spells are quite particular about the company they keep  and tend to express any objections by hurling their books viciously across the room .  and  of course  there is always the half felt presence of the things from the dungeon dimensions  clustering around the magical leakage and constantly probing the walls of reality .   the job of magical librarian  who has to spend his working days in this sort of highly charged atmosphere  is a high risk occupation .   the head librarian was sitting on top of his desk  quietly peeling a orange  and was well aware of that .   he glanced up when trymon entered .      i   m looking for anything we   ve got on the pyramid of tshut     said trymon .  he had come prepared  he took a banana out of his pocket .   the librarian looked at it mournfully  and then flopped down heavily on the floor .  trymon found a soft hand poked gently into his and the librarian led the way  waddling sadly between the bookshelves .  it was like holding a little leather glove .   around them the books sizzled and sparked  with the occasional discharge of undirected magic flashing over to the carefully placed earthing rods nailed to the shelves .  there was a tinny  blue smell and  just at the very limit of hearing  the horrible chittering of the dungeon creatures .   like many other parts of unseen university the library occupied rather more space than its outside dimensions would suggest  because magic distorts space in strange ways  and it was probably the only library in the universe with mobius shelves .  but the librarian   s mental catalogue was ticking over perfectly .  he stopped by a soaring stack of musty books and swung himself up into the darkness .  there was the sound of rustling paper  and a cloud of dust floated down to trymon .  then the librarian was back  a slim volume in his hands .      oook     he said .   trymon took it gingerly .   the cover was scratched and very dog eared  the gold of its lettering had long ago curled off  but he could just make out  in the old magic tongue of the tsort valley  the words  lyt gryet teymple hyte tsort  y hiystory myistical .      oook .     said the librarian  anxiously .   trymon turned the pages cautiously .  he wasn   t very good at languages  he   d always found them highly inefficient things which by rights ought to be replaced by some sort of easily understood numerical system  but this seemed exactly what he was looking for .  there were whole pages covered with meaningful hieroglyphs .      is this the only book you   ve got about the pyramid of tsort .     he said slowly .      oook .         you   re quite sure .         oook .      trymon listened .  he could hear  a long way off  the sound of approaching feet and arguing voices .  but he had been prepared for that  too .   he reached into a pocket .      would you like another banana .     he said .      the forest of skund was indeed enchanted  which was nothing unusual on the disc  and was also the only forest in the whole universe to be called   in the local language   your finger you fool  which was the literal meaning of the word skund .   the reason for this is regrettably all too common .  when the first explorers from the warm lands around the circle sea traveled into the chilly hinterland they filled in the blank spaces on their maps by grabbing the nearest native  pointing at some distant landmark  speaking very clearly in a loud voice  and writing down whatever the bemused man told them .  thus were immortalized in generations of atlases such geographical oddities as just a mountain  i don   t know  what .  and  of course  your finger you fool .   rainclouds clustered around the bald heights of mt .  oolskunrahod     who is this fool who does not know what a mountain is     and the luggage settled itself more comfortably under a dripping tree  which tried unsuccessfully to strike up a conversation .   twoflower and rincewind were arguing .  the person they were arguing about sat on his mushroom and watched them with interest .  he looked like someone who smelled like someone who lived in a mushroom  and that bothered twoflower .      well  why hasn   t he got a red hat .      rincewind hesitated  desperately trying to imagine what twoflower was getting at .      what .     he said  giving in .      he should have a red hat     said twoflower .     and he certainly ought to be cleaner and more  more sort of jolly .  he doesn   t look like any sort of gnome to me .         what are you going on about .         look at that beard     said twoflower sternly .     i   ve seen better beards on a piece of cheese .         look  he   s six inches high and lives in a mushroom     snarled rincewind .     of course he   s a bloody gnome .         we   ve only got his word for it .      rincewind looked down at the gnome .      excuse me     he said .  he took twoflower to the other side of the clearing .      listen     he said between his teeth .     if he was fifteen feet tall and said he was a giant we   d only have his word for that too  wouldn   t we .         he could be a goblin     said twoflower defiantly .   rincewind looked back at the tiny figure  which was industriously picking its nose .      well .     he said .     so what .  gnome  goblin  pixie   so what .         not a pixie     said twoflower firmly .     pixies  they wear these sort of green combinations and they have pointy caps and little knobbly antenna thingies sticking out of their heads .  i   ve seen pictures .         where .      twoflower hesitated  and looked at his feet .     i think it was called the    mutter  mutter  mutter .            the what .  called the what .      the little man took a sudden interest in the backs of his hands .      the little folks    book of flower fairies     he muttered .   rincewind looked blank .      it   s a book on how to avoid them .     he said .      oh no     said twoflower hurriedly .     it tells you where to look for them .  i can remember the pictures now .     a dreamy look came over his face  and rincewind groaned inwardly .     there was even a special fairy that came and took your teeth away .         what  came and pulled out your actual teeth    .         no  no  you   re wrong  i mean after they   d fallen out  what you did was  you put the tooth under your pillow and the fairy came and took it away and left a rhinu piece .         why .         why what .         why did it collect teeth .         it just did .      rincewind formed a mental picture of some strange entity living in a castle made of teeth .  it was the kind of mental picture you tried to forget .  unsuccessfully .      urgh     he said .   red hats .  he wondered whether to enlighten the tourist about what life was really like when a frog was a good meal  a rabbit hole a useful place to shelter out of the rain  and an owl a drifting  silent terror in the night .  moleskin trousers sounded quaint unless you personally had to remove them from their original owner when the vicious little sod was cornered in his burrow .  as for red hats  anyone who went around a forest looking bright and conspicuous would only do so very  very briefly .   he wanted to say  look  the life of gnomes and goblins is nasty  brutish and short .  so are they .   he wanted to say all this  and couldn   t .  for a man with an itch to see the whole of infinity  twoflower never actually moved outside his own head .  telling him the truth would be like kicking a spaniel .      swee whee weedle wheet     said a voice by his foot .  he looked down .  the gnome  who had introduced himself as swires  looked up .  rincewind had a very good ear for languages .  the gnome had just said     i   ve got some newt sorbet left over from yesterday .         sounds wonderful     said rincewind .   swires gave him another prod in the ankle .      the other bigger  is he all right .     he said solicitously .      he   s just suffering from reality shock     said rincewind .     you haven   t got a red hat  by any chance .         wheet .         just a thought .         i know where there   s some food for biggers     said the gnome     and shelter  too .  it   s not far .      rincewind looked at the lowering sky .  the daylight was draining out of the landscape and the clouds looked as if they had heard about snow and were considering the idea .  of course  people who lived in mushrooms couldn   t necessarily be trusted  but right now a trap baited with a hot meal and clean sheets would have had the wizard hammering to get in .   they set off .  after a few seconds the luggage got carefully to its feet and started to follow .      psst .      it turned carefully  little legs moving in a complicated pattern  and appeared to look up .      is it good  being joinery .     said the tree  anxiously .     did it hurt .      the luggage seemed to think about this .  every brass handle  every knothole  radiated extreme concentration .   then it shrugged its lid and waddled away .   the tree sighed  and shook a few dead leaves out of its twigs .      the cottage was small  tumbledown and as ornate as a doily .  some mad whittler had got to work on it  rincewind decided  and had created terrible havoc before he could be dragged away .  every door  every shutter had its clusters of wooden grapes and half moon cutouts  and there were massed outbreaks of fretwork pinecones all over the walls .  he half expected a giant cuckoo to come hurtling out of an upper window .   what he also noticed was the characteristic greasy feel in the air .  tiny green and purple sparks flashed from his fingernails .      strong magical field     he muttered .     a hundred millithaums  at least .         there   s magic all over the place     said swires .     an old witch used to live around here .  she went a long time ago but the magic still keeps the house going .         here  there   s something odd about that door     said twoflower .      why should a house need magic to keep it going .     said rincewind .  twoflower touched a wall gingerly .      it   s all sticky .         nougat     said swires .      good grief .  a real gingerbread cottage .  rincewind  a real        rincewind nodded glumly .     yeah  the confectionary school of architecture     he said .     it never caught on .      he looked suspiciously at the licorice doorknocker .      it sort of regenerates     said swires .     marvelous  really .  you just don   t get this sort of place nowadays  you just can   t get the gingerbread .         really .     said rincewind  gloomily .      come on in     said the gnome     but mind the doormat .         why .         candyfloss .         the great disc spun slowly under its toiling sun  and daylight pooled in hollows and finally drained away as night fell .   in his chilly room in unseen university trymon pored over the book  his lips moving as his finger traced the unfamiliar  ancient script .  he read that the great pyramid of tsort  now long vanished  was made of one million  three thousand and ten limestone blocks .  he read that ten thousand slaves had been worked to death in its building .  he learned that it was a maze of secret passages  their walls reputedly decorated with the distilled wisdom of ancient tsort .  he read that its height plus its length divided by half its width equaled exactly   .        or precisely       .          times the difference between the distance to the sun and the weight of a small orange .  he learned that sixty years had been devoted entirely to its construction .   it all seemed  he thought  to be rather a lot of trouble to go to just to sharpen a razor blade .   and in the forest of skund twoflower and rincewind settled down to a meal of gingerbread mantelpiece and thought longingly of pickled onions .   and far away  but set as it were on a collision course  the greatest hero the disc ever produced rolled himself a cigarette  entirely unaware of the role that lay in store for him .   it was quite an interesting tailormade that he twirled expertly between his fingers because  like many of the wandering wizards from whom he had picked up the art  he was in the habit of saving dogends in a leather bag and rolling them into fresh smokes .  the implacable law of averages therefore dictated that some of that tobacco had been smoked almost continuously for many years now .  the thing he was trying unsuccessfully to light was  well  you could have coated roads with it .   so great was the reputation of this person that a group of nomadic barbarian horsemen had respectfully invited him to join them as they sat around a horseturd fire .  the nomads of the hub regions usually migrated rimward for the winter  and these were part of a tribe who had pitched their felt tents in the sweltering heat wave of a mere    degrees and were going around with peeling noses and complaining about heatstroke .   the barbarian chieftain said     what then are the greatest things that a man may find in life .     this is the sort of thing you   re supposed to say to maintain steppecred in barbarian circles .   the man on his right thoughtfully drank his cocktail of mare   s milk and snowcat blood  and spoke thus     the crisp horizon of the steppe  the wind in your hair  a fresh horse under you .      the man on his left said     the cry of the white eagle in the heights  the fall of snow in the forest  a true arrow in your bow .      the chieftain nodded  and said     surely it is the sight of your enemy slain  the humiliation of his tribe and the lamentation of his women .      there was a general murmur of whiskery approval at this outrageous display .   then the chieftain turned respectfully to his guest  a small figure carefully warming his chilblains by the fire  and said     but our guest  whose name is legend  must tell us truly  what is it that a man may call the greatest things in life .      the guest paused in the middle of another unsuccessful attempt to light up .      what shay .     he said  toothlessly .      i said  what is it that a man may call the greatest things in life .      the warriors leaned closer .  this should be worth hearing .   the guest thought long and hard and then said  with deliberation     hot water  good dentishtry and shoft lavatory paper .         brilliant octarine light flared in the forge .  galder weatherwax  stripped to the waist  his face hidden by a mask of smoked glass  squinted into the glow and brought a hammer down with surgical precision .  the magic squealed and writhed in the tongs but still he worked it  drawing it into a line of agonized fire .   a floorboard creaked .  galder had spent many hours tuning them  always a wise precaution with an ambitious assistant who walked like a cat .   d flat .  that meant he was just to the right of the door .      ah  trymon     he said  without turning  and noted with some satisfaction the faint indrawing of breath behind him .     good of you to come .  shut the door  will you .      trymon pushed the heavy door  his face expressionless .  on the high shelf above him various bottled impossibilities wallowed in their pickle jars and watched him with interest .   like all wizards    workshops  the place looked as though a taxidermist had dropped his stock in a foundry and then had a fight with a maddened glass blower  braining a passing crocodile in the process  it hung from the ceiling and smelled strongly of camphor  .  there were lamps and rings that trymon itched to rub  and mirrors that looked as though they could repay a second glance .  a pair of seven league boots stirred restlessly in a cage .  a whole library of grimoires  not of course as powerful as the octavo but still heavy with spells  creaked and rattled their chains as they sensed the wizard   s covetous glance on them .  the naked power of it all stirred him as nothing else could  but he deplored the scruffiness and galder   s sense of theater .   for example  he happened to know that the green liquid bubbling mysteriously through a maze of contorted pipework on one of the benches was just green dye with soap in it  because he   d bribed one of the servants .   one day  he thought  it   s all going to go .  starting with that bloody alligator .  his knuckles whitened        well  now     said galder cheerfully  hanging up his apron and sitting back in his chair with the lion paw arms and duck legs     you sent me this memmy thing .      trymon shrugged .     memo .  i merely pointed out  lord  that the other orders have all sent agents to skund forest to recapture the spell  while you do nothing     he said .     no doubt you will reveal your reasons in good time .         your faith shames me     said galder .      the wizard who captures the spell will bring great honor on himself and his order     said trymon .     the others have used boots and all manner of elsewhere spells .  what do you propose using  master .         did i detect a hint of sarcasm there .         absolutely not  master .         not even a smidgeon .         not even the merest smidgeon  master .         good .  because i don   t propose to go .     galder reached down and picked up an ancient book .  he mumbled a command and it creaked open  a bookmark suspiciously like a tongue flicked back into the binding .   he fumbled down beside his cushion and produced a little leather bag of tobacco and a pipe the size of an incinerator .  with all the skill of a terminal nicotine addict he rubbed a nut of tobacco between his hands and tamped it into the bowl .  he snapped his fingers and fire flared .  he sucked deep  sighed with satisfaction        looked up .      still here  trymon .         you summoned me  master     said trymon levelly .  at least  that   s what his voice said .  deep in his gray eyes was the faintest glitter that said he had a list of every slight  every patronizing twinkle  every gentle reproof  every knowing glance  and for every single one galder   s living brain was going to spend a year in acid .      oh  yes  so i did .  humor the deficiencies of an old man     said galder pleasantly .  he held up the book he had been reading .      i don   t hold with all this running about     he said .     it   s all very dramatic  mucking about with magic carpets and the like  but it isn   t true magic to my mind .  take seven league boots  now .  if men were meant to walk twenty one miles at a step i am sure god would have given us longer legs   where was i .         i am not sure     said trymon coldly .      ah  yes .  strange that we could find nothing about the pyramid of tsort in the library  you would have thought there   d be something  wouldn   t you .         the librarian will be disciplined  of course .      galder looked sideways at him .     nothing drastic     he said .     withold his bananas  perhaps .      they looked at each other for a moment .   galder broke off first   looking hard at trymon always bothered him .  it had the same disconcerting effect as gazing into a mirror and seeing no one there .      anyway     he said     strangely enough  i found assistance elsewhere .  in my own modest bookshelves  in fact .  the journal of skrelt changebasket  the founder of our order .  you  my keen young man who would rush off so soon  do you know what happens when a wizard dies .         any spells he has memorized say themselves     said trymon .     it is one of the first things we learn .         in fact it is not true of the original eight great spells .  by dint of close study skrelt learned that a great spell will simply take refuge in the nearest mind open and ready to receive it .  just push the big mirror over here  will you .      galder got to his feet and shuffled across to the forge  which was now cold .  the strand of magic still writhed  though  at once present and not present  like a slit cut into another universe full of hot blue light .  he picked it up easily  took a longbow from a rack  said a word of power  and watched with satisfaction as the magic grasped the ends of the bow and then tightened until the wood creaked .  then he selected an arrow .   trymon had tugged a heavy  full length mirror into the middle of the floor .  when i am head of the order  he told himself  i certainly won   t shuffle around in carpet slippers .   trymon  as mentioned earlier  felt that a lot could be done by fresh blood if only the dead wood could be removed   but  just for the moment  he was genuinely interested in seeing what the old fool would do next .   he may have derived some satisfaction if he had known that galder and skrelt changebasket were both absolutely wrong .   galder made a few passes in front of the glass  which clouded over and then cleared to show an aerial view of the forest of skund .  he looked at it intently while holding the bow with the arrow pointing vaguely at the ceiling .  he muttered a few words like    allow for wind speed of  say  three knots    and    adjust for temperature    and then  with a rather disappointing movement  released the arrow .   if the laws of action and reaction had anything to do with it  it should have flopped to the ground a few feet away .  but no one was listening to them .   with a sound that defies description  but which for the sake of completeness can be thought of basically as    spang .     plus three days hard work in any decently equipped radiophonic workshop  the arrow vanished .   galder threw the bow aside and grinned .      of course  it   ll take about an hour to get there     he said .     then the spell will simply follow the ionized path back here .  to me .         remarkable     said trymon  but any passing telepath would have read in letters ten yards high  if you  then why not me .  he looked down at the cluttered workbench  when a long and very sharp knife looked tailor made for what he suddenly had in mind .   violence was not something he liked to be involved in except at one remove .  but the pyramid of tsort had been quite clear about the rewards for whoever brought all eight spells together at the right time  and trymon was not about to let years of painstaking work go for nothing because some old fool had a bright idea .      would you like some cocoa while we   re waiting .     said galder  hobbling across the room to the servants    bell .      certainly     said trymon .  he picked up the knife  weighing it for balance and accuracy .     i must congratulate you  master .  i can see that we must all get up very early in the morning to get the better of you .      galder laughed .  and the knife left trymon   s hand at such speed that  because of the somewhat sluggish nature of disc light  it actually grew a bit shorter and a little more massive as it plunged  with unerring aim  toward galder   s neck .   it didn   t reach it .  instead  it swerved to one side and began a fast orbit   so fast that galder appeared suddenly to be wearing a metal collar .  he turned around  and to trymon it seemed that he had suddenly grown several feet taller and much more powerful .   the knife broke away and shuddered into the door a mere shadow   s depth from trymon   s ear .      early in the morning .     said galder pleasantly .     my dear lad  you will need to stay up all night .            have a bit more table     said rincewind .      no thanks  i don   t like marzipan     said twoflower .     anyway  i   m sure it   s not right to eat other people   s furniture .         don   t worry     said swires .     the old witch hasn   t been seen for years .  they say she was done up good and proper by a couple of young tearaways .         kids of today     commented rincewind .      i blame the parents     said twoflower .   once you had made the necessary mental adjustments  the gingerbread cottage was quite a pleasant place .  residual magic kept it standing and it was shunned by such local wild animals who hadn   t already died of terminal tooth decay .  a bright fire of licorice logs burned rather messily in the fireplace  rincewind had tried gathering wood outside  but had given up .  it   s hard to burn wood that talks to you .   he belched .      this isn   t very healthy     he said .     i mean  why sweets .  why not crispbread and cheese .  or salami  now   i could just do with a nice salami sofa .         search me     said swires .     old granny whitlow just did sweets .  you should have seen her meringues           i have     said rincewind     i looked at the mattresses           gingerbread is more traditional     said twoflower .      what  for mattresses .         don   t be silly     said twoflower reasonably .     whoever heard of a gingerbread mattress .      rincewind grunted .  he was thinking of food   more accurately  of food in ankh morpork .  funny how the old place seemed more attractive the farther he got from it .  he only had to close his eyes to picture  in dribbling detail  the food stalls of a hundred different cultures in the market places .  you could eat squishi or shark   s fin soup so fresh that swimmers wouldn   t go near it  and        do you think i could buy this place .     said twoflower .  rincewind hesitated .  he   d found it always paid to think very carefully before answering twoflower   s more surprising questions .      what for .     he said  cautiously .      well  it just reeks of ambience .         oh .         what   s ambience .     said swires  sniffing cautiously and wearing the kind of expression that said that he hadn   t done it  whatever it was .      i think it   s a kind of frog     said rincewind .     anyway  you can   t buy this place because there isn   t anyone to buy it from           i think i could probably arrange that  on behalf of the forest council of course     interrupted swires  trying to avoid rincewind   s glare .         and anyway you couldn   t take it with you  i mean  you could hardly pack it in the luggage  could you .     rincewind indicated the luggage  which was lying by the fire and managing in some quite impossible way to look like a contented but alert tiger  and then looked back at twoflower .  his face fell .      could you .     he repeated .   he had never quite come to terms with the fact that the inside of the luggage didn   t seem to inhabit quite the same world as the outside .  of course  this was simply a byproduct of its essential weirdness  but it was disconcerting to see twoflower fill it full of dirty shirts and old socks and then open the lid again on a pile of nice crisp laundry  smelling faintly of lavender .  twoflower also bought a lot of quaint native artifacts or  as rincewind would put it  junk  and even a seven foot ceremonial pig tickling pole seemed to fit inside quite easily without sticking out anywhere .      i don   t know     said twoflower .     you   re a wizard  you know about these things .         yes  well  of course  but baggage magic is a highly specialized art     said rincewind .     anyway  i   m sure the gnomes wouldn   t really want to sell it  it   s  it   s       he groped through what he knew of twoflower   s mad vocabulary      it   s a tourist attraction .         what   s that .     said swires  interestedly .      it means that lots of people like him will come and look at it     said rincewind .      why .         because       rincewind groped for words       it   s quaint .  um  oldey worldey .  folkloresque .  er  a delightful example of a vanished folk art  steeped in the traditions of an age long gone .         it is .     said swires  looking at the cottage in bewilderment .      yes .         all that .            fraid so .         i   ll help you pack .      and the night wears on  under a blanket of lowering clouds which covers most of the disc   which is fortuitous  because when it clears and the astrologers get a good view of the sky they are going to get angry and upset .   and in various parts of the forest parties of wizards are getting lost  and going around in circles  and hiding from each other  and getting upset because whenever they bump into a tree it apologizes to them .  but  unsteadily though it may be  many of them are getting quite close to the cottage     which is a good time to get back to the rambling buildings of unseen university and in particular the apartments of greyhald spold  currently the oldest wizard on the disc and determined to keep it that way .   he has just been extremely surprised and upset .   for the last few hours he has been very busy .  he may be deaf and a little hard of thinking  but elderly wizards have very well trained survival instincts  and they know that when a tall figure in a black robe and the latest in agricultural hand tools starts looking thoughtfully at you it is time to act fast .  the servants have been dismissed .  the doorways have been sealed with a paste made from powdered mayflies  and protective octograms have been drawn on the windows .  rare and rather smelly oils have been poured in complex patterns on the floor  in designs which hurt the eyes and suggest the designer was drunk or from some other dimension or  possibly  both  in the very center of the room is the eightfold octogram of witholding  surrounded by red and green candles .  and in the center of that is a box made from wood of the curlyfern pine  which grows to a great age  and it is lined with red silk and yet more protective amulets .  because greyhald spold knows that death is looking for him  and has spent many years designing an impregnable hiding place .   he has just set the complicated clockwork of the lock and shut the lid  lying back in the knowledge that here at last is the perfect defense against the most ultimate of all his enemies  although as yet he has not considered the important part that airholes must play in an enterprise of this kind .   and right beside him  very close to his ear  a voice has just said  dark in here  isn   t it .      it began to snow .  the barleysugar windows of the cottage showed bright and cheerful against the blackness .   at one side of the clearing three tiny red points of light glowed momentarily and there was the sound of a chesty cough  abruptly silenced .      shut up .     hissed a third rank wizard .     they   ll hear us .         who will .  we gave the lads from the brotherhood of the hoodwink the slip in the swamp  and those idiots from the venerable council of seers went off the wrong way anyway .         yeah     said the most junior wizard     but who keeps talking to us .  they say this is a magic wood  it   s full of goblins and wolves and           trees     said a voice out of the darkness  high above .  it possessed what can only be described as timbre .      yeah     said the youngest wizard .  he sucked on his dogend  and shivered .   the leader of the party peered over the rock and watched the cottage .      right then     he said  knocking out his pipe on the heel of his seven league boot  who squeaked in protest .     we rush in  we grab them  we   re away .  okay .         you sure it   s just people .     said the youngest wizard nervously .      of course i   m sure     snarled the leader .     what do you expect  three bears .         there could be monsters .  this is the sort of wood that has monsters .         and trees     said a friendly voice from the branches .      yeah     said the leader  cautiously .      rincewind looked carefully at the bed .  it was quite a nice little bed  in a sort of hard toffee inlaid with caramel  but he   d rather eat it than sleep in it and it looked as though someone already had .      someone   s been eating my bed     he said .      i like toffee     said twoflower defensively .      if you don   t watch out the fairy will come and take all your teeth away     said rincewind .      no  that   s elves     said swires from the dressing table .     elves do that .  toenails  too .  very touchy at times  elves can be .      twoflower sat down heavily on his bed .      you   ve got it wrong     he said .     elves are noble and beautiful and wise and fair  i   m sure i read that somewhere .      swires and rincewind   s kneecap exchanged glances .      i think you must be thinking about different elves     the gnome said slowly .     we   ve just got the other sort around here .  not that you could call them quick tempered     he added hastily .     not if you didn   t want to take your teeth home in your hat  anyway .      there was the tiny  distinctive sound of a nougat door opening .  at the same time  from the other side of the cottage  came the faintest of tinkles  like a rock smashing a barleysugar window as delicately as possible .      what was that .     said twoflower .      which one .     said rincewind .   there was the clonk of a heavy branch banging against the windowsill .  with a cry of    elves .     swires scuttled across the floor to a mouse hole and vanished .      what shall we do .     said twoflower .      panic .     said rincewind hopefully .  he always held that panic was the best means of survival  back in the olden days  his theory went  people faced with hungry saber toothed tigers could be divided very simply into those who panicked and those who stood there saying    what a magnificent brute .     and    here  pussy .         there   s a cupboard     said twoflower  pointing to a narrow door that was squeezed between the wall and the chimneybreast .  they scrambled into sweet  musty darkness .   there was the creak of a chocolate floorboard outside .  someone said    i heard voices .      someone else said     yeah  downstairs .  i think it   s the hoodwinkers .         i thought you said we   d given them the slip .         hey  you two  you can eat this place .  here  look you can           shut up .      there was a lot more creaking  and a muffled scream from downstairs where a venerable seer  creeping carefully through the darkness from the broken window  had trodden on the fingers of a hoodwinker who was hiding under the table .  there was the sudden zip and zing of magic .      bugger .     said a voice outside .     they   ve got him .  let   s go .      there was more creaking  and then silence .  after a while twoflower said     rincewind  i think there   s a broomstick in this cupboard .         well  what   s so unusual about that .         this one   s got handlebars .      there was a piercing shriek from below .  in the darkness a wizard had tried to open the luggage   s lid .  a crash from the scullery indicated the sudden arrival of a party of illuminated mages of the unbroken circle .      what do you think they   re after .     whispered twoflower .      i don   t know  but i think it might be a good idea not to find out     said rincewind thoughtfully .      you could be right .      rincewind pushed open the door gingerly .  the room was empty .  he tiptoed across to the window  and looked down into the upturned faces of three brothers of the order of midnight .      that   s him .      he drew back hurriedly and rushed for the stairs .   the scene below was indescribable but since that statement would earn the death penalty in the reign of olaf quimby ii the attempt better be made .  firstly  most of the struggling wizards were trying to illuminate the scene by various flames  fireballs and magical glows  so the overall lighting gave the impression of a disco in a strobe light factory  each man was trying to find a position from which he could see the rest of the room without being attacked himself  and absolutely everyone was trying to keep out of the way of the luggage  which had two venerable seers pinned in a corner and was snapping its lid at anyone who approached .  but one wizard did happen to look up .      it   s him .      rincewind jerked back  and something bumped into him .  he looked around hurriedly  and stared when he saw twoflower sitting on the broomstick   which was floating in midair .      the witch must have left it behind .     said twoflower .     a genuine magic broomstick .      rincewind hesitated .  octarine sparks were spitting off the broomstick   s bristles and he hated heights almost more than anything else  but what he really hated more than anything at all was a dozen very angry and bad tempered wizards rushing up the stairs toward him  and this was happening .      all right     he said     but i   ll drive .      he lashed out with a boot at a wizard who was halfway through a spell of binding and jumped onto the broomstick  which bobbed down the stairwell and then turned upside down so that rincewind was horribly eye to eye with a brother of midnight .   he yelped and gave the handlebars a convulsive twist .   several things happened at once .  the broomstick shot forward and broke through the wall in a shower of crumbs  the luggage surged forward and bit the brother in the leg  and with a strange whistling sound an arrow appeared from nowhere  missed rincewind by inches  and struck the luggage   s lid with a very solid thud .   the luggage vanished .      in a little village deep in the forest an ancient shaman threw a few more twigs on his fire and stared through the smoke at his shamefaced apprentice .      a box with legs on .     he said .      yes  master .  it just appeared out of the sky and looked at me     said the apprentice .      it had eyes then  this box .         n       began the apprentice and stopped  puzzled .  the old man frowned .      many have seen topaxci  god of the red mushroom  and they earn the name of shaman     he said .     some have seen skelde  spirit of the smoke  and they are called sorcerers .  a few have been privileged to see umcherrel  the soul of the forest  and they are known as spirit masters .  but none have seen a box with hundreds of legs that looked at them without eyes  and they are known as idio        the interruption was caused by a sudden screaming noise and a flurry of snow and sparks that blew the fire across the dark hut  there was a brief blurred vision and then the opposite wall was blasted aside and the apparition vanished .   there was a long silence .  then a slightly shorter silence .  then the old shaman said carefully     you didn   t just see two men go through upside down on a broomstick  shouting and screaming at each other  did you .      the boy looked at him levelly .     certainly not     he said .   the old man heaved a sigh of relief .     thank goodness for that     he said .     neither did i .         the cottage was in turmoil  because not only did the wizards want to follow the broomstick  they also wanted to prevent each other from doing so  and this led to several regrettable incidents .  the most spectacular  and certainly the most tragic  happened when one seer attempted to use his seven league boots without the proper sequence of spells and preparations .  seven league boots  as has already been intimated  are a tricksy form of magic at best  and he remembered too late that the utmost caution must be taken in using a means of transport which  when all is said and done  relies for its effectiveness on trying to put one foot twenty one miles in front of the other .      the first snowstorms of winter were raging  and in fact there was a suspiciously heavy covering of cloud over most of the disc .  and yet  from far above and by the silver light of the discworld   s tiny moon  it presented one of the most beautiful sights in the multiverse .   great streamers of cloud  hundreds of miles along  swirled from the waterfall at the rim to the mountains of the hub .  in the cold crystal silence the huge white spiral glittered frostily under the stars  imperceptibly turning  very much as though god had stirred his coffee and then poured the cream in .   nothing disturbed the glowing scene  which     something small and distant broke through the cloud layer  trailing shreds of vapor .  in the stratospheric calm the sounds of bickering came sharp and clear .      you said you could fly one of these things .         no i didn   t  i just said you couldn   t .         but i   ve never been on one before .         what a coincidence .         anyway  you said   look at the sky .         no i didn   t .         what   s happened to the stars .      and so it was that rincewind and twoflower became the first two people on the disc to see what the future held .   a thousand miles behind them the hub mountain of cori celesti stabbed the sky and cast a knife bright shadow across the broiling clouds  so that gods ought to have noticed too   but the gods don   t normally look at the sky and in any case were engaged in litigation with the ice giants  who had refused to turn their radio down .   rimward  in the direction of great a   tuin   s travel  the sky had been swept of stars .   in that circle of blackness there was just one star  a red and baleful star  a star like the glitter in the eye socket of a rabid mink .  it was small and horrible and uncompromising .  and the disc was being carried straight toward it .   rincewind knew precisely what to do in these circumstances .  he screamed and pointed the broomstick straight down .      galder weatherwax stood in the center of the octogram and raised his hands .      urshalo  dileptor  c   hula  do my bidding .      a small mist formed over his head .  he glanced sideways at trymon  who was sulking at the edge of the magic circle .      this next bit   s quite impressive     he said .     watch .  kot b   hai .  kot sham .  to me  o spirits of small isolated rocks and worried mice not less than three inches long .         what .     said trymon .      that bit took quite a lot of research     agreed galder     especially the mice .  anyway  where was i .  oh  yes        he raised his arms again .  trymon watched him  and licked his lips distractedly .  the old fool was really concentrating  bending his mind entirely to the spell and hardly paying any attention to trymon .   words of power rolled around the room  bouncing off the walls and scuttling out of sight behind shelves and jars .  trymon hesitated .   galder shut his eyes momentarily  his face a mask of ecstasy as he mouthed the final word .   trymon tensed  his fingers curling around the knife again .  and galder opened one eye  nodded at him and sent a sideways blast of power that picked the younger man up and sent him sprawling against the wall .   galder winked at him and raised his arms again .      to me  o spirits of        there was a thunderclap  an implosion of light and a moment of complete physical uncertainty during which even the walls seemed to turn in on themselves .  trymon heard a sharp intake of breath and then a dull  solid thump   the room was suddenly silent .   after a few minutes trymon crawled out from behind a chair and dusted himself off .  he whistled a few bars of nothing much and turned toward the door with exaggerated care  looking at the ceiling as if he had never seen it before .  he moved in a way that suggested he was attempting the world speed record for the nonchalant walk .   the luggage squatted in the center of the circle and opened its lid .   trymon stopped .  he turned very  very carefully  dreading what he might see .   the luggage seemed to contain some clean laundry  smelling slightly of lavender .  somehow it was quite the most terrifying thing the wizard had ever seen .      well  er     he said .     you  um  wouldn   t have seen another wizard around here  by any chance .      the luggage contrived to look more menacing .      oh     said trymon .     well  fine .  it doesn   t matter .      he pulled vaguely at the hem of his robe and took a brief interest in the detail of its stitching .  when he looked up the horrible box was still there .      goodbye     he said  and ran .  he managed to get through the door just in time .       the disc   s little moon toiled across the sky .  it shone by its own light  owing to the cramped and rather inefficient astronomical arrangements made by the creator  and was quite crowded with assorted lunar goddesses who were not  at this particular time  paying much attention to what went on in the disc but were getting up a petition about the ice giants .   had they looked down  they would have seen rincewind talking urgently to a bunch of rocks .   trolls are one of the oldest life forms in the multiverse  dating from an early attempt to get the whole life thing on the road without all that squashy protoplasm .  individual trolls live for a long time  hibernating during the summertime and sleeping during the day  since heat affects them and makes them slow .  they have a fascinating geology .  one could talk about tribology  one could mention the semiconductor effects of impure silicon  one could talk about the giant trolls of prehistory who make up most of the disc   s major mountain ranges and will cause some real problems if they ever awake  but the plain fact is that without the disc   s powerful and pervasive magical field trolls would have died out a long time ago .   psychiatry hadn   t been invented on the disc .  no one had ever shoved an inkblot under rincewind   s nose to see if he had any loose toys in the attic .  so the only way he   d have been able to describe the rocks turning back into trolls was by gabbling vaguely about how pictures suddenly form when you look at the fire  or clouds .   one minute there   d be a perfectly ordinary rock  and suddenly a few cracks that had been there all along took on the definite appearance of a mouth or a pointed ear .  a moment later  and without anything actually changing at all  a troll would be sitting there  grinning at him with a mouth full of diamonds .   they wouldn   t be able to digest me  he told himself .  i   d make them awfully ill .   it wasn   t much of a comfort .      so you   re rincewind the wizard     said the nearest one .  it sounded like someone running over gravel .     i dunno .  i thought you   d be taller .         perhaps he   s eroded a bit     said another one .     the legend is awfully old .      rincewind shifted awkwardly .  he was pretty certain the rock he was sitting on was changing shape  and a tiny troll   hardly any more than a pebble   was sitting companionably on his foot and watching him with extreme interest .      legend .     he said .     what legend .         it   s been handed down from mountain to gravel since the sunset  of time     said the first troll .        when the red star lights the sky rincewind the wizard will come looking for onions .  do not bite him .  it is very important that you help him stay alive .         there was a pause .      that   s it .     said rincewind .      yes     said the troll .     we   ve always been puzzled about it .  most of our legends are much more exciting .  it was more interesting being a rock in the old days .         it was .     said rincewind weakly .      oh yes .  no end of fun .  volcanoes all over the place .  it really meant something  being a rock then .  there was none of this sedimentary nonsense  you were igneous or nothing .  of course  that   s all gone now .  people call themselves trolls today  well  sometimes they   re hardly more than slate .  chalk even .  i wouldn   t give myself airs if you could use me to draw with  would you .         no     said rincewind quickly .     absolutely not  no .  this  er  this legend thing .  it said you shouldn   t bite me .         that   s right .     said the little troll on his foot     and it was me who told you where the onions were .         we   re rather glad you came along     said the first troll  which rincewind couldn   t help noticing was the biggest one there .     we   re a bit worried about this new star .  what does it mean .         i don   t know     said rincewind .     everyone seems to think i know about it  but i don   t           it   s not that we would mind being melted down     said the big troll .     that   s how we all started  anyway .  but we thought  maybe  it might mean the end of everything and that doesn   t seem a very good thing .         it   s getting bigger     said another troll .     look at it now .  bigger than last night .      rincewind looked .  it was definitely bigger than last night .      so we thought you might have some suggestions .     said the head troll  as meekly as it is possible to sound with a voice like a granite gargle .      you could jump over the edge     said rincewind .     there must be lots of places in the universe that could do with some extra rocks .         we   ve heard about that     said the troll .     we   ve met rocks that tried it .  they say you float about for millions of years and then you get very hot and burn away and end up at the bottom of a big hole in the scenery .  that doesn   t sound very bright .      it stood up with a noise like coal rattling down a chute  and stretched its thick  knobbly arms .      well  we   re supposed to help you     it said .     anything you want doing .         i was supposed to be making some soup     said rincewind .  he waved the onions vaguely .  it was probably not the most heroic or purposeful gesture ever made .      soup .     said the troll .     is that all .         well  maybe some biscuits too .      the trolls looked at one another  exposing enough mouth jewelry to buy a medium sized city .   eventually the biggest troll said     soup it is  then .     it shrugged grittily .     it   s just that we imagined that the legend would  well  be a little more   i don   t know  somehow i thought   still  i expect it doesn   t matter .      it extended a hand like a bunch of fossil bananas .      i   m kwartz     it said .     that   s krysoprase over there  and breccia  and jasper  and my wife beryl   she   s a bit metamorphic  but who isn   t these days .  jasper  get off his foot .      rincewind took the hand gingerly  bracing himself for the crunch of crushed bone .  it didn   t come .  the troll   s hand was rough and a bit lichenous around the fingernails .      i   m sorry     said rincewind .     i never really met trolls before .         we   re a dying race     said kwartz sadly  as the party set off under the stars .     young jasper   s the only pebble in our tribe .  we suffer from philosophy  you know .         yes .     said rincewind  trying to keep up .  the troll band moved very quickly  but also very quietly  big round shapes moving like wraiths through the night .  only the occasional flat squeak of a night creature who hadn   t heard them approaching marked their passage .      oh  yes .  martyrs to it .  it comes to all of us in the end .  one evening  they say  you start to wake up and then you think    why bother .     and you just don   t .  see those boulders over there .      rincewind saw some huge shapes lying in the grass .      the one on the end   s my aunt .  i don   t know what   s she   s thinking about  but she hasn   t moved for two hundred years .         gosh  i   m sorry .         oh  it   s no problem with us around to look after them     said kwartz .     not many humans around here  you see .  i know it   s not your fault  but you don   t seem to be able to spot the difference between a thinking troll and an ordinary rock .  my great uncle was actually quarried  you know .         that   s terrible .         yes  one minute he was a troll  the next he was an ornamental fireplace .      they paused in front of a familiar looking cliff .  the scuffed remains of a fire smoldered in the darkness .      it looks like there   s been a fight     said beryl .      they   re all gone .     said rincewind .  he ran to the end of the clearing .     the horses  too .  even the luggage .         one of them   s leaked     said kwartz  kneeling down .     that red watery stuff you have in your insides .  look .         blood .         is that what it   s called .  i   ve never really seen the point of it .      rincewind scuttled about in the manner of one totally at his wits    end  peering behind bushes in case anyone was hiding there .  that was why he tripped over a small green bottle .      cohen   s liniment .     he moaned .     he never goes anywhere without it .         well     said kwartz     you humans have something you can do  i mean like when we slow right down and catch philosophy  only you just fall to bits           dying  it   s called .     screamed rincewind .      that   s it .  they haven   t done that  because they   re not here .         unless they were eaten .     suggested jasper excitedly .      hmm     said kwartz  and     wolves .     said rincewind .      we flattened all the wolves around here years ago     said the troll .     old grandad did  anyway .         he didn   t like them .         no  he just didn   t used to look where he was going .  hmm .     the trolls looked at the ground again .      there   s a trail     he said .     quite a lot of horses .     he looked up at the nearby hills  where sheer cliffs and dangerous crags loomed over the moonlit forests .      old grandad lives up there     he said quietly .   there was something about the way he said it that made rincewind decide that he didn   t ever want to meet old grandad .      dangerous  is he .     he ventured .      he   s very old and big and mean .  we haven   t seen him about for years     said kwartz .      centuries     corrected beryl .      he   ll squash them all flat .     added jasper  jumping up and down on rincewind   s toes .      it just happens sometimes that a really old and big troll will go off by himself into the hills  and   um   the rock takes over  if you follow me .         no .      kwartz sighed .     people sometimes act like animals  don   t they .  and sometimes a troll will start thinking like a rock  and rocks don   t like people much .      breccia  a skinny troll with a sandstone finish  rapped on kwartz   s shoulder .      are we going to follow them  then .     he said .     the legend says we should help this rincewind squashy .      kwartz stood up  thought for a moment  then picked rincewind up by the scruff of his neck and with a big gritty movement placed him on his shoulders .      we go     he said firmly .     if we meet old grandad i   ll try to explain           two miles away a string of horses trotted through the night .  three of them carried captives  expertly gagged and bound .  a fourth pulled a rough travois on which the luggage lay trussed and netted and silent .   herrena softly called the column to a halt and beckoned one of her men to her .      are you quite sure .     she said .     i can   t hear anything .         i saw troll shapes     he said flatly .   she looked around .  the trees had thinned out here  there was a lot of scree  and ahead of them the track led toward a bald  rocky hill that looked especially unpleasant by red starlight .   she was worried about that track .  it was extremely old  but something had made it  and trolls took a lot of killing .   she sighed .  suddenly it looked as though that secretarial career was not such a bad option  at that .   not for the first time she reflected that there were many drawbacks to being a swordswoman  not least of which was that men didn   t take you seriously until you   d actually killed them  by which time it didn   t really matter anyway .  then there was all the leather  which brought her out in a rash but seemed to be unbreakably traditional .  and then there was the ale .  it was all right for the likes of hrun the barbarian or cimbar the assassin to carouse all night in low bars  but herrena drew the line at it unless they sold proper drinks in small glasses  preferably with a cherry in .  as for the toilet facilities     but she was too big to be a thief  too honest to be an assassin  too intelligent to be a wife  and too proud to enter the only other female profession generally available .   so she   d become a swordswoman and had been a good one  amassing a modest fortune that she was carefully husbanding for a future that she hadn   t quite worked out yet but which would certainly include a bidet if she had anything to say about it .   there was a distant sound of splintering timber .  trolls had never seen the point of walking around trees .   she looked up at the hill again .  two arms of high ground swept away to right and left  and up ahead was a large outcrop with   she squinted   some caves in it .   troll caves .  but maybe a better option than blundering around at night .  and come sunup  there   d be no problem .   she leaned across to gancia  leader of the gang of morpork mercenaries .  she wasn   t very happy about him .  it was true that he had the muscles of an ox and the stamina of an ox  the trouble was that he seemed to have the brains of an ox .  and the viciousness of a ferret .  like most of the lads in downtown morpork he   d have cheerfully sold his granny for glue  and probably had .      we   ll head for the caves and light a big fire in the entrance     she said .     trolls don   t like fire .      he gave her a look which suggested he had his own ideas about who should be giving the orders  but his lips said     you   re the boss .         right .      herrena looked back at the three captives .  that was the box all right   trymon   s description had been absolutely accurate .  but neither of the men looked like a wizard .  not even a failed wizard .         oh  dear     said kwartz .   the trolls halted .  the night closed in like velvet .  an owl hooted eerily   at least rincewind assumed it was an owl  he was a little hazy on ornithology .  perhaps a nightingale hooted  unless it was a thrush .  a bat flittered overhead .  he was quite confident about that .   he was also very tired and quite bruised .      why oh dear .     he said .   he peered into the gloom .  there was a distant speck in the hills that might have been a fire .      oh     he said .     you don   t like fires  do you .      kwartz nodded .     it destroys the superconductivity of our brains     he said     but a fire that small wouldn   t have much effect on old grandad .      rincewind looked around cautiously  listening for the sound of a rogue troll .  he   d seen what normal trolls could do to a forest .  they weren   t naturally destructive  they just treated organic matter as a sort of inconvenient fog .      let   s hope he doesn   t find it  then     he said fervently .   kwartz sighed .     not much chance of that     he said .     they   ve lit it in his mouth .            it   sh a judgeshment on me .     moaned cohen .  he tugged ineffectually at his bonds .   twoflower peered at him muzzily .  gancia   s slingshot had raised quite a lump on the back of his head and he was a little uncertain about things  starting with his name and working upward .      i should have been lisshening out     said cohen .     i should have been paying attenshion and not being shwayed by all this talk about your wosshnames  your din chewers .  i mussht be getting shoft .      he levered himself up by his elbows .  herrena and the rest of the gang were standing around the fire in the cave mouth .  the luggage was still and silent under its net in a corner .      there   s something funny about this cave     said bethan .      what .     said cohen .      well  look at it .  have you ever seen rocks like those before .      cohen had to agree that the semicircle of stones around the cave entrance were unusual  each one was higher than a man  and heavily worn  and surprisingly shiny .  there was a matching semicircle on the ceiling .  the whole effect was that of a stone computer built by a druid with a vague idea of geometry and no sense of gravity .      look at the walls  too .      cohen squinted at the wall next to him .  there were veins of red crystal in it .  he couldn   t be quite certain  but it was almost as if little points of light kept flashing on and off deep within the rock itself .   it was also extremely drafty .  a steady breeze blew out of the black depths of the cave .      i   m sure it was blowing the other way when we came in     whispered bethan .     what do you think  twoflower .         well  i   m not a cave expert     he said     but i was just thinking  that   s a very interesting stalag thingy hanging from the ceiling up there .  sort of bulbous  isn   t it .      they looked at it .      i can   t quite put my finger on why     said twoflower     but i think it might be a rather good idea to get out of here .         oh yesh     said cohen sarcastically     i shupposhe we   d jusht better ashk theesh people to untie ush and let us go  eh .      cohen hadn   t spent much time in twoflower   s company  otherwise he would not have been surprised when the little man nodded brightly and said  in the loud  slow and careful voice he employed as an alternative to actually speaking other people   s languages     excuse me .  could you please untie us and let us go .  it   s rather damp and drafty here .  sorry .      bethan looked sidelong at cohen .      was he supposed to say that .         it   sh novel  i   ll grant you .      and  indeed  three people detached themselves from the group around the fire and came toward them .  they did not look as if they intended to untie anyone .  the two men  in fact  looked the sort of people who  when they see other people tied up  start playing around with knives and making greasy suggestions and leering a lot .   herrena introduced herself by drawing her sword and pointing it at twoflower   s heart .      which one of you is rincewind the wizard .     she said .     there were four horses .  is he here .         um  i don   t know where he is     said twoflower .     he was looking for some onions .         then you are his friends and he will come looking for you     said herrena .  she glanced at cohen and bethan  then looked closely at the luggage .   trymon had been emphatic that they shouldn   t touch the luggage .  curiosity may have killed the cat  but herrena   s curiosity could have massacred a pride of lions .   she slit the netting and grasped the lid of the box .   twoflower winced .      locked     she said eventually .     where is the key  fat one .         it   it hasn   t got a key     said twoflower .      there is a keyhole     she pointed out .      well  yes  but if it wants to stay locked  it stays locked     said twoflower uncomfortably .   herrena was aware of gancia   s grin .  she snarled .      i want it open     she said .     gancia  see to it .     she strode back to the fire .   gancia drew a long thin knife and leaned down close to twoflower   s face .      she wants it open     he said .  he looked up at the other man and grinned .      she wants it open  weems .         yah .      gancia waved the knife slowly in front of twoflower   s face .      look     said twoflower patiently     i don   t think you understand .  no one can open the luggage if it   s feeling in a locked mood .         oh yes  i forgot     said gancia thoughtfully .     of course  it   s a magic box  isn   t that right .  with little legs  they say .  i say  weems  any legs your side .  no .      he held his knife to twoflower   s throat .      i   m really upset about that     he said .     so   s weems .  he doesn   t say much but what he does is  he tears bits off people .  so open   the   box .      he turned and planted a kick on the side of the box  leaving a nasty gash in the wood .   there was a tiny little click .   gancia grinned .  the lid swung up slowly  ponderously .  the distant firelight gleamed off gold   lots of gold  in plate  chain  and coin  heavy and glistening in the flickering shadows .      all right     said gancia softly .   he looked back at the unheeding men around the fire  who seemed to be shouting at someone outside the cave .  then he looked speculatively at weems .  his lips moved soundlessly with the unaccustomed effort of mental arithmetic .   he looked down at his knife .   then the floor moved .         i heard someone     said one of the men .     down there .  among the   uh   rocks .      rincewind   s voice floated up out of the darkness .      i say     he said .      well .     said herrena .      you   re in great danger .     shouted rincewind .     you must put the fire out .         no  no     said herrena .     you   ve got it wrong  you   re in great danger .  and the fire stays .         there   s this big old troll           everyone knows trolls keep away from fire     said herrena .  she nodded .  a couple of men drew their swords and slipped out into the darkness .      absolutely true .     shouted rincewind desperately .     only this specific troll can   t  you see .         can   t .     herrena hesitated .  something of the terror in rincewind   s voice hit her .      yes  because  you see  you   ve lit it on his tongue .      then the floor moved .      old grandad awoke very slowly from his centuries old slumber .  he nearly didn   t awake at all  in fact a few decades later none of this could have happened .  when a troll gets old and starts to think seriously about the universe it normally finds a quiet spot and gets down to some hard philosophizing  and after a while starts to forget about its extremities .  it begins to crystallize around the edges until nothing remains except a tiny flicker of life inside quite a large hill with some unusual rock strata .   old grandad hadn   t quite got that far .  he awoke from considering quite a promising line of inquiry about the meaning of truth and found a hot ashy taste in what  after a certain amount of thought  he remembered as being his mouth .   he began to get angry .  commands skittered along neural pathways of impure silicon .  deep within his silicaceous body stone slipped smoothly along special fracture lines .  trees toppled  turf split  as fingers the size of ships unfolded and gripped the ground .  two enormous rockslides high on his cliff face marked the opening of eyes like great crusted opals .   rincewind couldn   t see all this  of course  since his own eyes were daylight issue only  but he did see the whole dark landscape shake itself slowly and then begin to rise impossibly against the stars .      the sun rose .   however  the sunlight didn   t .  what did happen was that the famous discworld sunlight  which as has already been indicated travels very slowly through the disc   s powerful magical field  sloshed gently over the lands around the rim and began its soft  silent battle against the retreating armies of the night .  it poured like molten gold  across the sleeping landscape   bright  clean and  above all  slow .      herrena didn   t hesitate .  with great presence of mind she ran to the edge of old grandad   s bottom lip and jumped  rolling as she hit the earth .  the men followed her  cursing as they landed among the debris .   like a fat man trying to do push ups the old troll pushed himself upward .   this wasn   t apparent from where the prisoners were lying .  all they knew was that the floor kept rolling under them and that there was a lot of noise going on  most of it unpleasant .   weems grabbed gancia   s arm .      it   s a herthquake     he said .     let   s get out of here .         not without that gold     said gancia .      what .         the gold  the gold .  man  we could be as rich as creosote .      weems might have had a room temperature iq  but he knew idiocy when he saw it .  gancia   s eyes gleamed more than gold  and he appeared to be staring at weems   s left ear .   weems looked desperately at the luggage .  it was still open invitingly  which was odd   you   d have thought all this shaking would have slammed the lid shut .      we   d never carry it     he suggested .     it   s too heavy     he added .      we   ll damn well carry some of it .     shouted gancia  and leapt toward the chest as the floor shook again .   the lid snapped shut .  gancia vanished .   and just in case weems thought it was accidental the luggage   s lid snapped open again  just for a second  and a large tongue as red as mahogany licked across broad teeth as white as sycamore .  then it slammed shut again .   to weems   s further horror hundreds of little legs extruded from the underside of the box .  it rose very deliberately and  carefully arranging its feet  shuffled around to face him .  there was a particularly malevolent look about its keyhole  the sort of look that says    go on   make my day        he backed away and looked imploringly at twoflower .      i think it might be a good idea if you untied us     suggested twoflower .     it   s really quite friendly once it gets to know you .      licking his lips nervously  weems drew his knife .  the luggage gave a warning creak .   he slashed through their bonds and stood back quickly .      thank you     said twoflower .      i think my back   sh gone again     complained cohen  as bethan helped him to his feet .      what do we do with this man .     said bethan .      we take hish knife and tell him to bugger off     said cohen .     right .         yes  sir .  thank you  sir .     said weems  and bolted toward the cavemouth .  for a moment he was outlined against the gray predawn sky  and then he vanished .  there was a distant cry of    aaargh .         the sunlight roared silently across the land like surf .  here and there  where the magic field was slightly weaker  tongues of morning raced ahead of the day  leaving isolated islands of night that contracted and vanished as the bright ocean flowed onward .   the uplands around the vortex plains stood out ahead of the advancing tide like a great gray ship .      it is possible to stab a troll  but the technique takes practice and no one ever gets a chance to practice more than once .  herrena   s men saw the trolls loom out of the darkness like very solid ghosts .  blades shattered as they hit silica skins  there were one or two brief  flat screams  and then nothing more but shouts far away in the forest as they put as much distance as they could between themselves and the avenging earth .   rincewind crept out from behind a tree and looked around .  he was alone  but the bushes behind him rustled as the trolls lumbered after the gang .   he looked up .   high above him two great crystalline eyes focused in hatred of everything soft and squelchy and  above all  warm .  rincewind cowered in horror as a hand the size of a house rose  curled into a fist  and dropped toward him .   day came with a silent explosion of light .  for a moment the huge terrifying bulk of old grandad was a breakwater of shadow as the daylight streamed past .  there was a brief grinding noise .   there was silence .   several minutes passed .  nothing happened .   a few birds started singing .  a bumblebee buzzed over the boulder that was old grandad   s fist and alighted on a patch of thyme that had grown under a stone fingernail .   there was a scuffling down below .  rincewind slid awkwardly out of the narrow gap between the fist and the ground like a snake leaving a burrow .   he lay on his back  staring up at the sky past the frozen shape of the troll .  it hadn   t changed in any way  apart from the stillness  but already the eye started to play tricks .  last night rincewind had looked at cracks in stone and seen them become mouths and eyes  now he looked at the great cliff face and saw the features become  like magic  mere blemishes in the rock .      wow .     he said .   that didn   t seem to help .  he stood up  dusted himself off  and looked around .  apart from the bumblebee  he was completely alone .   after poking around for a bit he found a rock that  from certain angles  looked like beryl .   he was lost and lonely and a long way from home .  he     there was a crunch high above him  and shards of rock spattered into the earth .  high up on the face of old grandad a hole appeared  there was a brief sight of the luggage   s backside as it struggled to regain its footing  and then twoflower   s head poked out of the mouth cave .      anyone down there .  i say .         hey .     shouted the wizard .     am i glad to see you .         i don   t know .  are you .     said twoflower .      am i what .         gosh  there   s a wonderful view from up here .         it took them half an hour to get down .  fortunately old grandad had been quite craggy with plenty of hand holds  but his nose would have presented a tricky obstacle if it hadn   t been for the luxuriant oak tree that flourished in one nostril .   the luggage didn   t bother to climb .  it just jumped  and bounced its way down with no apparent harm .   cohen sat in the shade  trying to catch his breath and waiting for his sanity to catch up with him .  he eyed the luggage thoughtfully .      the horses have all gone     said twoflower .      we   ll find    em     said cohen .  his eyes bored into the luggage  which began to look embarrassed .      they were carrying all our food     said rincewind .      plenty of food in the foreshts .         i have some nourishing biscuits in the luggage     said twoflower .     traveler   s digestives .  always a comfort in a tight spot .         i   ve tried them     said rincewind .     they   ve got a mean edge on them  and        cohen stood up  wincing .      excushe me     he said flatly .     there   sh shomething i   ve got to know .      he walked over to the luggage and gripped its lid .  the box backed away hurriedly  but cohen stuck out a skinny foot and tripped up half its legs .  as it twisted to snap at him he gritted his teeth and heaved  jerking the luggage onto its curved lid where it rocked angrily like a maddened tortoise .      hey  that   s my luggage .     said twoflower .     why   s he attacking my luggage .         i think i know     said bethan quietly .     i think it   s because he   s scared of it .      twoflower turned to rincewind  openmouthed .  rincewind shrugged .      search me     he said .     i run away from things i   m scared of  myself .      with a snap of its lid the luggage jerked into the air and came down running  catching cohen a crack on the shins with one of its brass corners .  as it wheeled around he got a grip on it just long enough to send it galloping full tilt into a rock .      not bad     said rincewind  admiringly .   the luggage staggered back  paused for a moment  then came at cohen waving its lid menacingly .  he jumped and landed on it  with both his hands and feet caught in the gap between the box and the lid .   this severely puzzled the luggage .  it was even more astonished when cohen took a deep breath and heaved  muscles standing out on his skinny arms like a sock full of coconuts .   they stood locked there for some time  tendon versus hinge .  occasionally one or other would creak .   bethan elbowed twoflower in the ribs .      do something     she said .      um     said twoflower .     yes .  that   s about enough  i think .  put him down  please .      the luggage gave a creak of betrayal at the sound of its master   s voice .  its lid flew up with such force that cohen tumbled backward  but he scrambled to his feet and flung himself toward the box .   its contents lay open to the skies .   cohen reached inside .   the luggage creaked a bit  but had obviously weighed up the chances of being sent to the top of that great wardrobe in the sky .  when rincewind dared to peek through his fingers cohen was peering into the luggage and cursing under his breath .      laundry .     he shouted .     is that it .  just laundry .     he was shaking with rage .      i think there   s some biscuits too     said twoflower in a small voice .      but there wash gold .  and i shaw it eat shomebody .     cohen looked imploringly at rincewind .   the wizard sighed .     don   t ask me     he said .     i don   t own the bloody thing .         i bought it in a shop     said twoflower defensively .     i said i wanted a traveling trunk .         that   s what you got  all right     said rincewind .      it   s very loyal     said twoflower .      oh yes     agreed rincewind .     if loyalty is what you look for in a suitcase .         hold on     said cohen  who had sagged onto a rock .     wash it one of thoshe shopsh   i mean  i bet you hadn   t noticed it before and when you went back again it washn   t there .      twoflower brightened .     that   s right .         shopkeeper a little wizened old guy .  shop full of strange shtuff .         exactly .  never could find it again  i thought i must have got the wrong street  nothing but a brick wall where i thought it was  i remember thinking at the time it was rather        cohen shrugged .     one of those shops    he said .     that explainsh it  then .     he felt his back  and grimaced .     bloody horshe ran off with my liniment .      rincewind remembered something  and fumbled in the depths of his torn and now very grubby robe .  he held up a green bottle .      that   sh the shtuff .     said cohen .     you   re a marvel .     he looked sideways at twoflower .      i would have beaten it     he said quietly     even if you hadn   t called it off  i would have beaten it in the end .         that   s right     said bethan .      you two can make yourshelf usheful     he added .     that luggage broke through a troll tooth to get ush out .  that wash diamond .  shee if you can find the bitsh .  i   ve had an idea about them .      as bethan rolled up her sleeves and uncorked the bottle rincewind took twoflower to one side .  when they were safely hidden behind a shrub he said     he   s gone barmy .         that   s cohen the barbarian you   re talking about .     said twoflower  genuinely shocked .     he is the greatest warrior that           was     said rincewind urgently .     all that stuff with the warrior priests and man eating zombies was years ago .  all he   s got now is memories and so many scars you could play noughts and crosses on him .         he is rather more elderly than i imagined  yes     said twoflower .  he picked up a fragment of diamond .      so we ought to leave them and find our horses and move on     said rincewind .      that   s a bit of a mean trick  isn   t it .         they   ll be all right     said rincewind heartily .     the point is  would you feel happy in the company of someone who would attack the luggage with his bare hands .         that is a point     said twoflower .      they   ll probably be better off without us anyway .         are you sure .         positive     said rincewind .      they found the horses wandering aimlessly in the scrub  breakfasted on badly dried horse jerky  and set off in what rincewind believed was the right direction .  a few minutes later the luggage emerged from the bushes and followed them .   the sun rose higher in the sky  but still failed to blot out the light of the star .      it   s got bigger overnight     said twoflower .     why isn   t anybody doing something .         such as what .      twoflower thought .     couldn   t somebody tell great a   tuin to avoid it .     he said .     sort of go around it .         that sort of thing has been tried before     said rincewind .     wizards tried to tune in to great a   tuin   s mind .         it didn   t work .         oh  it worked all right     said rincewind .     only        only there had been certain unforeseen risks in reading a mind as great as the world turtle   s  he explained .  the wizards had trained up on tortoises and giant sea turtles first  to get the hang of the chelonian frame of mind  but although they knew that great a   tuin   s mind would be big they hadn   t realized that it would be slow .      there   s a bunch of wizards that have been reading it in shifts for thirty years     said rincewind .     all they   ve found out is that great a   tuin is looking forward to something .         what .         who knows .      they rode in silence for a while through a rough country where huge limestone blocks lined the track .  eventually twoflower said     we ought to go back  you know .         look  we   ll reach the smarl tomorrow     said rincewind .     nothing will happen to them out here  i don   t see why        he was talking to himself .  twoflower had wheeled his horse and was trotting back  demonstrating all the horsemanship of a sack of potatoes .   rincewind looked down .  the luggage regarded him owlishly .      what are you looking at .     said the wizard .     he can go back if he wants  why should i bother .      the luggage said nothing .      look  he   s not my responsibility     said rincewind .     let   s be absolutely clear about that .      the luggage said nothing  but louder this time .      go on   follow him .  you   re nothing to do with me .      the luggage retracted its little legs and settled down on the track .      well  i   m going     said rincewind .     i mean it     he added .   he turned the horse   s head back toward the new horizon  and glanced down .  the luggage sat there .      it   s no good trying to appeal to my better nature .  you can stay there all day for all i care .  i   m just going to ride off  okay .      he glared at the luggage .  the luggage looked back .         i thought you   d come back     said twoflower .      i don   t want to talk about it     said rincewind .      shall we talk about something else .         yeah  well  discussing how to get these ropes off would be favorite     said rincewind .  he wrenched at the bonds around his wrists .      i can   t imagine why you   re so important     said herrena .  she sat on a rock opposite them  sword across her knees .  most of the gang laying among the rocks high above  watching the road .  rincewind and twoflower had been a pathetically easy ambush .      weems told me what your box did to gancia     she added .     i can   t say that   s a great loss  but i hope it understands that if it comes within a mile of us i will personally cut both your throats  yes .      rincewind nodded violently .      good     said herrena .     you   re wanted dead or alive  i   m not really bothered which  but some of the lads might want to have a little discussion with you about those trolls .  if the sun hadn   t come up when it did        she left the words hanging  and walked away .      well  here   s another fine mess     said rincewind .  he had another pull at the ropes that bound him .  there was a rock behind him  and if he could bring his wrists up   yes  as he thought  it lacerated him while at the same time being too blunt to have any effect on the rope .      but why us .     said twoflower .     it   s to do with that star  isn   t it .         i don   t know anything about the star     said rincewind .     i never even attended astrology lessons at the university .         i expect everything will turn out all right in the end     said twoflower .   rincewind looked at him .  remarks like that always threw him .      do you really believe that .     he said .     i mean  really .         well  things generally do work out satisfactorily  when you come to think about it .         if you think the total disruption of my life for the last year is satisfactory then you might be right .  i   ve lost count of the times i   ve nearly been killed           twenty seven     said twoflower .      what .         twenty seven times     said twoflower helpfully .     i worked it out .  but you never actually have .         what .  worked it out .     said rincewind  who was beginning to have the familiar feeling that the conversation had been mugged .      no .  been killed .  doesn   t that seem a bit suspicious .         i   ve never objected to it  if that   s what you mean     said rincewind .  he glared at his feet .  twoflower was right  of course .  the spell was keeping him alive  it was obvious .  no doubt if he jumped over a cliff a passing cloud would cushion his fall .   the trouble with that theory  he decided  was that it only worked if he didn   t believe it was true .  the moment he thought he was invulnerable he   d be dead .   so  on the whole it was wisest not to think about it at all .   anyway  he might be wrong .   the only thing he could be certain of was that he was getting a headache .  he hoped that the spell was somewhere in the area of the headache and really suffering .   when they rode out of the hollow both rincewind and twoflower were sharing a horse with one of their captors .  rincewind perched uncomfortably in front of weems  who had sprained an ankle and was not in a good mood .  twoflower sat in front of herrena which  since he was fairly short  meant that at least he kept his ears warm .  she rode with a drawn knife and a sharp eye out for any walking boxes  herrena hadn   t quite worked out what the luggage was  but she was bright enough to know that it wouldn   t let twoflower be killed .   after about ten minutes they saw it in the middle of the road .  its lid lay open invitingly .  it was full of gold .      go around it     said herrena .      but           it   s a trap .         that   s right     said weems  white faced .     you take it from me .      reluctantly they reined their horses around the glittering temptation and trotted on along the track .  weems glanced back fearfully  dreading to see the chest coming after him .   what he saw was almost worse .  it had gone .   far off to one side of the path the long grass moved mysteriously and was still .   rincewind wasn   t much of a wizard and even less of a fighter  but he was an expert at cowardice and he knew fear when he smelled it .  he said  quietly     it   ll follow you  you know .         what .     said weems  distractedly .  he was still peering at the grass .      it   s very patient and it never gives up .  that   s sapient pearwood you   re dealing with .  it   ll let you think it   s forgotten you  then one day you   ll be walking along a dark street and you   ll hear these little footsteps behind you   shlup  shlup  they   ll go  then you   ll start running and they   ll speed up  shlupshlupshlup           shut up .     shouted weems .      it   s probably already recognized you  so           i said shut up .      herrena turned around in her saddle and glared at them .  weems scowled and pulled rincewind   s ear until it was right in front of his mouth  and said hoarsely     i   m afraid of nothing  understand .  this wizard stuff  i spit on it .         they all say that until they hear the footsteps     said rincewind .  he stopped .  a knifepoint was pricking his ribs .      nothing happened for the rest of the day but  to rincewind   s satisfaction and weems   s mounting paranoia  the luggage showed itself several times .  here it would be perched incongruously on a crag  there it would be half hidden in a ditch with moss growing over it .   by late afternoon they came to the crest of a hill and looked down on the broad valley of the upper smarl  the longest river on the disc .  it was already half a mile across  and heavy with the silt that made the lower valley the most fertile area on the continent .  a few wisps of early mist wreathed its banks .      shlup     said rincewind .  he felt weems jerk upright in the saddle .      eh .         just clearing my throat     said rincewind  and grinned .  he had put a lot of thought into that grin .  it was the sort of grin people use when they stare at your left ear and tell you in an urgent tone of voice that they are being spied on by secret agents from the next galaxy .  it was not a grin to inspire confidence .  more horrible grins had probably been seen  but only on the sort of grinner that is orange with black stripes  has a long tail and hangs around in jungles looking for victims to grin at .      wipe that off     said herrena  trotting up .   where the track led down to the river bank there was a crude jetty and a big bronze gong .      it   ll summon the ferryman     said herrena .     if we cross here we can cut off a big bend in the river .  might even make it to a town tonight .      weems looked doubtful .  the sun was getting fat and red  and the mists were beginning to thicken .      or maybe you want to spend the night this side of the water .      weems picked up the hammer and hit the gong so hard that it spun right around on its hanger and fell off .   they waited in silence .  then with a wet clinking sound a chain sprang out of the water and pulled taut against an iron peg set into the bank .  eventually the slow flat shape of the ferry emerged from the mist  its hooded ferryman heaving on a big wheel set in its center as he winched his way toward the shore .   the ferry   s flat bottom grated on the gravel  and the hooded figure leaned against the wheel panting .      two at a time     it muttered .     that   sh all .  jusht two  with horshesh .      rincewind swallowed  and tried not to look at twoflower .  the man would probably be grinning and mugging like an idiot .  he risked a sideways glance .   twoflower was sitting with his mouth open .      you   re not the usual ferryman     said herrena .     i   ve been here before  the usual man is a big fellow  sort of           it   sh hish day off .         well  okay     she said doubtfully .     in that case   what   s he laughing at .      twoflower   s shoulders were shaking  his face had gone red  and he was emitting muffled snorts .  herrena glared at him  then looked hard at the ferryman .      two of you   grab him .      there was a pause .  then one of the men said     what  the ferryman .         yes .         why .      herrena looked blank .  this sort of thing wasn   t supposed to happen .  it was accepted that when someone yelled something like    get him .     or    guards .     people jumped to it  they weren   t supposed to sit around discussing things .      because i said so .     was the best she could manage .  the two men nearest to the bowed figure looked at each other  shrugged  dismounted  and each took a shoulder .  the ferryman was about half their size .      like this .     said one of them .  twoflower was choking for breath .      now i want to see what he   s got under that robe .      the two men exchanged glances .      i   m not sure that       said one .   he got no further because a knobbly elbow jerked into his stomach like a piston .  his companion looked down incredulously and got the other elbow in the kidneys .   cohen cursed as he struggled to untangle his sword from his robe while hopping crabwise toward herrena .  rincewind groaned  gritted his teeth  and jerked his head backward hard .  there was a scream from weems and rincewind rolled sideways  landed heavily in the mud  scrambled up madly and looked around for somewhere to hide .   with a cry of triumph cohen managed to free his sword and waved it triumphantly  severely wounding a man who had been creeping up behind him .   herrena pushed twoflower off her horse and fumbled for her own blade .  twoflower tried to stand up and caused the horse of another man to rear  throwing him off and bringing his head down to the right level for rincewind to kick it as hard as possible .  rincewind would be the first to call himself a rat  but even rats fight in a corner .   weems   s hands dropped onto his shoulder and a fist like a medium sized rock slammed into his head .   as he went down he heard herrena say  quite quietly     kill them both .  i   ll deal with this old fool .         right .     said weems  and turned toward twoflower with his sword drawn .   rincewind saw him hesitate .  there was a moment of silence  and then even herrena could hear the splashing as the luggage surged ashore  water pouring from it .   weems stared at it in horror .  his sword fell from his hand .  he turned and ran into the mists .  a moment later the luggage bounded over rincewind and followed him .   herrena lunged at cohen  who parried the thrust and grunted as his arm twinged .  the blades clanged wetly  and then herrena was forced to back away as a cunning upward sweep from cohen nearly disarmed her .   rincewind staggered toward twoflower and tugged at him ineffectually .      time to be going     he muttered .      this is great .     said twoflower .     did you see the way he           yes  yes  come on .         but i want   i say  well done .      herrena   s sword spun out of her hand and stood quivering in the dirt .  with a snort of satisfaction cohen brought his own sword back  went momentarily cross eyed  gave a little yelp of pain  and stood absolutely motionless .   herrena looked at him  puzzled .  she made an experimental move in the direction of her own sword and when nothing happened she grasped it  tested its balance  and stared at cohen .  only his agonized eyes moved to follow her as she circled him cautiously .      his back   s gone again .     whispered twoflower .     what can we do .         we can see if we can catch the horses .         well     said herrena     i don   t know who you are or why you   re here  and there   s nothing personal about this  you understand .      she raised her sword in both hands .   there was a sudden movement in the mists and the dull thud of a heavy piece of wood hitting a head .  herrena looked bewildered for a moment  and then fell forward .   bethan dropped the branch she had been holding and looked at cohen .  then she grabbed him by the shoulders  stuck her knee in the small of his back  gave a businesslike twist and let him go .   an expression of bliss passed across his face .  he gave an experimental bend .      it   s gone .     he said .     the back .  gone .      twoflower turned to rincewind .      my father used to recommend hanging from the top of a door     he said conversationally .      weems crept very cautiously through the scrubby  mistladen trees .  the pale damp air muffled all sounds  but he was certain that there had been nothing to hear for the past ten minutes .  he turned around very slowly  and then allowed himself the luxury of a long  heartfelt sigh .  he stepped back into the cover of the bushes .   something nudged the back of his knees  very gently .  something angular .   he looked down .  there seemed to be more feet down there than there ought to be .   there was a short  sharp snap .      the fire was a tiny dot of light in a dark landscape .  the moon wasn   t up yet  but the star was a lurking glow on the horizon .      it   s circular now     said bethan .     it looks like a tiny sun .  i   m sure it   s getting hotter  too .         don   t     said rincewind .     as if i hadn   t got enough to worry about .         what i don   t undershtand     said cohen  who was having his back massaged     ish how they captured you without ush hearing it .  we wouldn   t have known at all if your luggage hadn   t kept jumping up and down .         and whining     said bethan .  they all looked at her .      well  it looked as if it was whining     she said .     i think it   s rather sweet  really .      four pairs of eyes turned toward the luggage  which was squatting on the other side of the fire .  it got up  and very pointedly moved back into the shadows .      eashy to feed     said cohen .      hard to lose     agreed rincewind .      loyal     suggested twoflower .      roomy     said cohen .      but i wouldn   t say sweet     said rincewind .      i shuppose you wouldn   t want to shell it .     said cohen .   twoflower shook his head .     i don   t think it would understand     he said .      no  i shupposhe not     said cohen .  he sat up  and bit his lip .     i wash looking for a preshent for bethan  you shee .  we   re getting married .         we thought you ought to be the first to know     said bethan  and blushed .   rincewind didn   t catch twoflower   s eye .      well  that   s very  er           just as soon as we find a town where there   s a priest     said bethan .     i want it done properly .         that   s very important     said twoflower seriously .     if there were more morals about we wouldn   t be crashing into stars .      they considered this for a moment .  then twoflower said brightly     this calls for a celebration .  i   ve got some biscuits and water  if you   ve still got some of that jerky .         oh  good     said rincewind weakly .  he beckoned cohen to one side .  with his beard trimmed the old man could easily have passed for seventy on a dark night .      this is  uh  serious .     he said .     you   re really going to marry her .         shure thing .  any objections .         well  no  of course not  but   i mean  she   s seventeen and you   re  how can i put it  you   re of the elderly persuasion .         time i shettled down  you mean .      rincewind groped for words .     you   re seventy years older than her  cohen .  are you sure that           i have been married before  you know .  i   ve got quite a good memory     said cohen reproachfully .      no  what i mean is  well  i mean physically  the point is  what about  you know  the age difference and everything  it   s a matter of health  isn   t it  and           ah     said cohen slowly     i shee what you mean .  the strain .  i hadn   t looked at it like that .         no     said rincewind  straightening up .     no  well  that   s only to be expected .         you   ve given me something to think about and no mishtake     said cohen .      i hope i haven   t upset anything .         no  no     said cohen vaguely .     don   t apologishe .  you were right to point it out .      he turned and looked at bethan  who waved at him  and then he looked up at the star that glared through the mists .   eventually he said     dangerous times  these .         that   s a fact .         who knows what tomorrow may bring .         not me .      cohen clapped rincewind on the shoulder .     shometimesh we jusht have to take rishks     he said .     don   t be offended  but i think we   ll go ahead with the wedding anyway and  well     he looked at bethan and sighed     we   ll just have to hope she   s shtrong enough .         around noon the following day they rode into a small  mud walled city surrounded by fields still lush and green .  there seemed to be a lot of traffic going the other way  though .  huge carts rumbled past them .  herds of livestock ambled along the crown of the road .  old ladies stomped past carrying entire households and haystacks on their backs .      plague .     said rincewind  stopping a man pushing a handcart full of children .   he shook his head .     it   s the star  friend     he said .     haven   t you seen it in the sky .         we couldn   t help noticing it  yes .         they say that it   ll hit us on hogswatchnight and the seas will boil and the countries of the disc will be broken and kings will be brought down and the cities will be as lakes of glass     said the man .     i   m off to the mountains .         that   ll help  will it .     said rincewind doubtfully .      no  but the view will be better .      rincewind rode back to the others .      everyone   s worried about the star     he said .     apparently there   s hardly anyone left in the cities  they   re all frightened of it .         i don   t want to worry anyone     said bethan     but hasn   t it struck you as unseasonably hot .         that   s what i said last night     said twoflower .     very warm  i thought .         i shuspect it   ll get a lot hotter     said cohen .     let   sh get on into the city .      they rode through echoing streets that were practically deserted .  cohen kept peering at merchants    signs until he reined his horse and said     thish ish what i   ve been looking for .  you find a temple and a priesht  i   ll join you shortly .         a jeweler .     said rincewind .      it   s a shuprishe .         i could do with a new dress  too     said bethan .      i   ll shteal you one .      there was something very oppressive about the city  rincewind decided .  there was also something very odd .   almost every door was painted with a large red star .      it   s creepy     said bethan .     as if people wanted to bring the star here .         or keep it away     said twoflower .      that won   t work .  it   s too big     said rincewind .  he saw their faces turned toward him .      well  it stands to reason  doesn   t it .     he said lamely .      no     said bethan .      stars are small lights in the sky     said twoflower .     one fell down near my home once   big white thing  size of a house  glowed for weeks before it went out .         this star is different     said a voice .     great a   tuin has climbed the beach of the universe .  this is the great ocean of space .         how do you know .     said twoflower .      know what .     said rincewind .      what you just said .  about beaches and oceans .         i didn   t say anything .         yes you did  you silly man .     yelled bethan .     we saw your lips going up and down and everything .      rincewind shut his eyes .  inside his mind he could feel the spell scuttling off to hide behind his conscience  and muttering to itself .      all right  all right     he said .     no need to shout .  i   i don   t know how i know  i just know           well  i wish you   d tell us .      they turned the corner .   all the cities around the circle sea had a special area set aside for the gods  of which the disc had an elegant sufficiency .  usually they were crowded and not very attractive from an architectural point of view .  the most senior gods  of course  had large and splendid temples  but the trouble was that later gods demanded equality and soon the holy areas were sprawling with lean tos  annexes  loft conversions  subbasements  bijou flatlets  ecclesiastical infilling and trans temporal timesharing  since no god would dream of living outside the holy quarter or  as it had become  three eighths .  there were usually three hundred different types of incense being burned and the noise was normally at pain threshold because of all the priests vying with each other to call their share of the faithful to prayer .   but this street was deathly quiet  that particularly unpleasant quiet that comes when hundreds of frightened and angry people are standing very still .   a man at the edge of the crowd turned around and scowled at the newcomers .  he had a red star painted on his forehead .      what   s       rincewind began  and stopped as his voice seemed far too loud     what   s this .         you   re strangers .     said the man .      actually we know one another quite       twoflower began  and fell silent .  bethan pointed up the street .   every temple had a star painted on it .  there was a particularly big one daubed across the stone eye outside the temple of blind io  leader of the gods .      urgh     said rincewind .     io is going to be really pissed when he sees that .  i don   t think we ought to hang around here  friends .      the crowd was facing a crude platform that had been built in the center of the wide street .  a big banner had been draped across the front of it .      i always heard that blind io can see everything that happens everywhere     said bethan quietly .     why hasn   t           quiet .     said the man beside them .     dahoney speaks .      a figure had stepped up on the platform  a tall thin man with hair like a dandelion .  there was no cheer from the crowd  just a collective sigh .  he began to speak .   rincewind listened in mounting horror .  where were the gods .  said the man .  they had gone .  perhaps they had never been .  who  actually  could remember seeing them .  and now the star had been sent     it went on and on  a quiet  clear voice that used words like    cleanse    and    scouring    and    purify    and drilled into the brain like a hot sword .  where were the wizards .  where was magic .  had it ever really worked  or had it all been a dream .   rincewind began to be really afraid that the gods might get to hear about this and be so angry that they   d take it out on anyone who happened to have been around at the time .   but somehow even the wrath of the gods would have been better than the sound of that voice .  the star was coming  it seemed to say  and its fearful fire could only be averted by   by   rincewind couldn   t be certain  but he had visions of swords and banners and blank eyed warriors .  the voice didn   t believe in gods  which in rincewind   s book was fair enough  but it didn   t believe in people either .   a tall  hooded stranger on rincewind   s left jostled him .  he turned   and looked up into a grinning skull under a black hood .   wizards  like cats  can see death .   compared to the sound of that voice  death seemed almost pleasant .  he leaned against a wall  his scythe propped up beside him .  he nodded at rincewind .      come to gloat .     whispered rincewind .  death shrugged .   i have come to see the future  he said .      this is the future .      a future  said death .      it   s horrible     said rincewind .   i   m inclined to agree  said death .      i would have thought you   d be all for it .      not like this .  the death of the warrior or the old man or the little child  this i understand  and i take away the pain and end the suffering .  i do not understand this death of the mind .      who are you talking to .     said twoflower .  several members of the congregation had turned around and were looking suspiciously at rincewind .      nobody     said rincewind .     can we go away .  i   ve got a headache .      now a group of people at the edge of the crowd were muttering and pointing to them .  rincewind grabbed the other two and hurried them around the corner .      mount up and let   s go     he said .     i   ve got a bad feeling that        a hand landed on his shoulder .  he turned around .  a pair of cloudy gray eyes set in a round bald head on top of a large muscular body were staring hard at his left ear .  the man had a star painted on his forehead .      you look like a wizard     he said  in a tone of voice that suggested this was very unwise and quite possibly fatal .      who  me .  no  i   m   a clerk .  yes .  a clerk .  that   s right     said rincewind .   he gave a little laugh .   the man paused  his lips moving soundlessly  as though he was listening to a voice in his head .  several other star people had joined him .  rincewind   s left ear began to be widely regarded .      i think you   re a wizard     said the man .      look     said rincewind     if i was a wizard i   d be able to do magic  right .  i   d just turn you into something  and i haven   t  so i   m not .         we killed all our wizards     said one of the men .     some ran away  but we killed quite a lot .  they waved their hands and nothing came out .      rincewind stared at him .      and we think you   re a wizard too     said the man holding rincewind in an ever tightening grip .     you   ve got the box on legs and you look like a wizard .      rincewind became aware that the three of them and the luggage had somehow become separated from their horses  and that they were now in a contracting circle of gray faced  solemn people .   bethan had gone pale .  even twoflower  whose ability to recognize danger was as good as rincewind   s ability to fly  was looking worried .   rincewind took a deep breath .   he raised his hands in the classic pose he   d learned years before  and rasped     stand back .  or i   ll fill you full of magic .         the magic has faded     said the man .     the star has taken it away .  all the false wizards said their funny words and then nothing happened and they looked at their hands in horror and very few of them  in fact  had the sense to run away .         i mean it .     said rincewind .   he   s going to kill me  he thought .  that   s it .  i can   t even bluff any more .  no good at magic  no good at bluffing  i   m just a     the spell stirred in his mind .  he felt it trickle into his brain like iced water and brace itself .  a cold tingle coursed down his arm .   his arm raised of its own volition  and he felt his own mouth opening and shutting and his own tongue moving as a voice that wasn   t his  a voice that sounded old and dry  said syllables that puffed into the air like steam clouds .   octarine fire flashed from under his fingernails .  it wrapped itself around the horrified man until he was lost in a cold  spitting cloud that rose above the street  hung there for a long moment  and then exploded into nothingness .   there wasn   t even a wisp of greasy smoke .   rincewind stared at his hand in horror .   twoflower and bethan each grabbed him by an arm and hustled him through the shocked crowd until they reached the open street .  there was a painful moment as they each chose to run down a different alley  but they hurried on with rincewind   s feet barely touching the cobbles .      magic     he mumbled excitedly  drunk with power .     i did magic           that   s right     said twoflower soothingly .      would you like me to do a spell .     said rincewind .  he pointed a finger at a passing dog and said    wheeee .     it gave him a hurt look .      making your feet run a lot faster   d be favorite     said bethan grimly .      sure .     slurred rincewind .     feet .  run faster .  hey  look  they   re doing it .         they   ve got more sense than you     said bethan .     which way now .      twoflower peered at the maze of alleyways around them .  there was a lot of shouting going on  some way off .   rincewind lurched out of their grasp  and tottered uncertainly down the nearest alley .      i can do it .     he shouted wildly .     just you all watch out           he   s in shock     said twoflower .      why .         he   s never done a spell before .         but he   s a wizard .         it   s all a bit complicated     said twoflower  running after rincewind .     anyway  i   m not sure that was actually him .  it certainly didn   t sound like him .  come along  old fellow .      rincewind looked at him with wild  unseeing eyes .      i   ll turn you into a rosebush     he said .      yes  yes  jolly good .  just come along     said twoflower soothingly  pulling gently at his arm .   there was a pattering of feet from several alleyways and suddenly a dozen star people were advancing on them .   bethan grabbed rincewind   s limp hand and held it up threateningly .      that   s far enough .     she screamed .      right .     shouted twoflower .     we   ve got a wizard and we   re not afraid to use him .         i mean it .     screamed bethan  spinning rincewind around by his arm  like a capstan .      right .  we   re heavily armed .  what .     said twoflower .      i said  where   s the luggage .     hissed bethan behind rincewind   s back .   twoflower looked around .  the luggage was missing .   rincewind was having the desired effect on the star people  though .  as his hand waved vaguely around they treated it like a rotary scythe and tried to hide behind one another .      well  where   s it gone .         how should i know .     said twoflower .      it   s your luggage .         i often don   t know where my luggage is  that   s what being a tourist is all about     said twoflower .     anyway  it often wanders off by itself .  it   s probably best not to ask why .      it began to dawn on the mob that nothing was actually happening  and that rincewind was in no condition to hurl insults  let alone magical fire .  they advanced  watching his hands cautiously .   twoflower and bethan backed away .  twoflower looked around .      bethan .         what .     said bethan  not taking her eyes off the advancing figures .      this is a dead end .         are you sure .         i think i know a brick wall when i see one     said twoflower reproachfully .      that   s about it  then     said bethan .      do you think perhaps if i explain    .         no .         oh .         i don   t think these are the sort of people who listen to explanations     bethan added .   twoflower stared at them .  he was  as has been mentioned  usually oblivious to personal danger .  against the whole of human experience twoflower believed that if only people would talk to each other  have a few drinks  exchange pictures of their grandchildren  maybe take in a show or something  then everything could be sorted out .  he also believed that people were basically good but sometimes had their bad days .  what was coming down the street was having about the same effect on him as a gorilla in a glass factory .   there was the faintest of sounds behind him  not so much a sound in fact as a change in the texture of the air .   the faces in front of him gaped open  turned  and disappeared rapidly down the alley .      eh .     said bethan  still propping up the now unconscious rincewind .   twoflower was looking the other way  at a big glass window full of strange wares  and a beaded doorway  and a large sign above it all which now said  after its characters had finished writhing into position   skillet  wang  yrxle .  yt  bunglestiff  cwmlad and patel  estblshd  various  purveyors     the jeweler turned the gold slowly over the tiny anvil  tapping the last strangely cut diamond into place .      from a troll   s tooth  you say .     he muttered  squinting closely at his work .      yesh     said cohen     and as i shay  you can have all the resht .     he was fingering a tray of gold rings .      very generous     murmured the jeweler  who was dwarvish and knew a good deal when he saw one .  he sighed .      not much work lately .     said cohen .  he looked out through the tiny window and watched a group of empty eyed people gathered on the other side of the narrow street .      times are hard  yes .         who are all theshe guysh with the starsh painted on .     said cohen .   the dwarf jeweler didn   t look up .      madmen     he said .     they say i should do no work because the star comes .  i tell them stars have never hurt me  i wish i could say the same about people .      cohen nodded thoughtfully as six men detached themselves from the group and came toward the shop .  they were carrying an assortment of weapons  and had a driven  determined look about them .      strange     said cohen .      i am  as you can see  of the dwarvish persuasion     said the jeweler .     one of the magical races  it is said .  the star people believe that the star will not destroy the disc if we turn aside from magic .  they   re probably going to beat me up a bit .  so it goes .      he held up his latest work in a pair of tweezers .      the strangest thing i have ever made     he said     but practical  i can see that .  what did you say they were called again .         din chewersh     said cohen .  he looked at the horseshoe shapes nestling in the wrinkled palm of his hand  then opened his mouth and made a series of painful grunting noises .   the door burst open .  the men strode in and took up positions around the walls .  they were sweating and uncertain  but their leader pushed cohen aside disdainfully and picked up the dwarf by his shirt .      we tole you yesterday  small stuff     he said .     you go out feet down or feet up  we don   t mind .  so now we gonna get really        cohen tapped him on the shoulder .  the man looked around irritably .      what do you want  grandad .     he snarled .   cohen paused until he had the man   s full attention  and then he smiled .  it was a slow  lazy smile  unveiling about three hundred carats of mouth jewelry that seemed to light up the room .      i will count to three     he said  in a friendly tone of voice .     one .  two .     his bony knee came up and buried itself in the man   s groin with a satisfyingly meaty noise  and he half turned to bring the full force of an elbow into the kidneys as the leader collapsed around his private universe of pain .      three     he told the ball of agony on the floor .  cohen had heard of fighting fair  and had long ago decided he wanted no part of it .   he looked up at the other men  and flashed his incredible smile .   they ought to have rushed him .  instead one of them  secure in the knowledge that he had a broadsword and cohen didn   t  sidled crabwise toward him .      oh  no     said cohen  waving his hands .     oh  come on  lad  not like that .      the man looked sideways at him .      not like what .     he asked suspiciously .      you never held a sword before .      the man half turned to his colleagues for reassurance .      not a lot  no     he said .     not often .     he waved his sword menacingly .   cohen shrugged .     i may be going to die  but i should hope i could be killed by a man who could hold his sword like a warrior     he said .   the man looked at his hands .     looks all right     he said  doubtfully .      look  lad  i know a little about these things .  i mean  come here a minute and   do you mind .    right  your left hand goes here  around the pommel  and your right hand goes   that   s right  just here   and the blade goes right into your leg .      as the man screamed and clutched at his foot cohen kicked his remaining leg away and turned to the room at large .      this is getting fiddly     he said .     why don   t you rush me .         that   s right     said a voice by his waist .  the jeweler had produced a very large and dirty ax  guaranteed to add tetanus to all the other terrors of warfare .   the four men gave these odds some consideration  and backed toward the door .      and wipe those silly stars off     said cohen .     you can tell everyone that cohen the barbarian will be very angry if he sees stars like that again  right .      the door slammed shut .  a moment later the ax thumped into it  bounced off  and took a sliver of leather off the toe of cohen   s sandal .      sorry     said the dwarf .     it belonged to my grandad .  i only use it for splitting firewood .      cohen felt his jaw experimentally .  the dine chewers seemed to be settling in quite well .      if i was you  i   d be getting out of here anyway     he said .  but the dwarf was already scuttling around the room  tipping trays of precious metal and gems into a leather sack .  a roll of tools went into one pocket  a packet of finished jewelry went into another  and with a grunt the dwarf stuck his arms through handles on either side of his little forge and heaved it bodily onto his back .      right     he said .     i   m ready .         you   re coming with me .         as far as the city gates  if you don   t mind     he said .     you can   t blame me  can you .         no .  but leave the ax behind .      they stepped out into the afternoon sun and a deserted street .  when cohen opened his mouth little pinpoints of bright light illuminated all the shadows .      i   ve got some friends around here to pick up     he said  and added     i hope they   re all right .  what   s your name .         lackjaw .         is there anywhere around here where i can       cohen paused lovingly  savoring the words      where i can get a steak .         the star people have closed all the inns .  they said it   s wrong to be eating and drinking when           i know  i know     said cohen .     i think i   m beginning to get the hang of it .  don   t they approve of anything .      lackjaw was lost in thought for a moment .     setting fire to things     he said at last .     they   re quite good at that .  books and stuff .  they have these great big bonfires .      cohen was shocked .      bonfires of books .         yes .  horrible  isn   t it .         right     said cohen .  he thought it was appalling .  someone who spent his life living rough under the sky knew the value of a good thick book  which ought to outlast at least a season of cooking fires if you were careful how you tore the pages out .  many a life had been saved on a snowy night by a handful of sodden kindling and a really dry book .  if you felt like a smoke and couldn   t find a pipe  a book was your man every time .   cohen realized people wrote things in books .  it had always seemed to him to be a frivolous waste of paper .      i   m afraid if your friends met them they might be in trouble     said lackjaw sadly as they walked up the street .   they turned the corner and saw the bonfire .  it was in the middle of the street .  a couple of star people were feeding it with books from a nearby house  which had its door smashed in and had been daubed with stars .   news of cohen hadn   t spread too far yet .  the book burners took no notice as he wandered up and leaned against the wall .  curly flakes of burnt paper bounced in the hot air and floated away over the rooftops .      what are you doing .     he said .   one of the star people  a woman  pushed her hair out of her eyes with a soot blackened hand  gazed intently at cohen   s left ear  and said     ridding the disc of wickedness .      two men came out of the building and glared at cohen  or at least at his ear .   cohen reached out and took the heavy book the woman was carrying .  its cover was crusted with strange red and black stones that spelled out what cohen was sure was a word .  he showed it to lackjaw .      the necrotelecomnicon     said the dwarf .     wizards use it .  it   s how to contact the dead  i think .         that   s wizards for you     said cohen .  he felt a page between finger and thumb  it was thin  and quite soft .  the rather unpleasant organic looking writing didn   t worry him at all .  yes  a book like this could be a real friend to a man        yes .  you want something .     he said to one of the star men  who had gripped his arm .      all books of magic must be burned     said the man  but a little uncertainly  because something about cohen   s teeth was giving him a nasty feeling of sanity .      why .     said cohen .      it has been revealed to us .     now cohen   s smile was as wide as all outdoors  and rather more dangerous .      i think we ought to be getting along     said lackjaw nervously .  a party of star people had turned into the street behind them .      i think i would like to kill someone     said cohen  still smiling .      the star directs that the disc must be cleansed     said the man  backing away .      stars can   t talk     said cohen  drawing his sword .      if you kill me a thousand will take my place     said the man  who was now backed against the wall .      yes     said cohen  in a reasonable tone of voice     but that isn   t the point  is it .  the point is  you   ll be dead .      the man   s adam   s apple began to bob like a yo yo .  he squinted down at cohen   s sword .      there is that  yes     he conceded .     tell you what   how about if we put the fire out .         good idea     said cohen .   lackjaw tugged at his belt .  the other star people were running toward them .  there were a lot of them  many of them were armed  and it began to look as though things would become a little more serious .   cohen waved his sword at them defiantly  and turned and ran .  even lackjaw had difficulty in keeping up .      funny     he gasped  as they plunged down another alley     i thought   for a minute   you   d want to stand   and fight them .         blow that   for a   lark .      as they came out into the light at the other end of the alley cohen flung himself against the wall  drew his sword  stood with his head on one side as he judged the approaching footsteps  and then brought the blade around in a dead flat sweep at stomach height .  there was an unpleasant noise and several screams  but by then cohen was well away up the street  moving in the unusual shambling run that spared his bunions .   with lackjaw pounding along grimly beside him he turned off into an inn painted with red stars  jumped onto a table with only a faint whimper of pain  ran along it   while  with almost perfect choreography  lackjaw ran straight underneath without ducking   jumped down at the other end  kicked his way through the kitchens  and came out into another alley .   they scurried around a few more turnings and piled into a doorway .  cohen clung to the wall and wheezed until the little blue and purple lights went away .      well     he panted     what did you get .         um  the cruet     said lackjaw .      just that .         well  i had to go under the table  didn   t i .  you didn   t do so well yourself .      cohen looked disdainfully at the small melon he had managed to skewer in his flight .      this must be pretty tough here     he said  biting through the rind .      want some salt on it .     said the dwarf .   cohen said nothing .  he just stood holding the melon  with his mouth open .   lackjaw looked around .  the cul de sac they were in was empty  except for an old box someone had left against a wall .   cohen was staring at it .  he handed the melon to the dwarf without looking at him and walked out into the sunlight .  lackjaw watched him creep stealthily around the box  or as stealthily as is possible with joints that creaked like a ship under full sail  and prod it once or twice with his sword  but very gingerly  as if he half expected it to explode .      it   s just a box     the dwarf called out .     what   s so special about a box .      cohen said nothing .  he squatted down painfully and peered closely at the lock on the lid .      what   s in it .     said lackjaw .      you wouldn   t want to know     said cohen .     help me up  will you .         yes  but this box           this box     said cohen     this box is       he waved his arms vaguely .      oblong .         eldritch     said cohen mysteriously .      eldritch .         yup .         oh     said the dwarf .  they stood looking at the box for a moment .      cohen .         yes .         what does eldritch mean .         well  eldritch is       cohen paused and looked down irritably .     give it a kick and you   ll see .      lockjaw   s steel capped dwarfboot whammed into the side of the box .  cohen flinched .  nothing else happened .      i see     said the dwarf .     eldritch means wooden .         no     said cohen .     it   it oughtn   t to have done that .         i see     said lackjaw  who didn   t  and was beginning to wish cohen hadn   t gone out into all this hot sunlight .     it ought to have run away  you think .         yes .  or bitten your leg off .         ah     said the dwarf .  he took cohen gently by the arm .     it   s nice and shady over here     he said .     why don   t you just have a little        cohen shook him off .      it   s watching that wall     he said .     look  that   s why it   s not taking any notice of us .  it   s staring at the wall .         yes  that   s right     said lackjaw soothingly .     of course it   s watching that wall with its little eyes           don   t be an idiot  it hasn   t got any eyes     snapped cohen .      sorry  sorry     said lackjaw hurriedly .     it   s watching the wall without eyes  sorry .         i think it   s worried about something     said cohen .      well  it would be  wouldn   t it     said lackjaw .     i expect it just wants us to go off somewhere and leave it alone .         i think it   s very puzzled     cohen added .      yes  it certainly looks puzzled     said the dwarf .  cohen glared at him .      how can you tell .     he snapped .   it struck lackjaw that the roles were unfairly reversing .  he looked from cohen to the box  his mouth opening and shutting .      how can you tell .     he said .  but cohen wasn   t listening anyway .  he sat down in front of the box  assuming that the bit with the keyhole was the front  and watched it intently .  lackjaw backed away .  funny  said his mind  but the damn thing is looking at me .      all right     said cohen     i know you and me don   t see eye to eye  but we   re all trying to find someone we care for  okay .         i   m       said lackjaw  and realized that cohen was talking to the box .      so tell me where they   ve gone .      as lackjaw looked on in horror the luggage extended its little legs  braced itself  and ran full tilt at the nearest wall .  clay bricks and dusty mortar exploded around it .   cohen peered through the hole .  there was a small grubby storeroom on the other side .  the luggage stood in the middle of the floor  radiating extreme bafflement .         shop .     said twoflower .      anyone here .     said bethan .      urrgh     said rincewind .      i think we ought to sit him down somewhere and get him a glass of water     said twoflower .     if there   s one here .         there   s everything else     said bethan .   the room was full of shelves  and the shelves were full of everything .  things that couldn   t be accommodated on them hung in bunches from the dark and shadowy ceiling  boxes and sacks of everything spilled onto the floor .   there was no sound from outside .  bethan looked around and found out why .      i   ve never seen so much stuff     said twoflower .      there   s one thing it   s out of stock of     said bethan  firmly .      how can you tell .         you just have to look .  it   s fresh out of exits .      twoflower turned around .  where the door and window had been there were shelves stacked with boxes  they looked as though they had been there for a long time .   twoflower sat rincewind down on a rickety chair by the counter and poked doubtfully at the shelves .  there were boxes of nails  and hairbrushes .  there were bars of soap  faded with age .  there was a stack of jars containing deliquescent bath salts  to which someone had fixed a rather sad and jaunty little notice announcing  in the face of all the evidence  that one would make an ideal gift .  there was also quite a lot of dust .   bethan peered at the shelves on the other wall  and laughed .      would you look at this .     she said .   twoflower looked .  she was holding a   well  it was a little mountain chalet  but with seashells stuck all over it  and then the perpetrator had written    a special souvenir    in pokerwork on the roof  which  of course  opened so that cigarettes could be kept in it  and played a tinny little tune  .      have you ever seen anything like it .     she said .   twoflower shook his head .  his mouth dropped open .      are you all right .     said bethan .      i think it   s the most beautiful thing i   ve ever seen     he said .   there was a whirring noise overhead .  they looked up .   a big black globe had lowered itself from the darkness of the ceiling .  little red lights flashed on and off on it  and as they stared it spun around and looked at them with a big glass eye .  it was menacing  that eye .  it seemed to suggest very emphatically that it was watching something distasteful .      hallo .     said twoflower .   a head appeared over the edge of the counter .  it looked angry .      i hope you were intending to pay for that     it said nastily .  its expression suggested that it expected rincewind to say yes  and that it wouldn   t believe him .      this .     said bethan .     i wouldn   t buy this if you threw in a hatful of rubies and           i   ll buy it .  how much .     said twoflower urgently  reaching into his pockets .  his face fell .      actually  i haven   t got any money     he said .     it   s in my luggage  but i        there was a snort .  the head disappeared from behind the counter  and reappeared from behind a display of toothbrushes .   it belonged to a very small man almost hidden behind a green apron .  he seemed very upset .      no money .     he said .     you come into my shop           we didn   t mean to     said twoflower quickly .     we didn   t notice it was there .         it wasn   t     said bethan firmly .     it   s magical  isn   t it .      the small shopkeeper hesitated .      yes     he reluctantly agreed .     a bit .         a bit .     said bethan .     a bit magical .         quite a bit  then     he conceded  backing away  and     all right     he agreed  as bethan continued to glare at him .     it   s magical .  i can   t help it .  the bloody door hasn   t been and gone again  has it .         yes  and we   re not happy about that thing in the ceiling .      he looked up  and frowned .  then he disappeared through a little beaded doorway half hidden among the merchandise .  there was a lot of clanking and whirring  and the black globe disappeared into the shadows .  it was replaced by  in succession  a bunch of herbs  a mobile advertising something twoflower had never heard of but which was apparently a bedtime drink  a suit of armor and a stuffed crocodile with a lifelike expression of extreme pain and surprise .   the shopkeeper reappeared .      better .     he demanded .      it   s an improvement     said twoflower  doubtfully .     i liked the herbs best .      at this point rincewind groaned .  he was about to wake up .      there have been three general theories put forward to explain the phenomenon of the wandering shops or  as they are generically known  tabernae vagantes .   the first postulates that many thousands of years ago there evolved somewhere in the multiverse a race whose single talent was to buy cheap and sell dear .  soon they controlled a vast galactic empire or  as they put it  emporium  and the more advanced members of the species found a way to equip their very shops with unique propulsion units that could break the dark walls of space itself and open up vast new markets .  and long after the worlds of the emporium perished in the heat death of their particular universe  after one last defiant fire sale  the wandering starshops still ply their trade  eating their way through the pages of spacetime like a worm through a three volume novel .   the second is that they are the creation of a sympathetic fate  charged with the role of supplying exactly the right thing at the right time .   the third is that they are simply a very clever way of getting around the various sunday closing acts .   all these theories  diverse as they are  have two things in common .  they explain the observed facts  and they are completely and utterly wrong .      rincewind opened his eyes and lay for a moment looking up at the stuffed reptile .  it was not the best thing to see when awakening from troubled dreams     magic .  so that   s what it felt like .  no wonder wizards didn   t have much truck with sex .   rincewind knew what orgasms were  of course  he   d had a few in his time  sometimes even in company  but nothing in his experience even approximated to that tight  hot moment when every nerve in his body streamed with blue white fire and raw magic had blazed forth from his fingers .  it filled you and lifted you and you surfed down the rising  curling wave of elemental force .  no wonder wizards fought for power     and so on .  the spell in his head had been doing it  though  not rincewind .  he was really beginning to hate that spell .  he was sure that if it hadn   t frightened away all the other spells he   d tried to learn he could have been a decent wizard in his own right .   somewhere in rincewind   s battered soul the worm of rebellion flashed a fang .   right  he thought .  you   re going back into the octavo  first chance i get .   he sat up .      where the hell is this .     he said  grabbing his head to stop it exploding .      a shop     said twoflower mournfully .      i hope it sells knives because i think i   d like to cut my head off     said rincewind .  something about the expression of the two opposite him sobered him up .      that was a joke     he said .     mainly a joke  anyway .  why are we in this shop .         we can   t get out     said bethan .      the door   s disappeared     added twoflower helpfully .   rincewind stood up  a little shakily .      oh     he said .     one of those shops .         all right     said the shopkeeper testily .     it   s magical  yes  it moves around  yes  no  i   m not telling you why           can i have a drink of water  please .     said rincewind .   the shopkeeper looked affronted .      first no money  then they want a glass of water     he snapped .     that   s just about        bethan snorted and strode across to the little man  who tried to back away .  he was too late .   she picked him up by his apron straps and glared at him eye to eye .  torn though her dress was  disarrayed though her hair was  she became for a moment the symbol of every woman who has caught a man with his thumb on the scales of life .      time is money     she hissed .     i   ll give you thirty seconds to get him a glass of water .  i think that   s a bargain  don   t you .         i say     twoflower whispered .     she   s a real terror when she   s roused  isn   t she .         yes     said rincewind  without enthusiasm .      all right  all right     said the shopkeeper  visibly cowed .      and then you can let us out     bethan added .      that   s fine by me  i wasn   t open for business anyway  i just stopped for a few seconds to get my bearings and you barged in .      he grumbled off through the bead curtains and returned with a cup of water .      i washed it out special     he said  avoiding bethan   s gaze .   rincewind looked at the liquid in the cup .  it had probably been clean before it was poured in  now drinking it would be genocide for thousands of innocent germs .   he put it down carefully .      now i   m going to have a good wash .     stated bethan  and stalked off through the curtain .   the shopkeeper waved a hand vaguely and looked appealingly at rincewind and twoflower .      she   s not bad     said twoflower .     she   s going to marry a friend of ours .         does he know .         things not so good in the starshop business .     said rincewind  as sympathetically as he could manage .   the little man shuddered .     you wouldn   t believe it     he said .     i mean  you learn not to expect much  you make a sale here and there  it   s a living  you know what i mean .  but these people you   ve got these days  the ones with these star things painted on their faces  well  i hardly have time to open the store and they   re threatening to burn it down .  too magical  they say .  so i say  of course magical  what else .         are there a lot of them about  then .     said rincewind .      all over the disc  friend .  don   t ask me why .         they believe a star is going to crash into the disc     said rincewind .      is it .         lots of people think so .         that   s a shame .  i   ve done good business here .  too magical  they say .  what   s wrong with magic  that   s what i   d like to know .         what will you do .     said twoflower .      oh  go to some other universe  there   s plenty around     said the shopkeeper airily .     thanks for telling me about the star  though .  can i drop you off somewhere .      the spell gave rincewind   s mind a kick .      er  no     he said     i think perhaps we   d better stay .  to see it through  you know .         you   re not worried about this star thing  then .         the star is life  not death     said rincewind .      how   s that .         how   s what .         you did it again .     said twoflower  pointing an accusing finger .     you say things and then don   t know you   ve said them .         i just said we   d better stay     said rincewind .      you said the star was life  not death     said twoflower .     your voice went all crackly and far away .  didn   t it .     he turned to the shopkeeper for confirmation .      that   s true     said the little man .     i thought his eyes crossed a bit  too .         it   s the spell  then     said rincewind .     it   s trying to take me over .  it knows what   s going to happen  and i think it wants to go to ankh morpork .  i want to go too     he added defiantly .     can you get us there .         is that the big city on the ankh .  sprawling place  smells of cesspits .         it has an ancient and honorable history     said rincewind  his voice stiff with injured civic pride .      that   s not how you described it to me     said twoflower .     you told me it was the only city that actually started out decadent .      rincewind looked embarrassed .     yes  but  well  it   s my home  don   t you see .         no     said the shopkeeper     not really .  i always say home is where you hang your hat .         um  no     said twoflower  always anxious to enlighten .     where you hang your hat is a hatstand .  a home is           i   ll just go and see about setting you on your way     said the shopkeeper hurriedly  as bethan came in .  he scooted past her .   twoflower followed him .   on the other side of the curtain was a room with a small bed  a rather grubby stove  and a three legged table .  then the shopkeeper did something to the table  there was a noise like a cork coming reluctantly out of a bottle  and the room contained a wall to wall universe .      don   t be frightened     said the shopkeeper  as stars streamed past .      i   m not frightened     said twoflower  his eyes sparkling .      oh     said the shopkeeper  slightly annoyed .     anyway  it   s just imagery generated by the shop  it   s not real .         and you can go anywhere .         oh no     said the shopkeeper  deeply shocked .     there   s all kinds of fail safes built in  after all  there   d be no point in going somewhere with insufficient per capita disposable income .  and there   s got to be a suitable wall  of course .  ah  here we are  this is your universe .  very bijou  i always think .  a sort of universette            here is the blackness of space  the myriad stars gleaming like diamond dust or  as some people would say  like great balls of exploding hydrogen a very long way off .  but then  some people would say anything .   a shadow starts to blot out the distant glitter  and it is blacker than space itself .   from here it also looks a great deal bigger  because space is not really big  it is simply somewhere to be big in .  planets are big  but planets are meant to be big and there is nothing clever about being the right size .   but this shape blotting out the sky like the footfall o god isn   t a planet .   it is a turtle  ten thousand miles long from its crater pocked head to its armored tail .   and great a   tuin is huge .   great flippers rise and fall ponderously  warping space into strange shapes .  the discworld slides across the sky like a royal barge .  but even great a   tuin is struggling now as it leaves the free depths of space and must fight the tormenting pressures of the solar shallows .  magic is weaker here  on the littoral of light .  many more days of this and the discworld will be stripped away by the pressures of reality .   great a   tuin knows this  but great a   tuin can recall doing all this before  many thousands of years ago .   the astrochelonian   s eyes  glowing red in the light of the dwarf star  are not focused on it but at a little patch of space nearby           yes  but where are we .     said twoflower .  the shopkeeper  hunched over his table  just shrugged .      i don   t think we   re anywhere     he said .     we   re in a cotangent incongruity  i believe .  i could be wrong .  the shop generally knows what it   s doing .         you mean you don   t .         i pick a bit up  here and there .     the shopkeeper blew his nose .     sometimes i land on a world where they understand these things .     he turned a pair of small  sad eyes on twoflower .     you   ve got a kind face  sir .  i don   t mind telling you .         telling me what .         it   s no life  you know  minding the shop .  never settling down  always on the move  never closing .         why don   t you stop  then .         ah  that   s it  you see  sir   i can   t .  i   m under a curse  i am .  a terrible thing .     he blew his nose again .      cursed to run a shop .         forever  sir  forever .  and never closing .  for hundreds of years .  there was this sorcerer  you see .  i did a terrible thing .         in a shop .     said twoflower .      oh  yes .  i can   t remember what it was he wanted  but when he asked for it i   i gave one of those sucking in noises  you know  like whistling only backward .     he demonstrated .   twoflower looked somber  but he was at heart a kind man and always ready to forgive .      i see     he said slowly .     even so           that   s not all .         oh .         i told him there was no demand for it .         after making the sucking noise .         yes .  i probably grinned  too .         oh  dear .  you didn   t call him squire  did you .         i   i may have done .         um .         there   s more .         surely not .         yes  i said i could order it and he could come back next day .         that doesn   t sound too bad     said twoflower  who alone of all the people in the multiverse allowed shops to order things for him and didn   t object at all to paying quite large sums of money to reimburse the shopkeeper for the inconvenience of having a bit of stock in his store often for several hours .      it was early closing day     said the shopkeeper .      oh .         yes  and i heard him rattling the doorhandle  i had this sign on the door  you know  it said something like    closed even for the sale of necromancer cigarettes     anyway  i heard him banging and i laughed .         you laughed .         yes .  like this .  hnufhnufhnufblort .         probably not a wise thing to do     said twoflower  shaking his head .      i know  i know .  my father always said  he said  do not peddle in the affairs of wizards   anyway  i heard him shouting something about never closing again  and a lot of words i couldn   t understand  and then the shop   the shop   the shop came alive .         and you   ve wandered like this ever since .         yes .  i suppose one day i might find the sorcerer and perhaps the thing he wanted will be in stock .  until then i must go from place to place           that was a terrible thing to do     said twoflower .   the shopkeeper wiped his nose on his apron .     thank you     he said .      even so  he shouldn   t have cursed you quite so badly     twoflower added .      oh .  yes  well .     the shopkeeper straightened his apron and made a brave little attempt to pull himself together .     anyway  this isn   t getting you to ankh morpork  is it .         funny thing is     said twoflower     that i bought my luggage in a shop like this  once .  another shop  i mean .         oh yes  there   s several of us     said the shopkeeper  turning back to the table     that sorcerer was a very impatient man  i understand .         endlessly roaming through the universe     mused twoflower .      that   s right .  mind you  there is a saving on the rates .         rates .         yes  they   re       the shopkeeper paused  and wrinkled his forehead .     i can   t quite remember  it was such a long time ago .  rates  rates           very large mice .         that   s probably it .            hold on   it   s thinking about something     said cohen .   lackjaw looked up wearily .  it had been quite nice  sitting here in the shade .  he had just worked out that in trying to escape from a city of crazed madmen he had appeared to have allowed one mad man to give him his full attention .  he wondered whether he would live to regret this .   he earnestly hoped so .      oh yes  it   s definitely thinking     he said bitterly .     anyone can see that .         i think it   s found them .         oh  good .         hold onto it .         are you mad .     said lackjaw .      i know this thing  trust me .  anyway  would you rather be left with all these star people .  they might be interested in having a talk with you .      cohen sidled over to the luggage  and then flung himself astride it .  it took no notice .      hurry up     he said .     i think it   s going to go .      lackjaw shrugged  and climbed on gingerly behind cohen .      oh .     he said     and how does it g           ankh morpork .   pearl of cities .   this is not a completely accurate description  of course   it was not round and shiny   but even its worst enemies would agree that if you had to liken ankh morpork to anything  then it might as well be a piece of rubbish covered with the diseased secretions of a dying mollusc .   there have been bigger cities .  there have been richer cities .  there have certainly been prettier cities .  but no city in the multiverse could rival ankh morpork for its smell .   the ancient ones  who know everything about all the universes and have smelled the smells of calcutta and  . xrc    .  and dauntocum marsport  have agreed that even these fine examples of nasal poetry are mere limericks when set against the glory of the ankh morpork smell .   you can talk about ramps .  you can talk about garlic .  you can talk about france .  go on .  but if you haven   t smelled ankh morpork on a hot day you haven   t smelled anything .   the citizens are proud of it .  they carry chairs outside to enjoy it on a really good day .  they puff out their cheeks and slap their chests and comment cheerfully on its little distinctive nuances .  they have even put up a statue to it  to commemorate the time when the troops of a rival state tried to invade by stealth one dark night and managed to get to the top of the walls before  to their horror  their nose plugs gave out .  rich merchants who have spent many years abroad sent back home for specially stoppered and sealed bottles of the stuff  which brings tears to their eyes .   it has that kind of effect .   there is only really one way to describe the effect the smell of ankh morpork has on the visiting nose  and that is by analogy .   take a tartan .  sprinkle it with confetti .  light it with strobe lights .   now take a chameleon .   put the chameleon on the tartan .   watch it closely .   see .   which explains why  when the shop finally materialized in ankh morpork  rincewind sat bolt upright and said    we   re here     bethan went pale and twoflower  who had no sense of smell  said     really .  how can you tell .      it had been a long afternoon .  they had broken into realspace in a number of walls in a variety of cities because  according to the shopkeeper  the disc   s magical field was playing up and upsetting everything .   all the cities were empty of most of their citizens and belonged to roaming gangs of crazed left ear people .      where do they all come from .     said twoflower  as they fled yet another mob .      inside every sane person there   s a madman struggling to get out     said the shopkeeper .     that   s what i   ve always thought .  no one goes mad quicker than a totally sane person .         that doesn   t make sense     said bethan     or if it makes sense  i don   t like it .      the star was bigger than the sun .  there would be no night tonight .  on the opposite horizon the disc   s own sunlet was doing its best to set normally  but the general effect of all that red light was to make the city  never particularly beautiful  look like something painted by a fanatical artist after a bad time on the shoe polish .   but it was home .  rincewind peered up and down the empty street and felt almost happy .   at the back of his mind the spell was kicking up a ruckus  but he ignored it .  maybe it was true that magic was getting weaker as the star got nearer  or perhaps he   d had the spell in his head for so long he had built up some kind of psychic immunity  but he found he could resist it .      we   re in the docks     he declared .     just smell that sea air .         oh     said bethan  leaning against the wall     yes .         that   s ozone  that is     said rincewind .     that   s air with character  is that .     he breathed deeply .   twoflower turned to the shopkeeper .      well  i hope you find your sorcerer     he said .     sorry we didn   t buy anything  but all my money   s in my luggage  you see .      the shopkeeper pushed something into his hand .      a little gift     he said .     you   ll need it .      he darted back into his shop  the bell jangled  the sign saying call again tomorrow for spoonfetcher   s leeches  the little suckers banged forlornly against the door  and the shop faded into the brickwork as though it had never been .  twoflower reached out gingerly and touched the wall  not quite believing it .      what   s in the bag .     said rincewind .   it was a thick brown paper bag  with string handles .      if it sprouts legs i don   t want to know about it     said bethan .   twoflower peered inside  and pulled out the contents .      is that all .     said rincewind .     a little house with shells on .         it   s very useful     said twoflower defensively .     you can keep cigarettes in it .         and they   re what you really need  are they .     said rincewind .      i   d plump for a bottle of really strong suntan oil     said bethan .      come on     said rincewind  and set off down the street .  the others followed .   it occurred to twoflower that some words of comfort were called for  a little tactful small talk to take bethan out of herself  as he would put it  and generally cheer her up .      don   t worry     he said .     there   s just a chance that cohen might still be alive .         oh  i expect he   s alive all right     she said  stamping along the cobbles as if she nursed a personal grievance against each one of them .     you don   t live to be eighty seven in his job if you go around dying all the time .  but he   s not here .         nor is my luggage     said twoflower .     of course  that   s not the same thing .         do you think the star is going to hit the disc .         no     said twoflower confidently .      why not .         because rincewind doesn   t think so .      she looked at him in amazement .      you see     the tourist went on     you know that thing you do with seaweed .      bethan  brought up on the vortex plains  had only heard of the sea in stories  and had decided she didn   t like it .  she looked blank .      eat it .         no  what you do is  you hang it up outside your door  and it tells you if it   s going to rain .      another thing bethan had learned was that there was no real point in trying to understand anything twoflower said  and that all anyone could do was run alongside the conversation and hope to jump on as it turned a corner .      i see     she said .      rincewind is like that  you see .         like seaweed .         yes .  if there was anything at all to be frightened about  he   d be frightened .  but he   s not .  the star is just about the only thing i   ve ever seen him not frightened of .  if he   s not worried  then take it from me  there   s nothing to worry about .         it   s not going to rain .     said bethan .      well  no .  metaphorically speaking .         oh .     bethan decided not to ask what    metaphorically    meant  in case it was something to do with seaweed .   rincewind turned around .      come on     he said .     not far now .         where to .     said twoflower .      unseen university  of course .         is that wise .         probably not  but i   m still going       rincewind paused  his face a mask of pain .  he put his hand to his ears and groaned .      spell giving you trouble .         yargh .         try humming .      rincewind grimaced .     i   m going to get rid of this thing     he said thickly .     it   s going back into the book where it belongs .  i want my head back .         but then       twoflower began  and stopped .  they could all hear it   a distant chanting and the stamping of many feet .      do you think it   s star people .     said bethan .   it was .  the lead marchers came around a corner a hundred yards away  behind a ragged white banner with an eight pointed star on it .      not just star people     said twoflower .     all kinds of people .      the crowd swept them up in its passage .  one moment they were standing in the deserted street  the next they were perforce moving with a tide of humanity that bore them onward through the city .      torchlight flickered easily on the damp tunnels far under the university as the heads of the eight orders of wizardry filed onward .      at least it   s cool down here     said one .      we shouldn   t be down here .      trymon  who was leading the party  said nothing .  but he was thinking very hard .  he was thinking about the bottle of oil in his belt  and the eight keys the wizards carried   eight keys that would fit the eight locks that chained the octavo to its lectern .  he was thinking that old wizards who sense that magic is draining away are preoccupied with their own problems and are perhaps less alert than they should be .  he was thinking that within a few minutes the octavo  the greatest concentration of magic on the disc  would be under his hands .   despite the coolness of the tunnel he began to sweat .   they came to a lead lined door set in the sheer stone .  trymon took a heavy key   a good  honest iron key  not like the twisted and disconcerting keys that would unlock the octavo   gave the lock a squirt of oil  inserted the key  turned it .  the lock squeaked open protestingly .      are we of one resolve .     said trymon .  there was a series of vaguely affirmative grunts .   he pushed at the door .   a warm gale of thick and somehow oily air rolled over them .  the air was filled with a high pitched and unpleasant chittering .  tiny sparks of octarine fire flared off every nose  fingernail and beard .   the wizards  their heads bowed against the storm of randomized magic that blew out of the room  pushed forward .  half formed shapes giggled and fluttered around them as the nightmare inhabitants of the dungeon dimensions constantly probed  with things that passed for fingers only because they were at the ends of their arms  for an unguarded entry into the circle of firelight that passed for the universe of reason and order .   even at this bad time for all things magical  even in a room designed to damp down all magical vibrations  the octavo was still crackling with power .   there was no real need for the torches .  the octavo filled the room with a dull  sullen light  which wasn   t strictly light at all but the opposite of light  darkness isn   t the opposite of light  it is simply its absence  and what was radiating from the book was the light that lies on the far side of darkness  the light fantastic .   it was a rather disappointing purple color .   as has been noted before  the octavo was chained to a lectern carved into the shape of something that looked vaguely avian  slightly reptilian and horribly alive .  two glittering eyes regarded the wizards with hooded hatred .      i saw it move     said one of them .      we   re safe so long as we don   t touch the book     said trymon .  he pulled a scroll out of his belt and unrolled it .      bring that torch here     he said     and put that cigarette out .      he waited for the explosion of infuriated pride .  but none came .  instead  the offending mage removed the dogend from his lips with trembling fingers and ground it into the floor .   trymon exulted .  so  he thought  they do what i say .  just for now  maybe   but just for now is enough .   he peered at the crabby writing of a wizard long dead .      right     he said     let   s see     to appease yt  the thynge that ys the guardian              the crowd surged over one of the bridges that linked morpork with ankh .  below it the river  turgid at the best of times  was a mere trickle which steamed .   the bridge shook under their feet rather more than it should .  strange ripples ran across the muddy remains of the river .  a few tiles slid off the roof of a nearby house .      what was that .     said twoflower .   bethan looked behind them  and screamed .   the star was rising .  as the disc   s own sun scurried for safety below the horizon the great bloated ball of the star climbed slowly into the sky until the whole of it was several degrees above the edge of the world .   they pulled rincewind into the safety of a doorway .  the crowd hardly noticed them  but ran on  terrified as lemmings .      the star   s got spots on     said twoflower .      no     said rincewind .     they   re   things .  things going around the star .  like the sun goes around the disc .  but they   re close in  because  because       he paused .     i nearly know .         know what .         i   ve got to get rid of this spell .         which way is the university .     said bethan .      this way .     said rincewind  pointing along the street .      it must be very popular .  that   s where everyone   s going .         i wonder why .     said twoflower .      somehow     said rincewind     i don   t think it   s to enroll for evening classes .      in fact unseen university was under siege  or at least those parts of it that extruded into the usual  everyday dimensions were under siege .  the crowds outside its gates were  generally  making one of two demands .  they were demanding that either a  the wizards should stop messing about and get rid of the star or  and this was the demand favored by the star people  that b  they should cease all magic and commit suicide in good order  thus ridding the disc of the curse of magic and warding off the terrible threat in the sky .   the wizards on the other side of the walls had no idea how to do a  and no intention of doing b  and many had in fact plumped for c   which largely consisted of nipping out of hidden side doors and having it away on their toes as far as possible  if not faster .   what reliable magic still remained in the university was being channeled into keeping the great gates secure .  the wizards were learning that while it was all very fine and impressive to have a set of gates that were locked by magic  it ought to have occurred to the builders to include some sort of emergency backup device such as  for example  a pair of ordinary  unimpressive stout iron bolts .   in the square outside the gates several large bonfires had been lit  for effect as much as anything else  because the heat from the star was scorching .      but you can still see the stars     said twoflower     the other stars  i mean .  the little ones .  in a black sky .      rincewind ignored him .  he was looking at the gates .  a group of star people and citizens were trying to batter them down .      it   s hopeless     said bethan .     we   ll never get in .  where are you going .         for a walk     said rincewind .  he was setting off determinedly down a side street .   there were one or two freelance rioters here  mostly engaged in wrecking shops .  rincewind took no notice  but followed the wall until it ran parallel to a dark alley that had the usual unfortunate smell of all alleys  everywhere .   then he started looking very closely at the stonework .  the wall here was twenty feet high  and topped with cruel metal spikes .      i need a knife     he said .      you   re going to cut your way through .     said bethan .      just find me a knife     said rincewind .  he started to tap stones .   twoflower and bethan looked at each other  and shrugged .  a few minutes later they returned with a selection of knives  and twoflower had even managed to find a sword .      we just helped ourselves     said bethan .      but we left some money     said twoflower .     i mean  we would have left some money  if we   d had any           so he insisted on writing a note     said bethan wearily .   twoflower drew himself up to his full height  which was hardly worth it .      i see no reason       he began  stiffly .      yes  yes     said bethan  sitting down glumly .     i know you don   t .  rincewind  all the shops have been smashed open  there was a whole bunch of people across the street helping themselves to musical instruments  can you believe that .         yeah     said rincewind  picking up a knife and testing its blade thoughtfully .     luters  i expect .      he thrust the blade into the wall  twisted it  and stepped back as a heavy stone fell out .  he looked up  counting under his breath  and levered another stone from its socket .      how did you do that .     said twoflower .      just give me a leg up  will you .     said rincewind .  a moment later  his feet wedged into the holes he had created  he was making further steps halfway up the wall .      it   s been like this for centuries     his voice floated down .     some of the stones haven   t got any mortar .  secret entrance  see .  watch out below .      another stone cracked into the cobbles .      students made it long ago     said rincewind .     handy way in and out after lights out .         ah     said twoflower     i understand .  over the wall and out to brightly lit tavernas to drink and sing and recite poetry  yes .         nearly right except for the singing and the poetry  yes     said rincewind .     a couple of these spikes should be loose       there was a clang .      there   s not much of a drop this side     came his voice after a few seconds .     come on  then .  if you   re coming .         and so it was that rincewind  twoflower and bethan entered unseen university .   elsewhere on the campus     the eight wizards inserted their keys and  with many a worried glance at one another  turned them .  there was a faint little snicking sound as the lock slid open .   the octavo was unchained .  a faint octarine light played across its bindings .   trymon reached out and picked it up  and none of the others objected .  his arm tingled .   he turned toward the door .      now to the great hall  brothers     he said     if i may lead the way        and there were no objections .   he reached the door with the book tucked under his arm .  it felt hot  and somehow prickly .   at every step he expected a cry  a protest  and none came .  he had to use every ounce of control to stop himself from laughing .  it was easier than he could have imagined .   the others were halfway across the claustrophobic dungeon by the time he was through the door  and perhaps they had noticed something in the set of his shoulders  but it was too late because he had crossed the threshold  gripped the handle  slammed the door  turned the key  smiled the smile .   he walked easily back along the corridor  ignoring the enraged screams of the wizards who had just discovered how impossible it is to pass spells in a room built to be impervious to magic .   the octavo squirmed  but trymon held it tightly .  now he ran  putting out of his mind the horrible sensations under his arm as the book shape changed into things hairy  skeletal and spiky .  his hand went numb .  the faint chittering noises he had been hearing grew in volume  and there were other sounds behind them   leering sounds  beckoning sounds  sounds made by the voices of unimaginable horrors that trymon found it all too easy to imagine .  as he ran across the great hall and up the main staircase the shadows began to move and reform and close in around him  and he also became aware that something was following  something with skittery legs moving obscenely fast .  ice formed on the walls .  doorways lunged at him as he barreled past .  underfoot the stairs began to feel just like a tongue     not for nothing had trymon spent long hours in the university   s curious equivalent of a gymnasium  building up mental muscle .  don   t trust the senses  he knew  because they can be deceived .  the stairs are there  somewhere   will them to be there  summon them into being as you climb and  boy  you better get good at it .  because this isn   t all imagination .      great a   tuin slowed .   with flippers the size of continents the skyturtle fought the pull of the star  and waited .   there would not be long to wait        rincewind sidled into the great hall .  there were a few torches burning  and it looked as though it had been set up for some sort of magical work .  but the ceremonial candlesticks had been overturned  the complex octograms chalked on the floor were scuffed as if something had danced on them  and the air was full of a smell unpleasant even by ankh morpork   s broad standards .  there was a hint of sulfur to it  but that underlay something worse .  it smelled like the bottom of a pond .   there was a distant crash  and a lot of shouting .      looks like the gates have gone down     said rincewind .      let   s get out of here     said bethan .      the cellars are this way     said rincewind  and set off through an arch .      down there .         yes .  would you rather stay here .      he took a torch from its bracket on the wall and started down the steps .   after a few flights the walls stopped being paneled and were bare stone .  here and there heavy doors had been propped open .      i heard something     said twoflower .   rincewind listened .  there did seem to be a noise coming from the depths below .  it didn   t sound frightening .  it sounded like a lot of people hammering on a door and shouting    oi .         it   s not those things from the dungeon dimensions you were telling us about  is it .     said bethan .      they don   t swear like that     said rincewind .     come on .      they hurried along the dripping passages  following the screamed curses and deep hacking coughs that were somehow reassuring  anything that wheezed like that  the listeners decided  couldn   t possibly represent a danger .   at last they came to a door set in an alcove .  it looked strong enough to hold back the sea .  there was a tiny grille .      hey .     shouted rincewind .  it wasn   t very useful  but he couldn   t think of anything better .   there was a sudden silence .  then a voice from the other side of the door said  very slowly     who is out there .      rincewind recognized that voice .  it had jerked him from daydreams into terror on many a hot classroom afternoon  years before .  it was lemuel panter  who had once made it his personal business to hammer the rudiments of scrying and summoning into young rincewind   s head .  he remembered the eyes like gimlets in a piggy face and the voice saying    and now mister rincewind will come out here and draw the relevant symbol on the board    and the million mile walk past the waiting class as he tried desperately to remember what the voice had been droning on about five minutes before .  even now his throat was going dry with terror and randomized guilt .  the dungeon dimensions just weren   t in it .      please sir  it   s me  sir  rincewind  sir     he squeaked .  he saw twoflower and bethan staring at him  and coughed .     yes     he added  in as deep a voice as he could manage .     that   s who it is .  rincewind .  right .      there was a susurration of whispers on the other side of the door .      rincewind .         prince who .         i remember a boy who wasn   t any           the spell  remember .         rincewind .      there was a pause .  then the voice said     i suppose the key isn   t in the lock  is it .         no     said rincewind .      what did he say .         he said no .         typical of the boy .         um  who is in there .     said rincewind .  .      the masters of wizardry     said the voice  haughtily .      why .      there was another pause  and then a conference of embarrassed whispers .      we  uh  got locked in     said the voice  reluctantly .      what  with the octavo .      whisper  whisper .      the octavo  in fact  isn   t in here  in fact     said the voice slowly .      oh .  but you are .     said rincewind  as politely as possible while grinning like a necrophiliac in a morgue .      that would appear to be the case .         is there anything we can get you .     said twoflower anxiously .      you could try getting us out .         could we pick the lock .     said bethan .      no use     said rincewind .     totally thief proof .         i expect cohen would have been able to     said bethan loyally .     wherever he   s got to .         the luggage would soon smash it down     agreed twoflower .      well  that   s it then     said bethan .     let   s get out into the fresh air .  fresher air  anyway .     she turned to walk away .      hang on  hang on     said rincewind .     that   s just typical  isn   t it .  old rincewind won   t have any ideas  will he .  oh  no  he   s just a makeweight  he is .  kick him as you pass .  don   t rely on him  he   s           all right     said bethan .     let   s hear it  then .            a nonentity  a failure  just a   what .         how are you going to get the door open .     said bethan .   rincewind looked at her with his mouth open .  then he looked at the door .  it really was very solid  and the lock had a smug air .   but he had gotten in  once  long ago .  rincewind the student had pushed at the door and it had swung open  and then a moment later the spell had jumped into his mind and ruined his life .      look     said a voice from behind the grille  as kindly as it could manage .     just go and find us a wizard  there   s a good fellow .      rincewind took a deep breath .      stand back     he rasped .      what .         find something to hide behind     he barked  with his voice shaking only slightly .     you too     he said to bethan and twoflower .      but you can   t           i mean it .         he means it     said twoflower .     that little vein on the side of his forehead  you know  when it throbs like that  well           shut up .      rincewind raised one arm uncertainly and pointed it at the door .   there was total silence .   oh gods  he thought  what happens now .   in the blackness at the back of his mind the spell shifted uneasily .   rincewind tried to get in tune or whatever with the metal of the lock .  if he could sow discord amongst its atoms so that they flew apart     nothing happened .   he swallowed hard  and turned his attention to the wood .  it was old and nearly fossilized  and probably wouldn   t burn even if soaked in oil and dropped into a furnace .  he tried anyway  explaining to the ancient molecules that they should try to jump up and down to keep warm     in the strained silence of his own mind he glared at the spell  which looked very sheepish .   he considered the air around the door itself  how it might best be twisted into weird shapes so that the door existed in another set of dimensions entirely .   the door sat there  defiantly solid .   sweating  his mind beginning the endless walk up to the blackboard in front of the grinning class  he turned desperately to the lock again .  it must be made of little bits of metal  not very heavy     from the grille came the faintest of sounds .  it was the noise of wizards untensing themselves and shaking their heads .   someone whispered     i told you        there was a tiny grinding noise  and a click .   rincewind   s face was a mask .  perspiration dripped off his chin .   there was another click  and the grinding of reluctant spindles .  trymon had oiled the lock  but the oil had been soaked up by the rust and dust of years  and the only way for a wizard to move something by magic  unless he can harness some external movement  is to use the leverage of his mind itself .   rincewind was trying very hard to prevent his brain being pushed out of his ears .   the lock rattled .  metal rods flexed in pitted groves  gave in  pushed levers .   levers clicked  notches engaged .  there was a long drawn out grinding noise that left rincewind on his knees .   the door swung open on pained hinges .  the wizards sidled out cautiously .   twoflower and bethan helped rincewind to his feet .  he stood gray faced and swaying .      not bad     said one of the wizards  looking closely at the lock .     a little slow  perhaps .         never mind that .     snapped jiglad wert .     did you three see anyone on the way down here .         no     said twoflower .      someone has stolen the octavo .      rincewind   s head jerked up .  his eyes focused .      who .         trymon        rincewind swallowed .     tall man .     he said .     fair hair  looks a bit like a ferret .         now that you mention it           he was in my class     said rincewind .     they always said he   d go a long way .         he   ll go a lot further if he opens the book     said one of the wizards  who was hastily rolling a cigarette in shaking fingers .      why .     said twoflower .     what will happen .      the wizards looked at one another .      it   s an ancient secret  handed down from mage to mage  and we can   t pass it on to knowlessmen     said wert .      oh  go on     said twoflower .      oh well  it probably doesn   t matter anymore .  one mind can   t hold all the spells .  it   ll break down  and leave a hole .         what .  in his head .         um .  no .  in the fabric of the universe     said wert .     he might think he can control it by himself  but        they felt the sound before they heard it .  it started off in the stones as a slow vibration  then rose suddenly to a knife edge whine that bypassed the eardrums and bored straight into the brain .  it sounded like a human voice singing  or chanting  or screaming  but there were deeper and more horrible harmonics .   the wizards went pale .  then  as one man  they turned and ran up the steps .   there were crowds outside the building .  some people were holding torches  others had stopped in the act of piling kindling around the walls .  but everyone was staring up at the tower of art .   the wizards pushed their way through the unheeding bodies  and turned to look up .   the sky was full of moons .  each one was three times bigger than the disc   s own moon  and each was in shadow except for a pink crescent where it caught the light of the star .   but in front of everything the top of the tower of art was an incandescent fury .  shapes could be dimly glimpsed within it  but there was nothing reassuring about them .  the sound had changed now to the wasplike buzzing  magnified a million times .   some of the wizards sank to their knees .      he   s done it     said wert  shaking his head .     he   s opened a pathway .         are those things demons .     said twoflower .      oh  demons     said wert .     demons would be a picnic compared with what   s trying to come through up there .         they   re worse than anything we can possibly imagine     said panter .      i can imagine some pretty bad things     said rincewind .      these are worse .         oh .         and what do you propose to do about it .     said a clear voice .   they turned .  bethan was glaring at them  arms folded .      pardon .     said wert .      you   re wizards  aren   t you .     she said .     well  get on with it .         what  tackle that .     said rincewind .      know anyone else .      wert pushed forward .     madam  i don   t think you quite understand           the dungeons dimensions will empty into our universe  right .     said bethan .      well  yes           we   ll all be eaten by things with tentacles for faces  right .         nothing so pleasant  but           and you   re just going to let it happen .         listen     said rincewind .     it   s all over  do you see .  you can   t put the spells back in the book  you can   t unsay what   s been said  you can   t           you can try .      rincewind sighed  and turned to twoflower .   he wasn   t there .  rincewind   s eyes turned inevitably toward the base of the tower of art  and he was just in time to see the tourist   s plump figure  sword inexpertly in hand  as it disappeared into a door .   rincewind   s feet made their own decision and  from the point of view of his head  got it entirely wrong .   the other wizards watched him go .      well .     said bethan .     he   s going .      the wizards tried to avoid one another   s eyes .   eventually wert said     we could try  i suppose .  it doesn   t seem to be spreading .         but we   ve got hardly any magic to speak of     said one of the wizards .      have you got a better idea  then .      one by one  their ceremonial robes glittering in the weird light  the wizards turned and trudged toward the tower .   the tower was hollow inside  with the stone treads of its staircase mortared spiral fashion into the walls .  twoflower was already several turns up by the time rincewind caught him .      hold on     he said  as cheerfully as he could manage .     this sort of thing is a job for the likes of cohen  not you .  no offense .         would he do any good .      rincewind looked up at the actinic light that lanced down through the distant hole at the top of the staircase .      no     he admitted .      then i   d be as good as him  wouldn   t i .     said twoflower  flourishing his looted sword .   rincewind hopped after him  keeping as close to the wall as possible .      you don   t understand .     he shouted .     there   s unimaginable horrors up there .         you always said i didn   t have any imagination .         it   s a point  yes     rincewind conceded     but        twoflower sat down .      look     he said .     i   ve been looking forward to something like this ever since i came here .  i mean  this is an adventure  isn   t it .  alone against the gods  that sort of thing .      rincewind opened and shut his mouth for a few seconds before the right words managed to come out .      can you use a sword .     he said weakly .      i don   t know .  i   ve never tried .         you   re mad .      twoflower looked at him with his head on one side .     you   re a fine one to talk     he said .     i   m here because i don   t know any better  but what about you .     he pointed downward  to where the other wizards were toiling up the stairs .     what about them .      blue light speared down the inside of the tower .  there was a peal of thunder .   the wizards reached them  coughing horribly and fighting for breath .      what   s the plan .     said rincewind .      there isn   t one     said wert .      right .  fine     said rincewind .     i   ll leave you to get on with it  then .         you   ll come with us     said panter .      but i   m not even a proper wizard .  you threw me out  remember .         i can   t think of any student less able     said the old wizard     but you   re here  and that   s the only qualification you need .  come on .      the light flared and went out .  the terrible noises died as if strangled .   silence filled the tower  one of those heavy  pressing silences .      it   s stopped     said twoflower .   something moved  high up against the circle of red sky .  it fell slowly  turning over and over and drifting from side to side .  it hit the stairs a turn above them .   rincewind was first to it .   it was the octavo .  but it lay on the stone as limp and lifeless as any other book  its pages fluttering in the breeze that blew up the tower .   twoflower panted up behind rincewind  and looked down .      they   re blank     he whispered .     every page is completely blank .         then he did it     said wert .     he   s read the spells .  successfully  too .  i wouldn   t have believed it .         there was all that noise     said rincewind doubtfully .     the light  too .  those shapes .  that didn   t sound so successful to me .         oh  you always get a certain amount of extradimensional attention in any great work of magic     said panter dismissively .     it impresses people  nothing more .         it looked like monsters up there     said twoflower  standing closer to rincewind .      monsters .  show me some monsters .     said wert .   instinctively they looked up .  there was no sound .  nothing moved against the circle of light .      i think we should go up and  er  congratulate him     said wert .      congratulate .     exploded rincewind .     he stole the octavo .  he locked you up .      the wizards exchanged knowing looks .      yes  well     said one of them .     when you   ve advanced in the craft  lad  you   ll know that there are times when the important thing is success .         it   s getting there that matters     said wert bluntly .     not how you travel .      they set off up the spiral .   rincewind sat down  scowling at the darkness .   he felt a hand on his shoulder .  it was twoflower  who was holding the octavo .      this is no way to treat a book     he said .     look  he   s bent the spine right back .  people always do that  they   ve got no idea of how to treat them .         yah     said rincewind vaguely .      don   t worry     said twoflower .      i   m not worried  i   m just angry     snapped rincewind .     give me the bloody thing .      he snatched the book and snapped it open viciously .   he rummaged around in the back of his mind  where the spell hung out .      all right     he snarled .     you   ve had your fun  you   ve ruined my life  now get back to where you belong .         but i       protested twoflower .      the spell  i mean the spell     said rincewind .     go on  get back on the page .      he glared at the ancient parchment until his eyes crossed .      then i   ll say you .     he shouted  his voice echoing up the tower .     you can join the rest of them and much good may it do you .      he shoved the book back into twoflower   s arms and staggered off up the steps .   the wizards had reached the top and disappeared from view .  rincewind climbed after them .      lad  am i .     he muttered .     when i   m advanced in the craft  eh .  i just managed to go around with one of the great spells in my head for years without going totally insane  didn   t i .     he considered the last question from all angles .     yes  you did     he reassured himself .     you didn   t start talking to trees  even when trees started talking to you .      his head emerged into the sultry air at the top of the tower .   he had expected to see fire blackened stones crisscrossed with talon marks  or perhaps something even worse .   instead he saw the seven senior wizards standing by trymon  who seemed totally unscathed .  he turned and smiled pleasantly at rincewind .      ah  rincewind .  come and join us  won   t you .      so this is it  rincewind thought .  all that drama for nothing .  maybe i really am not cut out to be a wizard  maybe     he looked up and into trymon   s eyes .   perhaps it was the spell  in its years of living in rincewind   s head  that had affected his eyes .  perhaps his time with twoflower  who only saw things as they ought to be  had taught him to see things as they are .   but what was certain was that by far the most difficult thing rincewind did in his whole life was look at trymon without running in terror or being very violently sick .   the others didn   t seem to have noticed .   they also seemed to be standing very still .   trymon had tried to contain the seven spells in his mind and it had broken  and the dungeon dimensions had found their hole  all right .  silly to have imagined that the things would have come marching out of a sort of rip in the sky  waving mandibles and tentacles .  that was old fashioned stuff  far too risky .  even nameless terrors learned to move with the times .  all they really needed to enter was one head .   his eyes were empty holes .   knowledge speared into rincewind   s mind like a knife of ice .  the dungeon dimensions would be a playgroup compared to what the things could do in a universe of order .  people were craving order  and order they would get   the order of the turning screw  the immutable law of straight lines and numbers .  they would beg for the harrow     trymon was looking at him .  something was looking at him .  and still the others hadn   t noticed .  could he even explain it .  trymon looked the same as he had always done  except for the eyes  and a slight sheen to his skin .   rincewind stared  and knew that there were far worse things than evil .  all the demons in hell would torture your very soul  but that was precisely because they valued souls very highly  evil would always try to steal the universe  but at least it considered the universe worth stealing .  but the gray world behind those empty eyes would trample and destroy without even according its victims the dignity of hatred .  it wouldn   t even notice them .   trymon held out his hand .      the eighth spell     he said .     give it to me .      rincewind backed away .      this is disobedience  rincewind .  i am your superior  after all .  in fact  i have been voted the supreme head of all the orders .         really .     said rincewind hoarsely .  he looked at the other wizards .  they were immobile  like statues .      oh yes     said trymon pleasantly .     quite without prompting  too .  very democratic .         i preferred tradition     said rincewind .     that way even the dead get the vote .         you will give me the spell voluntarily     said trymon .     do i have to show you what i will do otherwise .  and in the end you will still yield it .  you will scream for the opportunity to give it to me .      if it stops anywhere  it stops here  thought rincewind .      you   ll have to take it     he said .     i won   t give it to you .         i remember you     said trymon .     not much good as a student  as i recall .  you never really trusted magic  you kept on saying there should be a better way to run a universe .  well  you   ll see .  i have plans .  we can           not we     said rincewind firmly .      give me the spell .         try and take it     said rincewind  backing away .     i don   t think you can .         oh .      rincewind jumped aside as octarine fire flashed from trymon   s fingers and left a bubbling rock puddle on the stones .   he could sense the spell lurking in the back of his mind .  he could sense its fear .   in the silent caverns of his head he reached out for it .  it retreated in astonishment  like a dog faced with a maddened sheep .  he followed  stamping angrily through the disused lots and inner city disaster areas of his subconscious  until he found it cowering behind a heap of condemned memories .  it roared silent defiance at him  but rincewind wasn   t having any .   is this it .  he shouted at it .  when it   s time for the showdown  you go and hide .  you   re frightened .   the spell said  that   s nonsense  you can   t possibly believe that  i   m one of the eight spells .  but rincewind advanced on it angrily  shouting  maybe  but the fact is i do believe it and you   d better remember whose head you   re in  right .  i can believe anything i like in here .   rincewind jumped aside again as another bolt of fire lanced through the hot night .  trymon grinned  and made another complicated motion with his hands .   pressure gripped rincewind .  every inch of his skin felt as though it was being used as an anvil .  he flopped onto his knees .      there are much worse things     said trymon pleasantly .     i can make your flesh burn on the bones  or fill your body with ants .  i have the power to           i have a sword  you know .      the voice was squeaky with defiance .   rincewind raised his head .  through a purple haze of pain he saw twoflower standing behind trymon  holding a sword in exactly the wrong way .   trymon laughed  and flexed his fingers .  for a moment his attention was diverted .   rincewind was angry .  he was angry at the spell  at the world  at the unfairness of everything  at the fact that he hadn   t had much sleep lately  at the fact that he wasn   t thinking quite straight .  but most of all he was angry with trymon  standing there full of the magic rincewind had always wanted but had never achieved  and doing nothing worthwhile with it .   he sprang  striking trymon in the stomach with his head and flinging his arms around him in desperation .  twoflower was knocked aside as they slid along the stones .   trymon snarled  and got out the first syllable of a spell before rincewind   s wildly flailing elbow caught him in the neck .  a blast of randomized magic singed rincewind   s hair .   rincewind fought as he always fought  without skill or fairness or tactics but with a great deal of whirlwind effort .  the strategy was to prevent an opponent getting enough time to realize that in fact rincewind wasn   t a very good or strong fighter  and it often worked .   it was working now  because trymon had spent rather too much time reading ancient manuscripts and not getting enough healthy exercise and vitamins .  he managed to get several blows in  which rincewind was far too high on rage to notice  but he only used his hands while rincewind employed knees  feet and teeth as well .   he was  in fact  winning .   this came as a shock .   it came as more of a shock when  as he knelt on trymon   s chest hitting him repeatedly about the head  the other man   s face changed .  the skin crawled and waved like something seen through a heat haze  and trymon spoke .      help me .      for a moment his eyes looked up at rincewind in fear  pain and entreaty .  then they weren   t eyes at all  but multifaceted things on a head that could be called a head only by stretching the definition to its limits .  tentacles and saw edged legs and talons unfolded to rip rincewind   s rather sparse flesh from his body .   twoflower  the tower and the red sky all vanished .  time ran slowly  and stopped .   rincewind bit hard on a tentacle that was trying to pull his face off .  as it uncoiled in agony he thrust out a hand and felt it break something hot and squishy .   they were watching .  he turned his head  and saw that now he was fighting on the floor of an enormous amphitheater .  on each side tier upon tier of creatures stared down at him  creatures with bodies and faces that appeared to have been made by crossbreeding nightmares .  he caught a glimpse of even worse things behind him  huge shadows that stretched into the overcast sky  before the trymon monster lunged at him with a barbed sting the size of a spear .   rincewind dodged sideways  and then swung around with both hands clasped together into one fist that caught the thing in the stomach  or possibly the thorax  with a blow that ended in the satisfying crunch of chitin .   he plunged forward  fighting now out of terror of what would happen if he stopped .  the ghostly arena was full of the chittering of the dungeon creatures  a wall of rustling sound that hammered at his ears as he struggled .  he imagined that sound filling the disc  and he flung blow after blow to save the world of men  to preserve the little circle of firelight in the dark night of chaos and to close the gap through which the nightmare was advancing .  but mainly he hit it to stop it hitting back .   claws or talons drew white hot lines across his back  and something bit his shoulder  but he found a nest of soft tubes among all the hairs and scales and squeezed it hard .   an arm barbed with spikes swept him away  and he rolled over in the gritty black dust .   instinctively he curled into a ball  but nothing happened .  instead of the onslaught of fury he expected he opened his eyes to see the creature limping away from him  various liquids leaking from it .   it was the first time anything had ever run away from rincewind .   he dived after it  caught a scaly leg  and wrenched .  the creature chittered at him and flailed desperately with such appendages as were still working  but rincewind   s grip was unshakable .  he pulled himself up and planted one last satisfying blow into its remaining eye .  it screamed  and ran .  and there was only one place for it to run to .   the tower and the red sky came back with the click of restored time .   as soon as he felt the press of the flagstones under his feet rincewind flung his weight to one side and rolled on his back with the frantic creature at arm   s length .      now .     he yelled .      now what .     said twoflower .     oh .  yes .  right .      he swung the sword inexpertly but with some force  missing rincewind by inches and burying it deeply in the thing .  there was a shrill buzzing  as though he had smashed a wasp   s nest  and the melee of arms and legs and tentacles flailed in agony .  it rolled again  screaming and thrashing at the flagstones  and then it was thrashing at nothing at all because it had rolled over the edge of the stairway  taking rincewind with it .   there was a squelching noise as it bounced off a few of the stone steps  and then a distant and disappearing shriek as it tumbled the depth of the tower .   finally there was a dull explosion and a flash of octarine light .   then twoflower was alone on the top of the tower   alone  that is  except for seven wizards who still seemed to be frozen to the spot .   he sat bewildered as seven fireballs rose out of the blackness and plunged into the discarded octavo  which suddenly looked its old self and far more interesting .      oh dear     he said .     i suppose they   re the spells .         twoflower .     the voice was hollow and echoing  and just recognizable as rincewind   s .   twoflower stopped with his hand halfway to the book .      yes .     he said .     is that   is that you  rincewind .         yes     said the voice  resonant with the tones of the grave .     and there is something very important i want you to do for me  twoflower .      twoflower looked around .  he pulled himself together .  so the fate of the disc would depend on him  after all .      i   m ready     he said  his voice vibrating with pride .     what is it you want me to do .         first  i want you to listen very carefully     said rincewind   s disembodied voice patiently .      i   m listening .         it   s very important that when i tell you what to do you don   t say    what do you mean .     or argue or anything  understand .      twoflower stood to attention .  at least  his mind stood to attention  his body really couldn   t .  he stuck out several of his chins .      i   m ready     he said .      good .  now  what i want you to do is           yes .      rincewind   s voice rose from the depths of the stairwell .      i want you to come and help me up before i lose my grip on this stone     it said .   twoflower opened his mouth  then shut it quickly .  he ran to the square hole and peered down .  by the ruddy light of the star he could just make out rincewind   s eyes looking up at him .   twoflower lay down on his stomach and reached out .  rincewind   s hand gripped his wrist in the sort of grip that told twoflower that if he  rincewind  wasn   t pulled up then there was no possible way in which that grip was going to be relaxed .      i   m glad you   re alive     he said .      good .  so am i     said rincewind .   he hung around in the darkness for a bit .  after the past few minutes it was almost enjoyable  but only almost .      pull me up  then     he hinted .      i think that might be sort of difficult     grunted twoflower .     i don   t actually think i can do it  in fact .         what are you holding on to  then .         you .         i mean besides me .         what do you mean  besides you .     said twoflower .   rincewind said a word .      well  look     said twoflower .     the steps go around in a spiral  right .  if i sort of swing you and then you let go           if you   re going to suggest i try dropping twenty feet down a pitch dark tower in the hope of hitting a couple of greasy little steps which might not even still be there  you can forget it     said rincewind sharply .      there is an alternative  then .         out with it  man .         you could drop five hundred feet down a pitch black tower and hit stones which certainly are there     said twoflower .   dead silence came from below him .  then rincewind said  accusingly     that was sarcasm .         i thought it was just stating the obvious .      rincewind grunted .      i suppose you couldn   t do some magic       twoflower began .      no .         just a thought .      there was a flare of light far below  and a confused shouting  and then more lights  more shouting  and a line of torches starting up the long spiral .      there   s some people coming up the stairs     said twoflower  always keen to inform .      i hope they   re running     said rincewind .     i can   t feel my arm .         you   re lucky     said twoflower .     i can feel mine .      the leading torch stopped its climb and a voice rang out  filling the hollow tower with indecipherable echoes .      i think     said twoflower  aware that he was gradually sliding farther over the hole     that was someone telling us to hold on .      rincewind said another word .   then he said  in a lower and more urgent tone     actually  i don   t think i can hang on any longer .         try .         it   s no good  i can feel my hand slipping .      twoflower sighed .  it was time for harsh measures .     all right  then     he said .     drop  then .  see if i care .         what .     said rincewind  so astonished he forgot to let go .      go on  die .  take the easy way out .         easy .         all you have to do is plummet screaming through the air and break every bone in your body     said twoflower .     anybody can do it .  go on .  i wouldn   t want you to think that perhaps you ought to stay alive because we need you to say the spells and save the disc .  oh  no .  who cares if we all get burned up .  go on  just think of yourself .  drop .      there was a long  embarrassed silence .      i don   t know why it is     said rincewind eventually  in a voice rather louder than necessary     but ever since i met you i seem to have spent a lot of time hanging by my fingers over certain depth  have you noticed .         death     corrected twoflower .      death what .     said rincewind .      certain death     said twoflower helpfully  trying to ignore the slow but inexorable slide of his body across the flagstones .     hanging over certain death .  you don   t like heights .         heights i don   t mind     said rincewind   s voice from the darkness .     heights i can live with .  it   s depths that are occupying my attention at the moment .  do you know what i   m going to do when we get out of this .         no .     said twoflower  wedging his toes into a gap in the flagstones and trying to make himself immobile by sheer force of will .      i   m going to build a house in the flattest country i can find and it   s only going to have a ground floor and i   m not even going to wear sandals with thick soles        the leading torch came around the last turn of the spiral and twoflower looked down on the grinning face of cohen .  behind him  still hopping awkwardly up the stones  he could make out the reassuring bulk of the luggage .      everything all right .     said cohen .     can i do anything .      rincewind took a deep breath .   twoflower recognized the signs .  rincewind was about to say something like     yes  i   ve got this itch on the back of my neck  you couldn   t scratch it  could you  on your way past .     or    no  i enjoy hanging over bottomless drops    and he decided he couldn   t possibly face that .  he spoke very quickly .      pull rincewind back onto the stairs     he snapped .  rincewind deflated in midsnarl .   cohen caught him around the waist and jerked him unceremoniously onto the stones .      nasty mess down on the floor down there     he said conversationally .     who was it .         did it       rincewind swallowed     did it have   you know   tentacles and things .         no     said cohen .     just the normal bits .  spread out a bit  of course .      rincewind looked at twoflower  who shook his head .      just a wizard who let things get on top of him     he said .   unsteadily  with his arms screaming at him  rincewind let himself be helped back onto the roof of the tower .      how did you get here .     he added .   cohen pointed to the luggage  which had trotted over to twoflower and opened its lid like a dog that knows it   s been bad and is hoping that a quick display of affection may avert the rolled up newspaper of authority .      bumpy but fast     he said admiringly .     i   ll tell you this  no one tries to stop you .      rincewind looked up at the sky .  it was indeed full of moons  huge cratered discs now ten times bigger than the disc   s tiny satellite .  he looked at them without much interest .  he felt washed out and stretched well beyond the breaking point  as fragile as ancient elastic .   he noticed that twoflower was trying to set up his picture box .   cohen was looking at the seven senior wizards .      funny place to put statues     he said .     no one can see them .  mind you  i can   t say they   re up to much .  very poor work .      rincewind staggered across and tapped wert gingerly on the chest .  he was solid stone .   this is it  he thought .  i just want to go home .   hang on  i am home .  more or less .  so i just want a good sleep  and perhaps it will all be better in the morning .   his gaze fell on the octavo  which was outlined in tiny flashes of octarine fire .  oh yes  he thought .   he picked it up and thumbed idly through its pages .  they were thick with complex and swirling script that changed and re formed even as he looked at it .  it seemed undecided as to what it should be  one moment it was an orderly  matter of fact printing  the next a series of angular runes .  then it would be curly kythian spellscript .  then it would be pictograms in some ancient  evil and forgotten writing that seemed to consist exclusively of unpleasant reptilian beings doing complicated and painful things to one another     the last page was empty .  rincewind sighed  and looked in the back of his mind .  the spell looked back .   he had dreamed of this moment  how he would finally evict the spell and take vacant possession of his own head and learn all those lesser spells which had  up until then  been too frightened to stay in his mind .  somehow he had expected it to be far more exciting .   instead  in utter exhaustion and in a mood to brook no argument  he stared coldly at the spell and jerked a metaphorical thumb over his shoulder .   you .  out .   it looked for a moment as though the spell was going to argue  but it wisely thought better of it .   there was a tingling sensation  a blue flash behind his eyes  and a sudden feeling of emptiness .   when he looked down at the page it was full of words .  they were runes again .  he was glad about that  the reptilian pictures were not only unspeakable but probably unpronounceable too  and reminded him of things he would have great difficulty in forgetting .   he looked blankly at the book while twoflower bustled around unheeded and cohen tried in vain to lever the rings off the stone wizards .   he had to do something  he reminded himself .  what was it  now .   he opened the book at the first page and began to read  his lips moving and his forefinger tracing the outline of each letter .  as he mumbled each word it appeared soundlessly in the air beside him  in bright colors that streamed away in the night wind .   he turned over the page .   other people were coming up the steps now   star people  citizens  even some of the patrician   s personal guard .  a couple of star people made a halfhearted attempt to approach rincewind  who was surrounded now by a rainbow swirl of letters and took absolutely no notice of them  but cohen drew his sword and looked nonchalantly at them and they thought better of it .   silence spread out from rincewind   s bent form like ripples in a puddle .  it cascaded down the tower and spread out through the milling crowds below  flowed over the walls  gushed darkly through the city  and engulfed the lands beyond .   the bulk of the star loomed silently over the disc .  in the sky around it the new moons turned slowly and noiselessly .   the only sound was rincewind   s hoarse whispering as he turned page after page .      isn   t this exciting .     said twoflower .  cohen  who was rolling a cigarette from the tarry remnants of its ancestors  looked at him blankly  paper halfway to his lips .      isn   t what exciting .     he said .      all this magic .         it   s only lights     said cohen critically .     he hasn   t even produced doves out of his sleeves .         yes  but can   t you sense the occult potentiality .     said twoflower .   cohen produced a big yellow match from somewhere in his tobacco bag  looked at wert for a moment  and with great deliberation struck the match on his fossilized nose .      look     he said to twoflower  as kindly as he could manage .     what do you expect .  i   ve been around a long time  i   ve seen the whole magical thing  and i can tell you that if you go around with your jaw dropping all the time people hit it .  anyway  wizards die just like anyone else when you stick a        there was a loud snap as rincewind shut the book .  he stood up  and looked around .   what happened next was this   nothing .   it took a little while for people to realize it .  everyone had ducked instinctively  waiting for the explosion of white light or scintillating fireball or  in the case of cohen  who had fairly low expectations  a few white pigeons  possibly a slightly crumpled rabbit .   it wasn   t even an interesting nothing .  sometimes things can fail to happen in quite impressive ways  but as far as non events went this one just couldn   t compete .      is that it .     said cohen .  there was a general muttering from the crowd  and several of the star people were looking angrily at rincewind .   the wizard stared blearily at cohen .      i suppose so     he said .      but nothing   s happened .      rincewind looked blankly at the octavo .      maybe it has a subtle effect .     he said hopefully .     after all  we don   t know exactly what is supposed to happen .         we knew it .     shouted one of the star people .     magic doesn   t work .  it   s all illusion .      a stone looped over the roof and hit rincewind on the shoulder .      yeah     said another star person .     let   s get him .         let   s throw him off the tower .         yeah  let   s get him and throw him off the tower .      the crowd surged forward .  twoflower held up his hands .      i   m sure there   s just been a slight mistake       he began  before his legs were kicked from underneath him .      oh bugger     said cohen  dropping his dogend and grinding it under a sandalled foot .  he drew his sword and looked around for the luggage .   it hadn   t rushed to twoflower   s aid .  it was standing in front of rincewind  who was clutching the octavo to his chest like a hot water bottle and looking frantic .   a star man lunged at him .  the luggage raised its lid threateningly .      i know why it hasn   t worked     said a voice from the back of the crowd .  it was bethan .      oh yeah .     said the nearest citizen .     and why should we listen to you .      a mere fraction of a second later cohen   s sword was pressed against his neck .      on the other hand     said the man evenly     perhaps we should pay attention to what this young lady has got to say .      as cohen swung around slowly with his sword at the ready bethan stepped forward and pointed to the swirling shapes of the spells  which still hung in the air around rincewind .      that one can   t be right     she said  indicating a smudge of dirty brown amidst the pulsing  brightly colored flares .     you must have mispronounced a word .  let   s have a look .      rincewind passed her the octavo without a word .   she opened it and peered the pages .      what funny writing     she said .     it keeps changing .  what   s that crocodile thing doing to the octopus .      rincewind looked over her shoulder and  without thinking  told her .  she was silent for a moment .      oh     she said levelly .     i didn   t know crocodiles could do that .         it   s just ancient picture writing     said rincewind hurriedly .     it   ll change if you wait .  the spells can appear in every known language .         can you remember what you said when the wrong color appeared .      rincewind ran a finger down the page .      there  i think .  where the two headed lizard is doing   whatever it   s doing .      twoflower appeared at her other shoulder .  the spell flowed into another script .      i can   t even pronounce it     said bethan .     squiggle  squiggle  dot  dash .         that   s cupumuguk snow runes     said rincewind .     i think it should be pronounced    zph .            it didn   t work  though .  how about    sph    .      they looked at the word .  it remained resolutely off color .      or    sff    .     said bethan .      it might be    tsff        said rincewind doubtfully .  if anything the color became a dirtier shade of brown .      how about    zsff    .     said twoflower .      don   t be silly     said rincewind .     with snow runes the        bethan elbowed him in the stomach and pointed .   the brown shape in the air was now a brilliant red .   the book trembled in her hands .  rincewind grabbed her around the waist  snatched twoflower by the collar  and jumped backward .   bethan lost her grip on the octavo  which tumbled toward the floor .  and didn   t reach it .      the air around the octavo glowed .  it rose slowly  flapping its pages like wings .   then there was a plangent  sweet twanging noise and it seemed to explode in a complicated silent flower of light which rushed outward  faded  and was gone .   but something was happening much farther up in the sky        down in the geological depths of great a   tuin   s huge brain new thoughts surged along neural pathways the size of arterial roads .  it was impossible for a sky turtle to change its expression  but in some indefinable way its scaly  meteor pocked face looked quite expectant .   it was staring fixedly at the eight spheres endlessly orbiting around the star  on the very beaches of space .   the spheres were cracking .   huge segments of rock broke away and began the long spiral down to the star .  the sky filled with glittering shards .   from the wreakage of one hollow shell a very small sky turtle paddled its way into the red light .  it was barely bigger than an asteroid  its shell still shiny with molten yolk .   there were four small world elephant calves on there  too .  and on their backs was a discworld  tiny as yet  covered in smoke and volcanoes .   great a   tuin waited until all eight baby turtles had freed themselves from their shells and were treading space and looking bewildered .  then  carefully  so as not to dislodge anything  the old turtle turned and with considerable relief set out on the long swim to the blessedly cool  bottomless depths of space .   the young turtles followed  orbiting their parent .      twoflower stared raptly at the display overhead .  he probably had the best view of anyone on the disc .   then a terrible thought occurred to him .      where   s the picture box .     he asked urgently .      what .     said rincewind  eyes fixed on the sky .      the picture box     said twoflower .     i must get a picture of this .         can   t you just remember it .     said bethan  not looking at him .      i might forget .         i won   t ever forget     she said .     it   s the most beautiful thing i   ve ever seen .         much better than pigeons and billiard balls     agreed cohen .     i   ll give you that  rincewind .  how   s it done .         i dunno     said rincewind .      the star   s getting smaller     said bethan .   rincewind was vaguely aware of twoflower   s voice arguing with the demon who lived in the box and painted the pictures .  it was quite a technical argument  about field depths and whether or not the demon still had enough red paint .   it should be pointed out that currently great a   tuin was very pleased and contented  and feelings like that in a brain the size of several large cities are bound to radiate out .  in fact most people on the disc were currently in a state of mind normally achievable only by a lifetime of dedicated meditation or about thirty seconds of illegal herbage .   that   s old twoflower  rincewind thought .  it   s not that he doesn   t appreciate beauty  he just appreciates it in his own way .  i mean  if a poet sees a daffodil he stares at it and writes a long poem about it  but twoflower wanders off to find a book on botany .  and treads on it .  it   s right what cohen said .  he just looks at things  but nothing he looks at is ever the same again .  including me  i suspect .   the disc   s own sun rose .  the star was already dwindling  and it wasn   t quite so much competition .  good reliable disc light poured across the enraptured landscape  like a sea of gold .   or  as the more reliable observers generally held  like golden syrup .      that is a nice dramatic ending  but life doesn   t work like that and there were other things that had to happen .   there was the octavo  for example .   as the sunlight hit it the book snapped shut and started to fall back to the tower .  and many of the observers realized that dropping toward them was the single most magical thing on the discworld .   the feeling of bliss and brotherhood evaporated along with the morning dew .  rincewind and twoflower were elbowed aside as the crowd surged forward  struggling and trying to climb up one another  hands outstretched .   the octavo dropped into the center of the shouting mass .  there was a snap .  a decisive snap  the sort of snap made by a lid that doesn   t intend to be opening in a hurry .   rincewind peered between someone   s legs at twoflower .      do you know what i think   s going to happen .     he said  grinning .      what .         i think that when you open the luggage there   s just going to be your laundry in there  that   s what i think .         oh dear .         i think the octavo knows how to look after itself .  best place for it  really .         i suppose so .  you know  sometimes i get the feeling that the luggage knows exactly what it   s doing .         i know what you mean .      they crawled to the edge of the milling crowd  stood up  dusted themselves off and headed for the steps .  no one paid them any attention .      what are they doing now .     said twoflower  trying to see over the heads of the throng .      it looks as though they   re trying to lever it open     said rincewind .   there was a snap and a scream .      i think the luggage rather enjoys the attention     said twoflower  as they began their cautious descent .      yes  it probably does it good to get out and meet people     said rincewind     and now i think it   d do me good to go and order a couple of drinks .         good idea     said twoflower .     i   ll have a couple of drinks too .         it was nearly noon when twoflower awoke .  he couldn   t remember why he was in a hayloft  or why he was wearing someone else   s coat  but he did wake up with one idea right in the forefront of his mind .   he decided it was vitally important to tell rincewind about it .   he fell out of the hay and landed on the luggage .      oh  you   re here  are you .     he said .     i hope you   re ashamed of yourself .      the luggage looked bewildered .      anyway  i want to comb my hair .  open up     said twoflower .   the luggage obligingly flipped its lid .  twoflower rooted around among the bags and boxes inside until he found a comb and mirror and repaired some of the damage of the night .  then he looked hard at the luggage .      i suppose you wouldn   t like to tell me what you   ve done with the octavo .      the luggage   s expression could only be described as wooden .      all right .  come on  then .      twoflower stepped out into the sunlight  which was slightly too bright for his current tastes  and wandered aimlessly along the street .  everything seemed fresh and new  even the smells  but there didn   t seem to be many people up yet .  it had been a long night .   he found rincewind at the foot of the tower of art  supervising a team of workmen who had rigged up a gantry of sorts on the roof and were lowering the stone wizards to the ground .  he seemed to be assisted by a monkey  but twoflower was in no mood to be surprised at anything .      will they be able to be turned back .     he said .   rincewind looked around .     what .  oh  it   s you .  no  probably not .  i   m afraid they dropped poor old wert  anyway .  five hundred feet onto cobbles .         will you be able to do anything about that .         make a nice rockery .     rincewind turned and waved at the workmen .      you   re very cheerful     said twoflower  a shade reproachfully .     didn   t you go to bed .         funny thing  i couldn   t sleep     said rincewind .     i came out for a breath of fresh air  and no one seemed to have any idea what to do  so i just sort of got people together     he indicated the librarian  who tried to hold his hand     and started organizing things .  nice day  isn   t it .  air like wine .         rincewind  i   ve decided that           you know  i think i might re enroll     said rincewind cheerfully .     i think i could really make a go of things this time .  i can really see myself getting to grips with magic and graduating really well .  they do say if it   s summa cum laude  then the living is easy           good  because           there   s plenty of room at the top  too  now all the big boys will be doing doorstop duty  and           i   m going home .            a sharp lad with a bit of experience of the world could   what .         oook .         i said i   m going home     repeated twoflower  making polite little attempts to shake off the librarian  who was trying to pick lice off him .      what home .     said rincewind  astonished .      home home .  my home .  where i live     twoflower explained sheepishly .     back across the sea .  you know .  where i came from .  will you please stop doing that .         oh .         oook .      there was a pause .  then twoflower said     you see  last night it occurred to me  i thought  well  the thing is  all this traveling and seeing things is fine but there   s also a lot of fun to be had from having been .  you know  sticking all your pictures in a book and remembering things .         there is .         oook .         oh  yes .  the important thing about having lots of things to remember is that you   ve got to go somewhere afterward where you can remember them  you see .  you   ve got to stop .  you haven   t really been anywhere until you   ve got back home .  i think that   s what i mean .      rincewind ran the sentence across his mind again .  it didn   t seem any better second time around .      oh     he said again .     well  good .  if that   s the way you look at it .  when are you going  then .         today  i think .  there   s bound to be a ship going part of the way .         i expect so     said rincewind awkwardly .  he looked at his feet .  he looked at the sky .  he cleared his throat .      we   ve been through some times together  eh .     said twoflower  nudging him in the ribs .      yeah     said rincewind  contorting his face into something like a grin .      you   re not upset  are you .         who  me .     said rincewind .     gosh  no .  hundred and one things to do .         that   s all right  then .  listen  let   s go and have breakfast and then we can go down to the docks .      rincewind nodded dismally  turned to his assistant  and took a banana out of his pocket .      you   ve got the hang of it now  you take over     he muttered .      oook .         in fact there wasn   t any ship going anywhere near the agatean empire  but that was an academic point because twoflower simply counted gold pieces into the hand of the first captain with a halfway clean ship until the man suddenly saw the merits of changing his plans .   rincewind waited on the quayside until twoflower had finished paying the man about forty times more than his ship was worth .      that   s settled  then     said twoflower .     he   ll drop me at the brown islands and i can easily get a ship from there .         great     said rincewind .   twoflower looked thoughtful for a moment .  then he opened the luggage and pulled out a bag of gold .      have you seen cohen and bethan .     he said .      i think they went off to get married     said rincewind .     i heard bethan say it was now or never .         well  when you see them give them this     said twoflower  handing him the bag .     i know it   s expensive  setting up home for the first time .      twoflower had never fully understood the gulf in the exchange rate .  the bag could quite easily set cohen up with a small kingdom .      i   ll hand it over first chance i get     he said  and to his own surprise realized that he meant it .      good .  i   ve thought about something to give you  too .         oh  there   s no        twoflower rummaged in the luggage and produced a large sack .  he began to fill it with clothes and money and the picture box until finally the luggage was completely empty .  the last thing he put in was his souvenir musical cigarette box with the shell encrusted lid  carefully wrapped in soft paper .      it   s all yours     he said  shutting the luggage   s lid .     i shan   t really need it anymore  and it won   t fit on my wardrobe anyway .         what .         don   t you want it .         well  i   of course  but   it   s yours .  it follows you  not me .         luggage     said twoflower     this is rincewind .  you   re his  right .      the luggage slowly extended its legs  turned very deliberately and looked at rincewind .      i don   t think it belongs to anyone but itself  really     said twoflower .      yes     said rincewind uncertainly .      well  that   s about it  then     said twoflower .  he held out his hand .      goodbye  rincewind .  i   ll send you a postcard when i get home .  or something .         yes .  anytime you   re passing  there   s bound to be someone here who knows where i am .         yes .  well .  that   s it  then .         that   s it  right enough .         right .         yep .      twoflower walked up the gangplank  which the impatient crew hauled up behind him .   the rowing drum started its beat and the ship was propelled slowly out onto the turbid waters of the ankh  now back to their old level  where it caught the tide and turned toward the open sea .   rincewind watched it until it was a dot .  then he looked down at the luggage .  it stared back at him .      look     he said .     go away .  i   m giving you to yourself  do you understand .      he turned his back on it and stalked away .  after a few seconds he was aware of the little footsteps behind him .  he spun around .      i said i don   t want you .     he snapped  and gave it a kick .   the luggage sagged .  rincewind stalked away .   after he had gone a few yards he stopped and listened .  there was no sound .  when he turned the luggage was where he had left it .  it looked sort of huddled .  rincewind thought for a while .      all right  then     he said .     come on .      he turned his back and strode off to the university .  after a few minutes the luggage appeared to make up its mind  extended its legs again and padded after him .  it didn   t see that it had a lot of choice .   they headed along the quay and into the city  two dots on a dwindling landscape which  as the perspective broadened  included a tiny ship starting out across a wide green sea that was but a part of a bright circling ocean on a cloud swirled disc on the back of four giant elephants that themselves stood on the shell of an enormous turtle .   which soon became a glint among the stars  and disappeared .      they won   t be described  since even the pretty ones looked like the offspring of an octopus and a bicycle .  it is well known that things from undesirable universes are always seeking an entrance into this one  which is the psychic equivalent of handy for the buses and closer to the shops .      a thaum is the basic unit of magical strength .  it has been universally established as the amount of magic needed to create one small white pigeon or three normal sized billiard balls .      an interesting metaphor .  to nocturnal trolls  of course  the dawn of time lies in the future .      not precisely  of
