wind howled .  the storm crackled on the mountains .  lightning prodded the crags like an old man trying to get an elusive blackberry pip out of his false teeth .   among the hissing furze bushes a fire blazed  the flames driven this way and that by the gusts .   an eldritch voice shrieked     when shall we   two   meet again .      thunder rolled .   a rather more ordinary voice said     what   d you go and shout that for .  you made me drop my toast in the fire .      nanny ogg sat down again .      sorry  esme .  i was just doing it for   you know   old time   s sake   doesn   t roll off the tongue  though .         i   d just got it nice and brown  too .         sorry .         anyway  you didn   t have to shout .         sorry .         i mean  i ain   t deaf .  you could   ve just asked me in a normal voice .  and i   d have said     next wednesday .            sorry  esme .         just you cut me another slice .      nanny ogg nodded  and turned her head .     magrat  cut granny ano   oh .  mind wandering there for a minute .  i   ll do it myself  shall i .         hah .     said granny weatherwax  staring into the fire .   there was no sound for a while but the roar of the wind and the sound of nanny ogg cutting bread  which she did with about as much efficiency as a man trying to chainsaw a mattress .      i thought it   d cheer you up  coming up here     she said after a while .      really .     it wasn   t a question .      take you out of yourself  sort of thing       nanny went on  watching her friend carefully .      mm .     said granny  still staring moodily at the fire .   oh dear  thought nanny .  i shouldn   t   ve said that .   the point was   well  the point was that nanny ogg was worried .  very worried .  she wasn   t at all sure that her friend wasn   t   well   going   well  sort of   in a manner of speaking   well   black     she knew it happened  with the really powerful ones .  and granny weatherwax was pretty damn powerful .  she was probably an even more accomplished witch now than the infamous black aliss  and everyone knew what had happened to her at the finish .  pushed into her own stove by a couple of kids  and everyone said it was a damn good thing  even if it took a whole week to clean the oven .   but aliss  up until that terrible day  had terrorized the ramtops .  she   d become so good at magic that there wasn   t room in her head for anything else .   they said weapons couldn   t pierce her .  swords bounced off her skin .  they said you could hear her mad laughter a mile off  and of course  while mad laughter was always part of a witch   s stock in trade in necessary circumstances  this was insane mad laughter  the worst kind .  and she turned people into gingerbread and had a house made of frogs .  it had been very nasty  toward the end .  it always was  when a witch went bad .   sometimes  of course  they didn   t go bad .  they just went   somewhere .   granny   s intellect needed something to do .  she did not take kindly to boredom .  she   d take to her bed instead and send her mind out borrowing  inside the head of some forest creature  listening with its ears  seeing with its eyes .  that was all very well for general purposes  but she was too good at it .  she could stay away longer than anyone nanny ogg had ever heard of .   one day  almost certainly  she wouldn   t bother to come back   and this was the worst time of the year  with the geese honking and rushing across the sky every night  and the autumn air crisp and inviting .  there was something terribly tempting about that .   nanny ogg reckoned she knew what the cause of the problem was .   she coughed .      saw magrat the other day     she ventured  looking sidelong at granny .   there was no reaction .      she   s looking well .  queening suits her .         hmm .      nanny groaned inwardly .  if granny couldn   t even be bothered to make a nasty remark  then she was really missing magrat .   nanny ogg had never believed it at the start  but magrat garlick  wet as a sponge though she was half the time  had been dead right about one thing .   three was a natural number for witches .   and they   d lost one .  well  not lost  exactly .  magrat was queen now  and queens were hard to mislay .  but   that meant that there were only two of them instead of three .   when you had three  you had one to run around getting people to make up when there   d been a row .  magrat had been good for that .  without magrat  nanny ogg and granny weatherwax got on one another   s nerves .  with her  all three had been able to get on the nerves of absolutely everyone else in the whole world  which had been a lot more fun .   and there was no having magrat back   at least  to be precise about it  there was no having magrat back yet .   because  while three was a good number for witches   it had to be the right sort of three .  the right sort of   types .   nanny ogg found herself embarrassed even to think about this  and this was unusual because embarrassment normally came as naturally to nanny as altruism comes to a cat .   as a witch  she naturally didn   t believe in any occult nonsense of any sort .  but there were one or two truths down below the bedrock of the soul which had to be faced  and right in among them was this business of  well  of the maiden  the mother and the   other one .   there .  she   d put words around it .   of course  it was nothing but an old superstition and belonged to the unenlightened days when    maiden    or    mother    or   the other one   encompassed every woman over the age of twelve or so  except maybe for nine months of her life .  these days  any girl bright enough to count and sensible enough to take nanny   s advice could put off being at least one of them for quite some time .   even so   it was an old superstition   older than books  older than writing   and beliefs like that were heavy weights on the rubber sheet of human experience  tending to pull people into their orbit .   and magrat had been married for three months .  that ought to mean she was out of the first category .  at least   nanny twitched her train of thought on to a branch line   she probably was .  oh  surely .  young verence had sent off for a helpful manual .  it had pictures in it  and numbered parts .  nanny knew this because she had sneaked into the royal bedroom while visiting one day  and had spent an instructive ten minutes drawing mustaches and spectacles on some of the figures .  surely even magrat and verence could hardly fail to   no  they must have worked it out  even though nanny had heard that verence had been seen inquiring of people where he might buy a couple of false mustaches .  it   d not be long before magrat was eligible for the second category  even if they were both slow readers .   of course  granny weatherwax made a great play of her independence and self reliance .  but the point about that kind of stuff was that you needed someone around to be proudly independent and self reliant at .  people who didn   t need people needed people around to know that they were the kind of people who didn   t need people .   it was like hermits .  there was no point freezing your nadgers off on top of some mountain while communing with the infinite unless you could rely on a lot of impressionable young women to come along occasionally and say    gosh .      they needed to be three again .  things got exciting  when there were three of you .  there were rows  and adventures  and things for granny to get angry about  and she was only happy when she was angry .  in fact  it seemed to nanny  she was only granny weatherwax when she was angry .   yes .  they needed to be three .   or else   it was going to be gray wings in the night  or the clang of the oven door        the manuscript fell apart as soon as mr .  goatberger picked it up .   it wasn   t even on proper paper .  it had been written on old sugar bags  and the backs of envelopes  and bits of out of date calendar .   he grunted  and grabbed a handful of the musty pages to throw them on the fire .   a word caught his eye .   he read it  and his eye was dragged to the end of the sentence .   then he read to the end of the page  doubling back a few times because he hadn   t quite believed what he   d just read .   he turned the page .  and then he turned back .  and then he read on .  at one point he took a ruler out of his drawer and looked at it thoughtfully .   he opened his drinks cabinet .  the bottle tinkled cheerfully on the edge of the glass as he tried to pour himself a drink .   then he stared out of the window at the opera house on the other side of the road .  a small figure was brushing the steps .   and then he said     oh  my .      finally he went to the door and said     could you come in here  mr .  cropper .      his chief printer entered  clutching a sheaf of proofs .     we   re going to have to get mr .  cripslock to engrave page ii again     he said mournfully .     he   s spelled    famine    with seven letters           read this     said goatberger .      i was just off to lunch           read this .         guild agreement says           read this and see if you still have an appetite .      mr .  cropper sat down with bad grace and glanced at the first page .   then he turned to the second page .   after a while he opened the desk drawer and pulled out a ruler  which he looked at thoughtfully .      you   ve just read about bananana soup surprise .     said goatberger .      yes .         you wait till you get to spotted dick .         well  my old granny used to make spotted dick           not to this recipe     said goatberger  with absolute certainty .   cropper fumbled through the pages .     blimey .  do you think any of this stuff works .         who cares .  go down to the guild right now and hire all the engravers that   re free .  preferably elderly ones .         but i   ve still got the grune  june  august and spune predictions for next year   s almanac to           forget them .  use some old ones .         people   ll notice .         they   ve never noticed before     said mr .  goatberger .     you know the drill .  astounding rains of curry in klatch  amazing death of the seriph of ee  plague of wasps in howondaland .  this is a lot more important .      he stared unseeing out of the window again .      considerably more important .      and he dreamed the dream of all those who publish books  which was to have so much gold in your pockets that you would have to employ two people just to hold your trousers up .      the huge  be columned  gargoyle haunted face of ankh morpork   s opera house was there  in front of agnes nitt .   she stopped .  at least  most of agnes stopped .  there was a lot of agnes .  it took some time for outlying regions to come to rest .   well  this was it .  at last .  she could go in  or she could go away .  it was what they called a life choice .  she   d never had one of those before .   finally  after standing still for long enough for a pigeon to consider the perching possibilities of her huge and rather sad black floppy hat  she climbed the steps .   a man was theoretically sweeping them .  what he was in fact doing was moving the dirt around with a broom  to give it a change of scenery and a chance to make new friends .  he was dressed in a long coat that was slightly too small for him  and had a black beret perched incongruously on spiky black hair .      excuse me     said agnes .   the effect was electric .  he turned around  tangled one foot with the other  and collapsed onto his broom .   agnes   s hand flew to her mouth  and then she reached down .      oh  i   m so sorry .      the hand had that clammy feel that makes a holder think longingly of soap .  he pulled it away quickly  pushed his greasy hair out of his eyes and gave her a terrified smile  he had what nanny ogg called an underdone face  its features rubbery and pale .      no trouble miss .         are you all right .      he scrambled up  got the broom somehow tangled between his knees  and sat down again sharply .      er   shall i hold the broom .     said agnes helpfully .   she pulled it out of the tangle .  he got up again  after a couple of false starts .      do you work for the opera house .     said agnes .      yes miss .         er  can you tell me where i have to go for the auditions .      he looked around wildly .     stage door .     he said .     i   ll show you .     the words came out in a rush  as if he had to line them up and fire them all in one go before they had time to wander off .   he snatched the broom out of her hands and set off down the steps and toward the corner of the building .  he had a unique stride  it looked as though his body were being dragged forward and his legs had to flail around underneath it  landing wherever they could find room .  it wasn   t so much a walk as a collapse  indefinitely postponed .   his erratic footsteps led toward a door in the side wall .  agnes followed them in .   just inside was a sort of shed  with one open wall and a counter positioned so that someone standing there could watch the door .  the person behind it must have been a human being because walruses don   t wear coats .  the strange man had disappeared somewhere in the gloom beyond .   agnes looked around desperately .      yes  miss .     said the walrus man .  it really was an impressive mustache  which had sapped all the growth from the rest of its owner .      er   i   m here for the   the auditions     said agnes .     i saw a notice that said you were auditioning        she gave a helpless little smile .  the doorkeeper   s face proclaimed that it had seen and been unimpressed by more desperate smiles than even agnes could have eaten hot dinners .  he produced a clipboard and a stub of pencil .      you got to sign here     he said .      who was that   person who came in with me .      the mustache moved  suggesting a smile was buried somewhere below .     everyone knows our walter plinge .      this seemed to be all the information that was likely to be imparted .   agnes gripped the pencil .   the most important question was  what should she call herself .  her name had many sterling qualities  no doubt  but it didn   t exactly roll off the tongue .  it snapped off the palate and clicked between the teeth  but it didn   t roll off the tongue .   the trouble was  she couldn   t think of one with great rotational capabilities .   catherine  possibly .   or   perdita .  she could go back to trying perdita .  she   d been embarrassed out of using that name in lancre .  it was a mysterious name  hinting of darkness and intrigue and  incidentally  of someone who was quite thin .  she   d even given herself a middle initial   x   which stood for    someone who has a cool and exciting middle initial .      it hadn   t worked .  lancre people were depressingly resistant to cool .  she had just been known as    that agnes who calls herself perditax .      she   d never dared tell anyone that she   d like her full name to be perdita x dream .  they just wouldn   t understand .  they   d say things like  if you think that   s the right name for you  why have you still got two shelves full of soft toys .   well  here she could start afresh .  she was good .  she knew she was good .   probably no hope for the dream  though .   she was probably stuck with the nitt .      nanny ogg usually went to bed early .  after all  she was an old lady .  sometimes she went to bed as early as six a . m .   her breath puffed in the air as she walked through the woods .  her boots crunched on the leaves .  the wind had died away  leaving the sky wide and clear and open for the first frost of the season  a petal nipping  fruit withering little scorcher that showed you why they called nature a mother     a third witch  she thought .   three witches could sort of   spread the load .   maiden  mother and   crone .  there .   the trouble was that granny weatherwax combined all three in one .  she was a maiden  as far as nanny knew  and she was at least in the right age bracket for a crone  and  as for the third  well   cross granny weatherwax on a bad day and you   d be like a blossom in the frost .   there was bound to be a candidate for the vacancy  though .  there were several young girls in lancre who were just about the right age .   trouble was  the young men of lancre knew it too .  nanny wandered the summer hayfields regularly  and had a sharp if compassionate eye and damn good over the horizon hearing .  violet frottidge was walking out with young deviousness carter  or at least doing something within ninety degrees of walking out .  bonnie quarney had been gathering nuts in may with william simple  and it was only because she   d thought ahead and taken a little advice from nanny that she wouldn   t be bearing fruit in february .  and pretty soon now young mildred tinker   s mother would have a quiet word with mildred tinker   s father  and he   d have a word with his friend thatcher and he   d have a word with his son hob  and then there   d be a wedding  all done in a properly civilized way except for maybe a black eye or two .   no doubt about it  thought nanny with a misty eyed smile  innocence  in a hot lancre summer  was that state in which innocence is lost .   and then a name rose out of the throng .  oh  yes .  her .  why hadn   t she thought of her .  but you didn   t  of course .  whenever you thought about the young girls of lancre  you didn   t remember her .  and then you said     oh  yes  her too  of course .  o    course  she   s got a wonderful personality .  and good hair  of course .      she was bright  and talented .  in many ways .  her voice  for one thing .  that was her power  finding its way out .  and of course she also had a wonderful personality  so there   d be not much chance of her being   disqualified     well  that was settled  then .  another witch to bully and impress would set granny up a treat  and agnes would be bound to thank her eventually .   nanny ogg was relieved .  you needed at least three witches for a coven .  two witches was just an argument .   she opened the door of her cottage and climbed the stairs to bed .   her cat  the tom greebo  was spread out on the eiderdown like a puddle of gray fur .  he didn   t even awake as nanny lifted him up bodily so that  nightdress clad  she could slide between the sheets .   just to keep bad dreams at bay  she took a swig out of a bottle that smelled of apples and happy brain death .  then she pummeled her pillow  thought    her   yes     and drifted off to sleep .   presently greebo awoke  stretched  yawned and hopped silently to the floor .  then the most vicious and cunning a pile of fur that ever had the intelligence to sit on a bird table with its mouth open and a piece of toast balanced on its nose vanished through the open window .   a few minutes later  the cockerel in the garden next door stuck up his head to greet the bright new day and died instantly in mid     doodle doo .         there was a huge darkness in front of agnes while  at the same time  she was half blinded by the light .  just below the edge of the stage  giant flat candles floated in a long trough of water  producing a strong yellow glare quite unlike the oil lamps of home .  beyond the light  the auditorium waited like the mouth of a very big and extremely hungry animal .   from somewhere on the far side of the lights a voice said     when you   re ready  miss .      it wasn   t a particularly unfriendly voice .  it just wanted her to get on with it  sing her piece  and go .      i   ve  er  got this song  it   s a           you   ve given your music to miss proudlet .         er  there isn   t an accompaniment actually  it           oh  it   s a folk song  is it .      there was a whispering in the darkness  and someone laughed quietly .      off you go then   perdita  right .      agnes launched into the hedgehog song  and knew by about word seven that it had been the wrong choice .  you needed a tavern  with people leering and thumping their mugs on the table .  this big brilliant emptiness just sucked at it and made her voice hesitant and shrill .   she stopped at the end of verse three .  she could feel the blush starting somewhere around her knees .  it   d take some time to get to her face  because it had a lot of skin to cover  but by then it   d be strawberry pink .   she could hear whispering .  words like    timbre    emerged from the susurration and then  she wasn   t surprised to hear  came    impressive build .     she did  she knew  have an impressive build .  so did the opera house .  she didn   t have to feel good about it .   the voice spoke up .      you haven   t had much training  have you  dear .         no .     which was true .  lancre   s only other singer of note was nanny ogg  whose attitude to songs was purely ballistic .  you just pointed your voice at the end of the verse and went for it .   whisper  whisper .      sing us a few scales  dear .      the blush was at chest height now  thundering across the rolling acres        scales .      whisper .  muffled laugh .      do re mi .  you know  dear .  starting low .  la la lah .         oh .  yes .      as the armies of embarrassment stormed her neckline  agnes pitched her voice as low as she could and went for it .   she concentrated on the notes  working her way stolidly upward from sea level to mountaintop  and took no notice at the start when a chair vibrated across the stage or  at the end  when a glass broke somewhere and several bats fell out of the roof .   there was silence from the big emptiness  except for the thud of another bat and  far above  a gentle tinkle of glass .      is   is that your full range  lass .      people were clustering in the wings and staring at her .      no .         no .         if i go any higher people faint     said agnes .     and if i go lower everyone says it makes them feel uncomfortable .      whisper  whisper .  whisper  whisper  whisper .      and  er  any other    .         i can sing with myself in thirds .  nanny ogg says not everyone can do that .         sorry .         like   do mi .  at the same time .      whisper  whisper .      show us  lass .         laaaaaa     the people at the side of the stage were talking excitedly .   whisper  whisper .   the voice from the darkness said     now  your voice projection           oh  i can do that     snapped agnes .  she was getting rather fed up .     where would you like it projected .         i   m sorry .  we   re talking about        agnes ground her teeth .  she was good .  and she   d show them            to here .         or there .         or here .        it wasn   t that much of a trick  she thought .  it could be very impressive if you put the words in the mouth of a nearby dummy  like some of the traveling showmen did  but you couldn   t pitch it far away and still manage to fool a whole audience .   now that she was accustomed to the gloom she could just make out people turning around in their seats  bewildered .      what   s your name again  dear .     the voice  which had at one point shown traces of condescension  had a distinct beaten up sound .      ag   per   perdita     said agnes .     perdita nitt .  perdita x   nitt .         we may have to do something about the nitt  dear .         granny weatherwax   s door opened by itself .   jarge weaver hesitated .  of course  she were a witch .  people   d told him this sort of thing happened .   he didn   t like it .  but he didn   t like his back  either  especially when his back didn   t like him .  it came to something when your vertebrae ganged up on you .   he eased himself forward  grimacing  balancing himself on two sticks .   the witch was sitting in a rocking chair  facing away from the door .   jarge hesitated .      come on in  jarge weaver     said granny weatherwax     and let me give you something for that back of yours .      the shock made him try to stand upright  and this made something white hot explode somewhere in the region of his belt .   granny weatherwax rolled her eyes  and sighed .     can you sit down .     she said .      no  miss .  i can fall over on a chair  though .      granny produced a small black bottle from an apron pocket and shook it vigorously .  jarge   s eyes widened .      you got that all ready for me .     he said .      yes     said granny truthfully .  she   d long ago been resigned to the fact that people expected a bottle of something funny colored and sticky .  it wasn   t the medicine that did the trick  though .  it was  in a way  the spoon .      this is a mixture of rare herbs and suchlike     she said .     including sucrose and akwa .         my word     said jarge  impressed .      take a swig now .      he obeyed .  it tasted faintly of licorice .      you got to take another swig last thing at night     granny went on .     an    then walk three times round a chestnut tree .            three times round a chestnut tree           an      an    put a pine board under your mattress .  got to be pine from a twenty year old tree  mind .            twenty year old tree       said jarge .  he felt he should make a contribution .     so   s the knots in me back end up in the pine .     he hazarded .   granny was impressed .  it was an outrageously ingenious bit of folk hokum worth remembering for another occasion .      you got it exactly right     she said .      and that   s it .         you wanted more .         i   thought there were dancin    and chantin    and stuff .         did that before you got here     said granny .      my word .  yes .  er   about payin              oh  i don   t want payin        said granny .        s bad luck  taking money .         oh .  right .     jarge brightened up .      but maybe   if your wife   s got any old clothes  p   raps  i   m a size twelve  black for preference  or bakes the odd cake  no plums  they gives me wind  or got a bit of old mead put by  could be  or p   raps you   ll be killing a hog about now  best back   s my favorite  maybe some ham  a few pig knuckles   anything you can spare  really .  no obligation .  i wouldn   t go around puttin    anyone under obligation  just    cos i   m a witch .  everyone all right in your house  are they .  blessed with good health  i hope .      she watched this sink in .      and now let me help you out of the door     she added .   weaver was never quite certain about what happened next .  granny  usually so sure on her feet  seemed to trip over one of his sticks as she went through the door  and fell backward  holding his shoulders  and somehow her knee came up and hit a spot on his backbone as she twisted sideways  and there was a click        aargh .         sorry .         me back .  me back .      still  jarge reasoned later  she was an old woman .  and she might be getting clumsy and she   d always been daft  but she made good potions .  they worked damn fast  too .  he was carrying his sticks by the time he got home .   granny watched him go  shaking her head .   people were so blind  she reflected .  they preferred to believe in gibberish rather than chiropracty .   of course  it was just as well this was so .  she   d much rather they went    oo    when she seemed to know who was approaching her cottage than work out that it conveniently overlooked a bend in the track  and as for the door latch and the trick with the length of black thread      but what had she done .  she   d just tricked a rather dim old man .   she   d faced wizards  monsters and elves   and now she was feeling pleased with herself because she   d fooled jarge weaver  a man who   d twice failed to become village idiot through being over qualified .   it was the slippery slope .  next thing it   d be cackling and gibbering and luring children into the oven .  and it wasn   t as if she even liked children .   for years granny weatherwax had been contented enough with the challenge that village witchcraft could offer .  and then she   d been forced to go traveling  and she   d seen a bit of the world  and it had made her itchy   especially at this time of the year  when the geese were flying overhead and the first frost had mugged innocent leaves in the deeper valleys .   she looked around at the kitchen .  it needed sweeping .  the washing up needed doing .  the walls had grown grubby .  there seemed to be so much to do that she couldn   t bring herself to do any of it .   there was a honking far above  and a ragged v of geese sped over the clearing .   they were heading for warmer weather in places granny weatherwax had only heard about .   it was tempting .      the selection committee sat around the table in the office of mr .  seldom bucket  the opera house   s new owner .  he   d been joined by salzella  the musical director  and dr .  undershaft  the chorus master .      and so     said mr .  bucket     we come to   let   s see   yes  christine   marvelous stage presence  eh .  good figure  too .     he winked at dr .  undershaft .      yes .  very pretty     said dr .  undershaft flatly .     can   t sing  though .         what you artistic types don   t realize is this is the century of the fruitbat     said bucket .     opera is a production  not just a lot of songs .         so you say .  but           the idea that a soprano should be fifteen acres of bosom in a horned helmet belongs to the past  like .      salzella and undershaft exchanged glances .  so he was going to be that kind of owner        unfortunately     said salzella sourly     the idea that a soprano should have a reasonable singing voice does not belong to the past .  she has a good figure  yes .  she certainly has a   sparkle .  but she can   t sing .         you can train her  can   t you .     said bucket .     a few years in the chorus           yes  maybe after a few years  if i persevere  she will be merely very bad     said undershaft .      er  gentlemen     said mr .  bucket .     ahem .  all right .  cards on the table  eh .  i   m a simple man  me .  no beating about the bush  speak as you find  call a spade a spade           do give us your forthright views     said salzella .  definitely that kind of owner  he thought .  self made man proud of his handiwork .  confuses bluffness and honesty with merely being rude .  i wouldn   t mind betting a dollar that he thinks he can tell a man   s character by testing the firmness of his handshake and looking deeply into his eyes .      i   ve been through the mill  i have     bucket began     and i made myself what i am today        self raising flour .  thought salzella .         but i have to  er  declare a bit of a financial interest .  her dad did  er  in fact  er  lend me a fair whack of money to help me buy this place  and he made a heartfelt fatherly request in regard to his daughter .  if i bring it to mind correctly  his exact words  er  were     don   t make me have to break your legs .     i don   t expect you artistes to understand .  it   s a business thing .  the gods help those who help themselves  that   s my motto .      salzella stuck his hands in his waistcoat pockets  leaned back and started to whistle softly .      i see     said undershaft .     well  it   s not the first time it   s happened .  normally it   s a ballerina  of course .         oh  it   s nothing like that     said bucket hurriedly .     it   s just that with the money comes this girl christine .  and you have to admit  she does look good .         oh  very well     said salzella .     it   s your opera house  i   m sure .  and now   perdita    .      they smiled at one another .      perdita .     said bucket  relieved to get the christine business over so that he could go back to being bluff and honest again .      perdita x     salzella corrected him .      what will these girls think of next .         i think she will prove an asset     said undershaft .      yes  if we ever do that opera with the elephants .         but the range   what a range she   s got           quite .  i saw you staring .         i meant her voice  salzella .  she will add body to the chorus .         she is a chorus .  we could sack everyone else .  ye gods  she can even sing in harmony with herself .  but can you see her in a major role .         good grief  no .  we   d be a laughingstock .         quite so .  she seems quite   amenable  though .         wonderful personality  i thought .  and good hair  of course .         she   d never expected it to be this easy     agnes listened in a kind of trance while people talked at her about wages  very little   the need for training  a lot   and accommodation  members of the chorus lived in the opera house itself  up near the roof  .   and then  more or less  she was forgotten about .  she stood and watched at the side of the stage while a group of ballet hopefuls were put through their delicate paces .      you do have an amazing voice     said someone behind her .   she turned .  as nanny ogg had once remarked  it was an education seeing agnes turn around .  she was light enough on her feet but the inertia of outlying parts meant that bits of agnes were still trying to work out which way to face for some time afterward .   the girl who had spoken to her was slightly built  even by ordinary standards  and had gone to some pains to make herself look even thinner .  she had long blond hair and the happy smile of someone who is aware that she is thin and has long blond hair .      my name   s christine .     she said .     isn   t this exciting .  .      and she had the type of voice that can exclaim a question .  it seemed to have an excited little squeak permanently screwed to it .      er  yes     said agnes .      i   ve been waiting for this day for years .      agnes had been waiting for it for about twenty four hours  ever since she   d seen the notice outside the opera house .  but she   d be danged if she   d say that .      where did you train .  .     said christine .     i spent three years with mme .  venturi at the quirm conservatory .         um .  i was       agnes hesitated  trying out the upcoming sentence in her head .        i trained with   dame ogg .  but she hasn   t got a conservatory  because it   s hard to get the glass up the mountain .      christine didn   t appear to want to question this .  anything she found too difficult to understand  she ignored .      the money in the chorus isn   t very good  is it .  .     she said .      no .     it was less than you   d get for scrubbing floors .  the reason was that  when you advertised a dirty floor  hundreds of hopefuls didn   t turn up .      but it   s what i   ve always wanted to do .  besides  there   s the status .         yes  i expect there is .         i   ve been to look at the rooms we get .  they   re very poky .  what room have you been given .  .      agnes looked down blankly at the key she had been handed  along with many sharp instructions about no men and an unpleasant not that you need telling expression on the chorus mistress   s face .      oh      .      christine clapped her hands .     oh  goody .  .         pardon .         i   m so glad .  .  you   re next to me .  .      agnes was taken aback .  she   d always been resigned to being the last to be picked in the great team game of life .      well   yes  i suppose so       she said .      you   re so lucky .  .  you   ve got such a majestic figure for opera .  .  and such marvelous hair  the way you pile it up like that .  .  black suits you  by the way .  .      majestic  thought agnes .  it was a word that would never  ever have occurred to her .  and she   d always steered away from white because in white she looked like a washing line on a windy day .   she followed christine .   it occurred to agnes  as she trudged after the girl en route to her new lodgings  that if you spent much time in the same room as christine you   d need to open a window to stop from drowning in punctuation .   from somewhere at the back of the stage  quite unheeded  someone watched them go .      people were generally glad to see nanny ogg .  she was good at making them feel at home in their own home .   but she was a witch  and therefore also expert at arriving just after cakes were baked or sausages were made .  nanny ogg generally traveled with a string bag stuffed up one knee length knicker leg   in case  as she put it  someone wants to give me something .      so  mrs .  nitt     she observed  around about the third cake and fourth cup of tea     how   s that daughter of yours .  agnes it is to whom i refer .         oh  didn   t you hear  mrs .  ogg .  she   s gone off to ankh morpork to be a singer .      nanny ogg   s heart sank .      that   s nice     she said .     she has a good singing voice  i remember .  of course  i gave her a few tips .  i used to hear her singing in the woods .         it   s the air here     said mrs .  nitt .     she   s always had such a good chest .         yes  indeed .  noted for it .  so   er   she   s not here  then .         you know our agnes .  she never says much .  i think she thought it was a bit dull .         dull .  lancre .     said nanny ogg .      that   s what i said     said mrs .  nitt .     i said we get some lovely sunsets up here .  and there   s the fair every soul cake tuesday  regular .      nanny ogg thought about agnes .  you needed quite large thoughts to fit all of agnes in .   lancre had always bred strong  capable women .  a lancre farmer needed a wife who   d think nothing of beating a wolf to death with her apron when she went out to get some firewood .  and  while kissing initially seemed to have more charms than cookery  a stolid lancre lad looking for a bride would bear in mind his father   s advice that kisses eventually lost their fire but cookery tended to get even better over the years  and direct his courting to those families that clearly showed a tradition of enjoying their food .   agnes was  nanny considered  quite good looking in an expansive kind of way  she was a fine figure of typical young lancre womanhood .  this meant she was approximately two womanhoods from anywhere else .   nanny also recalled her as being rather thoughtful and shy  as if trying to reduce the amount of world she took up .   but she had shown signs of craft ability .  that was only to be expected .  there was nothing like that not fitting in feeling to stimulate the old magical nerves  that was why esme was so good at it .  in agnes   s case this had manifested itself in a tendency to wear soppy black lace gloves and pale makeup and call herself perdita plus an initial from the arse of the alphabet  but nanny had assumed that would soon burn off when she got some serious witchcraft under her rather strained belt .   she should have paid more attention to the thing about music .  power found its way out by all sorts of routes     music and magic had a lot in common .  they were only two letters apart  for one thing .  and you couldn   t do both .   damn .  nanny had rather been counting on the girl .      she used to send off to ankh morpork for music     said mrs .  nitt .     see .      she handed nanny several piles of papers .   nanny leafed through them .  song sheets were common enough in the ramtops  and a singsong in the parlor was considered the third best thing to do on long dark evenings .  but nanny could see this wasn   t ordinary music .  it was far too crowded for that .      cosi fan hita     she read .     die meistersinger von scrote .         that   s foreign     said mrs .  nitt proudly .      it certainly is     said nanny .   mrs .  nitt was looking expectantly at her .      what .     said nanny  and then     oh .      mrs .  nitt   s eyes flickered to her emptied teacup and back again .   nanny ogg sighed and laid the music aside .  occasionally she saw granny weatherwax   s point .  sometimes people expected too little of witches .      yes  indeedy     she said  trying to smile .     let us see what destiny in the form of these dried up bits of leaf has in store for us  eh .      she set her features in a suitable occult expression and looked down into the cup .   which  a second later  smashed into fragments when it hit the floor .      it was a small room .  in fact it was half a small room  since a thin wall had been built across it .  junior members of the chorus ranked rather lower in the opera than apprentice scene shifters .   there was room for a bed  a wardrobe  a dressingtable and  quite out of place  a huge mirror  as big as the door .      impressive  isn   t it .  .     said christine .     they tried to take it out but it   s built into the wall  apparently .  .  i   m sure it will be very useful .  .      agnes said nothing .  her own half room  the other half of this one  didn   t have a mirror .  she was glad of that .  she did not regard mirrors as naturally friendly .  it wasn   t just the images they showed her .  there was something   worrying   about mirrors .  she   d always felt that .  they seemed to be looking at her .  agnes hated being looked at .   christine stepped into the small space in the middle of the floor and twirled .  there was something very enjoyable about watching her .  it was the sparkle  agnes thought .  something about christine suggested sequins .      isn   t this nice .  .     she said .   not liking christine would be like not liking small fluffy animals .  and christine was just like a small fluffy animal .  a rabbit  perhaps .  it was certainly impossible for her to get a whole idea into her head in one go .  she had to nibble it into manageable bits .   agnes glanced at the mirror again .  her reflection stared at her .  she could have done with some time to herself right now .  everything had happened so quickly .  and this place made her uneasy .  everything would feel a lot better if she could just have some time to herself .   christine stopped twirling .     are you all right .  .      agnes nodded .      do tell me about yourself .  .         er   well       agnes was gratified  despite herself .     i   m from somewhere up in the mountains you   ve probably never heard of        she stopped .  a light had gone off in christine   s head  and agnes realized that the question had been asked not because christine in any way wanted to know the answer but for something to say .  she went on        and my father is the emperor of klatch and my mother is a small tray of raspberry puddings .         that   s interesting .     said christine  who was looking at the mirror .     do you think my hair looks right .  .         what agnes would have said  if christine had been capable of listening to anything for more than a couple of seconds  was   she   d woken up one morning with the horrible realization that she   d been saddled with a lovely personality .  it was as simple as that .  oh  and very good hair .   it wasn   t so much the personality  it was the    but    that people always added when they talked about it .  but she   s got a lovely personality  they said .  it was the lack of choice that rankled .  no one had asked her  before she was born  whether she wanted a lovely personality or whether she   d prefer  say  a miserable personality but a body that could take size nine in dresses .  instead  people would take pains to tell her that beauty was only skin deep  as if a man ever fell for an attractive pair of kidneys .   she could feel a future trying to land on her .   she   d caught herself saying    poot .     and    dang .     when she wanted to swear  and using pink writing paper .   she   d got a reputation for being calm and capable in a crisis .   next thing she knew she   d be making shortbread and apple pies as good as her mother   s  and then there   d be no hope for her .   so she   d introduced perdita .  she   d heard somewhere that inside every fat woman was a thin woman trying to get out   so she   d named her perdita .  she was a good repository for all those thoughts that agnes couldn   t think on account of her wonderful personality .  perdita would use black writing paper if she could get away with it  and would be beautifully pale instead of embarrassingly flushed .  perdita wanted to be an interestingly lost soul in plum colored lipstick .  just occasionally  though  agnes thought perdita was as dumb as she was .   was the only alternative the witches .  she   d felt their interest in her  in a way she couldn   t exactly identify .  it was of a piece with knowing when someone was watching you  although she had  in fact  occasionally seen nanny ogg watching her in a critical kind of fashion  like someone inspecting a second hand horse .   she knew she did have some talent .  sometimes she knew things that were going to happen  although always in a sufficiently confused way that the knowledge was totally useless until afterward .  and there was her voice .  she was aware it wasn   t quite natural .  she   d always enjoyed singing and  somehow  her voice had just done everything she   d wanted it to do .   but she   d seen the ways the witches lived .  oh  nanny ogg was all right   quite a nice old baggage really .  but the others were weird  lying crosswise on the world instead of nicely parallel to it like everyone else   old mother dismass who could see into the past and the future but was totally blind in the present  and millie hopwood over in slice  who stuttered and had runny ears  and as for granny weatherwax     oh  yes .  finest job in the world .  being a sour old woman with no friends .   they were always looking for weird people like themselves .   well  they could look in vain for agnes nitt .   fed up with living in lancre  and fed up with the witches  and above all fed up with being agnes nitt  she   d   escaped .      nanny ogg didn   t look built for running  but she covered the ground deceptively fast  her great heavy boots kicking up shoals of leaves .   there was a trumpeting overhead .  another skein of geese passed across the sky  so fast in pursuit of the summer that their wings were hardly moving in the ballistic rush .   granny weatherwax   s cottage looked deserted .  it had  nanny felt  a particularly empty feel .   she scurried around to the back door and burst through  pounded up the stairs  saw the gaunt figure on the bed  reached an instant conclusion  grabbed the pitcher of water from its place on the marble washstand  ran forward     a hand shot up and grabbed her wrist .      i was having a nap     said granny  opening her eyes .     gytha  i swear i could feel you comin    half a mile away           we got to make a cup of tea quick .     gasped nanny  almost sagging with relief .   granny weatherwax was more than bright enough not to ask questions .   but you couldn   t hurry a good cup of tea .  nanny ogg jiggled from one foot to the other while the fire was pumped up  the small frogs fished out of the water bucket  the water boiled  the dried leaves allowed to seep .      i ain   t saying nothing     said nanny  sitting down at last .     just pour a cup  that   s all .      on the whole  witches despised fortune telling from tea leaves .  tea leaves are not uniquely fortunate in knowing what the future holds .  they are really just something for the eyes to rest on while the mind does the work .  practically anything would do .  the scum on a puddle  the skin on a custard   anything .  nanny ogg could see the future in the froth on a beer mug .  it invariably showed that she was going to enjoy a refreshing drink which she almost certainly was not going to pay for .      you recall young agnes nitt .     said nanny as granny weatherwax tried to find the milk .   granny hesitated .      agnes who calls herself perditax .         perdita x     said nanny .  she at least respected anyone   s right to recreate themselves .   granny shrugged .     fat girl .  big hair .  walks with her feet turned out .  sings to herself in the woods .  good voice .  reads books .  says    poot .     instead of swearing .  blushes when anyone looks at her .  wears black lace gloves with the fingers cut out .         you remember we once talked about maybe how possibly she might be   suitable .         oh  there   s a twist in the soul there  you   re right     said granny .     but   it   s an unfortunate name .         her father   s name was terminal     said nanny ogg reflectively .     there were three sons  primal  medial and terminal .  i   m afraid the family   s always had a problem with education .         i meant agnes     said granny .     always puts me in mind of carpet fluff  that name .         prob   ly that   s why she called herself perdita     said nanny .      worse .         got her fixed in your mind .     said nanny .      yes  i suppose so .         good .  now look at them tea leaves .      granny looked down .   there was no particular drama  perhaps because of the way nanny had built up expectations .  but granny did hiss between her teeth .      well  now .  there   s a thing     she said .      see it .  see it .         yep .         like   a skull .         yep .         and them eyes .  i nearly pi   i was pretty damn surprised by them eyes  i can tell you .      granny carefully replaced the cup .      her mam showed me her letters home     said nanny .     i brung    em with me .  it   s worrying  esme .  she could be facing something bad .  she   s a lancre girl .  one of ours .  nothing   s too much trouble when it   s one of your own  i always say .         tea leaves can   t tell the future     said granny quietly .     everyone knows that .         tea leaves don   t know .         well  who   d be so daft as to tell anything to a bunch of dried leaves .      nanny ogg looked down at agnes   s letters home .  they were written in the careful rounded script of someone who   d been taught to write as a child by copying letters on a slate  and had never written enough as an adult to change their style .  the person writing them had also very conscientiously drawn faint pencil lines on the paper before writing .       dear mam  i hope this finds you as it leaves me .  here i am in ankh morpork and everything is all right  i have not been ravished yet .  . i am staying at   treacle mine road  it is alright and       granny tried another .       dear mum  i hope you are well .  everything is fine but  the money runs away like water here .  i am doing some singing in taverns but i am not making much so i went to see the guild of seamstresses about getting a sewing job and i took along some stitching to show them and you   d be amazed  that   s all i can say       and another         dear mother  some good news at last .  next week they   re holding auditions at the opera house          what   s opera .     said granny weatherwax .      it   s like theater  with singing     said nanny ogg .      hah .  theater     said granny darkly .      our nev told me about it .  it   s all singing in foreign languages  he said .  he couldn   t understand any of it .      granny put down the letters .      yes  but your nev can   t understand a lot of things .  what was he doing at this opera theater  anyway .         nicking the lead off the roof .     nanny said this quite happily .  it wasn   t theft if an ogg was doing it .      can   t tell much from the letters  except that she   s picking up an education     said granny .     but it   s a long way to        there was a hesitant knock on the door .  it was shawn ogg  nanny   s youngest son and lancre   s entire civil and public service .  currently he had his postman   s badge on  the lancre postal service consisted of taking the mailbag off the nail where the coach left it and delivering it to the outlying homesteads when he had a moment  although many citizens were in the habit of going down to the sack and rummaging until they found some mail they liked .   he touched his helmet respectfully at granny weatherwax .      got a lot of letters  mum     he said to nanny ogg .     er .  they   re all addressed to  er  well   er   you   d better have a look  mum .      nanny ogg took the proffered bundle .         the lancre witch        she said aloud .      that   d be me  then     said granny weatherwax firmly  and took the letters .      ah .  well  i   d better be going       said nanny  backing toward the door .      can   t imagine why people   d be writing to me     said granny  slitting an envelope .     still  i suppose news gets around .     she focused on the words .         dear witch        she read        i would just like to say how much i appreciated the famous carrot and oyster pie recipe .  my husband           nanny ogg made it halfway down the path before her boots became  suddenly  too heavy to lift .      gytha ogg  you come back here right now .         agnes tried again .  she didn   t really know anyone in ankh morpork and she did need someone to talk to  even if they didn   t listen .      i suppose mainly i came because of the witches     she said .   christine turned  her eyes wide with fascination .  so was her mouth .  it was like looking at a rather pretty bowling ball .      witches .  .     she breathed .      oh  yes     said agnes wearily .  yes .  people were always fascinated by the idea of witches .  they should try living around them  she thought .      do they do spells and ride around on broomsticks .  .         oh  yes .         no wonder you ran away .         what .  oh   no   it   s not like that .  i mean  they   re not bad .  it   s much   worse than that .         worse than bad .  .         they think they know what   s best for everybody .      christine   s forehead wrinkled  as it tended to when she was contemplating a problem more complex than    what is your name .         that doesn   t sound very ba           they   mess people around .  they think that just because they   re right that   s the same as good .  it   s not even as though they do any real magic .  it   s all fooling people and being clever .  they think they can do what they like .      the force of the words knocked even christine back .     oh  dear .  .  did they want you to do something .  .         they want me to be something .  but i   m not going to .      christine stared at her .  and then  automatically  forgot everything she   d just heard .      come on     she said     let   s have a look around .  .         nanny ogg balanced on a chair and took down an oblong wrapped in paper .   granny watched sternly with her arms folded .      thing is     nanny babbled  under the laser glare     my late husband  i remember him once sayin    to me  after dinner  he said     you know  mother  it   d be a real shame if all the stuff you know just passed away when you did .  why don   t you write some of it down .     so i scribbled the odd one  when i had a moment  and then i thought it   d be nice to have it all properly done so i sent it off to the almanac people in ankh morpork and they hardly charged me anything and a little while ago they sent me this  i think it   s a very good job  it   s amazing how they get all the letters so neat           you done a book     said granny .      only cookery     said nanny ogg meekly  as one might plead a first offense .      what do you know about it .  you hardly ever do any cooking     said granny .      i do specialities     said nanny .   granny looked at the offending volume .      the joye of snacks     she read out loud .        bye a lancre witch .     hah .  why dint you put your own name on it  eh .  books   ve got to have a name on    em so   s everyone knows who   s guilty .         it   s my gnome de plum     said nanny .     mr .  goatberger the almanac man said it   d make it sound more mysterious .      granny cast her gimlet gaze to the bottom of the crowded cover  where it said  in very small lettering     cxxviith printyng .  more than twenty thoufand solde .  one half dollar .         you sent them some money to get it all printed .     she said .      only a couple of dollars     said nanny .     damn good job they made of it  too .  and then they sent the money back afterward  only they got it wrong and sent three dollars extra .      granny weatherwax was grudgingly literate but keenly numerate .  she assumed that anything written down was probably a lie  and that applied to numbers  too .  numbers were used only by people who wanted to put one over on you .   her lips moved silently as she thought about numbers .      oh     she said  quietly .     and that was it  was it .  you never wrote to him again .         not on your life .  three dollars  mind .  i dint want him saying he wanted    em back .         i can see that     said granny  still dwelling in the world of numbers .  she wondered how much it cost to do a book .  it couldn   t be a lot  they had sort of printing mills to do the actual work .      after all  there   s a lot you can do with three dollars     said nanny .      right enough     said granny .     you ain   t got a pencil about you  have you .  you being a literary type and all .         i got a slate     said nanny .      pass it over  then .         i bin keeping it by me in case i wake up in the night and i get an idea for a recipe  see     said nanny .      good     said granny vaguely .  the slate pencil squeaked across the gray tablet .  the paper must cost something .  and you   d probably have to tip someone a couple of pennies to sell it    angular figures danced from column to column .      i   ll make another cup of tea  shall i .     said nanny  relieved that the conversation appeared to be coming to a peaceful end .      hmm .     said granny .  she stared at the result and drew two lines under it .     but you enjoyed it  did you .     she called out .     the writin    .      nanny ogg poked her head around the scullery door .     oh  yes .  the money dint matter     she said .      you   ve never been very good at numbers  have you .     said granny .  now she drew a circle around the final figure .      oh  you know me  esme     said nanny cheerfully .     i couldn   t subtract a fart from a plate of beans .         that   s good     cos i reckon this master goatberger owes you a bit more than you got  if there   s any justice in the world     said granny .      money ain   t everything  esme .  what i say is  if you   ve got your health           i reckon  if there   s any justice  it   s about four or five thousand dollars     said granny quietly .   there was a crash from the scullery .      so it   s a good job the money don   t matter     granny weatherwax went on .     it   d be a terrible thing otherwise .  all that money  matterin    .      nanny ogg   s white face appeared around the edge of the door .     he never .         could be a bit more     said granny .      it never .         you just adds up and divides and that .      nanny ogg stared in horrified fascination at her own fingers .      but that   s a       she stopped .  the only word she could think of was    fortune    and that wasn   t adequate .  witches didn   t operate in a cash economy .  the whole of the ramtops  by and large  got by without the complications of capital .  fifty dollars was a fortune .  a hundred dollars was a  was a  was   well  it was two fortunes  that was what it was .      it   s a lot of money     she said weakly .     what couldn   t i do with money like that .         dunno     said granny weatherwax .     what did you do with the three dollars .         got it in a tin up the chimney     said nanny ogg .   granny nodded approvingly .  this was the kind of good fiscal practice she liked to see .      beats me why people   d fall over themselves to read a cookery book  though     she added .     i mean  it   s not the sort of thing that        the room fell silent .  nanny ogg shuffled her boots .   granny said  in a voice laden with a suspicion that was all the worse because it wasn   t yet quite sure what it was suspicious of     it is a cookery book  isn   t it .         oh  yes     said nanny hurriedly  avoiding granny   s gaze .     yes .  recipes and that .  yes .      granny glared at her .     just recipes .         yes .  oh  yes .  yes .  and some   cookery anecdotes  yes .      granny went on glaring .   nanny gave in .      er   look under famous carrot and oyster pie     she said .     page    .      granny turned the pages .  her lips moved silently .  then     i see .  anything else .         er   cinnamon and marshmallow fingers   page           granny looked it up .      and .         er   celery astonishment   page    .      granny looked that up  too .      can   t say it astonished me     she said .     and    .         er   well  more or less all of humorous puddings and cake decoration .  that   s all of chapter six .  i done illustrations for that .      granny turned to chapter six .  she had to turn the book around a couple of times .      what one you looking at .     said nanny ogg  because an author is always keen to get feedback .      strawberry wobbler     said granny .      ah .  that one always gets a laugh .      it did not appear to be obtaining one from granny .  she carefully closed the book .      gytha     she said     this is me askin    you this .  is there any page in this book  is there any single recipe  which does not in some way relate to   goings on .      nanny ogg  her face red as her apples  seemed to give this some lengthy consideration .      porridge     she said  eventually .      really .         yes .  er .  no  i tell a lie  it   s got my special honey mixture in it .      granny turned a page .      what about this one .  maids of honor .         weeelll  they starts out as maids of honor     said nanny  fidgeting with her feet     but they ends up tarts .      granny looked at the front cover again .  the joye of snacks .      an    you actually set out to           it just sort of turned out that way  really .      granny weatherwax was not a jouster in the lists of love but  as an intelligent onlooker  she knew how the game was played .  no wonder the book had sold like hot cakes .  half the recipes told you how to make them .  it was surprising the pages hadn   t singed .   and it was by    a lancre witch .     the world was  granny weatherwax modestly admitted  well aware of who the witch of lancre was  viz  it was her .      gytha ogg     she said .      yes  esme .         gytha ogg  you look me in the eye .         sorry  esme .            a lancre witch     it says here .         i never thought  esme .         so you   ll go and see mr .  goatberger and have this stopped  right .  i don   t want people lookin    at me and thinkin    about the bananana soup surprise .  i don   t even believe the bananana soup surprise .  and i ain   t relishin    going down the street and hearin    people makin    cracks about bananas .         yes  esme .         and i   ll come with you to make sure you do .         yes  esme .         and we   ll talk to the man about your money .         yes  esme .         and we might just drop in on young agnes to make sure she   s all right .         yes  esme .         but we   ll do it diplomatic like .  we don   t want people thinkin    we   re pokin    our noses in .         yes  esme .         no one could say i interfere where i   m not wanted .  you won   t find anyone callin    me a busybody .         yes  esme .         that was     yes  esme  you won   t find anyone callin    you a busybody     was it .         oh  yes  esme .         you sure about that .         yes  esme .         good .      granny looked out at the dull gray sky and the dying leaves and felt  amazingly enough  her sap rising .  a day ago the future had looked aching and desolate  and now it looked full of surprises and terror and bad things happening to people     if she had anything to do with it  anyway .   in the scullery  nanny ogg grinned to herself .      agnes had known a little bit about the theater .  a traveling company came to lancre sometimes .  their stage was about twice the size of a door  and    backstage    consisted of a bit of sacking behind which was usually a man trying to change trousers and wigs at the same time and another man  dressed as a king  having a surreptitious smoke .   the opera house was almost as big as the patrician   s palace  and far more palatial .  it covered three acres .  there was stabling for twenty horses and two elephants in the cellar  agnes spent some time there  because the elephants were reassuringly larger than her .   there were rooms behind the stage so big that entire sets were stored there .  there was a whole ballet school somewhere in the building .  some of the girls were on stage now  ugly in woolly jumpers  going through a routine .   the inside of the opera house   at least  the backstage inside   put agnes strongly in mind of the clock her brother had taken apart to find the tick .  it was hardly a building .  it was more like a machine .  sets and curtains and ropes hung in the darkness like dreadful things in a forgotten cellar .  the stage was only a small part of the place  a little rectangle of light in a huge  complicated darkness full of significant machinery     a piece of dust floated down from the blackness high above .  she brushed it off .      i thought i heard someone up there     she said .      it   s probably the ghost .  .     said christine .     we   ve got one  you know .  oh  i said we .  .  isn   t this exciting .  .         a man with his face covered by a white mask     said agnes .      oh .  .  you   ve heard about him  then .  .         what .  who .         the ghost .  .      blast  thought agnes .  it was always ready to catch her out .  just when she thought she   d put all that behind her .  she   d know things without quite knowing why .  it upset people .  it certainly upset her .      oh  i   suppose someone must have told me       she mumbled .      he moves around the opera house invisibly  they say .  .  one moment he   ll be in the gods  next moment he   ll be backstage somewhere .  .  no one knows how he does it .  .         really .         they say he watches every performance .  .  that   s why they never sell tickets for box eight  didn   t you know .  .         box eight .     said agnes .     what   s a box .         boxes .  you know .  that   s where you get the best people .  .  look  i shall show you .      christine marched to the front of the stage and waved a hand grandly at the empty auditorium .      the boxes .     she said .     over there .  and right up there  the gods .      her voice bounced back from the distant wall .      aren   t the best people in the gods .  it sounds           oh  no .  the best people will be in boxes .  or possibly in the stalls .      agnes pointed .      who   s down there .  they must get a good view           don   t be silly .  .  that   s the pit .  .  that   s for the musicians .  .         well  that makes sense  anyway .  er .  which one   s box eight .         i don   t know .  but they say if ever they sell seats in box eight there   ll be a dreadful tragedy .  .  isn   t that romantic .  .      for some reason agnes   s practical eye was drawn to the huge chandelier that hung over the auditorium like a fantastic sea monster .  its thick rope disappeared into the darkness near the ceiling .   the glass chimes tinkled .   another flare of that certain power which agnes did her best to suppress at every turn flashed a treacherous image across her mind .      that looks like an accident waiting to happen if ever i saw one     she mumbled .      i   m sure it   s perfectly safe .  .     trilled christine .     i   m sure they wouldn   t allow        a chord rolled out  shaking the stage .  the chandelier tinkled  and more dust came down .      what was that .     said agnes .      it was the organ .  .  it   s so big it   s behind the stage .  .  come on  let   s go and see .  .      other members of the staff were hurrying toward the organ .  there was an overturned bucket nearby  and a spreading pool of green paint .   a carpenter reached past agnes and picked up an envelope that was lying on the organ seat .      it   s for the boss     he said .      when it   s my mail  the postman usually just knocks     said a ballerina  and giggled .   agnes looked up .  ropes swung lazily in the musty darkness .  for a moment she thought she saw a flash of white  and then it was gone .   there was a shape  just visible  tangled in the ropes .   something wet and sticky dripped down and splashed on the keyboard .   people were already screaming when agnes reached past  dipped her finger in the growing puddle  and sniffed .      it   s blood .     said the carpenter .      it   s blood  isn   t it .     said a musician .      blood .  .     screamed christine .     blood .  .      it was agnes   s terrible fate to keep her head in a crisis .  she sniffed her finger again .      it   s turpentine     said agnes .     er .  sorry .  is that wrong .      up in the tangle of ropes  the figure moaned .      shouldn   t we get him down .     she added .      cando cutoff was a humble woodcutter .  he wasn   t humble because he was a woodcutter .  he would still have been quite humble if he   d owned five logging mills .  he was just naturally humble .   and he was unpretentiously stacking some logs at the point where the lancre road met the main mountain road when he saw a farm cart rumble to a halt and unload two elderly ladies in black .  both carried a broomstick in one hand and a sack in the other .   they were arguing .  it was not a raised voice argument  but a chronic wrangle that had clearly been going on for some time and was set in for the rest of the decade .      it   s all very well for you  but it   s my three dollars so i don   t see why i can   t say how we go .         i likes flying .         and i   m telling you it   s too draughty on broomsticks this time of year  esme .  the breeze gets into places i wouldn   t dream of talking about .         really .  can   t imagine where those   d be  then .         oh  esme .         don   t    oh  esme    me .  it weren   t me that come up with the amusing wedding trifle with the special sponge fingers .         anyway  greebo don   t like it on the broomstick .  he   s got a delicate stomach .      cutoff noticed that one of the sacks was moving in a lazy way .      gytha  i   ve seen him eat half a skunk  so don   t tell me about his delicate stomach     said granny  who disliked cats on principle .     anyway   he   s been doing it again .      nanny ogg waved her hands airily .      oh  he only does it sometimes  when he   s really in a corner     she said .      he did it in ole mrs .  grope   s henhouse last week .  she went in to see what all the ruckus was  and he did it right in front of her .  she had to have a lie down .         he was probably more frightened than she was     said nanny defensively .      that   s what comes of getting strange ideas in foreign parts     said granny .     now you   ve got a cat who   yes  what is it .      cutoff had meekly approached them and was hovering in the kind of half crouch of someone trying to be noticed while also not wanting to intrude .      are you ladies waiting for the stagecoach .         yes     said the taller of the ladies .      um  i   m afraid the next coach doesn   t stop here .  it doesn   t stop until creel springs .      they gave him a couple of polite stares .      thank you     said the tall one .  she turned to her companion .      it gave her a nasty shock  anyway .  i dread to think what he   ll learn this time .         he pines when i   m gone .  he won   t take food from anyone else .         only    cos they try to poison him  and no wonder .      cutoff shook his head sadly and wandered back to his log pile .   the coach turned up five minutes later  coming around the corner at speed .  it drew level with the women        and stopped .  that is  the horses tried to stand still and the wheels locked .   it wasn   t so much a skid as a spin  and the whole thing gradually came to rest about fifty yards down the road  with the driver in a tree .   the women strolled toward it  still arguing .   one of them poked the driver with her broomstick .     two tickets to ankh morpork  please .      he landed in the road .      what do you mean  two tickets to ankh morpork .  the coach doesn   t stop here .         looks stopped to me .         did you do something .         what  us .         listen  lady  even if i was stopping here the tickets are forty damn dollars each .         oh .         why   ve you got broomsticks .     shouted the driver .     are you witches .         yes .  have you got any special low terms for witches .         yeah  how about    meddling  interfering old baggages    .      cutoff felt that he must have missed part of the conversation  because the next exchange went like this      what was that again  young man .         two complimentary tickets to ankh morpork  ma   am .  no problem .         inside seats  mind .  no traveling on the top .         certainly  ma   am .  excuse me while i just kneel in the dirt so   s you can step up  ma   am .      cutoff nodded happily to himself as the coach pulled away again .  it was nice to see that good manners and courtesy were still alive .      with great difficulty and much shouting and untangling of ropes far above  the figure was lowered to the stage .   he was soaked in paint and turpentine .  the swelling audience of off duty staff and rehearsal truants crowded in around him .   agnes knelt down  loosened his collar and tried to unwind the rope that had caught around arm and neck .      does anyone know him .     she said .      it   s tommy cripps     said a musician .     he paints scenery .      tommy moaned  and opened his eyes .      i saw him .     he muttered .     it was horrible .         saw what .     said agnes .  and then she had a sudden feeling that she   d intruded on some private conversation .  around her there was a babble of voices .      giselle said she saw him last week .         he   s here .         it   s happening again .         are we all doomed .  .     squeaked christine .   tommy cripps gripped agnes   s arm .      he   s got a face like death .         who .         the ghost .         what gho    .         it   s white bone .  he has no nose .      a couple of ballet dancers fainted  but carefully  so as not to get their clothes dirty .      then how does he       agnes began .      i saw him too .      on cue  the company turned .   an elderly man advanced across the stage .  he wore an ancient opera hat and carried a sack over one shoulder  while his spare hand made the needlessly expansive gestures of someone who has got hold of some direful information and can   t wait to freeze all nearby spines .  the sack must have contained something alive  because it was bouncing around .      i saw him .  ooooooh yes .  wi    his great black cloak and his white face with no eyes but only two holes where eyes should be .  ooohhhh .  and           he had a mask on .     said agnes .   the old man paused and shot her the dark look reserved for all those who insist on injecting a note of sanity when things are getting interestingly ghastly .      and he had no nose .     he went on  ignoring her .      i just said that     muttered tommy cripps  in a rather annoyed voice .     i told them that .  they already know that .         if he had no nose  how did he sme       agnes began  but no one was listening to her .      did you mention about the eyes .     said the old man .      i was just getting round to the eyes     snapped tommy .     yes  he had eyes like           are we talking about some kind of mask here .     said agnes .   now everyone was giving her that kind of look ufologists get when they suddenly say     hey  if you shade your eyes you can see it is just a flock of geese after all .      the man with the sack coughed and regrouped .     like great holes  they were       he began  but it was clear that it had all been spoiled for him .     great holes     he said sourly .     that   s what i saw .  and no nose  i might add  thank you so very much .         it   s the ghost again .     said a scene shifter .      he jumped out from behind the organ     said tommy cripps .     next thing i knew  there was a rope around my neck and i was upside down .      the company looked at the man with the sack  in case he could trump this .      great big black holes     he managed  sticking to what he knew .      all right  everyone  what   s going on here .      an imposing figure strode out of the wings .  he had flowing black hair  carefully brushed to give it a carefree alfresco look  but the face underneath was the face of an organizer .  he nodded at the old man with the sack .      what are you staring at  mr .  pounder .     he said .   the old man looked down .     i knows what i saw  mr .  salzella     he said .     i see lots o    things  i do .         as much as is visible through the bottom of a bottle  i have no doubt  you old reprobate .  what happened to tommy .         it was the ghost .     said tommy  delighted to have center stage again .     he swooped out at me  mr .  salzella .  i think my leg is broken     he added quickly  in the voice of one who is suddenly aware of the time off opportunities of the situation .   agnes expected the newcomer to say something like    ghosts .  there   s no such thing .     he had the kind of face that said that .   instead  he said     back again  is he .  where did he go .         didn   t see  mr .  salzella .  he just swooped off again .         some of you help tommy down to the canteen     said salzella .     and someone else fetch a doctor           his leg isn   t broken     said agnes .     but that   s a nasty rope burn on his neck and he   s filled his own ear with paint .         what do you know about it  miss .     said tommy .  a paint filled ear didn   t sound as though it had the possibilities of a broken leg .      i   ve   er   had some training     said agnes  and then added quickly     it   s a nasty burn  though  and of course there may be some delayed shock .         brandy is very good for that  isn   t it .     said tommy .     perhaps you could try forcing some between my lips .         thank you  perdita .  the rest of you  go back to what you were doing     said salzella .      big dark holes     said mr .  pounder .     big ones .         yes  thank you  mr .  pounder .  help ron with mr .  cripps  will you .  perdita  you come here .  and you  christine .      the two girls stood before the director of music .      did you see anything .     said salzella .      i saw a great creature with great flapping wings and great big holes where his eyes should be .  .     said christine .      i   m afraid i just saw something white up in the ceiling     said agnes .     sorry .      she blushed  aware of how useless that sounded .  perdita would have seen a mysterious cloaked figure or something   something interesting     salzella smiled at her .     you mean you just see things that are really there .     he said .     i can see you haven   t been with the opera for long  dear .  but i may say i   m pleased to have a level headed person around here for once           oh  no .     screamed someone .      it   s the ghost .  .     shrieked christine  automatically .      er .  it   s the young man behind the organ     said agnes .     sorry .         observant as well as level headed     said salzella .     whereas i can see that you  christine  will fit right in here .  what   s the matter  andr   .      a fair haired young man peered around the organ pipes .      someone   s been smashing things  mr .  salzella     he said mournfully .     the pallet springs and the backfalls and everything .  completely ruined .  i   m sure i won   t be able to get a tune out of it .  and it   s priceless .      salzella sighed .     all right .  i   ll tell mister bucket     he said .     thank you  everyone .      he gave agnes a gloomy nod  and strode off .         you shouldn   t ort to do that to people     said nanny ogg in a vague sort of way  as the coach began to get up speed .   she looked around with a wide  friendly grin at the now rather disheveled occupants of the coach .      morning     she said  delving into the sack .     i   m gytha ogg  i   ve got fifteen children  this is my friend esme weatherwax  we   re going to ankh morpork  would anyone like an egg sandwich .  i   ve brung plenty .  the cat   s been sleepin    on them but they   re fine  look  they bend back all right .  no .  please yourself  i   m sure .  let   s see what else we   ve got   ah  has anybody got an opener for a bottle of beer .      a man in the corner indicated that he might have such a thing .      fine     said nanny ogg .     anyone got something to drink a bottle of beer out of .      another man nodded hopefully .      good     said nanny ogg .     now  has anybody got a bottle of beer .      granny  for once not the center of attention as all horrified eyes were on nanny and her sack  surveyed the other occupants of the coach .   the express stage went right over the ramtops and all the way through the patchwork of little countries beyond .  if it cost forty dollars just from lancre  then it must have cost these people a lot more .  what sort of folk spent the best part of two months    wages just to travel fast and uncomfortably .   the thin man who sat clutching his bag was probably a spy  she decided .  the fat man who   d volunteered the glass looked as if he sold things  he had the unpleasant complexion of someone who   d hit too many bottles but missed too many meals .   they were huddled together on their seat because the rest of it was occupied by a man of almost wizardly proportions .  he didn   t appear to have woken up when the coach stopped .  there was a handkerchief over his face .  he was snoring with the regularity of a geyser  and looked as though the only worries he might have in the world were a tendency for small objects to gravitate toward him  and the occasional tide .   nanny ogg continued to rummage around in her bag and  as was the case when she was preoccupied  her mouth had wired itself to her eyeballs without her brain intervening .   she was used to traveling by broomstick .  long distance ground travel was a novelty to her  so she   d prepared with some care .         lessee now   book of puzzles for long journeys   cushion   foot powder   mosquito trap   phrase book   bag to be sick into   oh dear        the audience  which against all probability had managed to squeeze itself farther away from nanny during the litany  waited with horrified interest .      what .     said granny .      how often d   you reckon this coach stops .         what   s the matter .         i should   ve gone before we left .  sorry .  it   s the jolting .  anyone know if there   s a privy on this thing .     she added brightly .      er     said the probable spy     we generally wait until the next stop  or       he stopped .  he had been about to add    there   s always the window     which was a manly option on the bumpier rural stretches  but he stopped himself in the horrible apprehension that this ghastly old woman might seriously consider the possibility .      there   s ohulan just a bit further on the road     said granny  who was trying to doze .     you just wait .         this coach doesn   t stop at ohulan     said the spy helpfully .   granny weatherwax raised her head .      up until now  that is     said the spy .      mr .  bucket was sitting in his office trying to make sense of the opera house   s books .   they didn   t make any kind of sense .  he reckoned he was as good as the next man at reading a balance sheet  but these were to bookkeeping what grit was to clockwork .   seldom bucket had always enjoyed opera .  he didn   t understand it and never had  but he didn   t understand the ocean either and he enjoyed that  too .  he   d looked upon the purchase as  well  something to do  a sort of working retirement .  the offer had been too good to pass up .  things had been getting pretty tough in the wholesale cheese and milk derivatives business  and he   d been looking forward to the quieter climes of the world of art .   the previous owners had put on some good operas .  it was only a shame that their genius hadn   t run to bookkeeping as well .  money seemed to have been taken out of the accounts when anyone needed it .  the financial record system largely consisted of notes on torn bits of paper saying     i   ve taken     to pay q .  see you monday .  r .     who was r .  who was q .  what was the money for .  you wouldn   t get away with this sort of thing in the world of cheese .   he looked up as the door opened .      ah  salzella     he said .     thank you for coming .  you don   t know who q is  by any chance .         no  mr .  bucket .         or r .         i   m afraid not .     salzella pulled up a chair .      it   s taken me all morning  but i   ve worked out we pay more than fifteen hundred dollars a year for ballet shoes     said bucket  waving a piece of paper in the air .   salzella nodded .     yes  they do rather go through them at the toes .         i mean  it   s ridiculous .  i   ve still got a pair of boots belonging to my father .         but ballet shoes  sir  are rather more like foot gloves     salzella explained .      you   re telling me .  they cost seven dollars a pair and they last hardly any time at all .  a few performances .  there must be some way we can make a saving    .      salzella gave his new employer a long  cool stare .     possibly we could ask the girls to spend more time in the air .     he said .     a few extra grands jet  s .      bucket looked puzzled .     would that work .     he said suspiciously .      well  their feet wouldn   t be on the ground for so long  would they .     said salzella  in the tones of one who knows for a fact that he   s much more intelligent than anyone else in the room .      good point .  good point .  have a word with the ballet mistress  will you .         of course .  i am sure she will welcome the suggestion .  you may well have halved costs at a stroke .      bucket beamed .      which is perhaps just as well     said salzella .     there is  in fact  another matter that i   ve come to see you about           yes .         it is to do with the organ we had .         had .  what do you mean  had .     said bucket  adding     you   re going to tell me something expensive  are you .  what have we got now .         a lot of pipes and some keyboards     said salzella .     everything else has been smashed .         smashed .  who by .      salzella leaned back .  he was not a man to whom amusement came easily  but he realized that he was rather enjoying this .      tell me     he said     when mr .  pnigeus and mr .  cavaille sold you this opera house  did they mention anything   supernatural .      bucket scratched his head .     well   yes .  after i   d signed and paid .  it was a bit of a joke .  they said     oh  and by the way  people say there   s some man in evening dress who haunts the place  haha  ridiculous  isn   t it  these theatrical people  like children really  haha  but you may find it keeps them happy if you always keep box eight free on first nights  haha .     i remember that quite well .  handing over thirty thousand dollars concentrates the memory a bit .  and then they rode off .  quite a fast carriage  now i come to think about it .         ah     said salzella  and he almost smiled .     well  now that the ink is dry  i wonder if i might fill you in on the fine detail           birds sang .  the wind rattled the dried seed heads of moorland flowers .   granny weatherwax poked in the ditches to see if there were any interesting herbs hereabouts .   high over the hills  a buzzard screamed and wheeled .   the coach stood by the side of the road  despite the fact that it should have been speeding along at least twenty miles away .   at last granny grew bored  and sidled toward a clump of gorse bushes .      how   re you doing  gytha .         fine  fine     said a muffled voice .      only i reckon the coach driver is getting a bit impatient .         you can   t hurry nature     said nanny ogg .      well  don   t blame me .  you was the one who said it was too draughty on the broomsticks .         you make yourself useful  esme weatherwax     said the voice from the bushes     by obligin    me and findin    any dock or burdock plants that might happen to be around out there  thank you very much .         herbs .  what   re you plannin    with them .         i   m plannin    to say     thank goodness  big leaves  just what i need .            some distance from the bushes where nanny ogg was communing with nature there was  placid under the autumn sky  a lake .   in the reeds  a swan was dying .  or was due to die .   there was  however  an unforeseen snag .   death sat down on the bank .   now look  he said  i know how it is supposed to go .  swans sing just once  beautifully  before they die .  that   s where the word    swansong    originates .  it is very moving .  now  let us try this again     he produced a tuning fork from the shadowy recesses of his robe and twanged it on the side of his scythe .   there   s your note        uh uh     said the swan  shaking its head .   why make it difficult .      i like it here     said the swan .   that has nothing to do with it .      did you know i can break a man   s arm with a blow of my wing .      how about if i get you started .  do you know    moonlight bay    .      that   s no more than a barbershop ditty .  i happen to be a swan .         little brown jug    .  death cleared his throat .  ha ha ha  hee hee hee  little        that   s a song .     the swan hissed angrily and swayed from one crabbed foot to the other .     i don   t know who you are  sirrah  but where i come from we   ve got better taste in music .      really .  would you care to show me an example .      uh uh .      damn .      thought you   d got me there  didn   t you     said the swan .     thought you   d tricked me  eh .  thought i might unthinkingly give you a couple of bars of the pedlar   s song from lohen shaak  eh .      i don   t know that one .   the swan took a deep  labored breath .      that   s the one that goes    schneide meinen eigenen hals           thank you  said death .  the scythe moved .      bugger .      a moment later the swan stepped out of its body and ruffled fresh but slightly transparent wings .      now what .     it said .   that   s up to you .  it   s always up to you .      mr .  bucket leaned back in his creaky leather chair with his eyes shut until his director of music had finished .      so     bucket said .     let me see if i   ve got this right .  there   s this ghost .  every time anyone loses a hammer in this place  it   s been stolen by the ghost .  every time someone cracks a note  it   s because of the ghost .  but also  every time someone finds a lost object  it   s because of the ghost .  every time someone has a very good scene  it must be because of the ghost .  he sort of comes with the building  like the rats .  every so often someone sees him  but not for long because he comes and goes like a   well  a ghost .  apparently we let him use box eight for free on every first night performance .  and you say people like him .            like    isn   t quite the right word     said salzella .     it would be more correct to say that   well  it   s pure superstition  of course  but they think he   s lucky .  thought he was  anyway .      and you wouldn   t understand a thing about that  would you  you coarse little cheesemonger  he added to himself .  cheese is cheese .  milk goes rotten naturally .  you don   t have to make it happen by having several hundred people wound up until their nerves go twang        lucky     said bucket flatly .      luck is very important     said salzella  in a voice in which pained patience floated like ice cubes .     i imagine that temperament is not an important factor in the cheese business .         we rely on rennet     said bucket .   salzella sighed .     anyway  the company feel that the ghost is   lucky .  he used to send people little notes of encouragement .  after a really good performance  sopranos would find a box of chocolates in their dressing room  that sort of thing .  and dead flowers  for some reason .         dead flowers .         well  not flowers at all  as such .  just a bouquet of dead rose stems with no roses on them .  it   s something of a trademark of his .  it   s considered lucky .         dead flowers are lucky .         possibly .  live flowers  certainly  are terribly bad luck on stage .  some singers won   t even have them in their dressing room .  so   dead flowers are safe  you might say .  odd  but safe .  and it didn   t worry people because everyone thought the ghost was on their side .  at least  they did .  until about six months ago .      mr .  bucket shut his eyes again .     tell me     he said .      there have been   accidents .         what kind of accidents .         the kind of accidents that you prefer to call   accidents .      mr .  bucket   s eyes stayed closed .     like   the time when reg plenty and fred chiswell were working late one night up on the curdling vats and it turned out reg had been seeing fred   s wife and somehow      bucket swallowed      somehow he must have tripped  fred said  and fallen           i am not familiar with the gentlemen concerned but   that kind of accident .  yes .      bucket sighed .     that was some of the finest farmhouse nutty we ever made .         do you want me to tell you about our accidents .         i   m sure you   re going to .         a seamstress stitched herself to the wall .  a deputy stage manager was found stabbed with a prop sword .  oh  and you wouldn   t like me to tell you what happened to the man who worked the trapdoor .  and all the lead mysteriously disappeared from the roof  although personally i don   t think that was the work of the ghost .         and everyone   calls these   accidents .         well  you wanted to sell your cheese  didn   t you .  i can   t imagine anything that would depress the house like news that dead bodies are dropping like flies out of the flies .      he took an envelope out of his pocket and placed it on the table .      the ghost likes to leave little messages     he said .     there was one by the organ .  a scenery painter spotted him and   nearly had an accident .      bucket sniffed the envelope .  it reeked of turpentine .   the letter inside was on a sheet of the opera house   s own note paper .  in neat  copperplate writing  it said       ahahahahaha .  ahahahaha .  aahahaha .   beware .  .  .  .  .     yrs sincerely  the opera ghost       what sort of person     said salzella patiently     sits down and writes a maniacal laugh .  and all those exclamation marks  you notice .  five .  a sure sign of someone who wears his underpants on his head .  opera can do that to a man .  look  at least let   s search the building .  the cellars go on forever .  i   ll need a boat           a boat .  in the cellar .         oh .  didn   t they tell you about the sub basement .      bucket smiled the bright  crazed smile of a man who was nearing double exclamation marks himself .      no     he said .     they didn   t tell me about the sub basement .  they were too busy not telling me that someone goes around killing the company .  i don   t recall anyone saying    oh  by the way  people are dying a lot  and incidentally there   s a touch of rising damp              they   re flooded .         oh  good .     said bucket .     what with .  buckets of blood .         didn   t you have a look .         they said the cellars were fine .         and you believed them .         well  there was rather a lot of champagne        salzella sighed .   bucket took offense at the sigh .     i happen to pride myself that i am a good judge of character     he said .     look a man deeply in the eye and give him a firm handshake and you know everything about him .         yes  indeed     said salzella .      oh  blast   se  or enrico basilica will be here the day after tomorrow .  do you think something might happen to him .         oh  not much .  cut throat  perhaps .         what .  you think so .         how should i know .         what do you want me to do .  close the place .  as far as i can see it doesn   t make any money as it is .  why hasn   t anyone told the watch .         that would be worse     said salzella .     big trolls in rusty chain mail tramping everywhere  getting in everyone   s way and asking stupid questions .  they   d close us down .      bucket swallowed .     oh  we can   t have that     he said .     can   t have them   putting everyone on edge .      salzella sat back .  he seemed to relax a little .     on edge .  mr .  bucket     he said     this is opera .  everyone is always on edge .  have you ever heard of a catastrophe curve  mr .  bucket .      seldom bucket did his best .     well  i know there   s a dreadful bend in the road up by           a catastrophe curve  mr .  bucket  is what opera runs along .  opera happens because a large number of things amazingly fail to go wrong  mr .  bucket .  it works because of hatred and love and nerves .  all the time .  this isn   t cheese .  this is opera .  if you wanted a quiet retirement  mr .  bucket  you shouldn   t have bought the opera house .  you should have done something peaceful  like alligator dentistry .         nanny ogg was easily bored .  but  on the other hand  she was also easy to amuse .      certainly an interestin    way to travel     she said .     you do get to see places .         yes     said granny .     every five miles  it seems to me .         can   t think what   s got into me .         i shouldn   t think the horses have managed to get faster   n a walk all morning .      they were  by now  alone except for the huge snoring man .  the other two had got out and joined the travelers on top .   the main cause of this was greebo .  with a cat   s unerring instinct for people who dislike cats he   d leapt heavily into their laps and given them the    young masser back on de ole plantation    treatment .  and he   d treadled them into submission and then settled down and gone to sleep  claws gripping not sufficiently to draw blood but definitely to suggest that this was an option should the person move or breathe .  and then  when he was sure they were resigned to the situation  he   d started to smell .   no one knew where it came from .  it was not associated with any known orifice .  it was just that  after five minutes    doze  the air above greebo had a penetrating smell of fermented carpets .   he was now trying it out on the very large man .  it wasn   t working .  at last greebo had found a stomach too big for him .  also  the continuing going up and down was beginning to make him feel ill .   the snores reverberated around the coach .      wouldn   t like to come between him and his pudding     said nanny ogg .   granny was staring out of the window .  at least  her face was turned that way  but her eyes were focused on infinity .      gytha .         yes  esme .         mind if i ask you a question .         you don   t normally ask if i mind     said nanny .      doesn   t it ever get you down  the way people don   t think properly .      oh oh  thought nanny .  i reckon i got her out just in time .  thank goodness for literature .      how d   you mean .     she said .      i means the way they distracts themselves .         can   t say i ever really thought about it  esme .         like   s   pose i was to say to you  gytha ogg  your house is on fire  what   s the first thing you   d try to take out .      nanny bit her lip .     this is one of them personality questions  ain   t it .     she said .      that   s right .         like  you try to guess what i   m like by what i say           gytha ogg  i   ve known you all my life  i knows what you   re like .  i don   t need to guess .  but answer me  all the same .         i reckon i   d take greebo .      granny nodded .         cos that shows i   ve got a warm and considerate nature     nanny went on .      no  it shows you   re the kind of person who tries to work out what the right answer   s supposed to be     said granny .     untrustworthy .  that was a witch   s answer if ever i heard one .  devious .      nanny looked proud .   the snores changed to a blurt blurt noise and the handkerchief quivered .         treacle pudding  with lots of custard           hey  he just said something     said nanny .      he talks in his sleep     said granny weatherwax .     he   s been doing it on and off .         i never heard him .         you were out of the coach .         oh .         at the last stop he was going on about pancakes with lemon     said granny .     and mashed potatoes with butter .         makes me feel hungry just listening to that     said nanny .     i   ve got a pork pie in the bag somewhere        the snoring stopped abruptly .  a hand came up and moved the handkerchief aside .  the face beyond was friendly  bearded and small .  it gave the witches a shy smile which turned inexorably toward the pork pie .      want a slice  mister .     said nanny .     i   ve got some mustard here  too .         oo  would you  dear lady .     said the man  in a squeaky voice .     don   t know when i last had a pork pie   oh  dear        he grimaced as if he   d just said something wrong  and then relaxed .      got a bottle of beer if you want a drop  too     said nanny .  she was one of those women who enjoy seeing people eat almost as much as eating itself .      beer .     said the man .     beer .  you know  they don   t let me drink beer .  hah  it   s supposed to be the wrong ambience .  i   d give anything for a pint of beer           just a    thank you    would do     said nanny  passing it over .      who   s this    they    to whom you refers .     said granny .         s my fault really     said the man  through a faint spray of pork crumbs .     got caught up  i suppose        there was a change in the sounds from outside .  the lights of a town were going past and the coach was slowing down .   the man forced the last of the pie into his mouth and washed it down with the dregs of the beer .      oo  lovely     he said .  then he leaned back and put the handkerchief over his face .   he raised a corner .     don   t tell anyone i spoke to you     he said     but you   ve made a friend of henry slugg .         and what do you do  henry slugg .     said granny  carefully .      i   m   i   m on the stage .         yes .  we can see     said nanny ogg .      no  i meant        the coach stopped .  gravel crunched as people climbed down .  the door was pulled open .   granny saw a crowd of people peering excitedly through the doorway  and reached up automatically to straighten her hat .  but several hands reached out for henry slugg  who sat up  smiled nervously  and let himself be helped out .  several people also shouted out a name  but it wasn   t the name of henry slugg .      who   s enrico basilica .     said nanny ogg .      don   t know     said granny .     maybe he   s the person mr .  slugg   s afraid of .      the coaching inn was a run down shack  with only two bedrooms for guests .  as helpless old ladies traveling alone  the witches got one  simply because all hell would have been let loose if they hadn   t .      mr .  bucket looked pained .      i may just be a big man in cheese to you     he said     you may think i   m just some hard headed businessman who wouldn   t know culture if he found it floating in his tea  but i have been a patron of the opera here and elsewhere for many years .  i can hum nearly the whole of           i am sure you   ve seen a lot of opera     said salzella .     but   how much do you know about production .         i   ve been behind the scenes in lots of theaters           oh  theater     said salzella .     theater doesn   t even approach it .  opera isn   t theater with singing and dancing .  opera   s opera .  you might think a production like lohenshaak is full of passion  but it   s a sandpit of toddlers compared to what goes on behind the scenes .  the singers all loathe the sight of one another  the chorus despises the singers  they both hate the orchestra  and everyone fears the conductor  the staff on one prompt side won   t talk to the staff on the opposite prompt side  the dancers are all crazed from hunger in any case  and that   s only the start of it  because what is really        there was a series of knocks at the door .  they were painfully irregular  as if the knocker were having to concentrate quite hard .      come in  walter     said salzella .   walter plinge shuffled in  a pail dangling at the end of each arm .     come to fill your coal scuttle mr .  bucket .      bucket waved a hand vaguely  and turned back to the director of music .     you were saying .      salzella stared at walter as the man carefully piled lumps of coal in the scuttle  one at a time .      salzella .         what .  oh .  i   m sorry   what was i saying .         something about it being only the start .         what .  oh .  yes .  yes   you see  it   s fine for actors .  there   s plenty of parts for old men .  acting   s something you can do all your life .  you get better at it .  but when your talent is singing or dancing   time creeps up behind you  all the       he fumbled for a word  and settled lamely for    time .  time is the poison .  you watch backstage one night and you   ll see the dancers checking all the time in any mirror they can find for that first little imperfection .  you watch the singers .  everyone   s on edge  everyone knows that this might be their last perfect night  that tomorrow might be the beginning of the end .  that   s why everyone worries about luck  you see .  all the stuff about live flowers being unlucky  you remember .  well  so   s green .  and real jewelry worn onstage .  and real mirrors on stage .  and whistling onstage .  and peeking at the audience through the main curtains .  and using new makeup on a first night .  and knitting onstage  even at rehearsals .  a yellow clarinet in the orchestra is very unlucky  don   t ask me why .  and as for stopping a performance before its proper ending  well  that   s worst of all .  you might as well sit under a ladder and break mirrors .      behind salzella  walter carefully placed the last lump of coal on the pile in the scuttle and dusted it carefully .      good grief     said bucket  at last .     i thought it was tough in cheese .      he waved a hand at the pile of papers and what passed for the accounts .     i paid thirty thousand for this place     he said .     it   s in the center of the city .  prime site .  i thought it was hard bargaining .         they   d have probably accepted twenty five .         and tell me again about box eight .  you let this ghost have it .         the ghost considers it is his for every first night  yes .         how does he get in .         no one knows .  we   ve searched and searched for secret entrances           he really doesn   t pay .         no .         it   s worth fifty dollars a night .         there will be trouble if you sell it     said salzella .      good grief  salzella  you   re an educated man .  how can you sit there so calmly and accept this sort of madness .  some creature in a mask has the run of the place  gets a prime box all to himself  kills people  and you sit there saying there will be trouble .         i told you  the show must go on .         why .  we never said    the cheese must go on    .  what   s so special about the show going on .      salzella smiled .     as far as i understand it     he said     the   power behind the show  the soul of the show  all the effort that   s gone into it  call it what you will   it leaks out and spills everywhere .  that   s why they burble about    the show must go on .     it must go on .  but most of the company wouldn   t even understand why anyone should ask the question .      bucket glared at the pile of what passed for the opera house   s financial records .      they certainly don   t understand bookkeeping .  who does the accounts .         all of us  really     said salzella .      all of you .         money gets put in  money gets taken out       said salzella vaguely .     is it important .      bucket   s jaw dropped .     is it important .         because     salzella went on  smoothly     opera doesn   t make money .  opera never makes money .         good grief  man .  important .  what   d i ever have achieved in the cheese business  i   d like to know  if i   d said that money wasn   t important .      salzella smiled humorlessly .     there are people out on the stage right now  sir     he said     who   d say that you would probably have made better cheeses .     he sighed  and leaned over the desk .     you see     he said     cheese does make money .  and opera doesn   t .  opera   s what you spend money on .         but   what do you get out of it .         you get opera .  you put money in  you see  and opera comes out     said salzella wearily .      there   s no profit .         profit   profit     murmured the director of music  scratching his forehead .     no  i don   t believe i   ve come across the word .         then how do we manage .         we seem to rub along .      bucket put his head in his hands .     i mean     he muttered  half to himself     i knew the place wasn   t making much  but i thought that was just because it was run badly .  we have big audiences .  we charge a mint for tickets .  now i   m told that a ghost runs around killing people and we don   t even make any money .      salzella beamed .     ah  opera     he said .      greebo stalked over the inn   s rooftops .   most cats are nervous and ill at ease when taken out of their territory  which is why cat books go on about putting butter on their paws and so on  presumably because constantly skidding into the walls will take the animal   s mind off where the walls actually are .   but greebo traveled well  purely because he took it for granted that the whole world was his dirt box .   he dropped heavily onto an outhouse roof and padded toward a small open window .   greebo also had a cat   s approach to possessions  which was simply that nothing edible had a right to belong to other people .   from the window came a variety of smells which included pork pies and cream .  he squeezed through and dropped onto the pantry shelf .   of course  sometimes he got caught .  at least  sometimes he got discovered     there was cream .  he settled down .   he was halfway down the bowl when the door opened .   greebo   s ears flattened .  his one good eye sought desperately for an escape route .  the window was too high  the person opening the door was wearing a long dress that militated against the old    through the legs    routine and   and   and   there was no escape     his claws scrabbled on the floor     oh no   here it came     something flipped in his body   s morphogenic field .  here was a problem a cat shape couldn   t deal with .  oh  well  we know another one .  sometimes greebo could be almost   human .   crockery crashed around him .  shelves erupted as his head rose .  a bag of flour exploded outward to make room for his broadening shoulders .   the cook stared up at him .  then she looked down .  and then up .  and then  her gaze dragged as though it were on a winch  down again .   she screamed .   greebo screamed .   he grabbed desperately at a bowl to cover that part which  as a cat  he never had to worry about exposing .   he screamed again  this time because he   d just poured lukewarm pork dripping all over himself .   his groping fingers found a large copper jelly mold .  clasping it to his groinal areas  he barreled forward and fled out of the pantry and out of the kitchen and out of the dining room and out of the inn and into the night .   the spy  who was dining with the traveling salesman  put down his knife .      that   s something you don   t often see     he said .      what .     said the salesman  who   d had his back to the excitement .      one of those old copper jelly molds .  they   re worth quite a lot now .  my aunt had a very good one .      the hysterical cook was given a big drink and several members of staff went out into the darkness to investigate .   all they found was a jelly mold  lying forlornly in the yard .      at home granny weatherwax slept with open windows and an unlocked door  secure in the knowledge that the ramtops    various creatures of the night would rather eat their own ears than break in .  in dangerously civilized lands  however  she took a different view .      i really don   t think we need to shove the bed in front of the door  esme     said nanny ogg  heaving on her end .      you can   t be too careful     said granny .     supposing some man started rattlin    the knob in the middle of the night .         not at our time of life     said nanny sadly .      gytha ogg  you are the most        granny was interrupted by a watery sound .  it came from behind the wall and went on for some time .   it stopped  and then started again   a steady splashing that gradually became a trickle .  nanny started to grin .      someone fillin    a bath .     said granny .         or i suppose it could be someone fillin    a bath     nanny conceded .   there was the sound of a third jug being emptied .  footsteps left the room .  a few seconds later a door opened and there was a rather heavier tread  followed after a brief interval by a few splashes and a grunt .      yes  a man gettin    into a bath     said granny .     what   re you doin     gytha .         seein    if there   s a knothole in this wood somewhere     said nanny .     ah  here   s one           come back here .         sorry  esme .      and then the singing started .  it was a very pleasant tenor voice  given added timbre by the bath itself .      show me the way to go home  i   m tired and i want to go to bed           someone   s enjoyin    themselves  anyway     said nanny .         wherever i may roam        there was a knock at the distant bathroom door  upon which the singer slipped smoothly into another language         per via di terra  mare o schiuma        the witches looked at one another .   a muffled voice said     i   ve brought you your hot water bottle  sir .         thank you verr    mucha     said the bather  his voice dripping with accent .   footsteps went away in the distance .         indicame la strada    to go home .     splash  splash .     good eeeeevening  frieeeends           well  well  well     said granny  more or less to herself .     it seems once again that our mr .  slugg is a secret polyglot .         fancy .  and you haven   t even looked through the knothole     said nanny .      gytha  is there anything in the whole world you can   t make sound grubby .         not found it yet  esme     said nanny brightly .      i meant that when he mutters in his sleep and sings in his bath he talks just like us  but when he thinks people are listening he comes over all foreign .         that   s probably to throw that basilica person off the scent     nanny said .      oh  i reckon mr .  basilica is very close to henry slugg     said granny .     in fact  i reckon that they   re one and        there was a gentle knock at the door .      who   s there .     granny demanded .      it   s me  ma   am .  mr .  slot .  this is my tavern .      the witches pushed the bed aside and granny opened the door a fraction .      yes .     she said suspiciously .      er   the coachman said you were   witches .         yes .         maybe you could   help us .         what   s wrong .         it   s my boy        granny opened the door farther and saw the woman standing behind mr .  slot .  one look at her face was enough .  there was a bundle in her arms .   granny stepped back .     bring him in and let me have a look at him .      she took the baby from the woman  sat down on the room   s one chair  and pulled back the blanket .  nanny ogg peered over her shoulder .      hmm     said granny  after a while .  she glanced at nanny  who gave an almost imperceptible shake of her head .      there   s a curse on this house  that   s what it is     said slot .     my best cow   s been taken mortally sick  too .         oh .  you have a cowshed .     said granny .     very good place for a sickroom  a cowshed .  it   s the warmth .  you better show me where it is .         you want to take the boy down there .         right now .      the man looked at his wife  and shrugged .     well  i   m sure you know your business best     he said .     it   s this way .      he led the witches down some back stairs and across a yard and into the fetid sweet air of the byre .  a cow was stretched out on the straw .  it rolled an eye madly as they entered  and tried to moo .   granny took in the scene and stood looking thoughtful for a moment .   then she said     this will do .         what do you need .     said slot .      just peace and quiet .      the man scratched his head .     i thought you did a chant or made up some potion or something     he said .      sometimes .         i mean  i know where there   s a toad           all i shall require is a candle     said granny .     a new one  for preference .         that   s all .         yes .      mr .  slot looked a little put out .  despite his distraction  something about his manner suggested that granny weatherwax was possibly not that much of a witch if she didn   t want a toad .      and some matches     said granny  noting this .     a pack of cards might be useful  too .         and i   ll need three cold lamb chops and exactly two pints of beer     said nanny ogg .   the man nodded .  this didn   t sound too toadlike  but it was better than nothing .      what   d you ask for that for .     hissed granny  as the man bustled off .     can   t imagine what good those   d do .  anyway  you already had a big dinner .         well  i   m always prepared to go that extra meal .  you won   t want me around and i   ll get bored     said nanny .      did i say i didn   t want you around .         well   even i can see that boy is in a coma  and the cow has the red bugge if i   m any judge .  that   s bad  too .  so i reckon you   re planning some   direct action .      granny shrugged .      time like that  a witch needs to be alone     said nanny .     but you just mind what you   re doing  esme weatherwax .      the child was brought down in a blanket and made as comfortable as possible .  the man followed behind his wife with a tray .      mrs .  ogg will do her necessary procedures with the tray in her room     said granny haughtily .     you just leave me in here tonight .  and no one is to come in  right .  no matter what .      the mother gave a worried curtsy .     but i thought i might look in about midn           no one .  now  off you go .      when they   d been gently but firmly ushered out  nanny ogg stuck her head around the door .     what exactly are you planning  esme .         you   ve sat up with the dyin    often enough  gytha .         oh  yes  it   s       nanny   s face fell .     oh  esme   you   re not going to           enjoy your supper  gytha .      granny closed the door .   she spent some time arranging boxes and barrels so that she had a crude table and something to sit on .  the air was warm and smelled of bovine flatulence .  periodically she checked the health of both patients  although there was little enough to check .   in the distance the sounds of the inn gradually subsided .  the last one was the clink of the innkeeper   s keys as he locked the doors .  granny heard him walk across to the cowshed door and hesitate .  then he went away  and began to climb the stairs .   she waited a little longer and then lit the candle .  its cheery flame gave the place a warm and comforting glow .   on the plank table she laid out the cards and attempted to play patience  a game she   d never been able to master .   the candle burned down .  she pushed the cards away  and sat watching the flame .   after some immeasurable piece of time the flame flickered .  it would have passed unnoticed by anyone who hadn   t been concentrating on it for some while .   she took a deep breath and        good morning     said granny weatherwax .   good morning  said a voice by her ear .      nanny ogg had long ago polished off the chops and the beer  but she hadn   t got into bed .  she lay on it  fully clothed  with her arms behind her head  staring at the dark ceiling .   after a while there was a scratching on the shutters .  she got up and opened them .   a huge figure leapt into the room .  for a moment the moonlight lit a glistening torso and a mane of black hair .  then the creature dived under the bed .      oh  deary deary me     said nanny .   she waited for a while  and then fished a chop bone off her tray .  there was still a bit of meat on it .  she lowered it toward the floor .   a hand shot out and grabbed it .   nanny sat back .      poor little man     she said .   it was only on the subject of greebo that nanny   s otherwise keen sense of reality found itself all twisted .  to nanny ogg he was merely a larger version of the little fluffy kitten he had once been .  to everyone else he was a scarred ball of inventive malignancy .   but now he had to deal with a problem seldom encountered by cats .  the witches had  a year ago  turned him into a human  for reasons that had seemed quite necessary at the time .  it had taken a lot of effort  and his morphogenic field had reasserted itself after a few hours  much to everyone   s relief .   but magic is never as simple as people think .  it has to obey certain universal laws .  and one is that  no matter how hard a thing is to do  once it has been done it   ll become a whole lot easier and will therefore be done a lot .  a huge mountain might be scaled by strong men only after many centuries of failed attempts  but a few decades later grandmothers will be strolling up it for tea and then wandering back afterward to see where they left their glasses .   in accordance with this law  greebo   s soul had noted that there was one extra option for use in a tight corner  in addition to the usual cat assortment of run  fight  crap or all three together  and that was  become human .   it tended to wear off after a short time  most of which he spent searching desperately for a pair of pants .   there were snores from under the bed .  gradually  to nanny   s relief  they turned into a purr .   then she sat bolt upright .  she was some way from the cowshed but        he   s here     she said .      granny breathed out  slowly .      come and sit where i can see you .  that   s good manners .  and let me tell you right now that i ain   t at all afraid of you .      the tall  black robed figure walked across the floor and sat down on a handy barrel  leaning its scythe against the wall .  then it pushed back its hood .   granny folded her arms and stared calmly at the visitor  meeting his gaze eye to socket .   i am impressed .      i have faith .      really .  in what particular deity .      oh  none of them .      then faith in what .      just faith  you know .  in general .      death leaned forward .  the candlelight raised new shadows on his skull .   courage is easy by candlelight .  your faith  i suspect  is in the flame .   death grinned .   granny leaned forward  and blew out the candle .  then she folded her arms again and stared fiercely ahead of her .   after some length of time a voice said  all right  you   ve made your point .   granny lit a match .  its flare illuminated the skull opposite  which hadn   t moved .      fair enough     she said  as she relit the candle .     we don   t want to be sitting here all night  do we .  how many have you come for .      one .      the cow .      death shook his head .      it could be the cow .      no .  that would be changing history .      history is about things changing .      no .   granny sat back .      then i challenge you to a game .  that   s traditional .  that   s allowed .      death was silent for a moment .   this is true .      good .      challenging me by means of a game is allowable .      yes .      however   you understand that to win all you must gamble all .      double or quits .  yes  i know .      but not chess .      can   t abide chess .      or cripple mr .  onion .  i   ve never been able to understand the rules .      very well .  how about one hand of poker .  five cards each  no draws .  sudden death  as they say .      death thought about this  too .   you know this family .      no .      then why .      are we talking or are we playing .      oh  very well .   granny picked up the pack of cards and shuffled it  not looking at her hands  and smiling at death all the time .  she dealt five cards each  and reached down     a bony hand grasped hers .   but first  mistress weatherwax   we will exchange cards .   he picked up the two piles and transposed them  and then nodded at granny .   madam .   granny looked at her cards  and threw them down .   four queens .  hmm .  that is very high .   death looked down at his cards  and then up into granny   s steady  blue eyed gaze .   neither moved for some time .   then death laid the hand on the table .   i lose  he said .  all i have is four ones .   he looked back into granny   s eyes for a moment .  there was a blue glow in the depth of his eye sockets .  maybe  for the merest fraction of a second  barely noticeable even to the closest observation  one winked off .   granny nodded  and extended a hand .   she prided herself on the ability to judge people by their gaze and their handshake  which in this case was a rather chilly one .      take the cow     she said .   it is a valuable creature .      who knows what the child will become .      death stood up  and reached for his scythe .   he said  ow .      ah  yes .  i couldn   t help noticing     said granny weatherwax  as the tension drained out of the atmosphere     that you seem to be sparing that arm .      oh  you know how it is .  repetitive actions and so on        it could get serious if you left it .      how serious .      want me to have a look .      would you mind .  it certainly aches on cold nights .   granny stood up and reached out  but her hands went straight through .      look  you   re going to have to make yourself a bit more solid if i   m to do anything        possibly a bottle of suckrose and akwa .      sugar and water .  i expect you know that   s only for the hard of thinking .  come on  roll up that sleeve .  don   t be a big baby .  what   s the worst i can do to you .      granny   s hands touched smooth bone .  she   d felt worse .  at least these had never had flesh on them .   she felt  thought  gripped  twisted     there was a click .   ow .      now try it above the shoulder .      er .  hmm .  yes .  it does seem considerably more free .  yes  indeed .  my word  yes .  thank you very much .      if it gives you trouble again  you know where i live .      thank you .  thank you very much .      you know where everyone lives .  tuesday mornings is a good time .  i   m generally in .      i shall remember .  thank you .      by appointment  in your case .  no offense meant .      thank you .   death walked away .  a moment later there was a faint gasp from the cow .  that and a slight sagging of the skin were all that apparently marked the transition from living animal to cooling meat .   granny picked up the baby and laid a hand on its forehead .      fever   s gone     she said .   mistress weatherwax .  said death from the doorway .      yes  sir .      i have to know .  what would have happened if i had not   lost .      at the cards  you mean .      yes .  what would you have done .   granny laid the baby down carefully on the straw  and smiled .      well     she said     for a start   i   d have broken your bloody arm .         agnes stayed up late  simply because of the novelty .  most people in lancre  as the saying goes  went to bed with the chickens and got up with the cows .   but she watched the evening   s performance  and watched the set being struck afterwards  and watched the actors leave or  in the case of younger chorus members  head off for their lodgings in odd corners of the building .  and then there was no one else  except walter plinge and his mother sweeping up .   she headed for the staircase .  there didn   t seem to be a candle anywhere back here  but the few left burning in the auditorium were just enough to give the darkness a few shades .   the stairs went up the wall at the rear of the stage  with nothing but a rickety handrail between them and the drop .  besides leading to the attics and storeroom on the upper floors  they were also one route to the fly loft and the other secret platforms where men in flat hats and gray overalls worked the magic of the theater  usually by means of pulleys     there was a figure on one of the gantries over the stage .  agnes saw it only because it moved slightly .  it was kneeling down  looking at something .  in the darkness .   she stepped back .  the stair creaked .   the figure jerked around .  a square of yellow light opened in the darkness  its beam pinning her against the brickwork .      who   s there .     she said  raising a hand to shade her eyes .      who   s that .     said a voice .  and then  after a moment     oh .  it   s   perdita  isn   t it .      the square of light swung toward her as the figure made its way over the stage .      andr   .     she said .  she felt inclined to back away  if only the brickwork would let her .   and suddenly he was on the stairs  quite an ordinary person  no shadow at all  holding a very large lantern .      what are you doing here .     said the organist .      i   was just going to bed .         oh  yes .     he relaxed a little .     some of you girls have got rooms here .  the management thought it was safer than having you going home alone late at night .         what are you doing up here .     said agnes  suddenly aware that there was just the two of them .      i was   looking at the place where the ghost tried to strangle mr .  cripps     said andr   .      why .         i wanted to make certain everything was safe now  of course .         didn   t the stagehands do that .         oh  you know them .  i just thought i   d better make certain .      agnes looked down at the lantern .      i   ve never seen one like that before .  how did you make it light up so quickly .         er .  it   s a dark lantern .  there   s this flap  you see     he demonstrated     so you can shut it right down and open it up again           that must be very useful when you   re looking for the black notes .         don   t be sarcastic .  i just don   t want there to be any more trouble .  you   ll find that you start looking around when           goodnight  andr   .         goodnight  then .      she hurried up the rest of the flights and ducked into her bedroom .  no one followed her .   when she   d calmed down  which took some time  she undressed in the voluminous tent of her red flannel nightdress and got into bed  resisting any temptation to pull the covers over her head .   she stared at the dark ceiling .      that   s stupid     she thought  eventually .     he was on the stage this morning .  no one could move that fast        she never knew whether she actually got some sleep or whether it happened just as she was dozing off  but there was a very faint knock at the door .      perdita .  .      only one person she knew could exclaim a whisper .   agnes got up and padded over to the door .  she opened the door a fraction  just to check  and christine half fell into the room .      what   s the matter .         i   m frightened .  .         what of .         the mirror .  .  it   s talking to me .  .  can i sleep in your room .  .      agnes looked around .  it was crowded enough with the two of them standing up in it .      the mirror   s talking .         yes .  .         are you sure .      christine dived into agnes   s bed and pulled the covers over her .     yes .  .     she said  indistinctly .   agnes stood alone in the darkness .   people always tended to assume that she could cope  as if capability went with mass  like gravity .  and merely saying briskly     nonsense  mirrors don   t talk     would probably not be any help  especially with one half of the dialogue buried beneath the bedclothes .   she felt her way into the next room  stubbing her foot on the bed in the darkness .   there must be a candle in here  somewhere .  she felt for the tiny bedside table  hoping to start the reassuring rattle of a matchbox .   a faint glimmer from the midnight city filtered through the window .  the mirror seemed to glow .   she sat down on the bed  which creaked ominously under her .   oh well   one bed was as good as another     she was about to lie back when something in the darkness went    ting .   it was a tuning fork .   and a voice said     christine   please attend .      she sat upright  staring at the darkness .   and then realization dawned .  no men  they   d said .  they   d been very strict about that  as if opera were some kind of religion .  it was not a problem in agnes   s case  at least in the way they meant  but for someone like christine   they said love always found a way and  of course  so did a number of associated activities .   oh  good grief .  she felt the blush start .  in darkness .  what kind of a reaction was that .   agnes   s life unrolled in front of her .  it didn   t look as though it were going to have many high points .  but it did hold years and years of being capable and having a lovely personality .  it almost certainly held chocolate rather than sex and  while agnes was not in a position to make a direct comparison  and regardless of the fact that a bar of chocolate could be made to last all day  it did not seem a very fair exchange .   she felt the same feeling she   d felt back home .  sometimes life reaches that desperate point where the wrong thing to do has to be the right thing to do .   it doesn   t matter what direction you go .  sometimes you just have to go .   she gripped the bedclothes and replayed in her mind the way her friend spoke .  you had to have that little gulp  that breathless tinkle in the tone that people got whose minds played with the fairies half the time .  she tried it out in her head  and then delivered it to her vocal cords .      yes .  .  who   s there .  .         a friend .      agnes pulled the bedclothes up higher .     in the middle of the night .  .         night is nothing to me .  i belong to the night .  and i can help you .     it was a pleasant voice .  it seemed to be coming from the mirror .      help me to do what .  .         don   t you want to be the best singer in the opera .         oh  perdita is a lot better than me .  .      there was silence for a moment  and then the voice said     but while i cannot teach her to look and move like you  i can teach you to sing like her .      agnes stared into the darkness  shock and humiliation rising from her like steam .      tomorrow you will sing the part of iodine .  but i will teach you how to sing it perfectly           next morning the witches had the interior of the coach almost to themselves .  news like greebo gets around .  but henry slugg was there  if that was indeed his name  sitting next to a very welldressed  thin little man .      well  here we are again  then     said nanny ogg .   henry smiled nervously .      that was some good singing last night     nanny went on .   henry   s face set in a good natured grimace .  in his eyes  terror waved a white flag .      i am afraid se  or basilica doesn   t speak morporkian  ma   am     said the thin man .     but i will translate for you  if you like .         what .     said nanny .     then how come   ow .         sorry     said granny weatherwax .     my elbow must have slipped .      nanny ogg rubbed her side .     i was saying     she said     that he was   ow .         dear me  i seem to have done it again     said granny .     this gentleman was telling us that his friend doesn   t speak our language  gytha .         eh .  but   what .  oh .  but   ah .  really .  oh .  all right     said nanny .     oh  yes .  eats our pies  though  when   ow .         excuse my friend  it   s her time of life .  she gets confused     said granny .     we did enjoy his singing .  heard him through the wall .         you were very fortunate     said the thin man primly .     sometimes people have to wait years to hear se  or basilica              probably waiting for him to finish his dinner       a voice muttered .         in fact  at la scalda in genua last month his singing made ten thousand people shed tears .            hah  i can do that  i don   t see there   s anything special about that        granny   s eyes hadn   t left henry    se  or basilica    slugg   s face .  he had the expression of a man whose profound relief was horribly tempered by a dread that it wouldn   t last very long .      se  or basilica   s fame has spread far and wide     said the manager primly .         just like senior basilica     muttered nanny .     on other people   s pies  i expect .  oh  yes  too posh for us now  just because he   s the only man you could find on an atlas   ow .         well  well     said granny  smiling in a way that everyone except nanny ogg would think of as innocent .     it   s nice and warm in genua .  i expect se  or basilica really misses his home .  and what do you do  young sir .         i am his manager and translator .  er .  you have the advantage of me  ma   am .         yes  indeed .     granny nodded .      we have some good singers where we come from  too     said nanny ogg  rebelliously .      really .     said the manager .     and where do you ladies come from .         lancre .      the man politely endeavored to position lancre on his mental map of great centers of music .     do you have a conservatory there .         yes  indeed     said nanny ogg stoutly  and then  just to make sure  she added     you should see the size of my tomatoes .      granny rolled her eyes .     gytha  you haven   t got a conservatory .  it   s just a big windowsill .         yes  but it catches the sun nearly all day   ow           i expect se  or basilica is going to ankh morpork .     said granny .      we     said the manager  primly     have allowed the opera house to engage us for the rest of the season        his voice faltered .  he   d looked up at the luggage rack .     what   s that .      granny glanced up .     oh  that   s greebo     she said .      and mister basilica   s not to eat him     said nanny .      what is it .         he   s a cat .         it   s grinning at me .     the manager shifted uneasily .     and i can smell something     he said .         s funny     said nanny .     i can   t smell a thing .      there was a change in the sound of the hooves outside  and the coach lurched as it slowed .      ah     said the manager awkwardly     i   er   i see we   re stopping to change horses .  it   s a  a nice day .  i think i may just  er  see if there   s room on the seats outside .      he left when the coach stopped .  when it started again  a few minutes later  he hadn   t come back .      well  well     said granny  as they lurched away again     it seems there   s just you and me  gytha .  and se  or basilica  who doesn   t speak our language .  does he  mr .  henry slugg .      henry slugg took out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead .     ladies .  dear ladies .  i beg you  for pity   s sake           have you done anything bad  mr .  slugg .     said nanny .     took advantage of women who dint want to be took advantage of .  stole .   apart from lead on roofs and other stuff people wouldn   t miss .   done any murders of anyone who dint deserve it .         no .         he tellin    the truth  esme .      henry writhed under granny weatherwax   s stare .      yes .         oh  well  that   s all right  then     said nanny .     i understand .  i don   t have to pay taxes myself  but i know all about people not wantin    to .         oh  it   s not that  i assure you     said henry .     i have people to pay my taxes for me           that   s a good trick     said nanny .      mr .  slugg   s got a different trick     said granny .     i reckon i know the trick .  it   s like sugar and water .      henry waved his hands uncertainly .     it   s just that if they knew       he began .      everything   s better if it comes from a long way away .  that   s the secret     said granny .      it   s   yes  that   s part of it     said henry .     i mean  no one wants to listen to a slugg .         where   re you from  henry .     said nanny .      really from     said granny .      i grew up in rookery yard in the shades .  they   re in ankh morpork     said henry .     it was a terrible rough place .  there were only three ways out .  you could sing your way out or you could fight your way out .         what was the third way .     said nanny .      oh  you could go down that little alleyway into shamlegger street and then cut down into treacle mine road     said henry .     but no one ever amounted to anything who went that way .      he sighed .     i made a few coppers singing in taverns and such like     he said     but when i tried for anything better they said    what is your name .     and i said    henry slugg    and they   d laugh .  i thought of changing my name  but everyone in ankh morpork knew who i was .  and no one wanted to listen to anyone called plain henry slugg .      nanny nodded .     it   s like with conjurers     she said .     they   re never called fred wossname .  it   s always something like the great astoundo  fresh from the court of the king of klatch  and gladys .         and everyone takes notice     said granny     and are always careful not to ask themselves  if he   s come from the king of klatch  why   s he doing card tricks here in slice  population seven .         the trick is to make sure that everywhere you go  you are from somewhere else     said henry .     and then i was famous  but           you   d got stuck as enrico     said granny .   he nodded .     i was only going to do it to make some money .  i was going to come back and marry my little angeline           who was she .     said granny .      oh  a girl i grew up with     said henry  vaguely .      sharing the same gutter in the back streets of ankh morpork  kind of thing .     said nanny  in an understanding voice .      gutter .  in those days you had to put your name down and wait five years for a gutter     said henry .     we thought people in gutters were nobs .  we shared a drain .  with two other families .  and a man who juggled eels .      he sighed .     but i moved on  and then there was always somewhere else to go  and they liked me in brindisi   and   and        he blew his nose on the handkerchief  carefully folded it up  and produced another one from his pocket .      i don   t mind the pasta and the squid     he said .     well  not much   but you can   t get a decent pint for love nor money and they put olive oil on everything and tomatoes give me a rash and there isn   t what i   d call a good hard cheese in the whole country .      he dabbed at his face with the handkerchief .      and people are so kind     he said .     i thought i   d get a few beefsteaks when i traveled but  wherever i go  they do pasta especially for me .  in tomato sauce .  sometimes they fry it .  and what they do to the squid       he shuddered .     then they all grin and watch me eat it .  they think i enjoy it .  what i   d give for a plate of nice roast mutton with clootie dumplings           why don   t you say .     said nanny .   he shrugged .     enrico basilica eats pasta     he said .     there   s not much i can do about it now .      he sat back .     you   re interested in music  mrs .  ogg .      nanny nodded proudly .     i can get a tune out of just about anything if you give me five minutes to study it     she said .     and our jason can play the violin and our kev can blow the trombone and all my kids can sing and our shawn can fart any melody you care to name .         a very talented family  indeed     said enrico .  he fumbled in a waistcoat pocket and took out two oblongs of cardboard .     so please  ladies  accept these as a small token of gratitude from someone who eats other people   s pies .  our little secret  eh .     he winked desperately at nanny .     they   re open tickets for the opera .         well  that   s amazin        said nanny     because we   re going to   ow .         why  thank you very much     said granny weatherwax  taking the tickets .     how very gracious of you .  we shall be sure to go .         and if you   ll excuse me     said enrico     i must catch up on my sleep .         don   t worry  i shouldn   t think it   s had time to get far away     said nanny .   the singer leaned back  pulled the handkerchief over his face and  after a few minutes  began to snore the happy snore of someone who had done his duty and now with any luck wouldn   t have to meet these rather disconcerting old women ever again .      he   s well away     said nanny  after a while .  she glanced at the tickets in granny   s hand .     you want to visit the opera .     she said .   granny stared into space .      i said  do you want to visit the opera .      granny looked at the tickets .     what i want don   t signify  i suspect     she said .   nanny ogg nodded .   granny weatherwax was firmly against fiction .  life was hard enough without lies floating around and changing the way people thought .  and because the theater was fiction made flesh  she hated the theater most of all .  but that was it   hate was exactly the right word .  hate is a force of attraction .  hate is just love with its back turned .   she didn   t loathe the theater  because  had she done so  she would have avoided it completely .  granny now took every opportunity to visit the traveling theater that came to lancre  and sat bolt upright in the front row of every performance  staring fiercely .  even honest punch and judy men found her sitting among the children  snapping things like       tain   t so .     and    is that any way to behave .     as a result  lancre was becoming known throughout the sto plains as a really tough gig .   but what she wanted wasn   t important .  like it or not  witches are drawn to the edge of things  where two states collide .  they feel the pull of doors  circumferences  boundaries  gates  mirrors  masks        and stages .      breakfast was served in the opera house   s refectory at half past nine .  actors were not known for their habit of early rising .   agnes started to fall forward into her eggs and bacon  and stopped herself just in time .      good morning .  .      christine sat down with a tray on which was  agnes was not surprised to see  a plate holding one stick of celery  one raisin and about a spoonful of milk .  she leaned toward agnes and her face very briefly expressed some concern .     are you all right .  .  you look a little peaky .  .      agnes caught herself in mid snore .      i   m fine     she said .     just a bit tired           oh  good .  .     this exchange having exhausted her higher mental processes  christine went back to operating on automatic .     do you like my new dress .  .     she exclaimed .     isn   t it fetching .  .      agnes looked at it .     yes     she said .     very   white .  very lacy .  very figure hugging .         and do you know what .  .         no .  what .         i already have a secret admirer .  .  isn   t that thrilling .  .  all the great singers have them  you know .  .         a secret admirer           yes .  .  this dress .  .  it arrived at the stage door just now .  .  isn   t that exciting .  .         amazing     said agnes  glumly .     and it   s not as if you   ve even sung .  er .  who   s it from .         he didn   t say  of course .  .  it has to be a secret admirer .  .  he   ll probably want to send me flowers and drink champagne out of my shoe .  .         really .     agnes made a face .     do people do that .         it   s traditional .  .      christine  boiling over with cheerfulness  had some to share        you do look very tired .     she said .  her hand went to her mouth .     oh .  .  we swapped rooms  didn   t we .  .  i was so silly .  .  and  d   you know     she added with that look of half empty cunning that was the nearest she came to guile     i could have sworn i heard singing in the night   someone trying scales and things .  .      agnes had been brought up to tell the truth .  she knew she should say     i   m sorry  i appear to have got your life by mistake .  there seems to have been a bit of a confusion        but  she decided  she   d also been brought up to do what she was told  not to put herself first  to be respectful to her elders and to use no swearword stronger than    poot .      she could borrow a more interesting future .  just for a night or two .  she could give it up any time she liked .      you know  that   s funny     she said     because i   m right next door to you and i didn   t .         oh .  .  well  that   s all right  then .  .      agnes stared at the tiny meal on christine   s tray .     is that all you   re having for breakfast .         oh  yes .  i can just blow up like a balloon  dear .  .  it   s lucky for you  you can eat anything .  .  don   t forget it   s practice in half an hour .      and she skipped off .   she   s got a head full of air  agnes thought .  i   m sure she doesn   t mean to say anything hurtful .   but  deep inside her  perdita x dream thought a rude word .      mrs .  plinge took her broom out of the cleaning cupboard  and turned .      walter .      her voice echoed around the empty stage .      walter .      she tapped the broom handle warily .  walter had a routine .  it had taken her years to train him into it .  it wasn   t like him not to be in the right place at the right time .   she shook her head  and started work .  she could see it   d be a mop job later .  it would probably be ages before they got rid of the smell of turpentine .   someone came walking across the stage .  they were whistling .   mrs .  plinge was shocked .      mr .  pounder .      the opera house   s professional rat catcher stopped  and lowered his struggling sack .  mr .  pounder wore an old opera hat to show that he was a cut above your normal rodent operative  and its brim was thick with wax and the old candle ends he used to light his way through the darker cellars .   he   d worked among the rats so long that there was something ratlike about him now .  his face seemed to be merely a rearward extension of his nose .  his mustache was bristly .  his front teeth were prominent .  people found themselves looking for his tail .      what   s that  mrs .  plinge .         you know you mustn   t whistle onstage .  that   s terrible bad luck .         ah  well  it   s    cos of good luck  mrs .  plinge .  oh  yes .  if you did know what i d   know  you   d be a happy man  too .  o    course  in your case you   d be a happy woman  on account of you being a woman .  ah .  some of the things i   ve seen  mrs .  plinge .         found gold down there  mr .  pounder .      mrs .  plinge knelt down carefully to scrape away a spot of paint .   mr .  pounder picked up his sack and continued on his way .      could be gold  mrs .  plinge .  ah .  could very well be gold        it took a moment for mrs .  plinge to coax her arthritic knees into letting her stand up and shuffle around .      pardon  mr .  pounder .     she said .   somewhere in the distance  there was a soft thump as a bundle of sandbags landed gently on the boards .   the stage was big and bare and empty  except for a sack which was scuttling determinedly for freedom .   mrs .  plinge looked both ways very carefully .      mr .  pounder .  are you there .      it suddenly seemed to her that the stage was even bigger and even more distinctly empty than before .      mr .  pounder .  cooo eee .      she craned around .      hello .  mr .  pounder .      something floated down from above and landed beside her .   it was a grubby black hat  with candle ends around the brim .   she looked up .      mr .  pounder .     she said .      mr .  pounder was used to darkness .  it held no fears for him .  and he   d always prided himself on his night vision .  if there was any light at all  any speck  any glimmer of phosphorescent rot  he could make use of it .  his candled hat was as much for show as anything else .   his candled hat   he   d thought he   d lost it but  it was strange  here it was  still on his head .  yes  indeed .  he rubbed his throat thoughtfully .  there was something important he couldn   t quite remember     it was very dark .   squeak .   he looked up .   standing in the air  at eye level  was a robed figure about six inches high .  a bony nose  with bent gray whiskers  protruded from the hood .  tiny skeletal fingers gripped a very small scythe .   mr .  pounder nodded thoughtfully to himself .  you didn   t rise to membership of the inner circle of the guild of rat catchers without hearing a few whispered rumors .  rats had their own death  they said  as well as their own kings  parliaments and nations .  no human had ever seen it  though .   up until now .   he felt honored .  he   d won the golden mallet for most rats caught every year for the past five years  but he respected them  as a soldier might respect a cunning and valiant enemy .      er   i   m dead  aren   t i    .      squeak .   mr .  pounder felt that many eyes were watching him .  many small  shining eyes .      and   what happens now .      squeak .   the soul of mr .  pounder looked at his hands .  they seemed to be elongating  and getting hairier .  he could feel his ears growing  and a certain rather embarrassing elongation happening at the base of his spine .  he   d spent most of his life in a single minded activity in dark places  yet even so        but i don   t believe in reincarnation .     he protested .   squeak .   and this  mr .  pounder understood with absolute rodent clarity  meant  reincarnation believes in you .      mr .  bucket went through his mail very carefully  and finally breathed out when the pile failed to disgorge another letter with the opera house crest .   he sat back and pulled open his desk drawer for a pen .   there was an envelope there .   he stared at it  and then slowly picked up his paper knife .   sliiiiit        rustle         i will be obliged if christine sings the role  of iodine in    la triviata    tonight .   the weather continues fine .  i trust you are well .     yrs  the opera ghost       mr .  salzella .  mr .  salzella .      bucket pushed back his chair and hurried to the door  opening it just in time to confront a ballerina  who screamed at him .   since his nerves were already strained  he responded by screaming back at her .  this seemed to have the effect that usually a wet flannel or a slap was necessary to achieve .  she stopped and gave him an affronted look .      he   s struck again  hasn   t he .     moaned bucket .      he   s here .  it   s the ghost .     said the girl  determined to get the line out even though it was not required .      yes  yes  i think i know     muttered bucket .     i just hope it wasn   t anybody expensive .      he stopped halfway along the corridor and then spun around .  the girl cringed away from his wavering finger .      at least stand on tiptoe .     he shouted .     you probably cost me a dollar just running up here .      there was a crowd in a huddle on the stage .  in the center was that new girl  the fat one  kneeling down and comforting an old woman .  bucket vaguely recognized the latter .  she was one of the staff that had come with the opera house  as much part of the whole thing as the rats or the gargoyles that infested the rooftops .   she was holding something in front of her .     it just fell out of the flies     she said .     his poor hat .      bucket looked up .  as his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness he made out a shape up among the battens  spinning slowly        oh  dear     he said .     and i thought he   d written such a polite letter           really .  then now read this one     said salzella  coming up behind him .      must i .         it   s addressed to you .      bucket unfolded the piece of paper .       hahahaha .  ahahahaha .     yrs  the opera ghost    ps  ahahahaha .  .  .  .  .     he gave salzella an agonized look .     who   s the poor fellow up there .         mr .  pounder  the rat catcher .  rope dropped around his neck  other end attached to some sandbags .  they went down .  he went   up .         i don   t understand .  is this man mad .      salzella put an arm around his shoulders and led him away from the crowd .     well  now     he said  as kindly as he could .     a man who wears evening dress all the time  lurks in the shadows and occasionally kills people .  then he sends little notes  writing maniacal laughter .  five exclamation marks again  i notice .  we have to ask ourselves  is this the career of a sane man .         but why is he doing it .     wailed bucket .      that is only a relevant question if he is sane     said salzella calmly .     he may be doing it because the little yellow pixies tell him to .         sane .  how can he be sane .     said bucket .     you were right  you know .  the atmosphere in this place   d drive anyone crazy .  i very well may be the only one here with both feet on the ground .     he turned .  his eyes narrowed when he saw a group of chorus girls whispering nervously .      you girls .  don   t just stand there .  let   s see you jump up and down .     he rasped .     on one leg .      he turned back to salzella .     what was i saying .         you were saying     said salzella     that you have both feet on the ground .  unlike the corps de ballet .  and the corpse de mr .  pounder .         i think that comment was in rather poor taste     said bucket coldly .      my view     said the director of music     is that we should shut down  get all the able bodied men together  issue them with torches  go through this place from top to bottom  flush him out  chase him through the city  catch him and beat him to a pulp  and then throw what   s left into the river .  it   s the only way to be sure .         you know we can   t afford to shut down     bucket said .     we seem to make thousands a week but we seem to spend thousands a week  too .  i   m sure i don   t know where it goes   i thought running this place was just a matter of getting bums on seats  but every time i look up there   s a bum spinning gently in the air   what   s he going to do next  i ask myself        they looked at one another and then  as if pulled by some kind of animal magnetism  their gazes turned and flew out over the auditorium until they found the huge  glittering bulk of the chandelier .      oh  no       moaned bucket .     he wouldn   t  would he .  that would shut us down .      salzella sighed .     look  it weighs more than a ton     he said .     the supporting rope is thicker than your arm .  the winch is padlocked when it   s not in use .  it   s safe .      they looked at one another .      i   ll have a man guard it every minute there   s a performance     said salzella .     i   ll do it personally  if you like .             and he wants christine to sing iodine tonight .  she   s got a voice like a whistle .      salzella raised his eyebrows .     that at least is not a problem  is it .     he said .      isn   t it .  it   s a key role .      salzella put his arm around the owner   s shoulders .     i think perhaps it is time for you to explore a few more little known corners of the wonderful world that is opera     he said .      the stagecoach rolled to a halt in sator square  ankh morpork .  the coach agent was waiting impatiently .      you   re fifteen hours late  mr .  reever .     he shouted .   the coach driver nodded impassively .  he laid the reins down  jumped off the box  and inspected the horses .  there was a certain woodenness about his movements .   passengers were grabbing their baggage and hurrying away .      well .     said the agent .      we had a picnic     said the coach driver .  his face was gray .      you stopped for a picnic .         and a bit of a singsong     said the driver  pulling the horses    feed bags from under the seat .      you are telling me that you stopped the mail coach for a picnic and a singsong .         oh  and the cat got stuck up a tree .     he sucked his hand  and the agent noticed that a handkerchief was tied around it .   a hazy look of recollection clouded the driver   s eyes .     and then there were the stories     he said .      what stories .         the little fat one said everyone had to tell a story to help pass the time .         yes .  well .  i don   t see how that could slow you down .         you should   ve heard her story .  the one about the very tall man and the piano .  i was so embarrassed i fell off the coach .  i wouldn   t use words like that even to my own dear grandmother .         and of course     said the agent  who prided himself on his ironic approach     the word timetable never crossed your mind while all this was going on .      the driver turned to look directly at him for the first time .  the agent took a step back .  here was a man who had hang glided over hell .      you tell them     said the driver  and walked away .   the agent stared after him  and then walked around to the door .   a small man with a hunted look climbed out  dragging a huge fat man behind him and gabbling urgently in a language the agent didn   t understand .   and then the agent was left alone with a coach and horses and an expanding circle of hurrying passengers .   he opened the door and peered inside .      good morning  mister     said nanny ogg .   he looked  in some puzzlement  from her to granny weatherwax .      is everything all right  ladies .         very nice journey     said nanny ogg  taking his arm .     we shall def   nitly patronize you another time .         the driver seemed to think there was a problem           problem .     said granny .     i didn   t notice any problems .  did you  gytha .         he could   ve been a bit quicker fetching the ladder     said nanny  climbing down .     and i   m sure he muttered something under his breath that time we stopped to admire the view .  but i   m prepared to be gracious about it .         you stopped to admire the view .     said the agent .     when .         oh  several times     said nanny .     no sense in rushing around the whole time  is there .  more haste less speed  etcetera .  could you point us in the direction of elm street .  only we   ve lodgings at mrs .  palm   s .  our nev speaks highly of the place  he says no one ever looked for him there        the agent stepped back  as people generally did in the face of nanny   s pump action chatter .      elm street .     he stuttered .     but   respectable ladies shouldn   t go there        nanny patted him on the shoulder .     that   s good     she said .     that way we won   t run into anyone we know .      as granny walked past the horses they tried to hide behind the coach .      bucket smiled brightly .  there were little beads of sweat around the edges of his face .      ah  perdita     he said .     do sit down  lass .  er .  you are enjoying your time with us so far .         yes  thank you  mr .  bucket     said agnes dutifully .      good .  that   s good .  isn   t that good  mr .  salzella .  don   t you think that   s good  dr .  undershaft .      agnes looked at the three worried faces .      we   re all very pleased     said mr .  bucket .     and  er  well  we have an amazing offer for you which i   m sure will help you to enjoy it even more .      agnes watched the assembled faces .     yes .     she said guardedly .      i know you  er  have only been with us hardly any time but we have decided to  er      bucket swallowed  and glanced at the other two for moral support      let you sing the part of iodine in tonight   s production of la triviata .         yes .         um .  it isn   t the major role but of course it does include the famous    departure    aria           oh .  yes .         er   there is  er   that is  er       bucket gave up and looked helplessly at his director of music .     mr .  salzella .      salzella leaned forward .     what in fact we would like you to do   perdita   is sing the role  indeed  but not  in fact   play the role .      agnes listened while they explained .  she   d stand in the chorus  just behind christine .  christine would be told to sing very softly .  it had been done dozens of times before  salzella explained .  it was done far more often than the audiences ever realized   when singers had a sore throat  or had completely dried  or had turned up so drunk they could barely stand  or  in one notorious instance many years previously  had died in the interval and subsequently sung their famous aria by means of a broom handle stuck up their back and their jaw operated with a piece of string .   it wasn   t immoral .  the show had to go on .   the ring of desperately grinning faces watched her .   i could just walk away  she thought .  walk away from these grinning faces and the mysterious ghost .  they couldn   t stop me .   but there   s nowhere to walk to except back .      yes  er  yes     she said .     i   m very   er   but why do it like this .  couldn   t i simply take her place and sing the part .      the men looked at one another  and then all started talking at once .      yes  but you see  christine is   has   more stage experience              technical grasp              stage presence              apparent lyrical ability              fits the costume        agnes looked down at her big hands .  she could feel the blush advancing like a barbarian horde  burning everything as it came .      we would like you  as it were     said bucket     to ghost the part           ghost .     said agnes .      it   s a stage term     said salzella .      oh  i see     said agnes .     yes .  well  of course .  i shall certainly do my best .         jolly good     said bucket .     we won   t forget this .  and i   m certain a very suitable part for you will come along very soon .  see dr .  undershaft this afternoon and he will take you through the role .         er .  i know it quite well  i think     said agnes  uncertainly .      really .  how .         i   ve been   taking lessons .         that is good  lass     said mr .  bucket .     shows keenness .  we   re very impressed .  but see dr .  undershaft in any case        agnes got up and  still looking down  trooped out .   undershaft sighed and shook his head .      poor child     he said .     born too late .  opera used to be just about voices .  you know  i remember the days of the great sopranos .  dame violetta gigli  dame clarissa extendo   whatever became of them  i sometimes wonder .         didn   t the climate change .     said salzella nastily .      there goes a figure that should prompt a revival of the ring of the nibelungingung     undershaft went on .     now that was an opera .         three days of gods shouting at one another and twenty minutes of memorable tunes .     said salzella .     no  thank you very much .         but can   t you hear her singing hildabrun  leader of the valkyries .         yes .  oh  yes .  but unfortunately i can also hear her singing nobbo the dwarf and io  chief of the gods .         those were the days     said undershaft sadly  shaking his head .     we had proper opera then .  i recall when dame veritasi stuffed a musician into his own tuba for yawning           yes  yes  but this is the century of the fruitbat     said salzella  standing up .  he glanced at the door again  and shook his head .      amazing     he said .     do you think she knows how fat she is .         the door of mrs .  palm   s discreet establishment opened at granny   s knock .   the person on the other side was a young woman .  very obviously a young woman .  there was no possible way that she could have been mistaken for a young man in any language  especially braille .   nanny peered around the young lady   s powdered shoulder at the red plush and gilt interior beyond  and then up at granny weatherwax   s impassive face  and then back at the young lady .      i   ll tan our nev   s hide when i get home     she muttered .     come away  esme  you don   t want to go in there .  it   d take too long to explain           why  granny weatherwax .     said the girl happily .     and who   s this .      nanny looked up at granny  whose expression hadn   t changed .      nanny ogg     nanny said eventually .     yes  i   m nanny ogg .  nev   s mum     she added darkly .     yes  indeed .  yes .  on account of me bein    a      the words    respectable widow woman    tried to range themselves in her vocal cords  and shriveled at the sheer enormity of the falsehood  forcing her to settle for    mother to him .  nev .  yes .  nev   s mum .         hello  colette     said granny .     what fascinatin    earrings you are wearing .  is mrs .  palm at home .         she   s always at home to important visitors     said colette .     do come in  everyone will be so pleased to see you again .      there were cries of welcome as granny stepped into the scarlet gloom .      what .  you   ve been here before .     said nanny  eying the pink flesh and white lace that made up much of the scenery .      oh  yes .  mrs .  palm is an old friend .  practic   ly a witch .         you   you do know what kind of place this is  do you  esme .     said nanny ogg .  she felt curiously annoyed .  she   d happily give way to granny   s expertise in the worlds of mind and magic  but she felt very strongly that there were some more specialized areas that were definitely ogg territory  and granny weatherwax had no business even to know what they were .      oh  yes     said granny  calmly .   nanny   s patience gave out .     it   s a house of ill repute  is what it is .         on the contrary     said granny .     i believe people speak very highly of it .         you knew .  and you never told me .      granny raised an ironic eyebrow .     the lady who invented the strawberry wobbler .         well  yes  but           we all live life the best way we can  gytha .  and there   s a lot of people who think witches are bad .         yes  but           before you criticize someone  gytha  walk a mile in their shoes     said granny  with a faint smile .      in those shoes she was wearin     i   d twist my ankle     said nanny  gritting her teeth .     i   d need a ladder just to get in    em .     it was infuriating  the way granny tricked you into reading her half of the dialogue .  and opened your mind to yourself in unexpected ways .      and it   s a welcoming place and the beds are soft     said granny .      warm  too  i expect     said nanny ogg  giving in .     and there   s always a friendly light in the window .         dear me  gytha ogg .  i always thought you were unshockable .         shockable  no     said nanny .     easily surprised  yes .         dr .  undershaft the chorus master peered at agnes over the top of his half moon spectacles .      the  um     departure    aria  as it is known     he said     is quite a little masterpiece .  not one of the great operatic highlights  but very memorable nevertheless .      his eyes misted over .        questa maledetta    sings iodine  as she tells peccadillo how hard it is for her to leave him      questa maledetta porta si blocccccca  si blocca comunque diavolo lo faccccc cio    .         he stopped and made great play of cleaning his glasses with his handkerchief .      when gigli sang it  there wasn   t a dry eye in the house     he mumbled .     i was there .  it was then that i decided that i would   oh  great days  indeed .     he put his glasses on and blew his nose .      i   ll run through it once     he said     just so that you can understand how it is supposed to go .  very well  andr   .      the young man who had been drafted to play the piano in the rehearsal room nodded  and winked surreptitiously at agnes .   she pretended not to have seen him  and listened with an expression of acute studiousness as the old man worked his way through the score .      and now     he said     let us see how you manage .      he handed her the score and nodded at the pianist .   agnes sang the aria  or at least a few bars of it .  andr   stopped playing and leaned his head against the piano  trying to stifle a laugh .      ahem     said undershaft .      was i doing something wrong .         you were singing tenor     said undershaft  looking sternly at andr   .      she was singing in your voice  sir .         perhaps you can sing it like  er  christine would sing it .      they started again .      kwesta .  .  maledetta .  .         undershaft held up both hands .  andr     s shoulders were shaking with the effort of not laughing .      yes  yes .  accurately observed .  i dare say you   re right .  but could we start again and  er  perhaps you would sing it how you think it should be sung .      agnes nodded .   they started again        and finished .   undershaft had sat down  half turned away .  he wouldn   t look round to face her .   agnes stood watching him uncertainly .     er .  was that all right .     she said .   andr   the pianist got up slowly and took her hand .     i think we   d better leave him     he said softly  pulling her toward the door .      was it that bad .         not   exactly .      undershaft raised his head  but didn   t turn it toward her .     more practice on those rs  madam  and strive for greater security above the stave     he said hoarsely .      yes .  yes  i will .      andr   led her out into the corridor  shut the door  and then turned to her .      that was astounding     he said .     did you ever hear the great gigli sing .         i don   t even know who gigli is .  what was i singing .         you didn   t know that either .         i don   t know what it means  no .      andr   looked down at the score in his hand .     well  i   m not much good at the language  but i suppose the opening could be sung something like this      this damn door sticks  this damn door sticks  it sticks no matter what the hell i do  it   s marked    pull    and indeed i am pulling  perhaps it should be marked    push    .      agnes blinked .     that   s it .         yes .         but i thought it was supposed to be very moving and romantic .         it is     said andr   .     it was .  this isn   t real life  this is opera .  it doesn   t matter what the words mean .  it   s the feeling that matters .  hasn   t anyone told    .  look  i   m in rehearsals for the rest of the afternoon  but perhaps we could meet tomorrow .  perhaps after breakfast .      oh  no  thought agnes .  here it comes .  the blush was moving inexorably upward .  she wondered if one day it might reach her face and carry on going  so that it ended up as a big pink cloud over her head .      er  yes     she said .     yes .  that would be   very helpful .         now i   ve got to go .     he gave her a weak little smile  and patted her hand .     and   i   m really sorry it   s happening this way .  because   that was astounding .      he went to walk away  and then stopped .     uh   sorry if i frightened you last night     he said .      what .         on the stairs .         oh  that .  i wasn   t frightened .         you   er   didn   t mention it to anyone  did you .  i   d hate people to think i was worrying over nothing .         hadn   t given it another thought  to tell you the truth .  i know you can   t be the ghost  if that   s what you   re worried about .  eh .         me .  the ghost .  haha .         haha     said agnes .      so  er   see you tomorrow  then           fine .      agnes headed back to her room  deep in thought .   christine was there  looking critically at herself in the mirror .  she spun around as agnes entered  she even moved with exclamation marks .      oh  perdita .  .  have you heard .  .  i   m to sing the part of iodine tonight .  .  isn   t that wonderful .  .     she dashed across the room and endeavored to pick agnes up and hug her  settling eventually for just hugging her .      and i heard they   re already letting you in the chorus .  .         yes  indeed .         isn   t that nice .  .  i   ve been practicing all morning with mr .  salzella .  kesta .  .  mallydetta .  .  porter see bloker .  .     she twirled happily .  invisible sequins filled the air with their shine .      when i am very famous     she said     you won   t regret having a friend in me .  .  i shall do my very best to help you .  .  i am sure you bring me luck .  .         yes  indeed     said agnes  hopelessly .      because my dear father told me that one day a dear little pixie would arrive to help me achieve my great ambition  and  do you know  i think that little pixie is you .  .      agnes smiled unhappily .  after you   d known christine for any length of time  you found yourself fighting a desire to look into her ear to see if you could spot daylight coming the other way .      er .  i thought we had swapped rooms .         oh  that .  .     said christine  smiling .     wasn   t i silly .  .  anyway  i shall need the big mirror now that i am to be a prima donna .  you don   t mind  do you .  .         what .  oh .  no .  no  of course not .  er .  if you   re sure        agnes looked at the mirror  and then at the bed .  and then at christine .      no     she said  shocked at the enormity of the idea that had just presented itself  delivered from the perdita of her soul .     i   m sure that will be fine .         dr .  undershaft blew his nose and tried to tidy himself up .   well  he didn   t have to stand for it .  perhaps the child was somewhat on the heavy side  but gigli  for example  had once crushed a tenor to death and no one had thought any worse of her for it .   he   d protest to mr .  bucket .   dr .  undershaft was a single minded man .  he believed in voices .  it didn   t matter what anyone looked like .  he never watched opera with his eyes open .  it was the music that mattered  not the acting and certainly not the shape of the singers .   what did it matter what shape she was .  dame tessitura had a beard you could strike a match on and a nose flattened half across her face  but she was still one of the best basses who ever opened beer bottles with her thumb .   of course salzella said that  while everyone accepted that large women of fifty could play thin girls of seventeen  people wouldn   t accept that a fat girl of seventeen could do it .  he said they   d cheerfully swallow a big lie and choke on a little fib .  salzella said that sort of thing .   something was going wrong these days .  the whole place seemed   sick  if a building could be sick .  the crowds were still coming  but the money just didn   t seem to be there anymore  everything seemed to be so expensive   and now they were owned by a cheese monger  for heaven   s sake  some grubby counter jumper who   d probably want to bring in fancy ideas .  what they needed was a businessman  some clerk who could add up columns of figures properly and not interfere .  that was the trouble with all the owners he had experienced   they started off thinking of themselves as businessmen  and then suddenly began to think they could make an artistic contribution .   still  possibly cheese mongers had to add up cheeses .  just so long as this one stayed in his office with the books  and didn   t go around acting as though he owned the place just because he happened to own the place     undershaft blinked .  he   d gone the wrong way again .  no matter how long you   d been here  this place was a maze .  he was behind the stage  in the orchestra   s room .  instruments and folding chairs had been stacked everywhere .  his foot toppled a beer bottle .   the twang of a string made him look around .  broken instruments littered the floor .  there were half a dozen smashed violins .  several oboes had been broken .  the trom had been pulled right out of a trombone .   he looked up into someone   s face .      but   why are you        the half moon spectacles tumbled over and over  and smashed on the boards .   then the attacker lowered his mask  as smooth and white as the skull of an angel  and stepped forward purposefully        dr .  undershaft blinked .   there was darkness .  a cloaked figure raised its head and looked at him through bony white sockets .   dr .  undershaft   s recent memories were a little confused  but one fact stood out .      aha     he said .     got you .  you   re the ghost .      you know  you   re rather amusingly wrong .   dr .  undershaft watched another masked figure pick up the body of   dr .  undershaft  and drag it into the shadows .      oh  i see .  i   m dead .      death nodded .   such would appear to be the case .      that was murder .  does anyone know .      the murderer .  and you  of course .      but him .  how can    .     undershaft began .   we must go  said death .      but he just killed me .  strangled me with his bare hands .      yes .  chalk it up to experience .      you mean i can   t do anything about it .      leave it to the living .  generally speaking  they get uneasy when the deceased takes a constructive role in a murder investigation .  they tend to lose concentration .      you know  you do have a very good bass voice .      thank you .      are there going to be   choirs and things .      would you like some .      agnes slipped out through the stage door and into the streets of ankh morpork .   she blinked in the light .  the air felt slightly prickly  and sharp  and too cold .   what she was about to do was wrong .  very wrong .  and all her life she   d done things that were right .   go on  said perdita .   in fact  she probably wouldn   t even do it .  but there was no harm in just asking where there was an herbal shop  so she asked .   and there was no harm in going in  so she went in .   and it certainly wasn   t against any kind of law to buy the ingredients she bought .  after all  she might get a headache later on  or be unable to sleep .   and it would mean nothing at all to take them back to her room and tuck them under the mattress .   that   s right  said perdita .   in fact  if you averaged out the moral difficulty of what she was proposing over all the little activities she had to undergo in order to do it  it probably wasn   t that bad at all  really     these comforting thoughts were arranging themselves in her mind as she headed back .  she turned a corner and nearly walked into nanny ogg and granny weatherwax .   she flung herself against the wall and stopped breathing .   they hadn   t seen her  although nanny   s foul cat leered at her over its owner   s shoulder .   they   d take her back .  she just knew they would .   the fact that she was a free agent and her own mistress and quite at liberty to go off to ankh morpork had nothing to do with it .  they   d interfere .  they always did .   she scurried back along the alley and ran as fast as she could to the rear of the opera house .   the stage doorkeeper took no notice of her .      granny and nanny strolled through the city toward the area known as the isle of gods .  it wasn   t exactly ankh and it wasn   t exactly morpork  being situated where the river bent so much it almost formed an island .  it was where the city kept all those things it occasionally needed but was uneasy about  like the watch house  the theaters  the prison and the publishers .  it was the place for all those things which might go off bang in unexpected ways .   greebo ambled along behind them .  the air was full of new smells  and he was looking forward to seeing if any of them belonged to anything he could eat  fight or ravish .   nanny ogg found herself getting increasingly worried .     this isn   t really us  esme     she said .      who is it  then .         i mean the book was just a bit of fun .  no sense in making ourselves unpopular  is there .         can   t have witches being done down  gytha .         i don   t feel done down .  i felt fine until you told me i was done down     said nanny  putting her finger on a major sociological point .      you   ve been exploited     said granny firmly .      no i ain   t .         yes you have .  you   re a downtrodden mass .         no i ain   t .         you   ve been swindled out of your life savings     said granny .      two dollars .         well  it   s all you   d actually saved     said granny  accurately .      only    cos i spent everything else     said nanny .  other people salted away money for their old age  but nanny preferred to accumulate memories .      well  there you are  then .         i was putting that by for some new piping for my still up at copperhead     said nanny .      you know how that scumble eats away at the metal           you were putting a little something by for some security and peace of mind in your old age     granny translated .      you don   t get peace of mind with my scumble     said nanny happily .     pieces  yes  but not peace .  it   s made from the finest apples  you know     she added .     well  mainly apples .      granny stopped outside an ornate doorway  and peered at the brass plate affixed thereon .      this is the place     she said .   they looked at the door .      i   ve never been one for front doors     said nanny  shifting from one foot to the other .   granny nodded .  witches had a thing about front doors .  a brief search located an alleyway which led around the back of the building .  here was a pair of much larger doors  wide open .  several dwarfs were loading bundles of books onto a cart .  a rhythmic thumping came from somewhere beyond the doorway .   no one took any notice of the witches as they wandered inside .   movable type was known in ankh morpork  but if wizards heard about it they moved it where no one could find it .  they generally didn   t interfere with the running of the city  but when it came to movable type the pointy foot was put down hard .  they had never explained why  and people didn   t press the issue because you didn   t press the issue with wizards  not if you liked yourself the shape you were .  they simply worked around the problem  and engraved everything .  this took a long time and meant that ankh morpork was  for example  denied the benefit of newspapers  leaving the population to fool themselves as best they could .   a press was thumping gently at one end of the warehouse .  beside it  at long tables  a number of dwarfs and humans were stitching pages together and gluing on the covers .   nanny took a book off a pile .  it was the joye of snacks .      can i help you  ladies .     said a voice .  its tone suggested very clearly that it wasn   t anticipating offering any kind of help whatsoever  except out into the street at speed .      we   ve come about this book     said granny .      i   m mrs .  ogg     said nanny ogg .   the man looked her up and down .      oh yes .  can you identify yourself .         certainly .  i   d know me anywhere .         hah .  well  i happen to know what gytha ogg looks like  madam  and she does not look like you .      nanny ogg opened her mouth to reply  and then said  in the voice of one who has stepped happily into the road and only now remembers about the onrushing coach        oh .         and how do you know what mrs .  ogg looks like .     said granny .      oh  is that the time .  we   d better be going       said nanny .      because  as a matter of fact  she sent me a picture     said goatberger  taking out his wallet .      i   m sure we   re not at all interested     said nanny hurriedly  pulling on granny   s arm .      i   m extremely interested     said granny .  she snatched a folded piece of paper out of goatberger   s hands  and peered at it .      hah .  yes   that   s gytha ogg all right     she said .     yes  indeed .  i remember when that young artist came to lancre for the summer .         i wore my hair longer in those days     muttered nanny .      just as well  considering     said granny .     i didn   t know you had copies  though .         oh  you know how it is when you   re young     said nanny dreamily .     it was doodle  doodle  doodle all summer long .     she awoke from her reverie .     and i still weigh the same now as i did then     she added .      except that it   s shifted     said granny  nastily .   she handed the sketch back to goatberger .     that   s her all right     she said .     but it   s out by about sixty years and several layers of clothing .  this is gytha ogg  right here .         you   re telling me this came up with bananana soup surprise .         did you try it .     said nanny .      mr .  cropper the head printer did  yes .         was he surprised .         not half as surprised as mrs .  cropper .         it can take people like that     said nanny .     i think perhaps i overdo the nutmeg .      goatberger stared at her .  doubt was beginning to assail him .  you only had to look at nanny ogg grinning back at you to believe she could write something like the joye of snacks .      did you really write this .     he said .      from memory     said nanny  proudly .      and now she   d like some money     said granny .   mr .  goatberger   s face twisted up as though he   d just eaten a lemon and washed it down with vinegar .      but we gave her the money back     he said .      see .     said nanny  her face falling .     i told you  esme           she wants some more     said granny .      no  i don   t           no  she doesn   t .     goatberger agreed .      she does     said granny .     she wants a little bit of money for every book you   ve sold .         i don   t expect to be treated like royalty     said nanny .       you shut up     said granny .     i know what you want .  we want some money  mr .  goatberger .         and what if i won   t give it to you .      granny glared at him .      then we shall go away and think about what to do next     she said .      that   s no idle threat     said nanny .     there   s a lot of people   ve regretted esme thinking about what to do next .         come back when you   ve thought  then .     snapped goatberger .  he stormed off .     i don   t know  authors wanting to be paid  good grief        he disappeared among the stacks of books .      er   do you think that could have gone better .     said nanny .   granny glanced at the table beside them .  it was stacked with long sheets of paper .  she nudged a dwarf  who had been watching the argument with some amusement .      what   re these .     she said .      they   re proofs for the almanack .     he saw her blank expression .     they   re sort of a trial run for the book so   s we can check that all the spelling mistakes have been left in .      granny picked it up .     come  gytha     she said .      i don   t want trouble  esme     said nanny ogg as she hurried after her .     it   s only money .         it ain   t money any more     said granny .     it   s a way of keepin    score .         mr .  bucket picked up a violin .  it was in two pieces  held together by the strings .  one of them broke .      who   d do something like this .     he said .     honestly  salzella   what is the difference between opera and madness .         is this a trick question .         no .         then i   d say  better scenery .  ah   i thought so        salzella rooted among the destruction  and stood up with a letter in his hand .      would you like me to open it .     he said .     it   s addressed to you .      bucket shut his eyes .      go on     he said .     don   t bother about the details .  just tell me  how many exclamation marks .         five .         oh .      salzella passed the paper over .   bucket read       dear bucket  whoops .   ahahahahahahahaha .  .  .  .  .     yrs  the opera ghost       what can we do .     he said .     one moment he writes polite little notes  the next he goes mad on paper .         herr trubelmacher has got everyone out hunting for new instruments     said salzella .      are violins more expensive than ballet shoes .         there are few things in the world more expensive than ballet shoes .  violins happen to be among them     said salzella .      further expense .         it seems so  yes .         but i thought the ghost liked music .  herr trubelmacher tells me the organ is beyond repair .  .  .      he stopped .  he was aware that he had exclaimed a little less rationally than a sane man should .      oh  well     bucket continued wearily .     the show must go on  i suppose .         yes  indeed     said salzella .   bucket shook his head .     how   s it all going for tonight .         i think it will work  if that   s what you mean .  perdita seems to have a very good grasp of the part .         and christine .         she has an astonishingly good grasp of wearing a dress .  between them  they make one prima donna .      the proud owner of the opera house got slowly to his feet .     it all seemed so simple     he moaned .     i thought  opera  how hard can it be .  songs .  pretty girls dancing .  nice scenery .  lots of people handing over cash .  got to be better than the cut throat world of yogurt  i thought .  now everywhere i go there   s        something crunched under his shoe .  he picked up the remains of a pair of half moon spectacles .      these are dr .  undershaft   s  aren   t they .     he said .     what   re they doing here .      his eyes met salzella   s steady gaze .      oh  no     he groaned .   salzella turned slightly  and stared hard at a big double bass case leaning against the wall .  he raised his eyebrows .      oh  no     said bucket  again .     go on .  open it .  my hands have gone all sweaty        salzella padded across to the case and grasped the lid .     ready .      bucket nodded  wearily .   the case was flung open .      oh  no .      salzella craned round to see .      ah  yes     he said .     a broken neck  and the body has been kicked in considerably .  that   ll cost a dollar or two to repair  and no mistake .         and all the strings are busted .  are double basses more expensive to rebuild than violins .         i am afraid that all musical instruments are incredibly expensive to repair  with the possible exception of the triangle     said salzella .     however  it could have been worse  hmm .         what .         well  it could have been dr .  undershaft in there  yes .      bucket gaped at him  and then shut his mouth .     oh  yes .  of course .  oh  yes .  that would have been worse .  yes .  bit of luck there  i suppose .  yes .  um .            so that   s an opera house  is it .     said granny .     looks like someone built a great big box and glued the architecture on afterward .      she coughed  and appeared to be waiting for something .      can we have a look around .     said nanny dutifully  aware that granny   s curiosity was equaled only by her desire not to show it .      it can   t do any harm  i suppose     said granny  as if granting a big favor .     seein    as we   ve nothing else to do right this minute .      the opera house was  indeed  that most efficiently multifunctional of building designs .  it was a cube .  but  as granny had pointed out  the architect had suddenly realized late in the day that there ought to be some sort of decoration  and had shoved it on hurriedly  in a riot of friezes  pillars  corybants  and curly bits .  gargoyles had colonized the higher reaches .  the effect  seen from the front  was of a huge wall of tortured stone .   round the back  of course  there was the usual drab mess of windows  pipes and damp stone walls .  one of the rules of a certain type of public architecture is that it only happens at the front .   granny paused under a window .     someone   s singing     she said .     listen .         la la la la la lah     trilled someone .     do re mi fah so la ti do           that   s opera  right enough     said granny .     sounds foreign to me .      nanny had an unexpected gift for languages  she could be comprehensibly incompetent in a new one within an hour or two .  what she spoke was one step away from gibberish but it was authentically foreign gibberish .  and she knew that granny weatherwax  whatever her other qualities  had an even bigger tin ear for languages than she did for music .      er .  could be     she said .     there   s always a lot going on  i know that .  our nev said they sometimes do different operations every night .         how did he find that out .     said granny .      well  there was a lot of lead .  that takes some shifting .  he said he liked the noisy ones .  he could hum along and also no one heard the hammering .      the witches strolled onward .      did you notice young agnes nearly bump into us back there .     said granny .      yes .  it was all i could do not to turn around     said nanny .      she wasn   t very pleased to see us  was she .  i practically heard her gasp .         that   s very suspicious  if you ask me     said nanny .     i mean  she sees two friendly faces from back home  you   d expect her to come runnin    up           we   re old friends  after all .  old friends of her grandma and her mum  anyway  and that   s practic   ly the same .         remember those eyes in the teacup .     said nanny .     she could be under the gaze of some strange occult force .  we got to be careful .  people can be very tricky when they   re in the grip of a strange occult force .  remember mr .  scruple over in slice .         that wasn   t a strange occult force .  that was acid stomach .         well  it certainly seemed strangely occult for a while .  especially if the windows were shut .      their perambulation had taken them to the opera house   s stage door .   granny looked up at a line of posters .      la triviata     she read aloud .     the ring of the nibelungingung    .         well  basically there are two sorts of opera     said nanny  who also had the true witch   s ability to be confidently expert on the basis of no experience whatsoever .     there   s your heavy opera  where basically people sing foreign and it goes like    oh  oh  oh  i am dyin     oh  i am dyin     oh  oh  oh  that   s what i   m doin        and there   s your light opera  where they sing in foreign and it basically goes    beer .  beer .  beer .  beer .  i like to drink lots of beer .      although sometimes they drink champagne instead .  that   s basically all of opera  reely .         what .  either dyin    or drinkin    beer .         basically  yes     said nanny  contriving to suggest that this was the whole gamut of human experience .      and that   s opera .         we ll   there might be some other stuff .  but mostly it   s stout or stabbin    .      granny was aware of a presence .   she turned .   a figure had emerged from the stage door  carrying a poster  a bucket of glue and a brush .   it was a strange figure  a sort of neat scarecrow in clothes slightly too small for it  although  to be truthful  there were probably no clothes that would have fit that body .  the ankles and wrists seemed infinitely extensible and independently guided .   it encountered the two witches standing at the poster board  and stopped politely .  they could see the sentence marshaling itself behind the unfocused eyes .      excuse me ladies .  the show must go on .      the words were all there and they made sense  but each sentence was fired out into the world as a unit .   granny pulled nanny to one side .      thank you .      they watched in silence as the man  with great and meticulous care  applied paste to a neat rectangle and then affixed the poster  smoothing every crease methodically .      what   s your name  young man .     said granny .      walter .         that   s a nice beret you have there .         my mum bought it for me .      walter chased the last air bubble to the edge of the paper and stood back .  then  completely ignoring the witches in his preoccupation with his task  he picked up the paste pot and went back inside .   the witches stared at the new poster in silence .      y   know  i wouldn   t mind seein    an operation     said nanny  after a while .     senior basilica did give us the tickets .         oh  you know me     said granny .     can   t be having with that sort of thing at all .      nanny looked sideways at her  and grinned to herself .  this was a familiar weatherwax opening line .  it meant  of course i want to  but you   ve got to persuade me .      you   re right  o    course     she said .     it   s for them folks in all their fine carriages .  it   s not for the likes of us .      granny looked hesitant for a moment .      i expect it   s having ideas above our station     nanny went on .     i expect if we went in they   d say  be off  you nasty ole crones           oh  they would  would they .         i don   t expect they want common folk like what we are comin    in with all those smart nobby people     said nanny .      is that a fact .  is that a fact  madam .  you just come with me .      granny stalked round to the front of the building  where people were already alighting from coaches .  she pushed her way up the steps and shouldered through the crowd to the ticket office .   she leaned forward .  the man behind the grille leaned back .      nasty old crones  eh .     she snapped .      i beg your pardon    .         not before time .  see here  we   ve got tickets for       she looked down at the pieces of cardboard  and pulled nanny ogg over .     it says here stalls .  the cheek of it .  stalls .  us .     she turned back to the ticket man .     see here  stalls aren   t good enough  we want seats in      she looked up at the board by the ticket window      the gods .  yes  that sounds about right .         i   m sorry .  you   ve got tickets for stalls seats and you want to exchange them for seats in the gods .         yes  and don   t you go expecting us to pay any more money .         i wasn   t going to ask you for           just as well .     said granny  smiling triumphantly .  she looked approvingly at the new tickets .     come  gytha .         er  excuse me     said the man as nanny ogg turned away     but what is that on your shoulders .         it   s   a fur collar     said nanny .      excuse me  but i just saw it flick its tail .         yes .  i happen to believe in beauty without cruelty .         agnes was aware of something happening backstage .  little groups of men were forming  and then breaking up as various individuals hurried away about their mysterious tasks .   out in front the orchestra was already tuning up .  the chorus was filing on to be a busy marketplace  in which various jugglers  gypsies  sword swallowers and gaily dressed yokels would be entirely unsurprised at an apparently drunken baritone strolling on to sing an enormous amount of plot at a passing tenor .   she saw mr .  bucket and mr .  salzella deep in argument with the stage manager .      how can we search the entire building .  this place is a maze .         he might have just wandered off somewhere    .         he   s as blind as a bat without those glasses .         but we can   t be certain something   s happened to him .         oh  yes .  you didn   t say that when we opened the double bass case .  you were certain he was going to be inside .  admit it .         i   wasn   t expecting just to find a smashed double bass  yes .  but i was feeling a bit mithered at that point .      a sword swallower nudged agnes .      what .         curtain up in one minute  dear     he said  smearing mustard on his sword .      has something happened to dr .  undershaft .         couldn   t say  dear .  you wouldn   t have any salt  would you .               scuse me .     scuse me .  sorry .     scuse me .  was that your foot .     scuse me        leaving a trail of annoyed and pained patrons in their wake  the witches trod their way to their seats .   granny elbowed herself comfortable and then  having in some matters the boredom threshold of a four year old  said     what   s happenin    now .      nanny   s skimpy knowledge of opera didn   t come to her aid .  so she turned to the lady beside her .         scuse me  could i borrow your program .  thank you .     scuse me  could i borrow your spectacles .  so kind .      she spent a few moments in careful study .      this is the overture     she said .     it   s kind of a free sample of what   s going to happen .     s got a summary of the story  too .  la triviata .      her lips moved as she read .  occasionally her brow wrinkled .      well  it   s quite simple reely     she said  at last .     a lot of people are in love with one another  there   s considerable dressing up as other people and general confusion  there   s a cheeky servant  no one really knows who anyone is  a couple of ole dukes go mad  chorus of gypsies  etc .  your basic opera .  someone   s prob   ly going to turn out to be someone else   s long lost son or daughter or wife or something .         shh .     said a voice behind them .      wish we   d brought something to eat     muttered granny .      i think i   ve got some peppermints in my knicker leg .         shh .         i would like my spectacles back  please .         here you are  ma   am .  they   re not very good  are they .      someone tapped nanny ogg on the shoulder .     madam  your fur stole is eating my chocolates .      and someone tapped granny weatherwax on her shoulder .     madam  kindly remove your hat .      nanny ogg choked on her peppermint .   granny weatherwax turned to the red faced gentleman behind her .     you do know what a woman in a pointy hat is  don   t you .     she said .      yes  madam .  a woman in a pointy hat is sitting in front of me .      granny gave him a stare .  and then  to nanny   s surprise  she removed her hat .      i do beg your pardon     she said .     i can see i was inadvertently bad mannered .  pray excuse me .      she turned back to the stage .   nanny ogg started breathing again .     you feeling all right  esme .         never better .      granny weatherwax surveyed the auditorium  oblivious to the sounds around her .      i assure you  madam  your fur is eating my chocolates .  it   s started on the second layer .         oh  dear .  show him the little map inside the lid  will you .  he   s only after the truffles  and you can soon rub the dribble off the others .         do you mind being quiet .         i don   t mind  it   s this man and his chocolates that   s making the noise        a big room  granny thought .  a great big room without windows     there was a tingling in her thumbs .   she looked at the chandelier .  the rope disappeared into an alcove in the ceiling .   her gaze passed along the rows of boxes .  they were all quite crowded .  on one  though  the curtains were almost closed  as if someone inside wanted to see out without being seen .   then granny looked among the stalls .  the audience was mainly human .  here and there was the hulking shape of a troll  although the troll equivalent of operas usually went on for a couple of years .  a few dwarf helmets gleamed  although dwarfs normally weren   t interested in anything without dwarfs in .  there seemed to be a lot of feathers down there  and here and there the glint of jewelry .  shoulders were being worn bare this season .  a lot of attention had been paid to appearances .  the people were here to look  not to see .   she closed her eyes .   this was when you started being a witch .  it wasn   t when you did headology on daft old men  or mixed up medicines  or stuck up for yourself  or knew one herb from another .   it was when you opened your mind to the world and carefully examined everything it picked up .   she ignored her ears until the sounds of the audience became just a distant buzz .   or  at least  a distant buzz broken by the voice of nanny ogg .      says here that dame timpani  who sings the part of quizella  is a diva     said nanny .     so i reckon this is like a part time job  then .  prob   ly quite a good idea  on account of you have to be able to hold your breath .  good trainin    for the singin    .      granny nodded without opening her eyes .   she kept them closed as the opera started .  nanny  who knew when to leave her friend to her own devices  tried to keep quiet but felt impelled to give out a running commentary .   then she said     there   s agnes .  hey  that   s agnes .         stop wavin    and sit down     murmured granny  trying to hold on to her waking dream .   nanny leaned over the balcony .      she   s dressed up as a gypsy     she said .     and now there   s a girl come forward to sing      she peered at the stolen program      the famous    departure    aria  it says here .  now that   s what i call a good voice           that   s agnes singin        said granny .      no  it   s this girl christine .         shut your eyes  you daft old woman  and tell me if that isn   t agnes singin        said granny .   nanny ogg obediently shut her eyes for a moment  and then opened them again .     it   s agnes singing .         yes .         but there   s that girl with the big smile right out there in front moving her lips and everything .         yes .      nanny scratched her head .     something a bit wrong here  esme .  can   t have people stealing our agnes   s voice .      granny   s eyes were still shut .     tell me if the curtains on that box down there on the right have moved     she said .      i just saw them twitch  esme .         ah .      granny let herself relax again .  she sank into the seat as the aria washed over her  and opened her mind once more     edges  walls  doors     once a space was enclosed it became a universe of its own .  some things remained trapped in it .   the music passed through one side of her head and out the other  but with it came other things  strands of things  echoes of old screams     she drifted down further  down below the conscious  into the darkness beyond the circle of firelight .   there was fear here .  it stalked the place like a great dark animal .  it lurked in every corner .  it was in the stones .  old terror crouched in the shadows .  it was one of the most ancient terrors  the one that meant that no sooner had mankind learned to walk on two legs than it dropped to its knees .  it was the terror of impermanence  the knowledge that all this would pass away  that a beautiful voice or a wonderful figure was something whose arrival you couldn   t control and whose departure you couldn   t delay .  it wasn   t what she had been looking for  but it was perhaps the sea in which it swam .   she went deeper .   and there it was  roaring through the nighttime of the soul of the place like a deep cold current .   as she drew closer she saw that it was not one thing but two  twisted around one another .  she reached out     trickery .  lies .  deceit .  murder .      no .      she blinked .   everyone had turned to look at her .   nanny tugged at her dress .     sit down  esme .      granny stared .  the chandelier hung peacefully over the crowded seats .      they beat him to death .         what   s that  esme .         and they throw him into the river .         esme .         sh .         madam  will you sit down at once .            and now it   s started on the nougat whirls .      granny snatched at her hat and did a crabwise run along the row  crushing some of the finest footwear in ankh morpork under her thick lancre soles .   nanny hung back reluctantly .  she   d quite enjoyed the song  and she wanted to applaud .  but her pair of hands wasn   t necessary .  the audience had exploded as soon as the last note had died away .   nanny ogg looked at the stage  and took note of something  and smiled .     like that  eh .         gytha .      she sighed .     coming  esme .     scuse me .     scuse me .  sorry .     scuse me        granny weatherwax was out in the red plush corridor  leaning with her forehead against the wall .      this is a bad one  gytha     she muttered .     it   s all twisted up .  i ain   t at all sure i can make it happen right .  the poor soul        she straightened up .     look at me  gytha  will you .      gytha obediently opened her eyes wide .  she winced a little as a fragment of granny weatherwax   s consciousness crept behind her eyes .   granny put her hat on  tucking in the occasional errant wisp of gray hair and then taking  one by one  the eight hat pins and ramming them home with the same frowning deliberation with which a mercenary might check his weapons .      all right     she said at last .   nanny ogg relaxed .     it   s not that i mind  esme     she said     but i wish you   d use a mirror .         waste of money     said granny .   now fully armored  she strode off along the corridor .      glad to see you didn   t lose your temper with the man who went on about your hat     said nanny  running along behind .      no point .  he   s going to be dead tomorrow .         oh  dear .  what of .         run over by a cart  i think .         why didn   t you tell him .         i could be wrong .      granny reached the stairs and thundered down them .      where   re we going .         i want to see who   s behind those curtains .      the applause  distant but still thunderous  filled the stairwell .      they certainly like agnes   s voice     said nanny .      yes .  i hopes we   re in time .         oh  bugger .         what .         i left greebo up there .         well  he likes meeting new people .  good grief  this place is a maze .      granny stepped out into a curved corridor  rather plusher than the one they had left .  there was a series of doors along it .      ah .  now  then        she walked along the row  counting  and then tried a handle .      can i help you  ladies .      they turned .  a little old woman had come up softly behind them  carrying a tray of drinks .   granny smiled at her .  nanny ogg smiled at the tray .      we were just wondering     said granny     which person in these boxes likes to sit with the curtains nearly shut .      the tray began to shake .      here  shall i hold that for you .     said nanny .     you   ll spill something if you   re not careful .         what do you know about box eight .     said the old lady .      ah .  box eight     said granny .     that   d be the one  yes .  that   s this one over here  isn   t it    .         no  please        granny strode forward and grasped the handle .   the door was locked .   the tray was thrust into nanny   s welcoming hands .     well  thank you  i don   t mind if i do       she said .   the woman pulled at granny   s arm .     don   t .  it   ll bring terrible bad luck .      granny thrust out her hand .     the key  madam .     behind her  nanny inspected a glass of champagne .      don   t make him angry .  it   s bad enough as it is .     the woman was clearly terrified .      iron     said granny  rattling the handle .     can   t magic iron           here     said nanny  stepping forward a little unsteadily .     give me one of your hat pins .  our nev   s taught me all kindsa tricks        granny   s hand rose to her hat  and then she looked at mrs .  plinge   s lined face .  she lowered her hand .      no     she said .     no  i reckon we   ll leave it for now           i don   t know what   s happening       sobbed mrs .  plinge .     it never used to be like this           have a good blow     said nanny  handing her a grubby handkerchief and patting her kindly on the back .         there was none of this killing people   he just wanted somewhere to watch the opera   it made him feel better           who   s this we   re talking about .     said granny .   nanny ogg gave her a warning look over the top of the old woman   s head .  there were some things best left to nanny .         he   d unlock it for an hour every friday for me to tidy up and there was always his little note saying thank you or apologizing for the chocolates down the seat   and where was the harm in it  that   s what i   d like to know           have another good blow     said nanny .         and now there   s people dropping like flies out of the flies   they say it   s him  but i know he never meant any harm              course not     said nanny  soothingly .         many   s the time i   ve seen    em look up at the box .  they always felt the better for it if they saw him   and then poor mr .  pounder was strangulated .  i looked around and there was his hat  just like that           it   s terrible when that happens     said nanny ogg .     what   s your name  dear .         mrs .  plinge     sniffed mrs .  plinge .     it came right down in front of me .  i   d have recognized it anywhere           i think it would be a good idea if we took you home  mrs .  plinge     said granny .      oh  dear .  i   ve got all these ladies and gentlemen to see to .  and anyway it   s dangerous going home this time of night   walter walks me home but he   s got to stay late tonight   oh dear           have another good blow     said nanny .     find a bit that isn   t too soggy .      there was a series of sharp pops .  granny weatherwax had interlocked her fingers and extended her hands at arm   s length  so that her knuckles cracked .      dangerous  eh .     she said .     well  we can   t see you all upset like this .  i   ll walk you home and mrs .  ogg will see to things here .            only i   ve got to attend to the boxes   i   ve got all these drinks to serve   could   ve sworn i had them a moment ago           mrs .  ogg knows all about drinks     said granny  glaring at her friend .      there   s nothing i don   t know about drinks     agreed nanny  shamelessly emptying the last glass .     especially these .            and what about our walter .  he   ll worry himself silly           walter   s your son .     said granny .     wears a beret .      the old woman nodded .      only i always comes back for him if he   s working late       she began .      you come back for him   but he sees you home .     said granny .      it   s   he   s   he   s       mrs .  plinge rallied .     he   s a good boy     she said defiantly .      i   m sure he is  mrs .  plinge     said granny .   she carefully lifted the little white bonnet off mrs .  plinge   s head and handed it to nanny  who put it on  and also took the little white apron .  that was the good thing about black .  you could be nearly anything  wearing black .  mother superior or madam  it was really just a matter of the style .  it just depended on the details .   there was a click .  box eight had bolted itself .  and then there was the very faint scrape of a chair being wedged under the door handle .   granny smiled  and took mrs .  plinge   s arm .     i   ll be back as soon as i can     she said .   nanny nodded  and watched them go .   there was a little cupboard at the end of the corridor .  it contained a stool  mrs .  plinge   s knitting  and a small but very well stocked bar .  there were also  on a polished mahogany plank  a number of bells on big coiled springs .   several of them were bouncing up and down angrily .   nanny poured herself a gin and gin with a dash of gin and inspected the rows of bottles with considerable interest .   another bell started to ring .   there was a huge jar of stuffed olives .  nanny helped herself to a handful and blew the dust off a bottle of port .   a bell fell off its spring .   somewhere out in the corridor a door opened and a young man   s voice bellowed     where are those drinks  woman .      nanny tried the port .   nanny ogg was used to the idea of domestic service .  as a girl  she   d been a maid at lancre castle  where the king was inclined to press his intentions and anything else he could get hold of .  young gytha ogg had already lost her innocence  but she had some clear ideas about unwelcome intentions  and when he jumped out at her in the scullery she had technically committed treason with a large leg of lamb swung in both hands .  that had ended her life below stairs and put a lengthy crimp in the king   s activities above them .   the brief experience had given her certain views which weren   t anything so definite as political but were very firmly oggish .  and mrs .  plinge had looked as if she didn   t get very much to eat and not a lot of time to sleep  either .  her hands had been thin and red .  nanny had a lot of time for the plinges of the world .   did port go with sherry .  oh  well  no harm in trying     all the bells were ringing now .  it must be coming up to the interval .   she methodically unscrewed the top off a jar of cocktail onions  and thoughtfully crunched a couple .   then  as other people started to poke their heads around the doors and make angry demands  she went to the champagne shelf and took down a couple of magnums .  she gave them a damn good shake  tucked one under each arm with a thumb on the corks  and stepped out into the corridor .   nanny   s philosophy of life was to do what seemed like a good idea at the time  and do it as hard as possible .  it had never let her down .      the curtains closed .  the audience was still on its feet  applauding .      what happens now .     whispered agnes to the next gypsy .   he pulled off his bandanna .     well  dear  we generally nip out to   oh  no  they   re going for a curtain call .      the curtains opened again .  the light caught christine  who curtsied and waved and sparkled .   her fellow gypsy nudged agnes .     look at dame timpani     he said .     there   s a nose in a sling if ever i saw one .      agnes stared at the prima donna .      she   s smiling     she said .      so does a tiger  dear .      the curtains shut once more  with a finality that said the stage manager was going to strike the set and would scream at someone if they dared to touch those ropes again     agnes ran off with the others .  there wasn   t too much to do in the next act .  she   d tried to memorize the plot earlier   although other members of the chorus had done their best to dissuade her  on the basis that you could either sing them or understand them  but not both .   nevertheless  agnes was conscientious .         so peccadillo  ten .    the son of duke tagliatella  bass   has secretly disguised himself as a swineherd to woo quizella  not knowing that doctor bufola  bar .   has sold the elixir to ludi the servant  without realizing he is really the maid iodine  sop .   dressed up as a boy because count artaud  bar .   claims that        a deputy stage manager pulled her out of the way and waved at someone in the wings .      lose the countryside  ron .      there was a series of whistles from offstage  answered by another from above .   the backcloth rose .  from the gloom above  the sandbag counterweights began to descend .         then artaud reveals  er  that zibeline must marry fideli  i mean fiabe  not knowing  er  that the family fortunes        the sandbags came down .  on one side of the stage  at least .  on the other side  agnes was interrupted in her impossible task by the screaming  and looked around into the upside down and not at all well features of the late dr .  undershaft .      nanny skipped through a handy door  shut it behind her  and leaned on it .  after a few moments the sound of running feet clattered past .   well  that had been fun .   she removed the lace bonnet and apron and  because there was a basic honesty in nanny  she tucked them in a pocket to give back to mrs .  plinge later .  then she pulled out a flat  round black shape and banged it against her arm .  the point shot out .  after a few adjustments her official hat was almost as good as new .   she looked around .  a certain absence of light and carpeting  together with a very presence of dust  suggested that this was a part of the place the public weren   t supposed to see .   oh  damn .  she supposed she had better find another door .  of course  that   d mean she   d have to leave greebo  wherever he was  but he   d turn up .  he always did when he wanted feeding .   there was a flight of steps leading down .  she followed them to a corridor which was slightly better lit and ambled along it for quite a way .  and then all she had to do was follow the screams .   she emerged among the flats and jumbled props backstage .   no one bothered about her .  the appearance of a small  amiable old lady was not about to cause comment at this point .   people were running backward and forward  shouting .  more impressionable people were just standing in one place and screaming .  a large lady was sprawled over two chairs having hysterics  while some distracted stagehands tried to fan her with a script .   nanny ogg was not certain whether something important had happened or whether this was just a continuation of opera by other means .      i should loosen her corsets  if i was you     she said as she ambled past .      good heavens  madam  there   s enough panic in here as it is .      nanny moved on to an interesting crowd of gypsies  noblemen and stagehands .   witches are curious by definition and inquisitive by nature .  she moved in .      let me through .  i   m a nosy person     she said  employing both elbows .  it worked  as this sort of approach generally does .   there was a dead person lying on the floor .  nanny had seen death in a wide variety of guises  and certainly knew strangulation when it presented itself .  it wasn   t the nicest end  although it could be quite colorful .      oh dear     she said .     poor man .  what happened to him .         mr .  bucket says he must have got caught up in the       someone began .      he didn   t get caught in anything .  this is the ghost   s work .     said someone else .     he could still be up there .      all eyes turned upward .      mr .  salzella   s sent some stagehands to flush him out .         have they got flaming torches .     said nanny .   several of them looked at her as if wondering  for the first time  who she was .      what .         got to have flaming torches when you   re tracking down evil monsters     said nanny .     well known fact .      there was a moment while this sunk in  and then      that   s true .         she   s right  you know .         well known fact  dear .         did they have flaming torches .         don   t think so .  just ordinary lanterns .         oh  they   re no good     said nanny .     that   s for smugglers  lanterns .  for evil monsters you need flaming           excuse me  boys and girls .      the stage manager had stood on a box .      now     he said  a little pale around the face     i know you   re all familiar with the phrase    the show must go on           there was a chorus of groans from the chorus .      it   s very hard to sing a jolly song about eating hedgehogs when you   re waiting for an accident to happen to you     shouted a gypsy king .      funny thing  if we   re talking about songs about hedgehogs  i myself       nanny began  but no one was paying her any attention .      now  we don   t actually know what happened           really .  shall we guess .     said a gypsy .         but we have men up in the fly loft now           oh .  in case of more accidents .            and mr .  bucket has authorized me to say that there will be an additional two dollars    bonus tonight in recognition of your bravely agreeing to continue with the show           money .  after a shock like this .  money .  he thinks he can offer us a couple of dollars and we   ll agree to stay on this cursed stage .         shame .         heartless .         unthinkable .         should be at least four .         right .  right .         for shame  my friends .  to talk about a few dollars when there is a dead man lying there   have you no respect for his memory .         exactly .  a few dollars is disrespectful .  five dollars or nothing .      nanny ogg nodded to herself  and wandered off and found a sufficiently big piece of cloth to cover the late dr .  undershaft .   nanny rather liked the theatrical world .  it was its own kind of magic .  that was why esme disliked it  she reckoned .  it was the magic of illusions and misdirection and foolery  and that was fine by nanny ogg  because you couldn   t be married three times without a little fooling .  but it was just close enough to granny   s own kind of magic to make granny uneasy .  which meant she couldn   t leave it alone .  it was like scratching an itch .   people didn   t take any notice of little old ladies who looked as though they fitted in  and nanny ogg could fit in faster than a dead chicken in a maggot factory .   besides  nanny had one additional little talent  which was a mind like a buzz saw behind a face like an elderly apple .   someone was crying .   a strange figure was kneeling beside the late chorus master .  it looked like a puppet with the strings cut .      can you give me a hand with this sheet  mister .     said nanny quietly .   the face looked up .  two watery eyes  running with tears  blinked at nanny .     he won   t wake up .      nanny mentally changed gear .     that   s right  luv     she said .     you   re walter  ain   t you .         he was always very good to me and our mum .  he never gave me a kick .      it was obvious to nanny that there was no help here .  she knelt down and began to do her best with the departed .      miss they say it were the ghost miss .  it weren   t the ghost miss .  he   d never do a thing like that .  he was always good to me and our mum .      nanny changed gear again .  you had to slow down a bit for walter plinge .      my mum   d know what to do .         yes  well   she   s gone home early  walter .      walter   s waxy face started to contort into an expression of terminal horror .      she mustn   t walk home without walter to look after her .     he shouted .      i bet she always says that     said nanny .     i bet she always makes sure her walter   s with her when she goes home .  but i expect that right now she   d want her walter to just get on with things so   s she can be proud of him .  show   s not half over yet .            s dangerous for our mum .      nanny patted his hand and absentmindedly wiped her own hand on her dress .      that   s a good boy     she said .     now  i   ve got to go off           the ghost wouldn   t harm no one .         yes  walter  only i   ve got to go but i   ll find someone to help you and you must put poor dr .  undershaft somewhere safe until after the show .  understand .  and i   m mrs .  ogg .      walter gawped at her  and then nodded sharply .      good boy .      nanny left him still looking at the body and headed farther backstage .   a young man hurrying past found that he   d suddenly acquired an ogg .         scuse me  young man     said nanny  still holding his arm     but d   you know anyone around here called agnes .  agnes nitt .         can   t say i do  ma   am .  what does she do .     he made to hurry on as politely as possible  but nanny   s grip was steel .      she sings a bit .  big girl .  voice with double joints in it .  wears black .         you don   t mean perdita .         perdita .  oh  yes .  that   d be her all right .         i think she   s seeing to christine .  they   re in mr .  salzella   s office .         would christine be the thin girl in white .         yes  ma   am .         and i expect you   re going to show me where this mr .  salzella   s office is .         er  am i   er  yes .  it   s just along the stage there  first door on the right .         what a good boy to help an old lady     said nanny .  her grip increased to a few ounces short of cutting off circulation .     and wouldn   t it be a good idea if you helped young walter back there do something respectful for the poor dead man .         back where .      nanny turned around .  the late dr .  undershaft had gone nowhere  but walter had vanished .      poor chap was a bit upset  i shouldn   t wonder     said nanny .     only to be expected .  so   how about if you got another strapping young lad to help you out instead .         er   yes .         what a good boy     nanny repeated .      it was mid evening .  granny and mrs .  plinge pushed their way through the crowds toward the shades  a part of the city that was as thronged as a rookery  fragrant as a cesspit  and vice versa .      so     said granny  as they entered the network of fetid alleys     your boy walter usually sees you home  does he .         he   s a good boy  mistress weatherwax     said mrs .  plinge defensively .      i   m sure you   re grateful for a strong lad to lean on     said granny .   mrs .  plinge looked up .  looking into granny   s eyes was like looking into a mirror .  what you saw looking back at you was yourself  and there was no hiding place .      they torment him so     she mumbled .     they poke at him and hide his broom .  they   re not bad boys round here  but they will torment him .         he brings his broom home  does he .         he looks after his things     said mrs .  plinge .     i   ve always brought him up to look after his things and not be a trouble .  but they will poke the poor soul and call him such names        the alleyway opened into a yard  like a well between the high buildings .  washing lines crisscrossed the rectangle of moonlit sky .      i   m just in here     said mrs .  plinge .     much obliged to you .         how does walter get home without you .     said granny .      oh  there   s plenty of places to sleep in the opera house .  he knows that if i don   t come for him he   s to stop there for the night .  he does what he   s told  mistress weatherwax .  he   s never any trouble .         i never said he was .      mrs .  plinge fumbled in her purse  as much to escape granny   s stare as to look for the key .      i expect your walter sees most of what goes on in the opera house     said granny  taking one of mrs .  plinge   s wrists in her hand .     i wonder what your walter   saw .      the pulse jumped at the same time as the thieves did .  shadows unfolded themselves .  there was the scrape of metal .   a low voice said     there   s two of you  ladies  and there   s six of us .  there   s no use in screaming .         oh  deary deary me     said granny .   mrs .  plinge dropped to her knees .     oh  please don   t hurt us  kind sirs  we are harmless old ladies .  haven   t you got mothers .      granny rolled her eyes .  damn  damn and blast .  she was a good witch .  that was her role in life .  that was the burden she had to bear .  good and evil were quite superfluous when you   d grown up with a highly developed sense of right and wrong .  she hoped  oh she hoped  that young though these were  they were dyed in the wool criminals        i    ad a mother once     said the nearest thief .     only i think i must of et    er        ah .  top marks .  granny raised both hands to her hat to draw out two long hat pins     a tile slid off the roof  and splashed into a puddle .   they looked up .   a caped figure was visible for a moment against the moonlight .  it thrust out a sword at arm   s length .  then it dropped  landing lightly in front of one astonished man .   the sword whirled .   the first thief spun and thrust at the shadowy shape in front of him  which turned out to be another thief  whose arm jerked up and dragged its own knife along the rib cage of the thief beside him .   the masked figure danced among the gang  his sword almost leaving trails in the air .  it occurred to granny later that it never actually made contact  but then  it never needed to   when six are against one in a m  l  e in the shadows  and especially if those six aren   t used to a target that is harder to hit than a wasp  and even more so if they got all their ideas of knife fighting from other amateurs  then there   s six chances in seven that they   ll stab a crony and about one chance in twelve that they   ll nick their own earlobe .   the two that remained uninjured after ten seconds looked at one another  turned  and ran .   and then it was over .   the surviving vertical figure bowed low in front of granny weatherwax .     ah .  bella donna .      there was a swirl of black cloak and red silk  and it too was gone .  for a moment soft footsteps could be heard skimming over the cobbles .   granny   s hand was still halfway to her hat .      well i never .     she said .   she looked down .  various bodies were groaning or making soft bubbling noises .      deary deary me     she said .  then she pulled herself together .      i reckon we   re going to need some nice hot water and some bits of bandage  and a good sharp needle for the stitching  mrs .  plinge     she said .     we can   t let these poor men bleed to death now  can we  even if they do try to rob old ladies        mrs .  plinge looked horrified .      we   ve got to be charitable  mrs .  plinge     granny insisted .      i   ll pump up the fire and tear up a sheet     said mrs .  plinge .     don   t know if i can find a needle           oh  i    spect i   ve got a needle     said granny  extracting one from the brim of her hat .   she knelt down by a fallen thief .     it   s rather rusty and blunt     she added     but we shall have to do the best we can .      the needle gleamed in the moonlight .  his round  frightened eyes focused on it  and then on granny   s face .  he whimpered .  his shoulder blades tried to dig him into the cobbles .   it was perhaps as well that no one else could see granny   s face in the shadows .      let   s do some good     she said .      salzella threw his hands in the air .     supposing he   d come down in the middle of the act .     he said .      all right  all right     said bucket  who was sitting behind his desk as a man might hide behind a bunker .     i agree .  after the show we call in the watch .  no two ways about it .  we shall just have to ask them to be discreet .         discreet .  have you ever met a watchman .     said salzella .      not that they   ll find anything .  he   ll have been over the rooftops and away  you may depend upon it .  whoever he is .  poor dr .  undershaft .  he was always so highly strung .         never more so than tonight     said salzella .      that was tasteless .      salzella leaned over the desk .     tasteless or not  the company are theater people .  superstitious .  one little thing like someone being murdered onstage and they go all to pieces .         he wasn   t murdered onstage  he was murdered offstage .  and we can   t be sure it was murder .  he   d been very   depressed  lately .      agnes had been shocked  but it hadn   t been shock at dr .  undershaft   s death .  she   d been astonished at her own reaction .  it had been startling and unpleasant to see the man  but even worse to see herself actually being interested in what was happening   in the way people reacted  in the way they moved  in the things they said .  it had been as if she   d stood outside herself  watching the whole thing .   christine  on the other hand  had just folded up .  so had dame timpani .  far more people had fussed over christine than around the prima donna  despite the fact that dame timpani had come around and fainted again quite pointedly several times and had eventually been forced to go for hysterics .  no one had assumed for a minute that agnes couldn   t cope .   christine had been carried into salzella   s backstage office and put on a couch .  agnes had to fetch a bowl of water and a cloth and was wiping her forehead  for there are some people who are destined to be carried to comfortable couches and some people whose only fate is fetching a bowl of cold water .      curtain goes up again in two minutes     said salzella .     i   d better go and round up the orchestra .  they   ll all be in the stab in the back over the road .  the swine can get through half a pint before the applause has died away .         are they capable of playing .         they never have been  so i don   t see why they should start now     said salzella .     they   re musicians  bucket .  the only way a dead body would upset them is if it fell in their beer  and even then they   d play if you offered them dead body money .      bucket walked over to the recumbent christine .     how is she .         she keeps mumbling a bit       agnes began .      cup of tea .  tea .  cup of tea  anyone .  nothing nicer than a cup of tea  well  i tell a lie  but i see the couch is occupied  just my little joke  no offense meant  anyone for a nice cup of tea .      agnes looked around in horror .      well  i could certainly do with one     said bucket  with false joviality .      how about you  miss .     nanny winked at agnes .      er   no  thank you   do you work here .     said agnes .      i   m just helping out for mrs .  plinge  who has been taken poorly     said nanny  giving her another wink .     i   m mrs .  ogg .  don   t mind me .      this seemed to satisfy bucket  if only because random tea distributors represented the most minor of threats at this point .      it   s more like grand guignol than opera out there tonight     said nanny .  she nudged bucket .        s foreign for    blood all over the stage        she said helpfully .      really .         yep .  it means   big gignol .      music started in the distance .      that   s the overture to act two     said bucket .     well  if christine is still unwell  then       he looked desperately at agnes .  well  at a time like this people would understand .   agnes   s chest swelled further with pride .     yes  mr .  bucket .         perhaps we could find you a white        christine  her eyes still shut  raised her wrist to her forehead and groaned .      oh  dear  what happened .      bucket knelt down instantly .     are you all right .  you had a nasty shock .  do you think you could go on for the sake of your art and people not asking for their money back .      she gave him a brave smile .  unnecessarily brave  it seemed to agnes .      i can   t disappoint the dear public .     she said .      jolly good .     said bucket .     i should hurry on out there  then .  perdita will help you   won   t you  perdita .         yes .  of course .         and you   ll be in the chorus for the duet     said bucket .     nearby in the chorus .      agnes sighed .     yes  i know .  come on  christine .         dear perdita       said christine .   nanny watched them go .  then she said     i   ll have that cup if you   ve finished with it .         oh .  yes .  yes  it was very nice     said bucket .      er   i had a bit of an accident up at the boxes     said nanny .   bucket clutched at his chest .     how many died .         oh  no one died  no one died .  they got a bit damp because i spilled some champagne .      bucket sagged with relief .     oh  i wouldn   t worry about that     he said .      when i say spilled   i mean  it went on happening        he waved her away .     it cleans up well off the carpet     he said .      does it stain ceilings .         mrs    .  .         ogg .         please just go away .      nanny nodded  gathered up the teacups and wandered out of the office .  if no one questioned an old lady with a tray of tea  they certainly weren   t bothered about one behind a pile of washing up .  washing up is a badge of membership anywhere .   as far as nanny ogg was concerned  washing up was also something that happened to other people  but she felt that it might be a good idea to stay in character .  she found an alcove with a pump and a sink in it  rolled up her sleeves  and set to work .   someone tapped her on the shoulder .      you shouldn   t do that  you know     said a voice .     that   s very unlucky .      she glanced around at a stagehand .      what  washing up causes seven years    bad luck .     she said .      you were whistling .         well .  i always whistle when i   m thinkin    .         you shouldn   t whistle onstage  i meant .         it   s unlucky .         i suppose you could say that .  we use whistle codes when we   re shifting the scenery .  having a sack of sandbags land on you could be unlucky  i suppose .      nanny glanced up .  his gaze followed hers .  just here the ceiling was about two feet away .      it   s just safest not to whistle     the boy mumbled .      i   ll remember that     said nanny .     no whistlin    .  interestin    .  we do live and learn  don   t we .         the curtain went up on act two .  nanny watched from the wings .   the interesting thing was the way in which people contrived to keep one hand higher than their necks in case of accidents .  there seemed to be far more salutes and waves and dramatic gestures than were strictly called for in the opera .   she watched the duet between iodine and bufola  possibly the first in the history of the opera where both singers kept their eyes turned resolutely upward .   nanny enjoyed music  as well .  if music were the food of love  she was game for a sonata and chips at any time .  but it was clear that the sparkle had gone out of things tonight .   she shook her head .   a figure moved through the shadows behind her  and reached out .  she turned  and looked at a fearsome face .      oh  hello  esme .  how did you get in .         you   ve still got the tickets so i had to talk to the man on the door .  but he   ll be right as rain in a minute or two .  what   s been happening .         well   the duke   s sung a long song to say that he must be going  and the count has sung a song saying how nice it is in the springtime  and a dead body   s fallen out of the ceiling .         that goes on a lot in opera  does it .         shouldn   t think so .         ah .  in the theater  i   ve noticed  if you watch dead bodies long enough you can see them move .         doubt if this one   ll move .  strangled .  someone   s murdering opera people .  i bin chatting to the ballet girls .         indeed .         it   s this ghost they   re all talking about .         hmm .  wears one of those black opera suits and a white mask .         how did you know that .      granny looked smug .      i mean  i can   t imagine who   d want to murder opera people       nanny thought of the expression on dame timpani   s face .     except p   raps other opera people .  and p   raps the musicians .  and some of the audience  p   raps .         i don   t believe in ghosts     said granny firmly .      oh  esme .  you know i   ve got a dozen of    em in my house .         oh  i believe in ghosts     said granny .     sad things hangin    around goin    woogy woogy woogy   but i don   t believe they kill people or use swords .     she walked away a little .     there   s too many ghosts here already .      nanny kept quiet .  it was best to do so when granny was listening without using her ears .      gytha .         yes  esme .         what does    bella donna    mean .         it   s the nobby name for deadly nightshade  esme .         i thought so .  huh .  the cheek of it .         only  in opera  it means beautiful woman .         really .  oh .     granny   s hand reached up and patted the iron hard bun of her hair .     foolishness .         he   d moved like music  like someone dancing to a rhythm inside his head .  and his face for a moment in the moonlight was the skull of an angel        the duet got another standing ovation .   agnes faded gently back into the chorus .  she had to do little else during the remainder of the act except dance  or at least move as rhythmically as she could  with the rest of the chorus during the gypsy fair  and listen to the duke singing a song about how lovely the countryside was in summer .  with an arm extended dramatically above his head .   she kept peering into the wings .   if nanny ogg was here then the other one would be around somewhere .  she wished she   d never written those wretched letters home .  well   they wouldn   t drag her back  no matter what they tried        the remainder of the opera passed without anyone dying  except where the score required them to do so at some length .  there was a minor upset when a member of the chorus was almost brained by a sandbag dislodged from a gantry by the stagehands stationed there to prevent accidents .   there was more applause at the end .  christine got most of it .   and then the curtains closed .   and opened and closed a few times as christine took her bows .   agnes considered she took one more bow than the applause really justified .  perdita  looking out through her eyes  said  of course she did .   and then they closed the curtains for the last time .   the audience went home .   from the wings  and up in the flies  the stagehands whistled their commands .  parts of the world vanished into the aerial darkness .  someone went around and put out most of the lights .  rising like a birthday cake  the chandelier was winched into its loft so that the candles could be snuffed .  then there were the footsteps of the men leaving the loft     within twenty minutes of the last hand clap of applause the auditorium was empty and dark  except for just a few lights .   there was the clank of a bucket .   walter plinge walked onto the stage  if such a word could be employed for his mode of progress .  he moved like a puppet on elastic strings  so that it seemed only coincidentally that his feet touched the ground .   very slowly  and very conscientiously  he began to mop the stage .   after a few minutes a shadow detached itself from the curtains and walked over to him .  walter looked down .      hello mister pussy cat     he said .   greebo rubbed against his legs .  cats have an instinct for anyone daft enough to give them food  and walter certainly was well qualified .      i shall go and find you some milk shall i mister cat .      greebo purred like a thunderstorm .   walking his strange walk  advancing only by averages  walter disappeared into the wings .   there were two dark figures sitting in the balcony .      sad     said nanny .      he   s got a good job in the warm and his mother keeps an eye on him     said granny .     a lot of people fare worse .         not a big future for him  though     said nanny .     not when you think about it .         there was a couple of cold potatoes and half a herring for their supper     said granny .     hardly a stick of furniture  too .         shame .         mind you  she   s a little bit richer now     granny conceded .     especially if she sells all those knives and boots     she added to herself .      it   s a cruel world for old ladies     said nanny  matriarch of a vast extended tribe and undisputed tyrant of half the ramtops .      especially one as terrified as mrs .  plinge     said granny .      well  i   d be frightened  too  if i was old and had walter to think about .         i ain   t talking about that  gytha .  i know about fear .         that   s true     said nanny .     most of the people you meet are full of fear .         mrs .  plinge is living in fear     said granny  appearing not to hear this .     her mind is flat with it .  she can   t hardly think for the terror .  i could feel it coming off of her like mist .         why .  because of the ghost .         i don   t know yet .  not all of it  anyway .  but i will find out .      nanny fished in the recesses of her clothing .      fancy a drink .     she said .  there was a muffled clink from somewhere in her petticoats .     i got champagne  brandy and port .  also some nibbles and biscuits .         gytha ogg  i believe you are a thief     said granny .      i ain   t .     said nanny  and added  with that grasp of advanced morality that comes naturally to a witch     just because i occasionally technic   ly steal something  that doesn   t make me a thief .  i don   t think thief .         let   s get back to mrs .  palm   s .         all right     said nanny .     but can we get something to eat first .  i don   t mind the cooking  but the grub there is a bit of an all day breakfast  if you know what i mean        there was a sound from the stage as they stood up .  walter had returned  followed by a slightly fatter greebo .  oblivious to the watchers  he continued to mop the stage .      first thing tomorrow     said granny     we   ll go and see mr .  goatberger the almanack man again .  i   ve had time to think about what to do next .  and then we   re going to sort this out .      she glared at the innocent figure washing the stage and said  under her breath     what is it you know  walter plinge .  what is it you   ve seen .            wasn   t it amazing .  .     said christine  sitting up in bed .  her nightdress  agnes had noted  was white .  and extremely lacy .      yes  indeed     said agnes .      five curtain calls .  .  mr .  bucket says that   s more than anyone   s ever had since dame gigli .  .  i   m sure i won   t be able to sleep for the excitement .  .         so you just drink up that lovely hot milk drink i   ve done for us     said agnes .     it took me ages to carry the saucepan up those stairs .         and the flowers .  .     said christine  ignoring the mug agnes had placed beside her .     they started arriving right after the performance  mr .  bucket said .  .  he said        there was a soft knock at the door .   christine adjusted her dress .      come .  .      the door opened and walter plinge shuffled in  hidden under the bouquets of flowers .   after a few steps he stumbled on his own feet  plunged forward  and dropped them .  then he stared at the two girls in mute embarrassment  turned suddenly  and walked into the door .   christine giggled .      sorry mu miss     said walter .      thank you  walter     said agnes .   the door closed .      isn   t he strange .  .  have you seen the way he stares at me .  .  do you think you could find some water for these  perdita .  .         certainly  christine .  it   s only seven flights of stairs .         and as a reward i shall drink this lovely drink you have made for me .  .  has it got spices in it .         oh .  yes .  spices     said agnes .      it   s not like one of those potions your witches cook up  is it .  .         er  no     said agnes .  after all  everyone in lancre used fresh herbs .     er   there   s not going to be anything like enough vases for them all  even if i use the guzunder           the what .  .         the   you know .  it   s goes under   the bed .  guzunder .         you   re so funny .  .         there won   t be  anyway     said agnes  blushing hotly .  behind her eyes  perdita committed murder .      then put in all the ones from the earls and knights and i shall see to the others tomorrow .     said christine  picking up the drink .   agnes picked up the kettle and started toward the door .      perdita  dear .     said christine  the mug halfway to her lips .   agnes turned .      it did seem to me you were singing the teensiest bit loud  dear .  i   m sure it must have been a little difficult for everyone to hear me .         sorry  christine     said agnes .   she walked down in darkness .  tonight there was a candle burning in a niche on every second landing .  without them the stairs would have been merely dark  with them  shadows crept and leapt at every corner .   she reached the pump in the little alcove by the stage manager   s office  and filled the kettle .   out on the stage  someone began to sing .   it was peccadillo   s part of a duet of three hours earlier  but sung without music and in a tenor voice of such tone and purity that the kettle dropped out of agnes   s hand and spilled cold water over her feet .   she listened for a while  and then realized that she was singing the soprano part under her breath .   the song came to an end .  she could hear  far off  the hollow sound of footsteps retreating in the distance .   she ran to the door to the stage  paused a moment  and then opened it and went forward and out onto the huge dim emptiness .  the candles left burning were as much illumination as stars on a clear night .  there was no one there .   she walked into the center of the stage  and stopped  and caught her breath at the shock .   she could feel the auditorium in front of her  the huge empty space making the sound that velvet would make if it could snore .   it wasn   t silence .  a stage is never silent .  it was the noise produced by a million other sounds that have never quite died away   the thunder of applause  the overtures  the arias .  they poured down   fragments of tunes  lost chords  snatches of song .   she stepped back  and trod on someone   s foot .   agnes spun around .     andr    there   s no        someone crouched back .     sorry miss .      agnes breathed out .     walter .         sorry miss .         it   s all right .  you just startled me .         didn   t see you miss .      walter was holding something .  to agnes   s amazement  the darker shape in the darkness was a cat  flopped over walter   s arms like an old rug and purring happily .  it was like seeing someone poking their arm into a mincing machine to find out what was jamming it .      that   s greebo  isn   t it .         he   s a happy cat .  he   s full of milk .         walter  why   re you in the middle of the stage in the dark when everyone   s gone home .         what were you doing miss .      it was the first time she   d heard walter ask a question .  and he   s sort of a janitor  after all  she told herself .  he   s allowed to go anywhere .      i   got lost     she said  ashamed at the lie .     i   i   ll be going up to my room now .  er .  did you hear someone singing .         all the time miss .         i meant just now .         just now i   m talking to you miss .         oh           g   night miss .      she walked through the soft warm gloom to the backstage door  resisting at every step the urge to look round .  she collected the kettle and hurried up the stairs .   behind her  on the stage  walter carefully lowered greebo to the floor  took off his beret  and removed something white and papery from inside it .      what shall we listen to  mister cat .  i know  we shall listen to the overture to die flederleiv by j .  q .  bubbla  cond .  vochua doinov .      greebo gave him the fat cheeked look of a cat prepared to put up with practically anything for food .   and walter sat down beside him and listened to the music coming out of the walls .      when agnes got back to the room christine was already fast asleep  snoring the snore of those in herbal heaven .  the mug lay by the bed .   it wasn   t a bad thing to do  agnes reassured herself .  christine probably needed a good night   s sleep .  it was practically a kindly act .   she turned her attention to the flowers .  there were quite a lot of roses and orchids .  most of them had cards attached .  many aristocratic men apparently appreciated good singing or  at least  good singing that appeared to come from a face like christine   s .   agnes arranged the flowers lancre fashion  which was to hold the pot with one hand and the bouquet in the other and forcibly bring the two into conjunction .   the last bunch was the smallest  and wrapped in red paper .  there was no card .  in fact  there were no flowers .   someone had merely wrapped up half a dozen blackened and spindly rose stems and then  for some reason  sprayed them with scent .  it was musky and rather pleasant  but a bad joke all the same .  she threw them in the bin with the rubbish  blew out the candle  and sat down to wait .   she wasn   t certain for whom .  or what .   after a minute or two she was aware that there was a glow coming from the waste bin .  it was the barest fluorescence  like a sick glowworm  but it was there .   she crawled across the floor and peered in .   there were rosebuds on the dead sticks  transparent as glass  visible only by the glimmer on the edge of each petal .  they flickered like marsh lights .   agnes lifted them out carefully and fumbled in the darkness for the empty mug .  it wasn   t the best of vases  but it would have to do .  then she sat and watched the ghostly flowers until        someone coughed .  she jerked her head up  aware that she   d fallen asleep .         madam .         sir .  .      the voice was melodious .  it suggested that  at any minute  it might break into song .      attend .  tomorrow you must sing the part of laura in il truccatore .  we have much to do .  one night is barely enough .  the aria in act one will occupy much of our time .      there was a brief passage of violin music .      your performance tonight was   good .  but there are areas that we must build upon .  attend .         did you send the roses .  .         you like the roses .  they bloom only in darkness .         who are you .  .  was it you i heard singing just now .  .      there was silence for a moment .      yes .      then      let us examine the role of laura in il truccatore       the master of disguise     also sometimes vulgarly known as    the man with a thousand faces              when the witches arrived at goatberger   s offices next morning they found a very large troll sitting on the stairs .  it had a club across its knees and held up a shovel sized hand to prevent them going any farther .      no one   s allowed in     it said .     mr .  goatberger is in a meetin    .         how long is this meetin    going to be .     said granny .      mr .  goatberger is a very elongated meeter .      granny gave the troll an appraising stare .     you been in publishin    long .     she said .      since dis mornin        said the troll proudly .      mr .  goatberger gave you the job .         yup .  come up quarry lane and picked me special for         the troll   s brow creased as it tried to remember the unfamiliar words         the fast track inna fast movin    worlda publishin    .         and what exactly is your job .            ead    itter .            scuse me     said nanny  pushing forward .     i   d know that strata anywhere .  you   re from copperhead in lancre  ain   t you .         so what .         we   re from lancre  too .         yeah .         this is granny weatherwax  you know .      the troll gave her a disbelieving grin  and then its brow corrugated again  and then it looked at granny .   she nodded .      the one you boys call aaoograha hoa  you know .     said nanny .        she who must be avoided    .      the troll looked at its club as if seriously considering the possibility of beating itself to death .   granny patted it on the lichen encrusted shoulder .     what   s your name  lad .         carborundum  miss     it mumbled .  one of its legs began to tremble .      well  i   m sure you   re going to make a good life for yourself here in the big city     said granny .      yes  why don   t you go and start now .     said nanny .   the troll gave her a grateful look and fled  without even bothering to open the door .      do they really call me that .     said granny .      er .  yes     said nanny  kicking herself .     it   s a mark of respect  of course .         oh .         er           i   ve always done my best to get along with trolls  you know that .         oh  yes .         how about the dwarfs .     said granny  as someone might who had found a hitherto unsuspected boil and couldn   t resist poking it .     have they got a name for me  too .         let   s go and see mr .  goatberger  shall we .     said nanny brightly .      gytha .         er   well   i think it   s k   ez   rek d   b   duz     said nanny .      what does that mean .         er      go around the other side of the mountain        said nanny .      oh .      granny was uncharacteristically silent as they made their way up the stairs .   nanny didn   t bother to knock .  she opened the door and said     coo ee  mr .  goatberger .  it   s us again  just like you said .  oh  i shouldn   t try to get out of the window like that   you   re three flights up and that bag of money is a bit dangerous if you   re climbing around .      the man edged around the room so that his desk was between him and the witches .      wasn   t there a troll downstairs .     he said .      it   s decided to break out of publishing     said nanny .  she sat down and gave him a big smile .     i    spect you   ve got some money for us .      mr .  goatberger realized that he was trapped .  his face contorted into a series of twisted expressions as he experimented with some replies .  then he smiled as widely as nanny and sat down opposite her .      of course  things are very difficult at the moment     he said .     in fact i can   t recall a worse time     he added  with considerable honesty .   he looked at granny   s face .  his grin stayed where it was but the rest of his face began to edge away .      people just don   t seem to be buying books     he said .     and the cost of the etchings  well  it   s wicked .         everyone i knows buys the almanack     said granny .     i reckon everyone in lancre buys your almanack .  everyone in the whole ramtops buys the almanack  even the dwarfs .  that   s a lot of half dollars .  and gytha   s book seems to be doing very well .         well  of course  i   m glad it   s so popular  but what with distribution  paying the peddlers  the wear and tear on           your almanack will last a household all winter  with care     said granny .     providing no one   s ill and the paper   s nice and thin .         my son jason buys two copies     said nanny .     of course  he   s got a big family .  the privy door never stops swinging           yes but  you see  the point is   i don   t actually have to pay you anything     said mr .  goatberger  trying to ignore this .  his smile had the face all to itself now .     you paid me to print it  and i gave you your money back .  in fact i think our accounts department made a slight error in your favor  but i won   t        his voice trailed away .   granny weatherwax was unfolding a sheet of paper .     these predictions for next year       she said .      where   d you get that .         i borrowed it .  you can have it back if you like           well  what about them .         they   re wrong .         what do you mean  they   re wrong .  they   re predictions .         i don   t see there being a rain of curry in klatch next may .  you don   t get curry that early .         you know about the predictions business .     said goatberger .     you .  i   ve been printing predictions for years .         i don   t do clever stuff for years ahead  like you do     granny admitted .     but i   m pretty accurate if you want a thirty second one .         indeed .  what   s going to happen in thirty seconds .      granny told him .   goatberger roared with laughter .     oh  yes  that   s a good one  you should be writing them for us .     he said .     oh  my word .  nothing like being ambitious  eh .  that   s better than the spontaneous combustion of the bishop of quirm  and that didn   t even happen .  in thirty seconds  eh .         no .         no .         twenty one seconds now     said granny .      mr .  bucket had arrived at the opera house early to see if anyone had died so far today .   he made it as far as his office without a single body dropping out of the shadows .   he really hadn   t expected it to be like this .  he   d liked opera .  it had all seemed so artistic .  he   d watched hundreds of operas and practically no one had died  except once during the ballet scene in la triviata when a ballerina had rather over enthusiastically been flung into the lap of an elderly gentleman in the front row of the stalls .  she hadn   t been hurt  but the old man had died in one incredibly happy instant .   someone knocked at the door .   mr .  bucket opened it about a quarter of an inch .     who   s dead .     he said .      n   no one mr .  bucket .  i   ve got your letters .         oh  it   s you  walter .  thank you .      he took the bundle and shut the door .   there were bills .  there were always bills .  the opera house practically runs itself  they   d told him .  well  yes  but it practically ran on money .  he rummaged through the let     there was an envelope with the opera house crest on it .   he looked at it like a man looks at a very fierce dog on a very thin leash .   it did nothing except lie there and look as gummed as an envelope can be .   finally he disembowelled it with the paper knife and then flung it down on the desk again  as if it would bite .   when it did not do so he reached out hesitantly and withdrew the folded letter .  it read as follows       my dear bucket    i should be most grateful if christine sings the role of laura tonight .  i assure you she is more than capable .   the second violinist is a little slow  i feel  and the second act last night was frankly extremely wooden .  this really is not good enough .   may i extend my own welcome to se  or basilica .  i congratulate you on his arrival .     wishing you the very best   the opera ghost       mr .  salzella .      salzella was eventually located .  he read the note .     you do not intend to accede to this .     he said .      she does sing superbly  salzella .         you mean the nitt girl .         well   yes   you know what i mean .         but this is nothing less than blackmail .         is it .  he   s not actually threatening anything .         you let her   i mean them  of course   you let them sing last night  and much good it did poor dr .  undershaft .         what do you advise  then .      there was another series of disjointed knocks on the door .      come in  walter     said bucket and salzella together .   walter jerked in  holding the coal scuttle .      i   ve been to see commander vimes of the city watch     said salzella .     he said he   ll have some of his best men here tonight .  undercover .         i thought you said they were all incompetent .      salzella shrugged .     we   ve got to do this properly .  did you know dr .  undershaft was strangled before he was hung .         hanged     said bucket  without thinking .     men are hanged .  it   s dead meat that   s hung .         indeed .     said salzella .     i appreciate the information .  well  poor old undershaft was strangled  apparently .  and then he was hung .         really  salzella  you do have a misplaced sense           i   ve finished now mr .  bucket .         yes  thank you  walter .  you may go .         yes mr .  bucket .      walter closed the door behind him  very conscientiously .      i   m afraid it   s working here     said salzella .     if you don   t find some way of dealing with   are you all right  mr .  bucket .         what .     bucket  who   d been staring at the closed door  shook his head .     oh .  yes .  er .  walter           what about him .         he   s   all right  is he .         oh  he   s got his   funny little ways .  he   s harmless enough  if that   s what you mean .  some of the stagehands and musicians are a bit cruel to him   you know  sending him out for a tin of invisible paint or a bag of nail holes and so on .  he believes what he   s told .  why .         oh   i just wondered .  silly  really .         i suppose he is  technically .         no  i meant   oh  it doesn   t matter           granny weatherwax and nanny ogg left goatberger   s office and walked demurely down the street .  at least .  granny walked demurely .  nanny leaned somewhat .   every thirty seconds she   d say     how much was that again .         three thousand  two hundred and seventy dollars and eighty seven pence     said granny .  she was looking thoughtful .      i thought it was nice of him to look in all the ashtrays for all the odd coppers he could round up     said nanny .     those he could reach  anyway .  how much was that again .         three thousand  two hundred and seventy dollars and eighty seven pence .         i   ve never had seventy dollars before     said nanny .      i didn   t say just seventy dollars  i said           yes  i know .  but i   m working my way up to it gradual .  i   ll say this about money .  it really chafes .         i don   t know why you have to keep your purse in your knicker leg     said granny .      it   s the last place anybody would look .     nanny sighed .     how much did you say it was .         three thousand  two hundred and seventy dollars and eighty seven pence .         i   m going to need a bigger tin .         you   re going to need a bigger chimney .         i could certainly do with a bigger knicker leg .     she nudged granny .     you   re going to have to be polite to me now i   m rich     she said .      yes  indeed     said granny  with a faraway look in her eyes .     don   t think i   m not considering that .      she stopped .  nanny walked into her  with a tinkle of lingerie .   the frontage of the opera house loomed over them .      we   ve got to get back in there     granny said .     and into box eight .         crowbar     said nanny  firmly .     a no .    claw end should do it .         we   re not your nev     said granny .     anyway  breaking in wouldn   t be the same thing .  we   ve got to have a right to be there .         cleaners     said nanny .     we could be cleaners  and   no     s not right me being a cleaner now  in my position .         no  we can   t have that  with you in your position .      granny glanced down at nanny as a coach pulled up outside the opera house .     o    course     she said  artfulness dripping off her voice like toffee     we could always buy box eight .         wouldn   t work     said nanny .  people were hurrying down the steps with the cuff adjusting  sticky looks of welcoming committees everywhere .     they   re scared of selling it .         why not .     said granny .     there   s people dying and the opera goes on .  that means someone   s prepared to sell his own grandmother if he   d make enough money .         it   d cost a fortune  anyway     said nanny .   she looked at granny   s triumphant expression and groaned .     oh  esme .  i was going to save that money for me old age .     she thought for a moment .     anyway  it still wouldn   t work .  i mean  look at us  we don   t look like the right kind of people        enrico basilica got out of the coach .      but we know the right kind of people     said granny .      oh  esme .         the shop bell tinkled in a refined tone  as if it were embarrassed to do something as vulgar as ring .  it would have much preferred to give a polite cough .   this was ankh morpork   s most prestigious dress shop  and one way of telling was the apparent absence of anything so crass as merchandise .  the occasional carefully placed piece of expensive material merely hinted at the possibilities available .   this was not a shop where things were bought .  this was an emporium where you had a cup of coffee and a chat .  possibly  as a result of that muted conversation  four or five yards of exquisite fabric would change ownership in some ethereal way  and yet nothing so crass as trade would have taken place .      shop .     yelled nanny .   a lady appeared from behind a curtain and observed the visitors  quite possibly with her nose .      have you come to the right entrance .     she said .  madame dawning had been brought up to be polite to servants and tradespeople  even when they were as scruffy as these two old crows .      my friend here wants a new dress     said the dumpier of the two .     one of the nobby ones with a train and a padded bum .         in black     said the thin one .      and we wants all the trimmings     said the dumpy one .     little handbag onna string  pair of glasses onna stick  the whole thing .         i think perhaps that might be a leetle more than you   re thinking of spending     said madame dawning .      how much is a leetle .     said the dumpy one .      i mean that this is rather a select dress shop .         that   s why we   re here .  we don   t want rubbish .  my name   s nanny ogg and this here is   lady esmerelda weatherwax .      madame dawning regarded lady esmerelda quizzically .  there was no doubt that the woman had a certain bearing .  and she stared like a duchess .      from lancre     said nanny ogg .     and she could have a conservatory if she liked  but she doesn   t want one .         er       madame dawning decided to play along for a while .     what style were you considering .         something nobby     said nanny ogg .      i perhaps would like a leetle more guidance than that           perhaps you could show us some things     said lady esmerelda  sitting down .     it   s for the opera .         oh  you patronize the opera .         lady esmerelda patronizes everything     said nanny ogg stoutly .   madame dawning had a manner peculiar to her class and upbringing .  she   d been raised to see the world in a certain way .  when it didn   t act in that certain way she wobbled a bit but  like a gyroscope  eventually recovered and went on spinning just as if it had .  if civilization were to collapse totally and the survivors were reduced to eating cockroaches  madame dawning would still use a napkin and look down on people who ate their cockroaches the wrong way around .      i will  er  show you some examples     she said .     excuse me one moment .      she scuttled into the long workrooms behind the shop  where there was considerably less gilt  and leaned against the wall and summoned her chief seamstress .      mildred  there are two very strange        she stopped .  they   d followed her .   they were wandering down the aisle between the rows of dressmakers  nodding at people and inspecting some of the dresses on the dummies .   she hurried back .     i   m sure you   d prefer           how much is this one .     said lady esmerelda  fingering a creation intended for the dowager duchess of quirm .      i am afraid that one is not for sale           how much would it be if it was for sale .         three hundred dollars  i believe     said madame dawning .      five hundred seems about right     said lady esmerelda .      does it .     said nanny ogg .     oh  it does  does it .      the dress was black .  at least  in theory it was black .  it was black in the same way that a starling   s wing is black .  it was black silk  with jet beads and sequins .  it was black on holiday .      it looks about my size .  we   ll take it .  pay the woman  gytha .      madame   s gyroscope precessed rapidly .     take it .  now .  five hundred dollars .  pay .  pay now .  cash .         see to it  gytha .         oh  all right .      nanny ogg turned away modestly and raised her skirt .  there was a series of rustlings and elasticated twangings  and then she turned around  holding a bag .   she counted out fifty rather warm ten dollar pieces into madame dawning   s unprotesting hand .      and now we   ll go back into the shop and have a poke around for the other stuff     said lady esmerelda .     i fancy ostrich feathers myself .  and one of those big cloaks the ladies wear .  and one of those fans edged with lace .         why don   t we get some great big diamonds while we   re about it .     said nanny ogg sharply .      good idea .      madame dawning could hear them bickering as they ambled away up the aisle .   she looked down at the money in her hand .   she knew about old money  which was somehow hallowed by the fact that people had hung on to it for years  and she knew about new money  which seemed to be being made by all these upstarts that were flooding into the city these days .  but under her powdered bosom she was an ankh morpork shopkeeper  and knew that the best kind of money was the sort that was in her hand rather than someone else   s .  the best kind of money was mine  not yours .   besides  she was also enough of a snob to confuse rudeness with good breeding .  in the same way that the really rich can never be mad  they   re eccentric   so they can also never be rude  they   re outspoken and forthright  .   she hurried after lady esmerelda and her rather strange friend .  salt of the earth  she told herself .   she was in time to overhear a mysterious conversation .      i   m being punished  ain   t i  esme .         can   t imagine what you   re talking about  gytha .         just    cos i had my little moment .         i really don   t follow you .  anyway  you said you were at your wits    end with thinking what you   d do with the money .         yes  but i   d have quite liked to have been at my wits    end on a big comfy chase longyou somewhere with lots of big strong men buyin    me chocolates and pressin    their favors on me .         money don   t buy happiness  gytha .         i only wanted to rent it for a few weeks .         agnes rose late  the music still ringing in her ears  and dressed in a dream .  but she hung a bed sheet over the mirror first  just in case .   there were half a dozen of the chorus dancers in the canteen  sharing a stick of celery and giggling .   and there was andr   .  he was eating something absentmindedly while staring at a sheet of music .  occasionally he   d wave his spoon in the air with a faraway look on his face  and then put it down and make a few notes .   in mid beat he caught sight of agnes  and grinned .     hello .  you look tired .         er   yes .         you   ve missed all the excitement .         have i .         the watch have been here  talking to everyone and asking lots of questions and writing things down very slowly .         what sort of questions .         well  knowing the watch  probably    was it you what did it  then .     they   re rather slow thinkers .         oh dear .  does that mean tonight   s performance is canceled .      andr   laughed .  he had a rather pleasant laugh .     i don   t think mr .  bucket could possibly cancel it .     he said .     even if people are dropping likes flies out of the flies .         why not .         people have been queuing for tickets .         why .      he told her .      that   s disgusting .     said agnes .     you mean they   re coming because it might be dangerous .         human nature  i   m afraid .  of course  some of them want to hear enrico basilica .  and   well   christine seems popular       he gave her a sorrowful look .      i don   t mind  honestly     lied agnes .     um   how long have you worked here  andre .         er   only a few months .  i   used to teach music to the seriph   s children in klatch .         um   what do you think about the ghost .      he shrugged .     just some kind of madman  i suppose .         um   do you know if he sings .  i mean  is good at singing .         i heard that he sends little critiques to the manager .  some of the girls say they   ve heard someone singing in the night  but they   re always saying silly things .         um   are there any secret passages here .      he looked at her with his head on one side .     who   ve you been talking to .         sorry .         the girls say there are .  of course  they say they see the ghost all the time .  and sometimes in two places at once .         why should they see him more .         perhaps he just likes looking at young ladies .  they   re always practicing in odd corners .  besides  they   re all half crazed with hunger anyway .         aren   t you interested in the ghost .  people have been killed .         well  people are saying it might have been dr .  undershaft .         but he was killed .         he might have hanged himself .  he   d been very depressed lately .  and he   d always been a bit strange .  nervy .  it   s going to be a bit difficult without him  though .  here  i   ve brought you a stack of old programs .  some of the notes may help  since you haven   t been in the opera long .      agnes stared at them  unseeing .   people were disappearing and the first thought that everyone had was that it was going to be inconvenient without them .   the show must go on .  everyone said that .  people said it all the time .  often they smiled when they said it  but they were serious all the same  under the smile .  no one ever said why .  but yesterday  when the chorus had been arguing about the money  everyone knew that they weren   t actually going to refuse to sing .  it was all a game .   the show went on .  she   d heard all the stories .  she   d heard about shows continuing while fire raged around the city  while a dragon was roosting on the roof  while there was rioting in the streets outside .  scenery collapsed .  the show went on .  leading tenor died .  then appeal to the audience for any student of music who knew the part  and give him his big chance while his predecessor   s body cooled gently in the wings .  why .  it was only a performance  for heaven   s sake .  it wasn   t like something important .  but   the show goes on .  everyone took this so much for granted that they didn   t even think about it anymore  as though there were fog in their heads .   on the other hand   someone was teaching her to sing at night .  a mysterious person sang songs on the stage when everyone had gone home .  she tried to think of that voice belonging to someone who killed people .  it didn   t work .  maybe she   d caught some of the fog and didn   t want it to work .  what sort of person could have that feel for music and kill people .   she   d been idly turning the pages of an old program and a name caught her eye .   she quickly shuffled through the others beneath .  there it was again .  not in every performance  and never in a major role  but it was there .  generally it played an innkeeper or a servant .      walter plinge .     she said .     walter .  but   he doesn   t sing  does he .      she held up a program and pointed .      what .  oh  no .     andr   laughed .     good heavens   it   s a   a kind of convenient name  i suppose .  sometimes someone has to sing a very minor part   perhaps a singer is in a role that they   d rather not be remembered in   well  here  they just go down on the program as walter plinge .  lots of theaters have a useful name like that .  like a .  n .  other .  it   s convenient for everyone .         but   walter plinge .         well  i suppose it started as a joke .  i mean  can you imagine walter plinge onstage .     andr   grinned .     in that little beret he wears .         what does he think about it .         i don   t think he minds .  it   s hard to tell  isn   t it .      there was a crash from the direction of the kitchen  although it was really more of a crashendo   the long drawn out clatter that begins when a pile of plates begins to slip  continues when someone tries to grab at them  develops a desperate counter theme when the person realizes they don   t have three hands  and ends with the roinroinroin of the one miraculously intact plate spinning around and around on the floor .   they heard an irate female voice .      walter plinge .         sorry mrs .  clamp .         damn thing keeps holding onto the edge of the pan .  let go  you wretched insect        there was the sound of crockery being swept up  and then a rubbery noise that could approximately be described as a spoing .      now where   s it gone .         don   t know mrs .  clamp .         and what   s that cat doing in here .      andr   turned back to agnes and flashed her a sad smile .     it is a little cruel  i suppose     he said .     the poor chap is a bit daft .         i   m not at all sure     said agnes     that i   ve met anyone here who isn   t .      he grinned again .     i know     he said .      i mean  everyone acts as if it   s only the music that matters .  the plots don   t make sense .  half the stories rely on people not recognizing their servants or wives because they   ve got a tiny mask on .  large ladies play the part of consumptive girls .  no one can act properly .  no wonder everyone accepts me singing for christine   that   s practically normal compared to opera .  it   s an operatic kind of idea .  there should be a sign on the door saying    leave your common sense here    .  if it wasn   t for the music the whole thing would be ridiculous .      she realized he was looking at her with an opera face .      of course  that   s it  isn   t it .  it is the show that matters  isn   t it .     she said .     it   s all show .         it   s not meant to be real     said andr   .     it   s not like theater .  no one   s saying     you   ve got to pretend this is a big battlefield and that guy in the cardboard crown is really a king .     the plot   s only there to fill in time before the next song .      he leaned forward and took her hand .     this must be wretched for you     he said .   no male had ever touched agnes before  except perhaps to push her over and steal her sweets .   she pulled her hand away .      i  er  better go and practice     she said  feeling the blush start .      you really picked up the role of iodine very well     said andr   .      i  er  have a private tutor     said agnes .      then he   s really studied opera  that   s all i can say .         i   think he has .            esme .         yes  gytha .         it   s not that i   m complaining or anything           yes .            but why isn   t it me who   s being the posh opera patronizer .         because you   re as common as muck  gytha .         oh .  right .     nanny subjected this statement to some thought and couldn   t see any point of inaccuracy that would sway a jury .     fair enough .         it   s not as though i like this .         shall i do madam   s feet .     said the manicurist .  she stared at granny   s boots and wondered if it might be necessary to use a hammer .      i got to admit  it   s a nice hair style     said nanny .      madam has marvelous hair     said the hairdresser .     what is the secret .         you   ve got to make sure there   s no newts in the water     said granny .  she looked at her reflection in the mirror over the washbasin  and went to look away   and then sneaked another glance .  her lips pursed .     hmm     she said .   at the other end  the manicurist had succeeded in getting granny   s boots and socks off .  much to her amazement there was revealed  instead of the corned and bunioned monstrosities she   d been expecting  a pair of perfect feet .  she didn   t know where to start because there was nowhere to begin  but this manicure was costing twenty dollars and in those circumstances you damn well find something to do .   nanny sat beside their pile of packages and tried to work everything out on a scrap of paper .  she didn   t have granny   s gift for numbers .  they tended to writhe under her gaze and add themselves up wrong .      esme .  i reckon we   ve spent   probably more   n a thousand dollars so far  and that   s not including hirin    the coach  and we haven   t paid mrs .  palm for the room .         you said nothing was too much trouble to help a lancre girl     said granny .   but i didn   t say nothing was too much money  thought nanny  and then scolded herself for thinking like that .  but she was definitely feeling a little lighter in the underwear regions .   there seemed to be a general consensus among the artisans of beauty that they   d done what they could .  granny swiveled the chair around .      what do you think .     she said .   nanny ogg stared .  she   d seen many strange things in her life  some of them twice .  she   d seen elves and walking stones and the shoeing of a unicorn .  she   d had a farmhouse dropped on her head .  but she   d never seen granny weatherwax in rouge .   all her normal expletives of shock and surprise fused instantly  and she found herself resorting to an ancient curse belonging to her grandmother .      well  i   ll be mogadored .     she said .      madam has extremely good skin     said the cosmetics lady .      i know     said granny .     can   t seem to do anything about it .         i   ll be mogadored .     said nanny again .      powder and paint     said granny .     huh .  just another kind of mask .  oh  well .     she gave the hairdresser a dreadful smile .     how much do we owe you .     she said .      er   thirty dollars .     said the hairdresser .     that is           give the w   man thirty dollars and another twenty to make up for his trouble     said granny  clutching at her head .      fifty dollars .  you could buy a shop for           gytha .         oh  all right .     scuse me  i   m just going to the bank .      she turned away demurely  raised the hem of her skirt        twangtwingtwongtwang        and turned back with a handful of coins .      there you go  my good wo   sir     she said sourly .   there was a coach waiting outside .  it was the best granny had been able to hire with nanny   s money .  a footman held open the door as nanny helped her friend aboard .      we   ll go straight to mrs .  palm   s so   s i can change     said granny as they pulled away .     and then to the opera house .  we ain   t got much time .         are you all right .         never felt better .     granny patted her hair .     gytha ogg  you wouldn   t be a witch if you couldn   t jump to conclusions  right .      nanny nodded .     oh  yes .     there was no shame in it .  sometimes there wasn   t time to do anything else but take a flying leap .  sometimes you had to trust to experience and intuition and general awareness and take a running jump .  nanny herself could clear quite a tall conclusion from a standing start .      so i   ve no doubt at all that there   s some kind of idea floating around in your mind about this ghost           well   sort of an idea  yes           a name  perhaps .      nanny shifted uncomfortably  and not only because of the money bags under her skirt .      i got to admit something crossed my mind .  a kind of   feeling .  i mean  you never can tell        granny nodded .     yes .  it   s all neat  isn   t it .  it   s a lie .         you said last night you saw the whole thing .         it   s still a lie .  like the lie about masks .         what lie about masks .         the way people say they hide faces .         they do hide faces     said nanny ogg .      only the one on the outside .         no one took much notice of agnes .  the stage was being set for the new performance tonight .  the orchestra was rehearsing .  the ballerinas had been herded into their practice room .  in various other rooms people were singing at cross purposes .  but no one seemed to want her to do anything .   i   m just a wandering voice  she thought .   she climbed the stairs to her room and sat on the bed .  the curtains were still drawn and  in the gloom  the strange roses glowed .  she had rescued them from the bin because they were beautiful  but  in a way  she   d have been happier if they weren   t there .  then she could have believed she   d imagined the whole thing .   there was no sound from christine   s room .  telling herself that it was really her room anyway  and christine had just been allowed to borrow it  agnes went in .   it was a mess .  christine had got up  got dressed   either that or a thorough but overenthusiastic burglar had gone through every drawer in the place   and gone .  the bouquets that agnes had put into whatever receptacles she could find last night were where she had left them .  the others were where she had left them  too  and they were already dying .   she caught herself wondering where she could find some jars and pots for them  and hated herself for it .  it was as bad as saying    poot .     you might as well paint welcome on yourself and lie down on the doorstep of the universe .  it was no fun at all  having a wonderful personality .  oh   and good hair .   and then she went and found pots for them anyway .   the mirror dominated the room .  it seemed to grow a little larger each time she looked at it .   all right .  she had to know  didn   t she .   heart pounding  she felt around the edges of it .  there was a little raised area that might have looked like part of the frame  but as her fingers moved across it there was a    click    and the mirror swung inward a fraction of an inch .  when she pushed at it  it moved .   she breathed out .  and stepped in .         it   s disgusting .     said salzella .     it   s pandering to the most depraved taste .      mr .  bucket shrugged .     it   s not as though we   re putting    good chance of seeing someone throttled on stage    on the posters     he said .     but news has got around .  people like   drama .         you mean the watch didn   t want us to shut down .         no .  they just said we should mount guards like last night and they   d take steps .         steps to the nearest place of safety  no doubt .         i don   t like it any more than you do  but it   s gone too far .  we need the watch now .  anyway  there   d be a riot if we closed .  ankh morpork has always enjoyed   excitement .  we   re completely sold out .  the show must go on .         oh  yes     said salzella nastily .     would you like me to slit a few throats in the second act .  just so no one feels disappointed .         of course not     said bucket .     we don   t want any deaths .  but        the    but    hung in the air like the late dr .  undershaft .   salzella threw up his hands .      anyway  i believe we are past the worst     said mr .  bucket .      i hope so     said salzella .      where   s se  or basilica .     said bucket .      mrs .  plinge is showing him his dressing room .         mrs .  plinge hasn   t been murdered .         no  no one has been found dead so far today     said salzella .      that is good news .         yes  and it must be  oh  at least ten past twelve     said salzella with an irony that bucket quite failed to notice .     i will go and fetch him up so that we can have lunch  shall i .  it must be a good half an hour since he had a snack .      bucket nodded .  after the director had gone he surreptitiously checked his desk drawers again .  there was no letter .  perhaps it was over   perhaps it was true what they were saying about the late doctor .   someone knocked at the door  four times .  only one person could achieve four knocks without any rhythm whatsoever .      come in  walter .      walter plinge stumbled into the room .     there   s a lady .     he said .     she   s to see mr .  bucket .      nanny ogg poked her head around the door .     coo ee     she said .     it   s only me .         it   s   mrs .  ogg  isn   t it .     said mr .  bucket .   there was something slightly worrying about the woman .  he didn   t recall her name on the list of employees .  on the other hand  she was clearly around the place  she wasn   t dead  and she made a decent cup of tea  so was it his worry if she wasn   t getting paid .      good gracious  i   m not the lady     said nanny ogg .     i   m as common as muck  me  on the highest authority .  no  she   s waiting down in the foyer .  i thought i   d better nip around here and warn you .         warn me .  warn me about what .  i don   t have any other appointments this morning .  who is this lady .         have you ever heard of lady esmerelda weatherwax .         no .  should i .         famous patron of the opera .  conservatories all over the place     said nanny .     pots of money  too .         really .  but i   m due to        bucket looked out of the window .  there was a coach and four horses outside .  it had so much rococo ornamentation on it that it was surprising it ever managed to move .      well  i       he began again .     it is really very incon           she ain   t the sort of person who likes to be kept waiting     said nanny  with absolute honesty .  and then  because granny had been getting on her nerves all morning and the initial embarrassment at mrs .  palm   s still rankled and there was a streak of mischief in nanny a mile wide  she added     they say she was a famous courtesan in her younger days .  they say she didn   t like to be kept waiting then  either .  retired now  of course .  so they say .         you know  i   ve visited most of the major opera houses and i   ve never heard the name     mused bucket .      ah  i heard she likes to keep her donations secret     said nanny .   mr .  bucket   s mental compass once again swung around to point due money .      you   d better show her up     he said .     i could perhaps give her a few minutes           no one ever gave lady esmerelda less than half an hour     said nanny  and gave bucket a wink .     i   ll go and fetch her  shall i .      she bustled away  towing walter behind her .   mr .  bucket stared after her .  then  after a moment   s thought  he got up and checked the set of his mustache in the mirror over the fireplace .   he heard the door open and turned with his finest smile in place .   it faded only slightly at the sight of salzella  ushering the impressive bulk of basilica in front of him .  the little manager and interpreter fussed along beside him  like a tugboat .      ah  se  or basilica     said bucket .     i trust the dressing rooms are to your satisfaction .      basilica gave him a blank smile while the interpreter spoke in brindisian  and then replied .      se  or basilica says they are fine but the larder isn   t big enough     he said .      haha     said bucket  and then stopped when no one else laughed .      in fact     he said hurriedly     se  or basilica will i   m sure be very happy to hear that our kitchens have made a special effort to        there was another knock at the door .  he hurried across and opened it .   granny weatherwax stood there  but not for long .  she pushed him aside and swept into the room .   there was a choking noise from enrico basilica .      which one of you is bucket .     she demanded .      er   me        granny removed a glove and extended her hand .     so sorry     she said .     ai am not used to important people opening their own doors .  ai am esmerelda weatherwax .         how charming .  i   ve heard so much about you     lied bucket .     pray let me introduce you .  no doubt you know se  or basilica .         of course     said granny  looking henry slugg in the eye .     i   m sure se  or basilica recalls the many happy times we   ve had in other opera houses whose names i can   t quite remember at the moment .      henry grimaced a smile  and said something to the interpreter .      that is astonishing     said the interpreter .     se  or basilica has just said how fondly he recalls meeting you many times before at opera houses that have just slipped his mind at present .      henry kissed granny   s hand  and looked up at her with pleading in his eyes .   my word  thought bucket  that look he   s giving her   i wonder if they ever        oh  uh  and this is mr .  salzella  our director of music     he said  remembering himself .      honored     said salzella  giving granny a firm handshake and looking her squarely in the eye .  she nodded .      and what   s the first thing you   d take out of a burning house  mr .  salzella .     she inquired .   he smiled politely .     what would you like me to take  madam .      she nodded thoughtfully and let go of his hand .      may i get you a drink .     said bucket .      a small sherry     said granny .   salzella sidled up to bucket as he was pouring the drink .     who the hell is she .         apparently she   s rolling in money     whispered bucket .     and very keen on opera .         never heard of her .         well  se  or basilica has  and that   s good enough for me .  make yourself pleasant to them  will you  while i try to sort out lunch .      he pulled open the door and tripped over nanny ogg .      sorry .     said nanny  standing up and giving him a cheerful grin .     these doorknobs are a bugger to polish  aren   t they .         er  mrs .            ogg .            ogg  could you run along to the kitchens and tell mrs .  clamp there will be another one for lunch  please .         right you are .      nanny bustled away .  bucket nodded approvingly .  what a reliable old lady  he thought .      it wasn   t exactly a secret .  when the room had been divided a space had been left between the walls .  at the far end it opened onto a staircase  a perfectly ordinary staircase  which even had some grubby daylight via a dirt encrusted window .   agnes was vaguely disappointed .  she had expected  well  a real secret passage  perhaps with a few torches flickering secretly in rather valuable secret wrought iron holders .  but the staircase had just been walled off from the rest of the place at some time .  it wasn   t secret   it had merely been forgotten .   there were cobwebs in the corners .  the cocoons of extinct flies hung down from the ceiling .  the air smelled of long dead birds .   but there was a clear track through the dust .  someone had used the stairs several times .   she hesitated between up and down  and headed up .  that was no great journey   after one more flight it ended at a trapdoor that wasn   t even bolted .   she pushed at it  and then blinked in the unaccustomed light .  wind caught at her hair .  a pigeon stared at her  and flew away as she poked her head into the fresh air .   the door had opened out onto the opera house   s roof  just one more item in a forest of sky lights and air shafts .   she went back inside and headed downward .  and became aware  as she did so  of the voices     the old stairs hadn   t been totally forgotten .  someone had at least seen their usefulness as an air shaft .  voices filtered up .  there were scales  distant music  snatches of conversation .  as she went down she passed through layers of noise  like a very carefully made sundae of sound .      greebo sat on top of the kitchen cupboard and watched the performance with interest .      use the ladle  why don   t you .     said a scene shifter .      it won   t reach .  walter .         yes mrs .  clamp .         give me that broom .         yes mrs .  clamp .      greebo looked up at the high ceiling  to which was affixed a sort of thin  ten pointed star .   in the middle of it was a pair of very frightened eyes .         plunge it into boiling water        said mrs .  clamp     that   s what it said in the cookbook .  it never said    watch out  it   ll grip the sides of the pot and spring straight up in the air           she flailed around with the broom handle .  the squid shrank back .      and that pasta   s all gone wrong     she muttered .     i   ve had it grilling for hours and it   s still hard as nails  the wretched stuff .         coo ee  it   s only me     said nanny ogg  poking her head around the door  and such was the all embracing nature of her personality that even those who didn   t know who she was took this on trust .     having a bit of trouble  are you .      she surveyed the scene  including the ceiling .  there was a smell of burning pasta in the air .      ah     she said .     this   d be the special lunch for senior basilica  would it .         it was meant to be     said the cook  still making ineffectual swipes .     blasted thing won   t come down  though .      other pots were simmering on the long iron range .  nanny nodded toward them .     what   s everyone else having .     she said .      mutton and clootie dumplings  with slumpie     said the cook .      ah .  good  honest food     said nanny  speaking of wall to wall suet oiled with lard .      and there   s supposed to be jammy devils for pudding and i   ve been so tied up with this wretched thing i haven   t even made a start .      nanny carefully took the broom out of the cook   s hands .     tell you what     she said     you make enough dumplings and slumpie for five people  and i   ll help by knocking up a quick pudding  how about that .         well  that   s a very handsome offer  mrs .            ogg .         the jam   s in the jar by           oh  i won   t bother about jam     said nanny .  she looked at the spice rack  grinned  and then stepped behind a table for modesty        twingtwangtwongtwang           got any chocolate .     she said  producing a slim volume .     i   ve got a recipe right here that might be fun        she licked her thumb and opened the book at page    .  chocolate delight with special secret sauce .   yes  thought nanny  that would be fun .   if people wanted to go around teaching people lessons  other people should remember that those people knew a thing or two about people .      scraps of conversation floated out of the walls as agnes wound her secret way down the forgotten stairs .   it was   thrilling .   no one was saying anything important .  there were no convenient guilty secrets .  there were just the sounds of people getting through the day .  but they were secret sounds .   it was wrong to listen  of course .   agnes had been brought up in the knowledge that a lot of things were wrong .  it was wrong to listen at doors  to look people directly in the eye  to talk out of turn  to answer back  to put yourself forward     but behind the walls she could be the perdita she   d always wanted to be .  perdita didn   t care about anything .  perdita got things done .  perdita could wear anything she wanted .  perdita x nitt  mistress of the darkness  magdalen of cool  could listen in to other people   s lives .  and never  ever have to have a wonderful personality .   agnes knew she should go back up to her room .  whatever lay in the increasingly shadowy depths was probably something she ought not to find .   perdita continued downward .  agnes went along for the ride .      the pre luncheon drinks were going quite well  mr .  bucket thought .  everyone was making polite conversation and absolutely no one had been killed up to the present moment .   and it had been very gratifying to see the tears of gratitude in se  or basilica   s eyes when he was told that the cook was preparing a special brindisian meal  just for him .  he   d seemed quite overcome .   it was reassuring that he knew lady esmerelda .  there was something about the woman that left mr .  bucket terribly perplexed .  he was finding it a little difficult to converse with her .  as a conversational gambit     hello  i understand you have a lot of money  can i have some please .     lacked  he felt  a certain subtlety .      so  er  madam     he ventured     what brings you to our  er  city .         i thought perhaps i could come and spend some money     said granny .     got rather a lot of it  you know .  keep havin    to change banks    cos they get filled up .      somewhere in bucket   s tortured brain  part of his mind went    whoopee    and clicked its heels .      i   m sure if there   s anything i can do       he murmured .      as a matter of fact  there is     said granny .     i was thinking of        a gong banged .      ah     said mr .  bucket .     luncheon is served .      he extended his arm to granny  who gave it an odd look before remembering who she was and taking it .   there was a small exclusive dining room off his office .  it contained a table set for five and  looking rather fetching in a waitress   s lacy bonnet  nanny ogg .   she bobbed a curtsy .   enrico basilica made a tiny strangling noise at the back of his throat .         scuse me  there   s been a bit of a problem     said nanny .      who   s dead .     said bucket .      oh  no one   s dead     said nanny .     it   s the dinner  it   s still alive and hangin    on to the ceiling .  and the pasta   s all gone black  see .  i said to mrs .  clamp  i said  it may be foreign but i don   t reckon it should be crunchy           this is terrible .  what a way to treat an honored guest .     said bucket .  he turned to the interpreter .     please assure se  or basilica that we will send out for fresh pasta straight away .  what were we having  mrs .  ogg .         roast mutton with clootie dumplings     said nanny .   behind the face of se  or basilica the throat of henry slugg made another little growling sound .      and there   s some nice slumpie with a knob of butter     nanny went on .   bucket looked around  puzzled .     is there a dog somewhere in here .     he said .      well  i for one don   t believe in pandering to singers     said granny weatherwax .     fancy food  indeed .  i never heard the like .  why not give him mutton with the rest of us .         oh  lady esmerelda  that   s hardly a way to treat       bucket began .   enrico   s elbow nudged his interpreter  with the special nudge of a man who could see clootie dumplings vanishing into the long grass if he weren   t careful .  he rumbled out a very pointed sentence .      se  or basilica says he would be more than happy to taste the indigenous food of ankh morpork     said the interpreter .      no  we really can   t       bucket tried again .      in fact se  or basilica insists that he tries the indigenous food of ankh morpork     said the interpreter .             s   right .  si     said basilica .      good     said granny .     and give him some beer while you   re about it .     she gave the tenor   s stomach a playful poke  losing her finger down to the second joint .     why  in a day or two i expect you could practically turn him into a native .         the wooden stairs gave way to stone .   perdita said  he   ll have a vast cave somewhere under the opera house .  there will be hundreds of candles  casting an exciting yet romantic light over the  yes  the lake  and there will be a dinner table shining with crystal glass and silverware  and of course he will have  yes  a huge organ     agnes blushed hotly in the darkness .      on which  that is to say  he will play in a virtuoso style many operatic classics .   agnes said  it   ll be damp .  there will be rats .         another clootie dumpling  senior .     said nanny ogg .      mmfmmfmmf .         take two while you   re about it .      it was an education watching enrico basilica eat .  it wasn   t as though he gobbled his food  but he did eat continuously  like a man who intends to go on doing it all day on industrial lines  his napkin tucked neatly into his collar .  the fork was loaded while the current consignment was being thoroughly masticated  so that the actual time between mouthfuls was as small as possible .  even nanny  no stranger to a metabolism going for the burn  was impressed .  enrico basilica ate like a man freed at last from the tyranny of tomatoes with everything .      i   ll order another mint sauce tanker  shall i .     she said .   mr .  bucket turned to granny weatherwax .     you were saying that you might be inclined to patronize our opera house     he murmured .      oh  yes     said granny .     is se  or basilica going to sing tonight .         mmfmmf .         i hope so     muttered salzella .     that or explode .         then i shall definitely want to be there     said granny .     a little more lamb here  my good woman .         yes ma   am     said nanny ogg  making a face at the back of granny   s head .      er   seats for tonight  in fact  are       bucket began .      a box would do me     said granny .     i   m not fussy .         in fact  even the boxes are           how about box eight .  i   ve heard as box eight is always empty .      bucket   s knife rattled on his plate .     er  box eight  box eight  you see  we don   t           i was thinking of donating a little something     said granny .      but box eight  you see  although technically unsold  is           two thousand dollars was what i had in mind     said granny .     oh  dear me  your waitress has let her dumplings go all over the place .  it   s so difficult to get reliable and polite staff these days  ain   t it    .      salzella and bucket stared at one another across the table .   then bucket said     excuse me  my lady  i must just have a brief discussion with my director of music .      the two men hurried to the far end of the room  where they began to argue in whispers .      two thousand dollars .     hissed nanny  watching them .      it might not be enough     said granny .     they   re both looking very red in the face .         yes  but two thousand dollars .         it   s only money .         yes  but it   s only my money  not only your money     nanny pointed out .      we witches have always held everything in common  you know that     said granny .      well  yes     said nanny  and once again cut to the heart of the sociopolitical debate .     it   s easy to hold everything in common when no one   s got anything .         why  gytha ogg     said granny     i thought you despised riches .         right  so i   d like to get the chance to despise them up close .         but i knows you  gytha ogg .  money   d spoil you .         i   d just like the chance to prove that it wouldn   t  that   s all i   m saying .         hush  they   re coming back        mr .  bucket approached  smiled uneasily  and sat down .     er     he began     it has to be box eight  does it .  only we could perhaps persuade someone in one of the other           wouldn   t hear of it     said granny .     i   ve heard that there   s no one ever seen in box eight .         er   haha   it   s laughable  i know  but there are some old theatrical traditions associated with box eight  absolute rubbish of course  but        he left the    but    hanging there hopefully .  it froze in the face of granny   s stare .      you see  it   s haunted     he mumbled .      oh lawks     said nanny ogg  vaguely remembering to stay in character .     another vat of slumpie  senior basilica .  and how about another quart of beer .         mmfmmf     said the tenor encouragingly  taking time out from his eating to point a fork at his empty mug .   granny went on staring .      excuse me     said bucket again .   he and salzella went into another huddle  out of which came sounds like    but two thousand dollars .  that   s a lot of shoes .      bucket surfaced again .  his face was gray .  granny   s stare could do that to people .      er   because of the danger  er  which of course doesn   t exist  haha  we   that is  the management   feel it incumbent on us to insist  that is  politely request  that if you do enter box eight you do so in company with a   man .      he ducked slightly .      a man .     said granny .      for protection     said bucket in a little voice .      although who   d protect him we really couldn   t say     said salzella under his breath .      we thought perhaps one of the staff       bucket mumbled .      ai am quate capable of finding my own man should the need arise     said granny  in a voice with snow on it .   bucket   s polite reply died in his throat when he saw  just behind lady esmerelda  mrs .  ogg grinning like a full moon .      anyone for pudding .     she said .   she held a big bowl on a tray .  there seemed to be a haze over it .      my word     he said     that looks delicious .      enrico basilica looked over the top of his food with the expression of a man who has had the amazing privilege of going to heaven while still alive .      mmmf .         it was damp .  and  with the demise of mr .  pounder  there were indeed rats .   the stone looked old  too .  of course  all stone was old  agnes told herself  but this had grown old as masonry .  ankh morpork had been here for thousands of years .  where other cities were built on clay or rock or loam  ankh morpork was built on ankh morpork .  people constructed new buildings on the remains of earlier ones  knocking out a few doorways here and there to turn ancient bedrooms into cellars .   the stairs petered out on damp flagstones  in almost total darkness .   perdita thought it looked romantic and gothic .   agnes thought it looked gloomy .   if someone used this place they   d need lights  wouldn   t they .  and a fumbling search confirmed it .  she found a candle and some matches tucked into a niche in the wall .   that was sobering for agnes and perdita together .  someone used this prosaic book of matches with a picture of a grinning troll on the cover  and this piece of perfectly ordinary candle .  perdita would have preferred a flaming torch .  agnes didn   t know what she would have preferred .  it was just that  if a mysterious person came and sang in the walls  and moved around the place like a ghost  and possibly killed people   well  you   d prefer a bit more style than a box of matches with a picture of a grinning troll on it .  that was the sort of thing a murderer would use .   she lit the candle and  in two minds about it all  went on into the dark .      chocolate delight with special secret sauce was a great success and heading down the little red lane as though hot wired .      more  mr .  salzella .     said bucket .     this really is first class stuff  isn   t it .  i must congratulate mrs .  clamp .         there is a certain piquancy  i must say     said the director of music .     how about you  se  or basilica .         mmmf .         lady esmerelda .         i don   t mind if i do     said granny  passing her plate across .      i   m sure i detect a hint of cinnamon     said the interpreter  a brown ring around his mouth .      indeed  and possibly just a trace of nutmeg     said mr .  bucket .      i thought   cardamom .     said salzella .      creamy yet spicy     said bucket .  his eyes unfocused slightly .     and curiously   warming .      granny stopped chewing  and looked down suspiciously at her plate .   then she sniffed at her spoon .      is it  er   is it just me  or is it a trifle   warm in here .     said bucket .   salzella had gripped the arms of his chair .  his forehead glistened .     do you think we could open a window .     he said .     i feel a little   strange .         yes  by all means     said bucket .   salzella half rose  and then a preoccupied expression suffused his features .  he sat down suddenly .      no  i rather believe i   ll just sit quietly for a moment     he said .      oh  dear     said the interpreter .  there was a hint of vapor around his collar .   basilica tapped him politely on the shoulder  grunted hopefully  and made pass it here motions in the direction of the half finished dish of chocolate pudding .      mmmf .     he said .      oh  dear     said the interpreter .   mr .  bucket ran a finger around his collar .  sweat was beginning to roll down his face .   basilica gave up on his stricken colleague and reached across in a businesslike way to hook the dish with his fork .      er   yes     said bucket  trying to keep his eyes away from granny .      yes   indeed     said salzella  his voice coming from a long way away .      oh  dear     said the interpreter  his eyes watering .     ai .  meu deus .  dio mio .  o goden .  d   zuk f   t .  aagorahaa .      se  or basilica upended the rest of the special secret sauce onto his plate and carefully scraped out the dish with his spoon  holding it upside down to reach the last little bit .      the weather has been a little   cool of late     bucket managed .     very cold  in fact .      enrico held the sauce dish up to the light and regarded it critically in case there was any drop hiding in a corner .      snow  ice  frost   that sort of thing     said salzella .     yes  indeed .  coldness of all descriptions  in fact .         yes .  yes .     said bucket gratefully .     and at a time like this i think it is very important to try to remember the names of  say  any number of boring and hopefully chilly things .         wind  glaciers  icicles           not icicles .         oh     said the interpreter  and slumped forward into his plate .  his head hit a spoon  which cart wheeled into the air and bounced off enrico   s head .   salzella started to whistle under his breath and pound the arm of his chair .   bucket blinked .  in front of him was the water jug .  the cold water jug .  he reached out        oh  oh  oh  dear me  what can i say  i seem to have spilled it all over myself     he said  through the rising clouds of steam .     what a butterfingers i am  to be sure .  i shall ring for mrs .  ogg to bring us another one .         yes  indeed     said salzella .     and perhaps you would care to do it soon .  i am also feeling very   accident prone .      basilica  still chewing  lifted his interpreter   s head off the table and carefully tipped the man   s unfinished pudding into his own plate .      in fact  in fact  in fact     said salzella     i think i shall just   have a brisk   have a nice cold   if you would excuse me a minute        he pushed back his chair and fled the room in a kind of crouching gait .   mr .  bucket glistened .     i   ll just  i   ll just  i   ll just   be back quite shortly     he said  and scurried away .   there was silence  broken only by the scrape of se  or basilica   s spoon and a sizzling noise from the interpreter .   then the tenor belched baritone .     whoops  pardon my klatchian     he said .     oh   damn .      he appeared to notice the depleted table for the first time .  he shrugged  and smiled hopefully at granny .     is there a cheese board  do you think .     he said .   the door flew open and nanny ogg burst in  holding a bucket of water in both hands .      all right  all right  that   s       she began  and then stopped .   granny dabbed primly at the corners of her mouth with her napkin .     i   m sorry  mrs .  ogg .     she said .   nanny looked at the empty dish in front of basilica .      or perhaps some fruit .     said the tenor .     a few nuts .         how much has he had .     she whispered .      best part of half     said granny .     but i don   t reckon it   s having any effect on account of not touching the sides .      nanny turned her attention to granny   s plate .     how about you .     she said .      two helpings     said granny .     with extra sauce  gytha ogg  may you be forgiven .      nanny looked at her with something like admiration in her eyes .     you ain   t even sweating .     she said .   granny picked up her water glass and held it at arm   s length .   after a few seconds  the water began to boil .      all right  you   re getting really good  i   ve got to admit it     said nanny .     i reckon i should have to get up real early to put one over on you .         i reckon you should never go to sleep     said granny .      sorry  esme .      se  or basilica  at a loss to follow the conversation  realized with reluctance that the meal was probably over .      absolutely superb     he said .     i just loved that pudding  mrs .  ogg .         i should just jolly well expect you did  henry slugg     said nanny .   henry carefully removed a clean handkerchief from his pocket  put it over his face  and leaned back in his chair .  the first snore occurred a few seconds later .      he   s easy to have around  isn   t he .     said nanny .     eat  sleep and sing .  you certainly know where you are with him .  i   ve found greebo  by the way .  he   s still following walter plinge around .     her expression became a little defiant .     say what you like  young walter   s all right by me if greebo likes him .      granny sighed .     gytha  greebo would like norris the eyeball eating maniac of quirm if he knew how to put food in a bowl .         and now she was lost .  she   d done her best not to be .  as agnes had walked through each dank room she   d thoughtfully taken note of details .  she   d carefully remembered right and left turns .  and yet she was lost .   here and there were steps down to lower cellars  but the water level was so high that it was lapping at the first step .  and it stank .  the candle burned with a greenish blue edge to the flame .   somewhere  said perdita  there was the secret room .  if there wasn   t a huge and glittering secret cavern  what on earth was life for .  there had to be a secret room .  a room  full of   giant candles  and enormous stalagmites     but it certainly isn   t here  said agnes .   she felt a complete idiot .  she   d gone through the mirror looking for   well  she wasn   t quite prepared to admit what she might have been looking for  but whatever it was it certainly wasn   t this .   she   d have to shout for help .   of course  someone might hear  but that was always a risk when you shouted for help .   she coughed .      er   hello .      the water gurgled .      er   help .  is there anyone there .      a rat ran over her foot .   oh  yes  she thought bitterly with perdita   s part of her brain  if christine had come down here there probably would have been some great glistening cave and delicious danger .  the world saved up rats and smelly cellars for agnes  because she had such a wonderful personality .      um   anyone .      more rats scuttled across the floor .  there was a faint squeaking from the side passages .      hello .      she was lost in some cellars with a candle getting shorter by the second .  the air was foul  the flagstones were slippery  no one knew where she was  she could die down here  she could be     eyes glowed in the darkness .   one was green yellow  the other pearly white .   a light appeared behind them .   something was coming along the passageway  casting long shadows .   rats tumbled over themselves in their panic to get away     agnes tried to press herself into the stone .      hello miss perdita x nitt .      a familiar shape juddered out of the darkness  just behind greebo .  it was all knees and elbows  it carried a sack over one shoulder and held a lantern in its other hand .  something fled from the darkness .  the terror leached out of it        you don   t want to be down here miss nitt with all the rats .         walter .         got to do mister pounder   s job now the poor man is passed away .  i am a person of all jobs .  no peas for the wicked .  but mister greebo just hits them with his paws and they   re off to rat heaven in a jiff .         walter .     repeated agnes  out of sheer relief .      come for an explore have you .  these ole tunnels goes all the way to the river .  you have to keep your wits about you not to get lost down here .  want to come back with me .      it was impossible to be frightened of walter plinge .  walter attracted a number of emotions  but terror wasn   t among them .      er   yes     said agnes .     i got lost .  sorry .      greebo sat down and started to wash himself in what agnes considered to be a supercilious way .  if a cat could snigger  he would be sniggering .      now i   ve got a full sack i have to take it to mister gimlet   s shop .     announced walter  turning around and loping out of the cellar without bothering to see if she was following him .     we get a ha   penny each which is not to be sneezed at .  the dwarfs think a rat is a good meal which only goes to show it would be a strange world if we were all alike .      it seemed a ridiculously short journey to the foot of some different stairs  which had a well used look to them .      have you ever seen the ghost  walter .     said agnes  as walter put his foot on the first step .   he didn   t turn around .     it is wrong to tell lies .         er   yes  so i believe .  so   when did you last see the ghost .         i last saw the ghost in the big room in the ballet school .         really .  what did he do .      walter paused for a moment  and then the words came out all together .     he ran off .      he stamped up the stairs in a way that suggested very emphatically that the exchange was over .   greebo sneered at agnes and followed him .   the stairs went up just one flight and came out through a trapdoor backstage .  she had been lost only a door or two from the real world .   no one noticed her emerge .  but then no one noticed her at all .  they just assumed that she   d be around when she was needed .   walter plinge had already loped off  in something of a hurry .   agnes hesitated .  they probably wouldn   t even notice she wasn   t there  right up to the point when christine opened her mouth     he hadn   t wanted to answer  but walter plinge spoke when spoken to and she had a feeling that he wasn   t able to lie .  telling lies would be being bad .   she   d never seen the ballet school .  it wasn   t far backstage  but it was a world of its own .  the dancers issued from it every day like so many very thin and twittering sheep under the control of elderly women who looked as though they breakfasted on pickled limes .  it was only after she   d timidly asked a few questions of the stagehands that she   d realized that the girls had joined the ballet because they wanted to .   she had seen the dancers    dressing room  where thirty girls washed and changed in a space rather smaller than bucket   s office .  it bore the same relationship to ballet as compost did to roses .   she looked around again .  still no one had paid any attention to her .   she headed for the school .  it was up a few steps  along a fetid corridor lined with notice boards and smelling of ancient grease .  a couple of girls fluttered past .  you never saw just one  they went around in groups  like mayflies .  she pushed open the door and stepped into the school .   reflections of reflections of reflections     there were mirrors on every wall .   a few girls  practicing on the bars that lined the room  looked up as she entered .   mirrors     out in the passage she leaned against the wall and got her breath back .  she   d never liked mirrors .  they always seemed to be laughing at her .  but didn   t they say it was the mark of a witch  not liking to get between two mirrors .  it sucked out your soul  or something .  a witch would never get between two mirrors if she could help it     but  of course  she very definitely wasn   t a witch .  so she took a deep breath  and went back into the room .   images of herself stretched away in every direction .   she managed a few steps  then wheeled around and groped for the doorway again  watched by the surprised dancers .   lack of sleep  she told herself .  and general over excitement .  anyway  she didn   t need to go right into the room  now that she knew who the ghost was .   it was so obvious .  the ghost didn   t require any mysterious nonexistent caves when all he needed to do was hide where everyone could see him .      mr .  bucket knocked at the door of salzella   s office .  a muffled voice said     come in .      there was no one in the office  but there was another closed door in the far wall .  bucket knocked again  and then rattled the door handle .      i   m in the bath     said salzella .      are you decent .         i   m fully clothed  if that   s what you mean .  is there a pail of ice out there .         was it you who ordered it .     said bucket guiltily .      yes .         only i  er  i had it taken to my office so i could stick my feet in it           your feet .         yes .  er   i went for a brisk run around the city  don   t know why  just felt like it           well .         my boots caught fire on the second lap .      there was a sloshing noise and some sotto voce grumbling and then the door swung open  revealing salzella in a purple dressing gown .      has se  or basilica been safely tethered .     he said  dripping on the floor .      he   s going through the music with herr trubelmacher .         and he   s   all right .         he sent along to the kitchen for a snack .      salzella shook his head .     astonishing .         and they   ve put the interpreter in a cupboard .  they don   t seem to be able to get him unfolded .      bucket sat down carefully .  he was wearing carpet slippers .      and       salzella prompted .      and what .         where did that dreadful woman go .         mrs .  ogg is showing her around .  well  what else could i do .  two thousand dollars  remember .         i am endeavoring to forget     said salzella .     i promise never to talk about that lunch ever again  if you don   t either .         what lunch .     said bucket innocently .      well done .         she does seem to have an amazing effect though  doesn   t she           i don   t know who you are talking about .         i mean  it   s not hard to see how she made her money           good heavens  man  she   s got a face like a hatchet .         they say that queen ezeriel of klatch had a squint  but that didn   t stop her having fourteen husbands  and that was only the official score .  besides  she   s knocking on a bit           i thought she   d been dead for two hundred years .         i   m talking about lady esmerelda .         so am i .         at least try to be civil to her at the soir  e before the performance tonight .         i   ll try .         the two thousand might be only the start  i hope .  every time i open a drawer there are more bills .  we seem to owe money to everyone .         opera is expensive .         you   re telling me .  whenever i try to make a start on the books  something dreadful happens .  do you think i might just have a few hours without something awful happening .         in an opera house .         the voice was muffled by the half dismantled mechanism of the organ .      all right   give me middle c .      a hairy finger pressed a key .  it made a thudding noise and somewhere in the mechanism something else went woing .      blast  it   s come off the peg   hold on   try again        the note rang out sweet and clear .      o kay     said the voice of the man hidden in the exposed entrails of the organ .     wait until i tighten the peg        agnes stepped closer .  the hulking figure seated at the organ turned around and gave her a friendly grin  which was much wider than the average grin .  its owner was covered in red hair and  while short changed in the leg department  had obviously been first in the queue when the arm counter opened .  and had also been given a special free offer of lip .      andr   .     said agnes weakly .   the organist extracted himself from the mechanism .  he was holding a complicated wooden bar with springs on it .     oh  hello     he said .      er   who is this .     said agnes  backing away from the primeval organist .      oh  this is the librarian .  i don   t think he has a name .  he   s the librarian at unseen university but  much more importantly  he   s their organist and it turns out our organ is a johnson   just like theirs .  he   s given us some spare parts           ook .         sorry  lent us some spare parts .         he plays the organ .         in an amazingly prehensile way  yes .      agnes relaxed .  the creature didn   t seem about to attack .      oh     she said .     well   i suppose it   s natural  because sometimes barrel organ men came to our village and they often had a dear little mon        there was a crashing chord .  the orangutan raised its other hand and waved a finger politely in front of agnes   s face .      he doesn   t like being called a monkey     said andr   .     and he likes you .         how can you tell .         he doesn   t usually go in for warnings .      she stepped back quickly and grabbed the boy   s arm .     can i have a word with you .     she said .      we   ve got only a few hours and i   d really like to get this           it   s important .      he followed her into the wings .  behind them  the librarian tapped a few keys on the half repaired keyboard and then ducked underneath .      i know who the ghost is     whispered agnes .   andr   stared at her .  then he pulled her farther into the shadows .     the ghost isn   t anybody     he said softly .     don   t be silly .  it   s just the ghost .         i mean he   s someone else when he takes his mask off .         who .         should i tell mr .  bucket and mr .  salzella .         who .  tell them about who .         walter plinge .      he stared at her again .      if you laugh i   ll   i   ll kick you     said agnes .      but walter isn   t even           i didn   t believe it either but he said he saw the ghost in the ballet school and there   s mirrors all over the walls and he   d be quite tall if he stood up properly and he roams around in the cellars           oh  come on           the other night i thought i heard him singing on the stage when everyone else had gone .         you saw him .         it was dark .         oh  well       andr   began dismissively .      but afterward i   m certain i heard him talking to the cat .  talking normally  i mean .  i mean like a normal person  i mean .  and you   ve got to admit   he is strange .  isn   t he just the sort of person who   d want to wear a mask to hide who he is .     she sagged .     look  i can see you don   t want to listen           no .  no  i think   well           i just thought i   d feel better if i told someone .      andr   smiled in the gloom .     i wouldn   t mention it to anyone else  though .      agnes looked down at her feet .     i suppose it does sound a bit far fetched        andr   laid a hand on her arm .  perdita felt agnes draw herself back .     do you feel better .     he said .      i   don   t know   i mean   i don   t know   i mean  i just can   t imagine him hurting anyone   i feel so stupid           everyone   s on edge .  don   t worry about it .         i   d   hate you to think i was being silly           i   ll keep an eye on walter  if you like .     he smiled at her .     but i   d better get on with things     he added .  he gave her another smile  as fast and brief as summer lightning .      thank y        he was already walking back to the organ .      this shop was a gentlemen   s outfitters .      it   s not for me     said nanny ogg .     it   s for a friend .  he   s six foot tall  very broad shoulders .         inside leg .         oh  yes .      she looked around the store .  might as well go all the way .  it was her money  after all .      and a black coat  long black tights  shoes with them shiny buckles  one of those top hats  a big cloak with a red silk lining  a bow tie  a really posh black cane with a very nobby silver knob on it   and   a black eye patch .         an eye patch .         yes .  maybe with sequins or something on it  since it   s the opera .      the tailor stared at nanny .     this is a little irregular     he said .     why can   t the gentleman come in himself .         he ain   t quite a gentleman yet .         but  madam  i meant that we have to get the size right .      nanny ogg looked around the shop .     tell you what     she said     you sell me something that looks about right and we   ll adjust him to fit .     scuse me        she turned away demurely        twingtwangtwong        and turned back  smoothing down her dress and holding a leather bag .      how much   ll it be .     she said .   the tailor looked blankly at the bag .     i   m afraid we won   t be able to have all that ready until at least next wednesday     he said .   nanny ogg sighed .  she felt she was becoming familiar with one of the most fundamental laws of physics .  time equaled money .  therefore  money equaled time .      i was sort of hoping to get it all a bit quicker than that     she said  jingling the bag up and down .   the tailor looked down his nose at her .     we are craftsmen  madam .  how long did you think it should take .         how about ten minutes .      twelve minutes later she left the shop with a large packet under one arm  a hat box under the other  and an ebony cane between her teeth .   granny was waiting outside .     got it all .         ess .         i   ll take the eye patch  shall i .         we   ve got to get a third witch     said nanny  trying to rearrange the parcels .     young agnes has got good strong arms .         you know if we was to drag her out of there by the scruff of her neck we   d never hear the last of it     said granny .     she   ll be a witch when she wants to be .      they headed for the opera house   s stage door .      afternoon  les     said nanny cheerfully as they entered .     stopped itching now  has it .         marvelous bit of ointment that was you gave me  mrs .  ogg     said the stage doorkeeper  his mustache bending into something that might have been a smile .      mrs .  les keeping well .  how   s her sister   s leg .         doing very well  mrs .  ogg  thank you for asking .         this is just esme weatherwax who   s helping me with some stuff     said nanny .   the doorkeeper nodded .  it was clear that any friend of mrs .  ogg was a friend of his .     no trouble at all  mrs .  ogg .      as they passed through into the dusty network of corridors granny reflected  not for the first time  that nanny had a magic all of her own .   nanny didn   t so much enter places as insinuate herself  she had unconsciously taken a natural talent for liking people and developed it into an occult science .  granny weatherwax did not doubt that her friend already knew the names  family histories  birthdays and favorite topics of conversation of half the people here  and probably also the vital wedge that would cause them to open up .  it might be talking about their children  or a potion for their bad feet  or one of nanny   s really filthy stories  but nanny would be in and after twenty four hours they   d have known her all their lives .  and they   d tell her things .  of their own free will .  nanny got on with people .  nanny could get a statue to cry on her shoulder and say what it really thought about pigeons .   it was a knack .  granny had never had the patience to acquire it .  just occasionally  she wondered whether it might have been a good idea .      curtain up in an hour and a half     said nanny .     i promised giselle i   d give her a hand           who   s giselle .         she does makeup .         you don   t know how to do makeup .         i distempered our privy  didn   t i .     said nanny .     and i paint faces on eggs for the kiddies every soul cake tuesday .         got to do anything else  have you .     said granny sarcastically .     open the curtains .  fill in for a ballet dancer who   s been taken poorly .         i did say i   d help with the drinks at the swarray     said nanny  letting the irony slide off like water on a red hot stove .     well  a lot of the staff have buggered off    cos of the ghost .  it   s in the big foyer in half an hour .  i expect you ought to be there  being a patronizer .         what   s a swarray .     said granny suspiciously .      it   s a sort of posh party before the opera .         what do i have to do .         drink sherry and make polite conversation     said nanny .     or conversation  anyway .  i saw the grub being done for it .  they   ve even got little cubes of cheese on sticks stuck in a grapefruit  and you don   t get much posher than that .         gytha ogg  you ain   t done any   special dishes  have you .         no  esme     said nanny ogg meekly .      only you   ve got an imp of mischief in you .         been far too busy for anything like that     said nanny .   granny nodded .     then we   d better find greebo     she said .      you sure about this  esme .     said nanny .      we might have a lot to do tonight     said granny .     maybe we could do with an extra pair of hands .         paws .         at the moment  yes .         it was walter .  agnes knew it .  it wasn   t knowledge in her mind  exactly .  it was practically something she breathed .  she felt it as a tree feels the sun .   it all fitted .  he could go anywhere  and no one took any notice of walter plinge .  in a way he was invisible  because he was always there .  and  if you were someone like walter plinge  wouldn   t you long to be someone as debonair and dashing as the ghost .   if you were someone like agnes nitt  wouldn   t you long to be someone as dark and mysterious as perdita x dream .   the traitor thought was there before she could choke it off .  she added hurriedly  but i   ve never killed anyone .   because that   s what i   d have to believe  isn   t it .  if he   s the ghost  then he   s killed people .   all the same   he does look odd  and he talks as if the words are trying to escape     a hand touched her shoulder .  she spun round .      it   s only me .     said christine .         oh .         don   t you think this is a marvelous dress .  .         what .         this dress  silly .  .      agnes looked her up and down .     oh .  yes .  very nice     she said  disinterest lying on her voice like rain on a midnight pavement .      you don   t sound very impressed .  .  really  perdita  there   s no need to be jealous .  .         i   m not jealous  i was thinking        she   d only seen the ghost for a moment  but he certainly hadn   t moved like walter .  walter walked as though his body were being dragged along by his head .  but the certainty was as hard as marble now .      well  you don   t seem very impressed  i must say .  .         i   m wondering if walter plinge is the ghost     said agnes  and immediately cursed herself  or at least pooted .  she felt embarrassed enough about andr     s reaction .   christine   s eyes widened .     but he   s a clown .  .         he walks odd and he talks odd     said agnes     but if he stood up straight        christine laughed .  agnes felt herself getting angry .     and he practically told me he was .         you believed him  did you .  .     christine made a little tutting sound that agnes considered quite offensive .     really  you girls believe the strangest things .  .         what do you mean  we girls .         oh  you know .  the dancers are always saying they   ve seen the ghost all over the place           good grief .  do you think i   m some sort of impressionable idiot .  think for a minute before answering .         well  of course i don   t  but           huh .      agnes strode off into the wings  concerned more with effect than direction .  the background noise of the stage faded behind her as she stepped into the scenery store .  it didn   t lead anywhere except to a pair of big double doors opening to the world outside .  it was full of bits of castles  balconies and romantic prison cells  stacked any old how .   christine hurried up behind her .      i really didn   t mean   look  not walter    he   s just a very odd odd job man .         he does all kinds of jobs .  no one ever knows where he is   they all just assume he   s around .         all right  but you don   t have to get so worked up        there was the faintest of sounds behind them .   they turned .   the ghost bowed .         who   s a good boy  then .  nanny   s got a bowl of fish eggs for a good boy     said nanny  trying to see under the big dresser in the kitchen .      fish eggs .     said granny  coldly .      i borrowed them from the stuff they   ve done for the swarray     said nanny .      borrowed .     said granny .      that   s right .  come along  greebo  who   s a good boy then .         borrowed .  you mean   when the cat   s finished with them  you   re going to give them back .         it   s only a manner of speaking  esme     said nanny in a hurt little voice .     it   s not the same as stealing if you don   t mean it .  come along  boy  here   s some lovely fish eggs for you        greebo pulled himself farther into the shadows .      there was a little sigh from christine and she folded up into a faint .  but she managed  agnes noticed sourly  to collapse in a way that probably didn   t hurt when she hit the ground and which showed off her dress to the best effect .  it was beginning to dawn on agnes that christine was remarkably clever in some specialized ways .   she looked back at the mask .      it   s all right     she said  her voice sounding hoarse even to her .     i know why you   re doing it .  i really do .      no expression could cross that ivory face  but the eyes flickered .   agnes swallowed .  the perdita part of her wanted to give in right now  because that would be more exciting  but she stood her ground .      you want to be something else and you   re stuck with what you are     said agnes .     i know all about that .  you   re lucky .  all you have to do is put on a mask .  at least you   re the right shape .  but why did you have to go and kill people .  why .  mr .  pounder couldn   t have done you any harm .  but   he poked around in odd places  didn   t he  and he   found something .      the ghost nodded slightly  and then held out his ebony cane .  he grasped both ends and pulled  so that a long thin sword slid out .      i know who you are .     agnes burst out  as he stepped forward .     i   i could probably help you .  it might not have been your fault .     she backed away .     i haven   t done anything to you .  you don   t have to be afraid of me .      she backed away farther as the figure advanced .  the eyes  in the dark hollows of the mask  glinted like tiny jewels .      i   m your friend  don   t you see .  please  walter .  walter .      there was  far off  an answering sound that seemed as loud as thunder and as impossible  in the circumstances  as a chocolate kettle .   it was the clank of a bucket handle .      what   s the matter miss perdita nitt .      the ghost hesitated .   there was the sound of footsteps .  irregular footsteps .   the ghost lowered the sword  opened a door in a piece of scenery painted to represent a castle wall  bowed ironically and slipped away .   walter rounded a corner .   he was an unlikely knight errant .  for one thing  he had on evening dress obviously designed for someone of a different shape .  he was still wearing his beret .  he also wore an apron and was carrying a mop and bucket .  but no heroic lance wielding rescuer ever galloped over a drawbridge more happily .  he was practically surrounded by a golden glow .         walter .         what   s the matter with miss christine .         she   er   she fainted     said agnes .     er .  probably   yes  probably the excitement .  with the opera .  tonight .  yes .  probably .  the excitement .  because of the opera tonight .      walter gave her a slightly worried look .     yes     he said  and added patiently     i know where there   s a medicine box shall i get it .      christine groaned and fluttered her eyelashes .     where am i .      perdita gritted agnes   s teeth .  where am i .  that didn   t sound the sort of thing someone said when they woke up from a faint  it sounded more like the sort of thing they said because they   d heard it was the sort of thing people said .      you fainted     she said .  she looked hard at walter .     why were you in here  walter .         got to mop out the stagehands    privy miss nitt .  always having trouble i   ve been working on it for months .         but you   re wearing evening dress .         yes then i got to be a waiter afterward because we   re short handed and there   s no one else to be a waiter when they have drinks and sausages on poles before the opera .      no one could have moved that fast .  true  walter and the ghost hadn   t both been in the room at the same time  but she   d heard his voice .  no one could have had time to duck around behind the piles of flats and turn up at the opposite side of the room in seconds  unless they were some sort of wizard .  some of the girls did say the ghost could almost seem to be in two places at once .  perhaps there were other secret places like the old staircase .  perhaps he     she stopped herself .  walter plinge wasn   t the ghost  then .  there was no sense in trying to find some excitable explanation to prove wrong right .   she   d told christine .  well  christine was giving her just a slightly bemused look as walter helped her up .  and she   d told andr    but he hadn   t seemed to believe her so probably that was all right .   which meant that the ghost was        someone else .   she   d been so certain .         you   ll enjoy it  mother .  you really will .            tain   t for the likes of us  henry .  i don   t see why mr .  morecombe couldn   t give you tickets to see nellie stamp at the music hall .  now that   s what i call music .  proper tunes you can understand .         songs like    she sits among the cabbages and leeks    are not very cultural  mother .      two figures wandered through the crowds heading for the opera house .  this was their conversation .         s a good laugh  though .  and you don   t have to hire suits .  seems daft to me  havin    to wear a special suit just to listen to music .         it enhances the experience     said young henry  who had read this somewhere .      i mean  how does the music know .     said his mother .     now  nellie stamp           come along  mother .      it was going to be one of those evenings  he knew it .   henry lawsy did his best .  and  given the starting point  it wasn   t a bad best .  he was a clerk in the firm of morecombe  slant   honeyplace  a somewhat old fashioned legal partnership .  one reason for its less than modern approach was the fact that messrs .  morecombe and honeyplace were vampires and mr .  slant was a zombie .  the three partners were  therefore  technically dead  although this did not prevent them putting in a proper day   s work   normally during the night  in the case of mr .  morecombe and mr .  honeyplace .   from henry   s point of view the hours were good and the job was not onerous  but he chafed somewhat about his promotion prospects because clearly dead men   s shoes were being fully occupied by dead men .  he   d decided that the only way to succeed was to better himself by improving his mind  which he tried to do at every opportunity .  it is probably a full description of henry lawsy   s mind that if you had given him a book called how to improve your mind in five minutes  he would have read it with a stopwatch .  his progress through life was hampered by his tremendous sense of his own ignorance  a disability which affects all too few people .   mr .  morecombe had given him two opera tickets as a reward for sorting out a particularly problematical tort .  he   d invited his mother because she represented     percent of all the women he knew .   people tended to shake henry   s hand cautiously  in case it came off .   he   d bought a book about the opera and read it carefully  because he   d heard that it was absolutely unheard of to go to an opera without knowing what it was about  and the chance of finding out while you were actually watching it was remote .  the book   s reassuring weight was in his pocket right now .  all he needed to complete the evening was a less embarrassing parent .      can we get some peanuts before we go in .     said his mother .      mother  they don   t sell peanuts at the opera .         no peanuts .  what   re you supposed to do if you don   t like the songs .         greebo   s suspicious eyes were two glows in the gloom .      poke him with a broom handle     suggested granny .      no     said nanny .     with someone like greebo you have to use a little bit of kindness .      granny closed her eyes and waved a hand .   there was a yowl from under the kitchen   s dresser and a sound of frantic scrabbling .  then  his claws scoring tracks in the floor  greebo came out backward  fighting all the way .      mind you  a lot of cruelty does the trick as well     nanny conceded .     you   ve never been much of a cat person  have you  esme .      greebo would have hissed at granny  except that even his cat brain was just bright enough to realize this was not the best move he could make .      give him his fish eggs     granny said .     he might as well have them now as later .      greebo inspected the dish .  oh  this was all right  then .  they wanted to give him food .   granny nodded at nanny ogg .  they held out their hands  palm up .   greebo was halfway through the caviar when he felt it happening .      wrrroowlllll       he wailed  and then the voice went deeper as his chest expanded  and rose physically as his back legs lengthened under him .   his ears flattened against his head  and then crept down the sides .         lllllwwaaaa           the jacket   s a forty four inch chest     said nanny .  granny nodded .         aaaaoooo        his face flattened .  his whiskers spread out .  greebo   s nose developed a life of its own .         oooooss   sshit .         he certainly gets the hang of it quicker these days     said nanny .      you put some clothes on right now  my lad     said granny  who had shut her eyes .   not that this made much difference  she had to admit later .  greebo fully clothed still managed to communicate the nakedness beneath .  the insouciant mustache  the long sideburns and the tousled black hair combined with the well developed muscles to give the impression of the more louche kind of buccaneer or a romantic poet who   d given up on the opium and tried red meat instead .  he had a scar running across his face  and a black patch now where it crossed the eye .  when he smiled  he exuded an easy air of undistilled  excitingly dangerous lasciviousness .  he could swagger while asleep .  greebo could  in fact  commit sexual harassment simply by sitting very quietly in the next room .   except as far as the witches were concerned .  to granny a cat was a damn cat whatever shape it was  and nanny ogg always thought of him as mister fluffy .   she adjusted the bow tie and stood back critically .     what do you think .     she said .      he looks like an assassin  but he   ll do     said granny .      oh  what a nasty thing to say .      greebo waved his arms experimentally and fumbled with the ebony cane .  fingers took a bit of getting used to  but cat reflexes learned fast .   nanny waved a finger playfully under his nose .  he took a half hearted swipe at it .      now you just stay with granny and do what she tells you like a good boy     she said .      yess  nan ny     said greebo reluctantly .  he managed to grip the stick properly .      and no fighting .         no  nan ny .         and no leaving bits of people on the doormat .         no  nan ny .         we   ll have no trouble like we did with those robbers last month .         no  nan ny .      he looked depressed .  humans had no fun .  incredible complications surrounded the most basic activities .      and no turning back into a cat again until we say .         yess  nan ny .         play your cards right and there could be a kipper in this for you .         yess  nan ny .         what   re we going to call him .     said granny .     he can   t just be greebo  which i   ve always said was a damn silly name for a cat .         well  he looks aristocratic       nanny began .      he looks like a beautiful brainless bully     granny corrected her .      aristocratic     repeated nanny .      same thing .         we can   t call him greebo  anyway .         we   ll think of something .         salzella leaned disconsolately against the marble banister of the foyer   s grand staircase and stared gloomily into his drink .   it had always seemed to him that one of the major flaws in the whole business of opera was the audience .  they were quite unsuitable .  the only ones worse than the ones who didn   t know anything at all about music  and whose idea of a sensible observation was    i liked that bit near the end when her voice went wobbly     were the ones who thought they did        want a drink do you mister salzella .  there   s lots you know .      walter plinge ambled by  his black suit making him look like a very good class of scarecrow .      plinge  you just say    drink  sir .        said the director of music .     and please take off that ridiculous beret .         my mum made it for me .         i   m sure she did  but        bucket sidled up to him .     i thought i told you to keep se  or basilica away from the canap  s .     he hissed .      i   m sorry  i couldn   t find a big enough crowbar     said salzella  waving away walter and his beret .     anyway  isn   t he supposed to be communing with his muse in his dressing room .  the curtain goes up in twenty minutes .         he says he sings better on a full stomach .         then we   re in for a big treat tonight .      bucket turned and surveyed the scene .     it   s going well  anyway     he said .      i suppose so .         the watch are here  you know .  in secret .  they   re mingling .         ah   let me guess        salzella looked around at the crowds .  there was  indeed  a very short man in a suit intended for a rather larger man  this was especially the case with the opera cloak  which actually trailed on the floor behind him to give the overall impression of a superhero who had spent too much time around the kryptonite .  he was wearing a deformed fur hat and trying surreptitiously to smoke a cigarette .      you mean that little man with the words    watchman in disguise    flashing on and off just above his head .         where .  i didn   t see that .      salzella sighed .     it   s corporal nobby nobbs     he said wearily .     the only known person to require an identity card to prove his species .  i   ve watched him mingle with three large sherries .         he   s not the only one  though     said mr .  bucket .     they   re taking this seriously .         oh  yes     said salzella .     if we look over there  for example  we see sergeant detritus  who is a troll  and who is wearing what in the circumstances is actually a rather well fitting suit .  it is therefore  i feel  something of a pity he has neglected to remove his helmet .  and these  you understand  the watch has chosen for their ability to blend .         well  they   ll certainly be useful if the ghost strikes again     said bucket  hopelessly .      the ghost would have to       salzella stopped .  he blinked .     oh  good grief     he whispered .     what has she found .      bucket turned .     that   s lady esmerelda   oh .      greebo strolled in alongside her with the gentle swagger that makes women thoughtful and men   s knuckles go white .  the buzz of conversation was momentarily hushed  and then rose again to a slightly shriller buzz .      i   m impressed     said salzella .      he certainly doesn   t look like a gentleman     said bucket .     look at the color of that eye .     he set his face into what he hoped was a smile  and bowed .      lady esmerelda .     he said .     how pleasant to see you again .  won   t you introduce us to your   guest .         this is lord gribeau     said granny .     mr .  bucket  the owner  and mr .  salzella  who seems to run the place .         haha     said salzella .   gribeau snarled  revealing longer incisors than any that bucket had seen outside a zoo .  and bucket had never seen such a greenish yellow eye .  the pupil was all wrong        ahaha       he said .     and may i order you something .         he   ll have milk     said granny firmly .      i expect he has to keep up his strength     said salzella .   granny spun around .  her expression would have etched steel .      anyone for a drink .     said nanny ogg  appearing out of nowhere with a tray and adroitly stepping between them like a very small peacekeeping force .     got a bit of everything here           including a glass of milk  i see     said bucket .   salzella looked from one witch to the other .     that   s remarkably foresighted of you     he said .      well  you never know     said nanny .   gribeau took the glass in both hands and lapped at it with his tongue .  then he looked at salzella .      what yourrr lookin aat .  neverrr seein mil   uk drun beforr .         never quite   like that  i must admit .      nanny winked at granny weatherwax as she turned to scurry away .   granny caught her arm .     remember     she whispered     when we go into the box   you keep an eye on mrs .  plinge .  mrs .  plinge knows something .  i ain   t sure what   s going to happen .  but it is going to happen .         right     said nanny .  she bustled off  muttering under her breath     oh  yes   do this  do that           drink here  please  ma   am .      nanny looked down .     good grief     she said .     what are you .      the apparition in the fur hat winked at her .     i   m the count de nobbs     it said     and this here     it added  indicating a mobile wall     is the count de tritus .      nanny glanced at the troll .     another count .  i   m sure there   s unaccountably more counts here than i can count .  and what can i get you  officers .     she said .      officers .  us .     said the count de nobbs .     what makes you think we   re watchmen .         he   s got a helmet on     nanny pointed out .     also  he   s got his badge pinned to his coat .         i told you to put it away .     nobby hissed .  he looked at nanny and smiled uneasily .     milit   ry chic     he said .     it   s just a fashion accessory .  actually  we are gentlemen of means and have nothing to do with the city watch whatsoever .         well  gentlemen  would you like some wine .         not while we on duty  t   anks     said the troll .      oh  yes  thank you very much  count de tritus     said nobby bitterly .     oh  yes  very undercover  that is .  why don   t you just wave your truncheon around where everyone can see it .         well  if you t   ink it   d help           put it away .      the count de tritus   s eyebrows met with the effort of thought .     dat was irony  den  was it .  to a superior officer .         can   t be a superior officer  can you     cos we ain   t watchmen .  look  commander vimes explained it three times        nanny ogg tactfully moved away .  it was bad enough watching them blow their cover without sucking at it as well .   this was a new world  all right .  she was used to a life where the men wore the bright clothes and the women wore black .  it made it a lot easier to decide what to put on in the mornings .  but inside the opera house the rules of clothing were all in reverse  just like the laws of common sense .  here the women dressed like frosted peacocks and the men looked like penguins .   so   there were coppers here .  nanny ogg was basically a law abiding person when she had no reason to break the law  and therefore had that kind of person   s attitude to law enforcement officers  which was one of deep and permanent distrust .   there was their approach to theft  for example .  nanny had a witch   s view of theft  which was a lot more complicated than the attitude adopted by the law and  if it came to it  people who owned property worth stealing .  they tended to wield the huge blunt ax of the law in circumstances that required the delicate scalpel of common sense .   no  thought nanny .  policemen with their great big boots were not required here on a night like this .  it would be a good idea to put a thumbtack under the ponderous feet of justice .   she ducked behind a gilt statue and fumbled in the recesses of her clothing while people nearby looked around in puzzlement at the erratic twanging of elastic .  she was sure she had one around somewhere   she   d packed it in case of emergencies     there was the clink of a small bottle .  ah  yes .   a moment later nanny ogg emerged decorously with two small glasses on her tray  and headed purposefully for the watchmen .      fruit drink  officers .     she said .     oh  silly me  what am i saying  i didn   t mean officers .  homemade fruit drink .      detritus sniffed suspiciously  immediately clearing his sinuses .     what   s in it .     he said .      apples     said nanny ogg promptly .     well   mainly apples .      under her hand  a couple of spilt drops finished eating their way through the metal of the tray and dropped onto the carpet  where they smoked .      the auditorium buzzed with the sound of operagoers settling down and mrs .  lawsy trying to find her shoes .      you really shouldn   t have taken them off  mother .         my feet are giving me gyp .         did you bring your knitting .         i think i must   ve left it in the ladies .         oh  mother .      henry lawsy marked his place in his book and raised his runny eyes heavenward  and blinked .  right above him   a long way above him   was a glittering circle of light .   his mother followed his gaze .     what   s that  then .         i think it   s a chandelier  mother .         it   s a pretty big one .  what   s holding it up .         i   m sure they   ve got special ropes and things  mother .         looks a bit dangerous  to my mind .         i   m sure it   s absolutely safe  mother .         what do you know about chandeliers .         i   m sure people wouldn   t come into the opera house if there was any chance of a chandelier dropping on their heads  mother     said henry  trying to read his book .       il truccatore  the master of disguise .  il truccatore  ten .    a mysterious nobleman  causes scandal in the city when he woos high born ladies while disguised as their husbands .  however  laura  sop .    the new bride of capriccio  bar .    refuses to give in to his blandishments       henry put a bookmark in the book  took a smaller book from his pocket  and carefully looked up    blandishments .     he was moving in a world he wasn   t quite sure of  embarrassment lay waiting at every turn  and he wasn   t going to get caught out over a word .  henry lived his life in permanent dread of being asked questions later .          and with the help of his servant wingie  ten .   he adopts a subterfuge       the dictionary came out again for a moment .          culminating       and again .          in the scene at the famous masked ball at the duke   s palace .  but il truccatore has not reckoned with his old adversary the count de          adversary      henry sighed  and reached for his pocket .      curtain up in five minutes     salzella reviewed his troops .  they consisted of scene builders and painters and all those other employees who could be spared for the evening .  at the end of the line  about fifty percent of walter plinge had managed to stand to attention .      now  you all know your positions     said salzella .     and if you see anything  anything at all  you are to let me know at once .  do you understand .         mr .  salzella .         yes  walter .         we mustn   t interrupt the opera mr .  salzella .      salzella shook his head .     people will understand  i   m sure           show must go on mr .  salzella .         walter  you will do what you   re told .      someone raised a hand .     he   s got a point  though  mr .  salzella        salzella rolled his eyes .     just catch the ghost     he said .     if we can do it without a lot of shouting  that   s good .  of course i don   t want to stop the show .     he saw them relax .   a deep chord rolled out over the stage .      what the hell was that .      salzella strode behind the stage and was met by andr    looking excited .      what   s going on .         we repaired it  mr .  salzella .  only   well  he doesn   t want to give up the seat        the librarian nodded at the director of music .  salzella knew the orangutan  and among the things he knew was that  if the librarian wanted to sit somewhere  then that was where he sat .  but he was a first class organist  salzella had to admit .  his lunch time recitals in the great hall of unseen university were extremely popular  especially since the university   s organ had every single sound effect that bloody stupid johnson   s inverted genius had been able to contrive .  no one would have believed  before a pair of simian hands had worked on the project  that something like doinov   s romantic prelude in g could be rescored for whoopee cushion and squashed rabbits .      there   s the overtures     said andr       and the ballroom scene           at least get him a bow tie     said salzella .      no one can see him  mr .  salzella  and he hasn   t really got much of a neck           we do have standards  andr   .         yes  mr .  salzella .         since you seem to have been relieved of employment this evening  then perhaps you could help us apprehend the ghost .         certainly  mr .  salzella .         fetch him a tie  then  and come with me .      a little later  left to himself  the librarian opened his copy of the score and placed it carefully on the stand .   he reached down under the seat and pulled out a large brown paper bag of peanuts .  he wasn   t entirely sure why andr    having talked him into playing the organ this evening  had told the other man that it was because he  the librarian  wouldn   t budge .  in fact  he   d got some interesting cataloguing to do and had been looking forward to it .  instead  he seemed to be here for the night  although a pound of shelled peanuts was handsome pay by any ape   s standards .  the human mind was a deep and abiding mystery and the librarian was glad he didn   t have one anymore .   he inspected the bow tie .  as andr   had foreseen  it presented certain problems to someone who   d been behind the door when the necks were handed out .      granny weatherwax stopped in front of box eight and looked around .  mrs .  plinge wasn   t visible .  she unlocked the door with what was probably the most expensive key in the world .      and you behave yourself     she said .      ye ess  gran ny     moaned greebo .      no going to the lavatory in the corners .         no  gran ny .      granny glared at her escort .  even in a bow tie  even with his fine mustaches waxed  he was still a cat .  you just couldn   t trust them to do anything except turn up for meals .   the inside of the box was rich red plush  picked out with gilt decoration .  it was like a soft little private room .   there were a couple of fat pillars on either side  supporting part of the weight of the balcony above .  she looked over the edge and noted the drop to the stalls below .  of course  someone could probably climb in from one of the adjacent boxes  but that   d be in full view of the audience and would be bound to cause some comment .  she peeked under the seats .  she stood on a chair and felt around the ceiling  which had gilt stars on it .  she inspected the carpet minutely .   she smiled at what she saw .  she   d been prepared to bet that she knew how the ghost got in  and now she was certain .   greebo spat on his hand and tried ineffectually to groom his hair .      you sit quiet and eat your fish eggs     said granny .      ye ess  gran ny .         and watch the opera  it   s good for you .         ye ess  gran ny .            evenin     mrs .  plinge .     said nanny cheerfully .     ain   t this excitin    .  the buzz of the audience  the air of expectation  the blokes in the orchestra findin    somewhere to hide the bottles and tryin    to remember how to play   all the exhilaration an    drama of the operatic experience waitin    to unfold           oh  hello  mrs .  ogg     said mrs .  plinge .  she was polishing glasses in her tiny bar .      certainly very packed     said nanny .  she looked sidelong at the old woman .      every seat sold  i heard .      this didn   t achieve the expected reaction .      shall i give you a hand cleaning out box eight .     she went on .      oh  i cleaned it out last week     said mrs .  plinge .  she held a glass up to the light .      yes  but i heard her ladyship is very particular     said nanny .     very picky about things .         what ladyship .         mr .  bucket has sold box eight  see     said nanny .   she heard a faint tinkle of glass .  ah .   mrs .  plinge appeared at the doorway of her nook .     but he can   t do that .         it   s his opera house     said nanny  watching mrs .  plinge carefully .     i suppose he thinks he can .         it   s the ghost   s box .      operagoers were appearing along the corridor .      i shouldn   t think he   d mind just for one night     said nanny ogg .     the show must go on  eh .  are you all right  mrs .  plinge .         i think i   d just better go and       she began  stepping forward .      no  you have a good sit down and a rest     said nanny  pressing her back with gentle but irresistible force .      but i should go and           and what  mrs .  plinge .     said nanny .   the old woman went pale .  granny weatherwax could be nasty  but then nastiness was always in the window  you were aware that it might turn up on the menu .  sharpness from nanny ogg  though  was like being bitten by a big friendly dog .  it was all the worse for being unexpected .      i daresay you wanted to go and have a word with somebody  did you  mrs .  plinge .     said nanny softly .     someone who might be a little shocked to find his box full  perhaps .  i reckon i could put a name to that someone  mrs .  plinge .  now  if        the old woman   s hand came up holding a bottle of champagne and then came down hard in an effort to launch the ss gytha ogg onto the seas of unconsciousness .  the bottle bounced .   then mrs .  plinge leapt past and scuttled away  her polished little black boots twinkling .   nanny ogg caught the door frame and swayed a little while blue and purple fireworks went off behind her eyes .  but there was dwarf in the ogg ancestry  and that meant a skull you could go mining with .   she stared muzzily at the bottle .     year of the insulted goat     she mumbled .        s a good year .      then consciousness gained the upper hand .   she grinned as she galloped after the retreating figure .  in mrs .  plinge   s place she   d have done exactly the same thing  except a good deal harder .      agnes waited with the others for the curtain to go up .  she was one of the crowd of fifty or so townspeople who would hear enrico basilica sing of his success as a master of disguise  it being a vital part of the entire process that  while the chorus would listen to expositions of the plot  and even sing along  they would suffer an instant lapse of memory afterward so that later unmaskings would come as a surprise .   for some reason  without any word being spoken  as many people as possible seemed to have acquired very broad brimmed hats .  those who hadn   t were taking every opportunity to glance upward .   beyond the curtain  herr trubelmacher launched the overture .   enrico  who had been chewing a chicken leg  carefully put the bone on a plate and nodded .  the waiting stagehand dashed off .   the opera had begun .      mrs .  plinge reached the bottom of the grand staircase and hung on to the banister  panting .   the opera had started .  there was no one around .  and no sounds of pursuit  either .   she straightened up  and tried to get her breath back .      coo ee  mrs .  plinge .      nanny ogg  waving the champagne bottle like a club  was already traveling at speed when she hit the first turn in the banister  but she leaned like a professional and kept her balance as she went into the straight  and then tilted again for the next curve        which left only the big gilt statue at the bottom .  it is the fate of all banisters worth sliding down that there is something nasty waiting at the far end .  but nanny ogg   s response was superb .  she swung a leg over as she hurtled downward and pushed herself off  her nailed boots leaving grooves in the marble as she spun to a halt in front of the old woman .   mrs .  plinge was lifted off her feet and carried into the shadows behind another statue .      you don   t want to try and outrun me  mrs .  plinge     nanny whispered  as she clamped a hand firmly over mrs .  plinge   s mouth .     you just want to wait here quietly with me .  and don   t go thinking i   m nice .  i   m only nice compared to esme  but so is practic   ly everyone           mmf .      with one hand tightly around mrs .  plinge   s arm and another over her mouth  nanny peered round the statue .  she could hear the singing  far off .   nothing else happened .  after a while  she started to fret .  perhaps he   d taken fright .  perhaps mrs .  plinge had left him some sort of signal .  perhaps he   d decided that the world was currently too dangerous for ghosts  although nanny doubted he could ever decide that     at this rate the first act would be over before     a door opened somewhere .  a lanky figure in a black suit and a ridiculous beret crossed the foyer and went up the stairs .  at the top  they saw it turn in the direction of the boxes and disappear .      y   see     said nanny  trying to get the stiffness out of her limbs     the thing about esme is  she   s stupid           mmf .            so she thinks that the most obvious way  d   y   see  for the ghost to get in and out of the box is through the door .  if you can   t find a secret panel  she reckons  it   s because it ain   t there .  a secret panel that ain   t there is the best kind there is  the reason bein     no bugger can find it .  that   s where you people all think too operatic  see .  you   re all cooped up in this place  listening to daft plots what don   t make sense  and i reckon it does something to your minds .  people can   t find a trapdoor so they say  oh  deary me  what a hidden trapdoor it must be .  whereas a normal person  e . g .   me and esme  we   d say  maybe there ain   t one  then .  and the best way for the ghost to get around the place without being seen is for him to be seen and not noticed .  especially if he   s got keys .  people don   t notice walter .  they looks the other way .      she gently released her grip .     now  i don   t blame you  mrs .  plinge     cos i   d do the same for one of mine  but you   d have done better to trust esme right at the start .  she   ll help you if she can .      nanny let mrs .  plinge go  but kept a grip on the champagne bottle  just in case .      what if she can   t .     said mrs .  plinge bitterly .      you think walter did those murders .         he   s a good boy .         i   m sure that   s the same as a    no     isn   t it .         they   ll put him in prison .         if he done them murders  esme won   t let that happen     said nanny .   something sank into mrs .  plinge   s not very alert mind .     what do you mean  she won   t let that happen .     she said .      i mean     said nanny     that if you throw yourself on esme   s mercy  you better be damn sure you deserve to bounce .         oh  mrs .  ogg .         now  don   t you worry about anything     said nanny  perhaps a little late under the circumstances .  it occurred to her that the immediate future might be a little bit easier on everyone if mrs .  plinge got some well earned rest .  she fumbled in her clothing and produced a bottle  half full of some cloudy orange liquid .     i   ll just give you a sip of a little something to calm your nerves           what is it .         it   s a sort of tonic     said nanny .  she flicked the cork out with her thumb  on the ceiling above her  the paint crinkled .     it   s made from apples .  well   mainly apples           walter plinge stopped outside box eight and looked around .   then he removed his beret and pulled out the mask .  the beret went into his pocket .   he straightened up  and it looked very much as though walter plinge with the mask on was several inches taller .   he took a key from his pocket and unlocked the door  and the figure that stepped into the box did not move like walter plinge .  it moved as though every nerve and muscle were under full and athletic control .   the sounds of the opera filled the box .  the walls had been lined with red velvet and were hung with curtains .  the chairs were high and well padded .   the ghost slipped into one of them and settled down .   a figure leaned forward out of the other chair and said     you carrn   t havve my fisssh eggs .      the ghost leapt up .  the door clicked behind him .   granny stepped out from the curtains .      well  well  we meet again     she said .   he backed away to the edge of the box .      i shouldn   t think you could jump     said granny .     it   s a long way down .     she focused her best stare on the white mask .     and now  mister ghost        he sprang back onto the edge of the box  saluted granny flamboyantly  and leapt upward .   granny blinked .   up until now the stare had always worked        too damn dark     she muttered .     greebo .      the bowl of caviar flew out of his nervous fingers and caused a fortean experience somewhere in the stalls .      yess  gran ny .         catch him .  and there could be a kipper in it for you .      greebo snarled happily .  this was more like it .  opera had begun to pall for him the moment he realized that no one was going to pour a bucket of cold water over the singers .  he understood chasing things .   besides  he liked to play with his friends .      agnes saw the movement out of the corner of her eye .  a figure had jumped out of one of the boxes and was climbing up to the balcony .  then another figure clambered after it  scrambling over the gilt cherubs .   singers faltered in mid note .  there was no mistaking the leading figure .  it was the ghost .      the librarian was aware that the orchestra had stopped playing .  somewhere on the other side of the backcloth the singers had stopped  too .  there was a buzz of excited conversation and one or two cries .   the hairs all over his body began to prickle .  senses designed to protect his species in the depths of the rain forest had adjusted nicely to the conditions of a big city  which was merely drier and had more carnivores .   he picked up the discarded bow tie and  with great deliberation  tied it around his forehead so that he looked like a really formal kamikaze warrior .  then he threw away the opera score and stared blankly into space for a moment .  he knew instinctively that some situations required musical accompaniment .   this organ lacked what he considered the most basic of facilities  such as the thunder pedal  a     foot earthquake pipe and a complete keyboard of animal noises  but he was certain there was something exciting that could be done in the bass register .   he stretched out his arms and cracked his knuckles .  this took some time .   and then he began to play .      the ghost danced along the edge of the balcony  scattering hats and opera glasses .  the audience watched in astonishment  and then began to clap .  they couldn   t quite see how it fitted into the plot of the opera   but this was an opera  after all .   he reached the center of the balcony  trotted a little way up the aisle  and then turned and ran down again at speed .  he reached the edge  jumped  jumped again  soared out into the auditorium        and landed on the chandelier  which jingled and began to sway gently .   the audience stood up and applauded as he climbed through the jangling tiers toward the central cable .   then another shape clambered over the edge of the balcony and loped along in pursuit .  this was a stockier figure than the first man  one eyed  broad in the shoulders and tapering at the waist  he looked evil in an interesting kind of way  like a pirate who really understood the words    jolly roger .     he didn   t even take a run but  when he reached the closest part to the chandelier  simply launched himself into space .   it was clear that he wasn   t going to make it .   and then it wasn   t clear how he did .   those watching through opera glasses swore later that the man thrust out an arm which merely seemed to graze the chandelier and yet was then somehow able to swivel his entire body in mid air .   a couple of people swore even harder that  just as the man reached out  his fingernails appeared to grow by several inches .   the huge glass mountain swung ponderously on its rope and  as it reached the end of the swing  greebo swung out farther  like a trapeze artist .  there was an appreciative    oo    from the audience .   he twisted again .  the chandelier hesitated for a moment at the extremity of its arc  and then swept back again .   as it jangled and creaked over the stalls the hanging figure swung upward  let go and did a backward somersault that dropped him in the middle of the crystals .  candles and prisms were scattered over the seats below .   and then  with the audience clapping and cheering  he scrambled up the rope after the fleeing ghost .      henry lawsy tried to move his arm  but a fallen crystal had stapled the sleeve of his coat to his arm rest .   it was a quandary .  he was pretty sure this wasn   t supposed to happen  but he wasn   t certain .   around him he could hear people hissing questions .      was that part of the plot .         i   m sure it must have been .         oh  yes .  yes .  it certainly was     said someone farther down the row  authoritatively .     yes .  yes .  the famous chase scene .  indeed .  oh  yes .  they did it in quirm  you know .         oh   yes .  yes  of course .  i   m sure i heard about it           i thought it was bloody good     said mrs .  lawsy .      mother .         about time something interesting happened .  you should   ve told me .  i   d   ve put my glasses on .         nanny ogg pounded up the back stairs toward the fly loft .      something   s gone wrong .     she muttered under her breath as she took the stairs two at a time .     she reckons she   s only got to stare at    em and they   re toffee in her hands  and then who has to sort it out afterward  eh .  go on  guess        the ancient wooden door at the top of the stairs gave way to nanny ogg   s boot with nanny ogg   s momentum behind it  and cracked open onto a big  shadowy space .  it was full of running figures .  legs flickered in the light of lanterns .  people were shouting .   a figure ran straight toward her .   nanny sprang into a crouch  both thumbs on the cork of the badly shaken champagne bottle she held cradled under one arm .      this is a magnum     she said     and i   m not afraid to drink it .      the figure stopped .     oh  it   s you  mrs .  ogg        nanny   s infallible memory for personal details threw up a card .     peter  isn   t it .     she said  relaxing .     the one with the bad feet .         that   s right  mrs .  ogg .         the powder i give you is working  is it .         they   re a lot better now  mrs .  ogg           so what   s been happening .         mr .  salzella caught the ghost .         really .      now that nanny   s eyes had managed to discern some order in the chaos  she could see a cluster of people in the middle of the floor  around the chandelier .   salzella was sitting on the planking .  his collar was torn and a sleeve had been ripped off his jacket  but he had a triumphant look in his eyes .   he waved something in the air .   it was white .  it looked like a piece of a skull .      it was plinge .     he said .     i tell you  it was walter plinge .  why are you all standing around .  get after him .         walter .     said one of the men  doubtfully .      yes  walter .      another man hurried up  waving his lantern .      i saw the ghost heading up to the roof .  and there was some big one eyed bastard going after him like a scalded cat .      that   s wrong  thought nanny .  something wrong here .      to the roof .     shouted salzella .      hadn   t we better get the flaming torches first .         flaming torches are not compulsory .         pitchforks and scythes .         that   s only for vampires .         how about just one torch .         get up there now .  understand .         the curtains closed .  there was a smattering of applause which was barely audible above the chatter from the audience .   the chorus turned to one another .     was that supposed to happen .      dust rained down .  stagehands were scampering across the gantries far above .  shouts echoed among the ropes and dusty backdrops .  a stagehand ran across the stage  holding a flaming torch .      here  what   s going on .     said a tenor .      they   ve got the ghost .  he   s heading for the roof .  it   s walter plinge .         what  walter .         our walter plinge .         yes .      the stagehand ran on in a trail of sparks  leaving the yeast of rumor to ferment in the ready dough that was the chorus .      walter .  surely not .         weeelll   he   s a bit odd  isn   t he    .         but only this morning he said to me     it   s a nice day mr .  sidney .     just like that .  normal as anything .  well   normal for walter           as a matter of fact  it   s always worried me  the way his eyes move as though they don   t talk to each other           and he   s always around the place .         yes  but he   s the odd job man           no argument about that .         it   s not walter     said agnes .   they looked at her .      that   s who he said they   re chasing  dear .         i don   t know who they   re chasing  but walter   s not the ghost .  fancy anyone thinking walter   s the ghost .     said agnes  hotly .     he wouldn   t hurt a fly .  anyway  i   ve seen           he   s always struck me as a bit slimy  though .         and they say he goes down into the cellars a lot .  what for  i ask myself .  let   s face it .  fair   s fair .  he   s crazy .         he doesn   t act crazy .     said agnes .      well  he always looks as though he   s about to  you must admit .  i   m going to see what   s happening .  anyone coming .      agnes gave up .  it was a horrible thing to learn  but there are times when evidence gets trampled and the hunt is on .      a hatch flew open .  the ghost clambered out  looked down  and slammed the hatch shut .  there was a yowl from below .   then he danced across the leads until he reached the gargoyle encrusted parapet  black and silver in the moonlight .  the wind caught at his cloak as he ran along the very edge of the roof and dropped down again near another door .   and a gargoyle was suddenly no longer a gargoyle  but a figure that reached down suddenly and twitched off his mask .   it was like cutting strings .      good evening  walter     said granny  as he sagged to his knees .      hello missus weatherwax .         mistress     granny corrected him .     now stand up .      there was a growl farther along the roof  and then a thump .  bits of trapdoor rose for a moment against the moonlight .      it   s nice up here  ain   t it .     said granny .     there   s fresh air and stars .  i thought  up or down .  but there   s only rats down below .      in another swift movement she grabbed walter   s chin and tilted it  just as greebo pulled himself onto the roof with prolonged murder in his heart .      how does your mind work  walter plinge .  if your house was on fire  what   s the first thing you   d try to take out .      greebo stalked along the rooftop  growling .  he liked rooftops in general  and some of his fondest memories involved them  but a trapdoor had just been slammed on his head and he was looking for anything he could disembowel .   then he recognized the shape of walter plinge as someone who had given him food .  and  standing right next to him  the much more unwelcome shape of granny weatherwax  who had once caught him digging in her garden and had kicked him in the cucumbers .   walter said something .  greebo didn   t take much notice of it .   granny weatherwax said     well done .  a good answer .  greebo .      greebo nudged walter heavily in the back .      want milluk right noaow .  purr  purr .      granny thrust the mask at the cat .  in the distance people were running up stairs and shouting .      you put this on .  and you stay down real low  walter plinge .  one man in a mask is pretty much like another  after all .  and when they chase you  greebo   give them a run for their money .  do it right and there could be           yurr  i knoaow     said greebo despondently  taking the mask .  it was turning out to be a long and busy evening for a kipper .   someone poked their head out of the stricken trapdoor .  the light glinted off greebo   s mask   and it had to be said  even by granny  that he made a good ghost .  for one thing  his morphogenic field was trying to reassert itself .  his claws could no longer even remotely be thought of as fingernails .   he spat at the pursuit as they poured up the steps  arched his back dramatically on the very edge of the roof  and stepped off .   one story down he thrust out an arm  caught a windowsill  and landed on the head of a gargoyle  which said    oh  fank oo ver    mush    in a reproachful voice .   the pursuers looked down at him .  some of them had managed to get hold of flaming torches  because sometimes convention is too strong to be lightly denied .   greebo snarled defiance and dropped again  springing from sill to drain pipe to balcony and pausing every now and again for another dramatic pose and another snarl at the pursuers .      we   d better get after him  corporal de nobbs     said one of them  who was staggering along behind .      we   d better get after him by carefully going back down the stairs  you mean .     cos somethin    i drank don   t want to stay drunk .  much more runnin    and i   ll be droppin    a custard  i   m tellin    you .      the other members of the posse also seemed to be reaching the conclusion that there was no extended future in chasing a man down the sheer wall of a building .  as one mob they turned and  shouting and waving their torches in the air  headed back to the stairs .   the parting crowd revealed nanny ogg  holding a pitchfork in one hand and a torch in the other and thrusting them both in the air while muttering     rhubarb  rhubarb .      granny walked over and tapped her on the shoulder .     they   ve gone  gytha .         rhuba   oh  hello  esme     said nanny  lowering the implements of righteous retribution .     i was just tagging along to see it didn   t get out of hand .  was that greebo i saw just then .         yes .         awww  bless him     said nanny .     he looked a bit bothered  though .  i hope he doesn   t happen to anybody .         where   s your broomstick .     said granny .      it   s in the cleaners    cupboard backstage .         then i   ll borrow it and keep an eye on things     said granny .      hey  he   s my cat  i ought to be looking after him       nanny began .   granny stepped aside  revealing a huddled shape sitting hugging its knees .     you look after walter plinge     she said .     it   s something you   d be better at than me .         hello mrs .  ogg .     said walter  mournfully .   nanny looked at him for a moment .      so he is the    .         yes .         you mean he really did do the mur    .         what do you think .     said granny .      well  if it comes to it  i think he didn   t     said nanny .     can i have a word in your ear  esme .  i don   t reckon i should say this in front of young walter .      the witches bent their heads together .  there was a brief whispered conversation .      everything is simple when you know the answer     said granny .     i   ll be back soon .      she hurried off .  nanny heard her shoes clattering on the stairs .   nanny looked down at walter again  and held out her hand .     up you get  walter .         yes mrs .  ogg .         i expect we   d better find somewhere for you to lie low  eh .         i know a hidden place mrs .  ogg .         you do  do you .      walter lurched across the roof toward another trapdoor  and pointed to it proudly .      that .     said nanny .     that doesn   t look very hidden to me  walter .      walter gave it a puzzled look  and then grinned in the way a scientist might after he   d solved a particularly difficult equation .     it   s hidden where everyone can see it mrs .  ogg .      nanny gave him a sharp look  but there was nothing but a slightly glazed innocence in walter   s eyes .   he lifted up the trapdoor and pointed politely downward .     you go down the ladder first so i will not see your drawers .         very   kind of you     said nanny .  it was the first time anyone had ever said anything like that to her .   the man waited patiently until she had reached the bottom of the ladder  and then climbed laboriously down after her .      this is just an old staircase  isn   t it .     said nanny  prodding at the darkness with her torch .      yes .  it goes all the way down .  except at the bottom where it goes all the way up .         anyone else know about it .         the ghost mrs .  ogg .     said walter  climbing down .      oh  yes     said nanny slowly .     and where   s the ghost now  walter .         he ran away .      she held up the torch .  there was still nothing to be read in walter   s expression .     what does the ghost do here  walter .         he watches over the opera .         that   s very kind of him  i   m sure .      nanny started downward  and as the shadows danced around her she heard walter say     you know she asked me a very silly question mrs .  ogg .  it was a silly question any fool knows the answer .         oh  yes     said nanny  peering at the walls .     about houses on fire  i expect           yes .  what would i take out of our house if it was on fire .         i expect you were a good boy and said you   d take your mum     said nanny .      no .  my mum would take herself .      nanny ran her hands over the nearest wall .  doors had been nailed shut when the staircase had been abandoned .  someone walking up and down here  with a keen pair of ears  could hear a lot of things        what would you take out then  walter .     she said .      the fire .      nanny stared unseeing at the wall  and then her face slowly broke into a grin .      you   re daft  walter plinge     she said .      daft as a broom mrs .  ogg .     said walter cheerfully .   but you ain   t insane  she thought .  you   re daft but you   re sane .  that   s what esme would say .  and there   s worser things .      greebo pounded along broadway .  he was suddenly not feeling very well .  muscles were twitching in odd ways .  a tingling at the base of his spine indicated that his tail wanted to grow  and his ears definitely wanted to creep up the sides of his head  which is always embarrassing when it happens in company .   in this case the company was about a hundred yards behind and apparently intent on moving his ears quite a long way from their current position  embarrassment or not .   it was gaining  too .  greebo normally had a famous turn of speed  but not when his knees were trying to reverse direction every few seconds .   his normal plan when pursued was to jump onto the water butt behind nanny ogg   s cottage and rake the pursuer across the nose with his claws when it came around the corner .  since this would now involve a five hundred mile dash  an alternative had to be sought .   there was a coach waiting outside one of the houses .  he lurched over to it  pulled himself up  grabbed the reins and briefly turned his attention to the driver .      get orfff .      greebo   s teeth shone in the moonlight .  the coachman  with great presence of mind and urgent absence of body  somersaulted backward into the night .   the horses reared  and tried to break into a gallop from a standing start .  animals are less capable of being fooled than are humans  they knew that what they had behind them was a very large cat  and the fact that it was man shaped didn   t make them any happier .   the coach lumbered off .  greebo looked over his twitching shoulder at the torchlit crowd and waved a paw derisively .  the effect pleased him so much that he clambered onto the roof of the swaying coach and continued to jeer .   it is a catlike attribute to spit defiance at the enemy from a place of safety .  in the circumstances it would have been better if catlike attributes had included the ability to steer .   a wheel hit the parapet of the brass bridge and scraped along it  the iron rim kicking up sparks .  the shock knocked greebo from his perch in midgesture .  he landed on his feet in the middle of the road  while the terrified horses continued on with the coach rocking dangerously from side to side .   the pursuers stopped .      what   s he doing now .         he   s just standing there .         there   s only one of him and there   s lots of us  right .  we could easily overpower him .         good idea .  on the count of three  we   ll all rush him  right .  one   two   three       pause .     you didn   t run .         well  nor did you .         yes  but i was the one saying    one  two  three .            remember what he did to mr .  pounder .         yes  well  i never liked the man all that much        greebo snarled .  ticklish things were happening to his body .  he threw his head back and roared .      look  at worst he   d only be able to get one or two of us           oh  that   s good  is it .         here  why   s he twisting around like that .         maybe he hurt himself falling off the coach           let   s get him .      the mob closed in .  greebo  struggling against a morphogenic field swinging wildly between species  punched the first man in the face with a hand and clawed the shirt off another man with something more like a giant paw .      oh  shiiiooooo        twenty hands grabbed him .  and then  in the m  l  e and the darkness  twenty hands were holding just cloth and emptiness .  vengeful boots connected with nothing more than air .  clubs that had been swung at a snarling face whirled through empty space and returned to hit their owner on the ear .         ooooaaawwwwl .      quite unnoticed in the scrum  a flat eared bullet of gray fur shot out from between the scuffling legs .   the kicking and punching stopped only when it became apparent that all the mob was attacking was itself .  and  since the iq of a mob is the iq of its most stupid member divided by the number of mobsters  it was never very clear to anyone what had happened .  obviously they   d closed in on the ghost  and he certainly couldn   t have escaped .  all that was left was a mask and some torn clothing .  so  the mob reasoned  he must have ended up in the river .  and good riddance  too .   happy in the knowledge of a job well done  they adjourned to the nearest pub .   this left sergeant count de tritus and corporal the count de nobby nobbs  who lurched to the middle of the bridge and regarded the few scraps of cloth .      commander vimes isn   t   isn   t   isn   t goin    to like dis     said detritus .     you know he likes prisoners to be alive .         yeah  but this one would   ve been hung anyway     said nobby  who was trying to stand upright .     this way was just a bit more   democratic .  a great saving in terms of rope  not to mention wear and tear on locks and keys .      detritus scratched his head .     shouldn   t there be some blood .     he ventured .   nobby gave him a sour look .     he couldn   t   ve got away     he said .     so don   t go asking questions like that .         only  if humans is hit hard enough  they leaks all over der place     said detritus .   nobby sighed .  that was the caliber of people you got in the watch these days .  they had to make a mystery of things .  in days gone by  when it had been just the old gang and an unofficial policy of lazy fair  they   d have said a heartfelt    well done  lads    to the vigilantes and turned in early .  but now old vimes had been promoted to commander he seemed to be enrolling people who asked questions all the time .  it was even affecting detritus  considered by other trolls to be as dim as a dead glowworm .   detritus reached down and picked up an eye patch .      what d   you think  then .     said nobby scornfully .     you think he turned into a bat and flew away .         ha .  i do not t   ink that    cos it is in   consist   ent with modern policing     said detritus .      well  i think     said nobby     that when you have ruled out the impossible  what is left  however improbable  ain   t worth hanging around on a cold night wonderin    about when you could be getting on the outside of a big drink .  come on .  i want to try a leg of the elephant that bit me .         was dat irony .         that was metaphor .      detritus  uneasy in what was technically his mind  prodded at the torn pieces of clothing .   something brushed against his leg .  it was a cat .  it had tattered ears  one good eye  and a face like a fist with fur on it .      hello  little cat     said detritus .   the cat stretched and grinned .     gerrt lorssst  coppuurrrr        detritus blinked .  there are no such things as troll cats  and detritus had never seen a cat before he   d arrived in ankh morpork and discovered that they were very  very hard to eat .  and he   d never heard of them talking .  on the other hand  he was very much aware of his reputation as the most stupid person in the city  and he wasn   t going to draw attention to a talking cat if it were going to turn out that everybody except him knew that they talked all the time .   in the gutter  a few feet away  there was something white .  he picked it up carefully .  it looked like the mask the ghost had worn .   this was probably a clue .   he waved it urgently .     hey  nobby           thank you .     something dipped through the darkness  snatched the mask from the troll   s hand  and soared into the night .   corporal nobbs turned around .     yes .     he said .      er   how big are birds .  normally .         oh  blimey  i dunno .  some are small  some are big .  who cares .      detritus sucked his finger .     oh  no reason     he said .     i am far too smart to be taken in by perfec   ly normal t   ings .         something squelched underfoot .      it   s pretty damp down here  walter     said nanny .   and the air was stale and heavy and seemed to be squeezing the light from the torch .  there was a dark edge to the flame .      not far now mrs .  ogg .      keys jingled in the darkness  and some hinges creaked .      i found this mrs .  ogg .  it   s the ghost   s secret cave .         secret cave  eh .         you got to shut your eyes .  you got to shut your eyes .     said walter urgently .   nanny did so  but to her shame kept a grip on the torch  just in case .  she said     and is the ghost in there  walter .         no .      there was the rattle of a matchbox and some scuffling  and then        you can open them now mrs .  ogg .      nanny did so .   color and light blurred and then swam into focus  first in her eyes and then  eventually  in her brain .     oh  my     she murmured .     oh  my  my        there were candles  the big flat ones used to illuminate the stage  floating in shallow bowls .  the light they gave was soft  and it rippled over the room like the soul of water .   it glinted off the beak of a huge swan .  it glittered in the eye of a vast  sagging dragon .   nanny ogg turned slowly .  her experience of opera had not been a lengthy one but witches pick things up quickly  and there was the winged helmet worn by hildabrun in the ring of the nibelungingung  and here was the striped pole from the barber of pseudopolis  and there was the pantomime horse with the humorous trapdoor from the enchanted piccolo  and here        here was opera  all piled in a heap .  once the eye had taken it all in  it had time to notice the peeling paint and rotting plaster and the general air of gentle moldering .  the decrepit props and threadbare costumes had been dumped in here because people didn   t want them anywhere else .   but someone did want them here .  after the eye had seen the ruin  then there was time for it to see the little patches of recent repair  the careful areas of fresh paint .   there was something like a desk in the tiny area of floor not occupied by the props .  and then nanny realized that it had a keyboard and a stool  and there were neat piles of paper on top of it .   walter was watching her with a big  proud grin .   nanny ambled over to the thing .     it   s a harmonium  ain   t it .  a tiny organ .         that   s right mrs .  ogg .      nanny picked up one of the sheaves of paper .  her lips moved as she read the meticulous copperplate writing .      an opera about cats .     she said .     never heard of an opera about cats        she thought for a moment  and then added to herself  but why not .  it   s a damn good idea .  the lives of cats are just like operas  when you come to think about it .   she leafed through the other piles .     guys and trolls .  hubward side story .  miserable les .  who   s he .  seven dwarfs for seven other dwarfs .  what   re all these  walter .      she sat down on the stool and pressed a few of the cracked yellow keys  which moved with an audible creak .  there were a couple of large pedals under the harmonium .  you pedaled these and that worked the bellows and these spongy keys produced something which was to organ music what    poot    was to cursing .   so this was where wal   where the ghost sat  thought nanny  down under the stage  among the discarded wreckage of old performances  down under the huge windowless room where  night after night  music and songs and rampant emotion echoed back and forth and never escaped or entirely died away .  the ghost worked down here  with a mind as open as a well  and it filled up with opera .  opera went in at the ears  and something else came out of the mind .   nanny pumped the pedals a few times .  air hissed from inefficient seams .  she tried a few notes .  they were reedy .  but  she considered  sometimes the old lie was true  and size really did not matter .  it really was what you did with it that counted .   walter watched her expectantly .   she took down another wad of paper and peered at the first page .  but walter leaned over and snatched at the script .      that one   s not finished mrs .  ogg .         the opera house was still in uproar .  half the audience had gone outside and the other half was hanging around in case further interesting events were going to transpire .  the orchestra was in a huddle in the pit  preparing its request for a special being upset by a ghost allowance .  the curtains were closed .  some of the chorus had stayed onstage  others had hurried off to take part in the chase .  the air had the excited electric feel it gets when normal civilized life is temporarily short circuited .   agnes bounced frantically from rumor to rumor .  the ghost had been caught  and it was walter plinge .  the ghost had been caught by walter plinge .  the ghost had been caught by someone else .  the ghost had escaped .  the ghost was dead .   there were arguments breaking out everywhere .      i still can   t believe it was walter .  i mean  good grief   walter .         what about the show .  we can   t just stop .  you never stop the show  not even if someone dies .         oh  we have stopped when people died           yes  but only as long as it took to get the body offstage .      agnes stepped back into the wings  and trod on something .     sorry     she said automatically .      it was only my foot     said granny weatherwax .     so   how is life in the big city  agnes nitt .      agnes turned .     oh   hello  granny       she mumbled .     and i   m not agnes here  thank you     she added  a shade more defiantly .      it   s a good job  is it  bein    someone else   s voice .         i   m doing what i want to do     said agnes .  she drew herself up to her full width .     and you can   t stop me .         but you ain   t part of it  are you .     said granny conversationally .     you try  but you always find yourself watchin    yourself watchin    people  eh .  never quite believin    anything .  thinkin    the wrong thoughts .         shut up .         ah .  thought so .         i have no intention of becoming a witch  thank you very much .         now  don   t go getting upset just because you know it   s going to happen .  a witch you   re going to be because a witch you are  and if you turn your back on him now then i don   t know what   s going to happen to walter plinge .         he   s not dead .         no .      agnes hesitated .     i knew he was the ghost     she began .     but then i saw he couldn   t be .         ah     said granny .     believed the evidence of your own eyes  did you .  in a place like this .         one of the stagehands just told me they chased him up onto the roof and then down into the street and beat him to death .         oh  well     said granny     you   ll never get anywhere if you believe what you hear .  what do you know .         what do you mean  what do i know .         don   t try cleverness on me  miss .      agnes looked at granny   s expression  and knew when to fold .     i know he   s the ghost     she said .      right .         but i can see that he isn   t .         yes .         and i know   i   m pretty sure he doesn   t mean any harm .         good .  well done .  walter might not know his right from his left  but he does know his right from his wrong .     granny rubbed her hands together .     well  we   re already home and looking for a clean towel  eh .         what .  you haven   t solved anything .            course we have .  we know that it wasn   t walter what done the murders  so now we just have to find out who it was .  easy .         where   s walter now .         nanny   s got him somewhere .         she   s all by herself .         i told you  she   s got walter .         i meant   well  he   s a bit strange .         only where it shows .      agnes sighed  and started to say that it wasn   t her problem .  and realized it was useless even to try .  the knowledge sat like a smug intruder in her mind .  whatever it was  it was her problem .      all right     she said .     i   ll help you if i can  because i   m here .  but afterward   that   s it .  afterward  you   ll leave me alone .  promise .         certainly .         well   all right  then       agnes stopped .     oh  no     she said .     that was too easy .  i don   t trust you .         don   t trust me .     said granny .     you   re saying you don   t trust me .         yes .  i don   t .  you   ll find a way to wriggle around it .         i never wriggle     said granny .     it   s nanny ogg who thinks we ought to have a third witch .  i reckon life   s difficult enough without some girl cluttering up the place just because she thinks she looks good in a pointy hat .      there was a pause .  then agnes said     i   m not falling for that one  either .  it   s where you say i   m too stupid to be a witch and i say  oh no i   m not  and you end up winning again .  i   d rather be someone else   s voice than some old witch with no friends and having everyone frightened of me and being nothing more than just a bit cleverer than other people and not doing any real magic at all        granny put her head on one side .      seems to me you   re so sharp you might cut yourself     she said .      all right .  when it   s all over  i   ll let you go your own way .  i won   t stop you .  now show me the way to mr .  bucket   s office           nanny smiled her jolly wrinkled old apple smile .     now  you just hand it over  walter     she said .     no harm in letting me see it  is there .  not old nanny .         can   t see it till it   s finished .         well  now     said nanny  hating herself for dropping the atom bomb     i   m sure your mam wouldn   t want to hear that you   ve been a bad boy  would she .      expressions floated over walter   s waxen features as he struggled with several ideas at once .  finally  without a word  he thrust the bundle at her  his arms trembling with tension .      there   s a good boy     said nanny .   she glanced at the first few pages  and then moved them nearer to the light .     hmm .      she treadled the harmonium for a while and played a few notes with her left hand .  they represented most of the musical notes she knew how to read .  it was a very simple little theme  such as might be picked out on the keyboard with one finger .     hey        her lips moved as she read the narrative .      well now  walter     she said     isn   t this a sort of opera about a ghost who lives in an opera house .     she turned a page .     very smart and debonair  he is .  he   s got a secret cave  i see        she played another short riff .     catchy music  too .      she read on  occasionally saying things like    well  well    and    lawks .     every now and again she   d give walter an appraising look .      i wonder why the ghost wrote this  walter .     she said  after a while .     quiet sort of chap  ain   t he .  put it all into his music .      walter stared at his feet .     there   s going to be a lot of trouble mrs .  ogg .         oh  me and granny will sort it all out     said nanny .      it   s wrong to tell lies     said walter .      probably     said nanny  who   d never let it worry her up to now .      it wouldn   t be right for our mum to lose her job mrs .  ogg .         it wouldn   t be right  no .      the feeling drifted over nanny that walter was trying to put across some sort of message .     er   what sort of lies would it be wrong to tell  walter .      walter   s eyes bulged .     lies   about things you see mrs .  ogg .  even if you did see them .      nanny thought it was probably time to present the oggish point of view .     it   s all right to tell lies if you don   t think lies     she said .      he said our mum would lose her job and i   d be locked up if i said mrs .  ogg .         did he .  which    he    was he .         the ghost mrs .  ogg .         i reckon granny ought to have a good look at you  walter     said nanny .     i reckon your mind   s all tangled up like a ball of string what   s been dropped .     she pedaled the harmonium thoughtfully .     was it the ghost that wrote all this music  walter .         it   s wrong to tell lies about the room with the sacks in it mrs .  ogg .      ah  thought nanny .     that   d be down here  would it .         he said i wasn   t to tell anyone .         who did .         the ghost mrs .  ogg .         but you   re       nanny began  and then tried another way .     ah  but i ain   t anyone     she said .     anyway  if you was to go to this room with the sacks and i was to follow you  that wouldn   t be telling anyone  would it .  it wouldn   t be your fault if some ole woman followed you  would it .      walter   s face was an agony of indecision but  erratic though his thinking might have been  it was no match for nanny ogg   s meretricious duplicity .  he was up against a mind that regarded truth as a reference point but certainly not as a shackle .  nanny ogg could think her way through a corkscrew in a tornado without touching the sides .      anyway  it   s all right if it   s me     she added for good measure .     in fact  he prob   ly meant to say    except for mrs .  ogg     only he forgot .      slowly  walter reached out and picked up a candle .  without saying a word he walked out of the door and into the damp darkness of the cellars .   nanny ogg followed him  her boots making squelching noises in the mud .   it didn   t seem like much of a distance .  as far as nanny could work out they were no longer under the opera house  but it was hard to be sure .  their shadows danced around them and they walked through other rooms  even more dark and dripping than the ones they   d been in .  walter stopped in front of a pile of timber that glistened with rot  and pulled a few of the spongy planks aside .   there were some sacks neatly piled .   nanny kicked one  and it broke .   in the flickering candlelight all that she could really see were sparkles of light as the cascade poured out  but there was no mistaking the gentle metallic scraping of lots of money .  lots and lots of money .  enough money to suggest very clearly that it belonged to either a thief or a publisher  and there didn   t seem to be any books around .      what   s this  walter .         it   s the ghost   s money mrs .  ogg .      there was a square hole in the opposite corner of the room .  water glinted a few inches below .  beside the hole were half a dozen containers of various sorts   old biscuit tins  broken bowls and the like .  there was a stick  or possibly a dead shrub  in each one .      and those  walter .  what are those .         rose bushes mrs .  ogg .         down here .  but nothing could gr        nanny stopped .   she squelched over to the pots .  they   d been filled with muck scraped from the floor .  the dead stems glistened with slime .   nothing could grow down here  of course .  there was no light .  everything that grew needed something else to feed on .  and   she moved the candle closer  and sniffed the fragrance .  yes .  it was subtle  but it was there .  roses in darkness .      well  my word  walter plinge     she said .     always one for the surprises  you are .         books were piled on mr .  bucket   s desk .      what you   re doing is wrong  granny weatherwax     said agnes from the doorway .   granny glanced up .     wrong as living other people   s lives for them .     she said .        s   matter of fact  there   s something even worse than that  which is living other people   s lives for yourself .  that kind of wrong .      agnes said nothing .  granny weatherwax couldn   t know .   granny turned back to the books .     anyway  this only looks wrong .  appearances is deceivin    .  you just pay attention to watching the corridor  madam .      she riffled through the bits of torn envelope and scribbled notes that seemed to be the opera house   s equivalent of proper accounts .  it was a mess .  in fact  it was more than a mess .  it was far too much of a mess to be a real mess  because a real mess has occasional bits of coherence  bits of what might be called random order .  rather  it was the kind of erratic mess that suggested that someone had set out to be messy .   take the account books .  they were full of tiny rows and columns  but someone hadn   t thought it worthwhile to invest in lined paper and had handwriting that wandered a bit .  there were forty rows on the left hand side but only thirty six by the time they reached the other side of the page .  it was hard to spot because of the way your eyes watered .      what are you doing .     said agnes  tearing her gaze away from the corridor .      amazin        said granny .     some things is entered twice .  and i reckon there   s a page here where someone   s added the month and taken away the time of day .         i thought you didn   t like books     said agnes .      i don   t     said granny  turning a page .     they can look you right in the face and still lie .  how many fiddle players are there in the band .         i think there are nine violinists in the orchestra .      the correction appeared to pass unnoticed .      well  there   s a thing     said granny  without moving her head .     seems that twelve of    em are drawing wages  but three of    em is over the page  so you mightn   t notice .     she looked up and rubbed her hands happily .     unless you   ve got a good memory  that is .      she ran a skinny finger down another erratic column .     what   s a flying ratchet .         i don   t know .         says here    repairs to flying ratchet  new springs for rotation cog assembly  and making good .  hundred and sixty dollars and sixty three pence .     hah .      she licked her finger and tried another page .      even nanny ain   t this bad at numbers     she said .     to be this bad at numbers you   ve got to be good .  hah .  no wonder this place never makes any money .  you might as well try to fill a sieve .      agnes darted into the room .     there   s someone coming .      granny got up and blew out the lamp .     you get behind the curtains     she commanded .      what   re you going to do .         oh   i   ll just have to make myself inconspicuous        agnes hurried across to the big window and turned to look at granny  who was standing by the fireplace .   the old witch faded .  she didn   t disappear .  she merely slid into the background .   an arm gradually became part of the mantelpiece .  a fold of her dress was a piece of shadow .  an elbow became the top of the chair behind her .  her face became one with a vase of faded flowers .   she was still there  like the old woman in the puzzle picture they sometimes printed in the almanack  where you could see the old woman or the young girl but not both at once  because one was made of the shadows of the other .  granny weatherwax was standing by the fireplace  but you could see her only if you knew she was there .   agnes blinked .  and there were just the shadows  the chair and the fire .   the door opened .  she ducked behind the curtains  feeling as conspicuous as a strawberry in a stew  certain that the sound of her heart would give her away .   the door shut  carefully  with barely a click .  footsteps crossed the floor .  a wooden scraping noise might have been a chair being moved slightly .   a scratch and a hiss were the sound of a match  striking .  a clink was the glass of the lamp  being lifted     all noise ceased .   agnes crouched  every muscle suddenly screaming with the strain .  the lamp hadn   t been lit   she   d have seen the light around the curtain .   someone out there was making no noise .   someone out there was suddenly suspicious .   a floorboard squeaked verrrry slowwwly  as someone shifted their weight .   she felt as if she was going to scream  or burst with the effort of silence .  the handle of the window behind her  a mere point of pressure a moment ago  was trying seriously to become part of her life .  her mouth was so dry that she knew it   d creak like a hinge if she dared to swallow .   it couldn   t be anyone who had a right to be here .  people who had a right to be in places walked around noisily .   the handle was getting really personal .   try to think of something else     the curtain moved .  someone was standing on the other side of it .   if her throat weren   t so arid she might be able to scream .   she could feel the presence through the cloth .  any moment now  someone was going to twitch the curtain aside .   she leapt  or as close to a leap as was feasible   it was a kind of vertical lumber  billowing the curtain aside  colliding with a slim body behind it  and ending on the floor in a tangle of limbs and ripping velvet .   she gulped air  and pressed down on the squirming bundle below her .      i   ll scream .     she said .     and if i do your eardrums will come down your nose .      the writhing stopped .      perdifa .     said a muffled voice .   above her  the curtain rail sagged at one end and the brass rings  one at a time  spun toward the floor .      nanny went back to the sacks .  each one bulged with round hard shapes that clinked gently under her questing finger .      this is a lot of money  walter     she said carefully .      yes mrs .  ogg .      nanny lost track of money fairly easily  although this didn   t mean the subject didn   t interest her  it was just that  beyond a certain point  it became dreamlike .  all she could be sure of was that the amount in front of her would make anyone   s drawers drop .      i suppose     she said     that if i was to ask you how it   d got here  you   d say it was the ghost  yes .  like the roses .         yes mrs .  ogg .      she gave him a worried look .     you   ll be all right down here  will you .     she said .     you   ll sit quiet .  i reckon i need to talk to some people .         where   s my mum mrs .  ogg .         she   s having a nice sleep  walter .      walter seemed satisfied with this .      you   ll sit quiet in your   in that room  will you .         yes mrs .  ogg .         there   s a good boy .      she glanced at the money bags again .  money was trouble .      agnes sat back .   andr   raised himself on his elbows and pulled the curtain off his face .     what the hell were you doing there .     he said .      i was   what do you mean  what was i doing there .  you were creeping around .         you were hiding behind the curtain .     said andr    getting to his feet and fumbling for the matches again .     next time you blow out a lamp  remember it   ll still be warm .         we were   on important business        the lamp glowed .  andr   turned .     we .     he said .   agnes nodded  and looked across at granny .  the witch hadn   t moved  although it took a deliberate effort of will to focus on her among the shapes and shadows .   andr   picked up the lamp and stepped forward .   the shadows shifted .      well .     he said .   agnes strode across the room and waved a hand in the air .  there was the chair back  there was the vase  there was   nothing else .      but she was there .         a ghost  eh .     said andr   sarcastically .   agnes backed away .   there is something about the light of a lamp held lower than someone   s face .  the shadows are wrong .  they fall in unfortunate places .  teeth seem more prominent .  agnes came to realize that she was alone in a room in suspicious circumstances with a man whose face suddenly looked a lot more unpleasant than it had before .      i suggest     he said     that you get back to the stage right now  yes .  that would be the very best thing you could do .  and don   t meddle in things that don   t concern you .  you   ve done too much as it is .      the fear hadn   t drained out of agnes  but it had found a space in which to metamorphose into anger .      i don   t have to put up with that .  for all i know  you might be the ghost .         really .  i was told that walter plinge was the ghost     said andr   .     how many people did you tell .  and now it turns out that he   s dead           no  he   s not .      it was out before she could stop it .  she   d said it merely to wipe the sneer off his face .  this happened .  but the expression that replaced it was no improvement .   a floorboard creaked .   they both turned .   there was a hat stand in the corner  next to a bookcase .  there were a few coats and scarves hanging from it .  it was surely only the way that the shadows fell that made it look  from this angle  like an old woman .  or        damn floors     said granny  fading into the foreground .  she stepped away from the coats .   as agnes said  later  it wasn   t as though she   d been invisible .  she   d simply become part of the scenery until she put herself forward again  she was there  but not there .  she didn   t stand out at all .  she was as unnoticeable as the very best of butlers .      how did you get in .     said andr   .     i looked all round the room .         seein    is believin        said granny  calmly .     of course  the trouble is that believin    is also seein     and there   s been too much of that round here lately .  now  i know you ain   t the ghost   so what are you  to be sneaking around in places where you shouldn   t be .         i could ask you the same quest           me .  i   m a witch  and i   m pretty good at it .         she   s  er  from lancre .  where i come from     agnes mumbled  trying to look at her feet .      oh .  not the one who wrote the book .     said andr   .     i   ve heard people talking about           no .  i   m much worse than her  understand .         she is     mumbled agnes .   andr   gave granny a long look  like a man weighing up his chances .  he must have decided that they were bobbing along the ceiling .      i   hang around in dark places looking for trouble     he said .      really .  there   s a nasty name for people like that     snapped granny .      yes     said andr   .     it   s    policeman .            nanny ogg climbed out of the cellars  rubbing her chin thoughtfully .  musicians and singers were still milling around  uncertain about what was going to happen next .  the ghost had had the decency to be chased and killed during the interval .  in theory that meant there was no reason why there shouldn   t be a third act  as soon as herr trubelmacher had scoured the nearby pubs and dragged the orchestra back .  the show must go on .   yes  she thought  it has to go on .  it   s like the buildup to a thunderstorm   no   it   s more like making love .  yes .  that was a far more oggish metaphor .  you put everything you   ve got into it  so sooner or later there   s a point where it   s got to go on  because you can   t imagine stopping .  the stage manager could dock a couple of dollars from their wages and they   d still go on  and everyone knew it .  and they would still go on .   she reached a ladder and climbed slowly into the flies .   she hadn   t been certain .  she needed to be certain now .   the fly loft was empty .  she walked carefully along the catwalk until she was over the auditorium .  the buzz of the audience came through the ceiling beneath her  slightly muffled .   light shone up at the point where the thick cable for the chandelier disappeared into the hole .  she stepped out over the creaking trapdoor and peered down .   terrific heat almost frizzled her hair .  a few yards below her hundreds of candles were burning .      dreadful if that lot fell down     she said quietly .     i    spect this place   d go up like a haystack        she let her gaze travel up and up the cable to the point  at just about waist height  where it was half cut through .  you   d never see it  if you weren   t expecting to find it .   then her gaze dropped again  and moved across the gloomy  dusty floor until it found something half hidden in the dust .   behind her  a shadow among the shadows rose to its feet  balanced itself carefully  and started to run .         i knows about policemen     said granny .     they   ve got big helmets and big feet and you can see them a mile off .  there   s a couple lurching around backstage .  anyone can see they   re policemen .  you don   t look like one .     she turned the badge over and over in her hands .     i ain   t happy with the idea of secret policemen     she said .     why do you need secret policemen .         because     said andr       sometimes you have secret criminals .      granny almost smiled .     that   s a fact     she said .  she peered at the small engraving on the back of the badge .     says here    cable street particulars              there aren   t many of us     said andr   .     we   ve only just started .  commander vimes said that  since we can   t do anything about the thieves    guild and the assassins    guild  we   d better look for other crimes .  hidden crimes .  that need watchmen with   different skills .  and i can play the piano quite well           what kind of skills have that troll and that dwarf got .     said granny .     seems to me the only thing they   re really good at is standing around looking obvious and stupi   hah .  yes           right .  and they didn   t even need much training     said andr   .     commander vimes says they   re the most obvious policemen anyone could think of .  incidentally  corporal nobbs has got some papers to prove he   s a human being .         forged .         i don   t think so .      granny weatherwax put her head on one side .     if your house was on fire  what   s the first thing you   d take out of it .         oh  granny       agnes began .      hmm .  who set fire to it .     said andr   .      you   re a policeman  right enough .     granny handed him his badge .     you come to arrest poor walter .     she said .      i know he didn   t murder dr .  undershaft .  i was watching him .  he was trying to unblock the privies all afternoon           i   ve had proof that walter isn   t the ghost     said agnes .      i was almost sure it was salzella     said andr   .     i know he creeps off to the cellars sometimes and i   m sure he   s stealing money .  but the ghost has been seen when salzella is perfectly visible .  so now i think           think .  think .     said granny .     someone thinking around here at last .  how   d you recognize the ghost  mister policeman .         well   he   s got a mask on           really .  now say it again  and listen to what you say .  good grief .  you can recognize him because he   s got a mask on .  you recognize him because you don   t know who he is .  life isn   t neat .  whoever said there   s only one ghost .         the figure ran through the shadows of the fly loft  cloak billowing around it .  nanny ogg was outlined against the light  peering down .   she said  without turning her head     hello  mr .  ghost .  come back for your saw  have you .      then she darted around behind the cable until she faced the shadow .     millions of people knows i   m up here .  you wouldn   t hurt a little old lady  would you .  oh  dear   me poor old heart .      she keeled over backward  hitting the floor hard enough to make the cable swing .   the figure hesitated .  then it took a length of thin rope from a pocket and advanced cautiously toward the fallen witch .  it knelt down  wound an end of the rope around each hand  and leaned forward .   nanny   s knee came up sharply .      feels a lot better now  mister     she said  as he reared backward .   she scrambled up again and grabbed the saw .      come back to finish it  eh .     she said  waving the implement in the air .     wonder how you   d blame that on walter .  make you happy  would it  the whole place burning down .      the figure  moving awkwardly  backed away as she advanced .  then it turned  lurched along the wobbling catwalk and disappeared into the gloom .   nanny pounded after him and saw the figure climbing down a ladder .  she looked around quickly  grabbed a rope to slide after him  and heard a pulley somewhere above start to clatter .   she descended  skirts billowing around her .  when she was about halfway down  a bunch of sandbags went upward past her in a hurry .   as she rattled onward she saw  between her boots  someone struggling with the trapdoor to the cellars .   she landed a few feet away  still holding the rope .      mr .  salzella .      nanny stuck two fingers in her mouth and let out a whistle that could have melted earwax .   she let go of the rope .   salzella glanced up at her as he raised the trapdoor  and then saw the shape dropping out of the roof .   one hundred and eighty pounds of sandbag hit the door  slamming it shut .      watch out .     said nanny  cheerfully .      bucket waited nervously in the wings .  unnecessarily nervously  of course .  the ghost was dead .  there couldn   t be anything to worry about .  people said they   d seen him killed  although they were  bucket had to admit  a bit hazy on the actual details .   nothing to worry about .   not a thing .   nothing whatsoever in any way .   everything was absolutely nothing to worry about in any way .   he ran a finger around the inside of his collar .  it hadn   t been such a bad life in wholesale cheese .  the most you had to worry about was one of poor old reg plenty   s trouser buttons in the farmhouse nutty and the time young weevins minced his thumb in the stirring machine and it was only by luck they happened to be doing strawberry yogurt at the time     a figure loomed up beside him .  he clutched at a curtain for support and then turned to see  with relief  the majestic and reassuring stomach of enrico basilica .  the tenor looked magnificent in a huge cockerel costume  complete with giant beak  wattles and comb .      ah  se  or     bucket burbled .     very impressive  may i say .         si     said a muffled voice from somewhere behind the beak  as other members of the company hurried past onto the stage .      may i say how sorry i am about all that business earlier .  i can assure you that it doesn   t happen every night  ahahah           si .         probably just high spirits  ahaha        the beak turned toward him .  bucket backed away .      si .            yes   well  i   m glad you   re so understanding        temperamental  he thought  as the tenor strode onto the stage and the overture to act three drifted to its close .  they   re like that  the real artistes .  nerves stretched like rubber bands  i expect .  it   s just like waiting for the cheese  really .  you can get really edgy waiting to see whether you   ve got half a ton of best blue vein or just a vat full of pig food .  it   s probably like that when you   ve got an aria working its way up        where   d he go .  where   d he go .         what .  oh   mrs .  ogg        the old woman waved a saw in front of his face .  it was not  in mr .  bucket   s current state of mental tension  a helpful gesture .   he was suddenly surrounded by other figures  equally conducive to multiple exclamation marks .      perdita .  why aren   t you onstage   oh  lady esmerelda  i didn   t see you there  of course if you want to come backstage you only have to           where   s salzella .     said andr   .   bucket looked around vaguely .     he was here a few minutes ago   that is     he said  pulling himself together     mr .  salzella is probably attending to his duties somewhere which  young man  is more than i can say for           i demand you stop the show now     said andr   .      oh  you do  do you .  and by what authority  may i ask .         he   s been sawing through the rope .     said nanny .   andr   pulled out a badge .     this .      bucket looked closely .        ankh morpork guild of musicians member         .      andr   glared at him  then at the badge  and started to pat his pockets urgently .     no .  blast  i know i had the other one a moment ago   look  you   ve got to clear the theater  we   ve got to search it  and that means           don   t stop the show     said granny .      i won   t stop the show     said bucket .         cos i reckon he   d like to see the show stopped .  the show must go on  eh .  isn   t that what you believe .  could he have got out of the building .         i sent corporal nobbs to the stage door and sergeant detritus is in the foyer     said andr   .     when it comes to standing in doorways  they   re among the best .         excuse me  what   s happening .     said bucket .      he could be anywhere .     said agnes .     there   re hundreds of hiding places .         who .     said bucket .      how about these cellars everyone talks about .     said granny .      where .         there   s only one entrance     said andr   .     he   s not stupid .         he can   t get into the cellars     said nanny .     he ran off .  probably in a cupboard somewhere by now .         no  he   ll stay where there   s crowds     said granny .     that   s what i   d do .         what .     said bucket .      could he have got into the audience from here .     said nanny .      who .     said bucket .   granny jerked a thumb toward the stage .     he   s somewhere on there .  i can feel him .         then we   ll wait until he comes off .         eighty people coming offstage all at once .     said agnes .     don   t you know what it   s like when the curtain goes down .         and we don   t want to stop the show     granny mused .      no  we don   t want to stop the show     said bucket  grasping at a familiar idea as it swept by on a tide of incomprehensibility .     or give people their money back in any fashion whatsoever .  what are we talking about  does anyone know .         the show must go on       murmured granny weatherwax  still staring out of the wings .     things have to end right .  this is an opera house .  they should end   operatically        nanny ogg hopped up and down excitedly .     oo  i know what you   re thinking  esme .     she squeaked .     oo  yes .  can we .  just so   s i can say i done it .  eh .  can we .  go on .  let   s .         henry lawsy peered closely at his opera notes .  he had not  of course  fully understood the events of the first two acts  but knew that this was perfectly okay because one would have to be quite na  ve to expect good sense as well as good songs .  anyway  it would all be explained in the last act  which was the masked ball in the duke   s palace .  it would almost certainly turn out that the woman one of the men had been rather daringly courting would be his own wife  but so cunningly disguised by a very small mask that her husband wouldn   t have spotted that she wore the same clothes and had the same hairstyle .  someone   s serving man would turn out to be someone else   s daughter in disguise  someone would die of something that didn   t prevent them from singing about it for several minutes  and the plot would be resolved by some coincidences which  in real life  would be as likely as a cardboard hammer .   he didn   t know any of this for a fact .  he was making a calculated guess .   in the meantime act three opened with the traditional ballet  this time apparently a country dance by the maidens of the court .   henry was aware of muffled laughter around him .   this was because  if you ran an eye at head height along the row of ballerinas as they tripped  arm in arm  onto the stage  there was an apparent gap .   this was only filled if the gaze went downward a foot or two  to a small fat ballerina in a huge grin  an overstretched tutu  long white drawers and   boots .   henry stared .  they were big boots .  they moved back and forth at an astonishing speed .  the satin slippers of the other dancers twinkled as they drifted across the floor  but the boots flashed and clattered like a tap dancer afraid of falling into the sink .   the pirouettes were novel  too .  while the other dancers whirled like snowflakes  the little fat one spun like a top and moved across the floor like one  too  bits of her anatomy trying to achieve local orbit .   around henry members of the audience were whispering to one another .      oh yes     he heard someone declare     they tried this in pseudopolis        his mother nudged him .     this supposed to happen .         er   i don   t think so              s bloody good  though .  a good laugh .      as the fat ballerina collided with a donkey in evening dress she staggered and grabbed at his mask  which came off     herr trubelmacher  the conductor  froze in horror and astonishment .  around him the orchestra rattled to a standstill  except for the tuba player        oom bah oom bah oom bah        who had memorized his score years ago and never took much interest in current affairs .   two figures rose up right in front of trubelmacher .  a hand grabbed his baton .      sorry  sir     said andr       but the show must go on  yes .     he handed the stick to the other figure .      there you are     he said .     and don   t let them stop .         ook .      the librarian carefully lifted herr trubelmacher aside with one hand  licked the baton thoughtfully  and then focused his gaze on the tuba player .      oom bah oom bahhhh   oom   om     the tuba player tapped a trombonist on the shoulder .      hey  frank  there   s a monkey where old troublemaker should be           shutupshutupshutup .      satisfied  the orangutan raised his arms .   the orchestra looked up .  and then looked up a bit more .  no conductor in musical history  not even the one who once fried and ate the piccolo player   s liver on a cymbal for one wrong note too many  not even the one who skewered three troublesome violinists on his baton  not even the one who made really hurtful sarcastic remarks in a loud voice  was ever the focus of such reverential attention .   onstage  nanny ogg took advantage of the hush to pull the head off a frog .      madam .         sorry  thought you might be someone else        the long arms dropped .  the orchestra  in one huge muddled chord  slammed back into life .   the dancers  after a moment   s confusion during which nanny ogg took the opportunity to decapitate a clown and a phoenix  tried to continue .   the chorus watched in bemusement .   christine felt a tap on her shoulder  and turned to see agnes .     perdita .  where have you been .  .     she hissed .     it   s nearly time for my duet with enrico .         you   ve got to help .     hissed agnes .  but down in her soul perdita said  enrico  eh .  it   s se  or basilica to everyone else        help you what .  .     said christine .      take everyone   s masks off .      christine   s forehead wrinkled beautifully .     that   s not supposed to happen until the end of the opera  is it .         er   it   s all been changed .     said agnes urgently .  she turned to a nobleman in a zebra mask and tugged it desperately .  the singer underneath glared at her .      sorry .     she whispered .     i thought you were someone else .         we   re not supposed to take them off until the end .         it   s been changed .         has it .  no one told me .      a short necked giraffe next to him leaned sideways .     what   s that .         the big unmasking scene is now  apparently .         no one told me .         yes  but when does anyone ever tell us anything .  we   re only the chorus   here  why is old troublemaker wearing a monkey mask    .      nanny ogg pirouetted past  cannoned into an elephant in evening dress and beheaded him by the trunk .  she whispered     we   re looking for the ghost  see .         but   the ghost is dead  isn   t he .         hard things to kill  ghosts     said nanny .   the whisper spread outward from that point .  there is nothing like a chorus for rumor .  people who would not believe a high priest if he said the sky was blue  and was able to produce signed affidavits to this effect from his white haired old mother and three vestal virgins  would trust just about anything whispered darkly behind their hand by a complete stranger in a pub .   a cockatoo spun around and pulled the mask off a parrot        bucket sobbed .  this was worse than the day the buttermilk exploded .  this was worse than the flash heatwave that had led a whole warehouseful of lancre extra strong to riot .   the opera had turned into a pantomime .   the audience was laughing .   about the only character still with a mask on was se  or basilica  who was watching the struggling chorus with as much aloof amazement as his own mask could convey   and this  amazingly enough  was quite a lot .      oh  no       moaned bucket .     we   ll never live it down .  he   ll never come back .  it   ll be all over the opera circuit and no one will ever want to come here ever again .         ever again wha    .     mumbled a voice behind him .   bucket turned .     oh  se  or basilica     he said .     didn   t see you there   i was just thinking  i do hope you don   t think this is typical .      se  or basilica stared through him  swaying slightly from side to side .  he was wearing a torn shirt .      summon       he said .      i   m sorry .         summon   summon hit me onna head     said the tenor .     wanna glassa water pliss           but you   re   just about   to   sing   aren   t you .     said bucket .  he grabbed the stunned man by the collar to pull him closer  but this simply meant that he dragged himself off the floor  bringing his shoes about level with basilica   s knees .     tell me   you   re out there   on the stage   please .  .  .      even in his stunned state  enrico basilica a . k . a .  henry slugg recognized what might be called the essential dichotomy of the statement .  he stuck to what he knew .      summon bashed me inna corridor       he volunteered .      that   s not you out there .      basilica blinked heavily .        m not me .         you   re going to sing the famous duet in a moment .  .  .      another thought staggered through basilica   s abused skull .        m i .     he said       s good      ll look forwa    to that .  ne   er had a chance to hear me befo           he gave a happy little sigh and fell full length backward .   bucket leaned against a pillar for support .  then his brow furrowed and  in the best traditions of the extended double take  he stared at the fallen tenor and counted to one on his fingers .  then he turned toward the stage and counted to two .   he could feel a fourth exclamation mark coming on any time now .      the enrico basilica onstage turned his mask this way and that .  stage right  bucket was whispering to a group of stagehands .  stage left  andr   the secret pianist was waiting .  a large troll loomed next to him .   the fat red singer walked to center stage as the prelude to the duet began .  the audience settled down again .  fun and games among the chorus was all very well   it might even be in the plot   but this was what they   d paid for .  this was what it was all about .   agnes stared at him as christine walked toward him .  now she could see he wasn   t right .  oh  he was fat  in a pillow up your shirt sort of way  but he didn   t move like basilica .  basilica moved lightly on his feet  as fat men often do  giving the effect of a barely tethered balloon .   she glanced at nanny  who was also watching him carefully .  she couldn   t see granny weatherwax anywhere .  that probably meant she was really close .   the expectancy of the audience dragged at them all .  ears opened like petals .  the fourth wall of the stage  the big black sucking darkness outside  was a well of silence begging to be filled up .   christine was walking toward him quite unconcerned .  christine would walk into a dragon   s mouth if it had a sign on it saying    totally harmless  i promise you      at least  if it was printed in large  easy to understand letters .   no one seemed to want to do anything .   it was a famous duet .  and a beautiful one .  agnes ought to know .  she   d been singing it all last night .   christine took the false basilica   s hand and  as the opening bars of the duet began  opened her mouth        stop right there .      agnes put everything she could into it .  the chandelier tinkled .   the orchestra went silent in a skid of wheezes and twangs .   in a fading of chords and a dying of echoes  the show stopped .      walter plinge sat in the candlelit gloom under the stage  his hands resting on his lap .  it was not often that walter plinge had nothing to do  but  when he did have nothing to do  he did nothing .   he liked it down here .  it was familiar .  the sounds of the opera filtered through .  they were muffled  but that didn   t matter .  walter knew all the words  every note of music  every step of every dance .  he needed the actual performances only in the same way that a clock needs its tiny little escapement mechanism  it kept him ticking nicely .   mrs .  plinge had taught him to read using the old programs .  that   s how he knew he was part of it all .  but he knew that anyway .  he   d cut what teeth he had on a helmet with horns on it .  the first bed he could remember was the very same trampoline used by dame gigli in the infamous bouncing gigli incident .   walter plinge lived opera .  he breathed its songs  painted its scenery  lit its fires  washed its floors and shined its shoes .  opera filled up places in walter plinge that might otherwise have been empty .   and now the show had stopped .   but all the energy  all the raw pent up emotion that is dammed up behind a show   all the screaming  the fears  the hopes  the desires   flew on  like a body hurled from the wreckage .   the terrible momentum smashed into walter plinge like a tidal wave hitting a teacup .   it propelled him out of his chair and flung him against the crumbling scenery .   he slid down and rolled into a twitching heap on the floor  clapping his hands over his ears to shut out the sudden  unnatural silence .   a shape stepped out of the shadows .   granny weatherwax had never heard of psychiatry and would have had no truck with it even if she had .  there are some arts too black even for a witch .  she practiced headology   practiced  in fact  until she was very good at it .  and though there may be some superficial similarities between a psychiatrist and a headologist  there is a huge practical difference .  a psychiatrist  dealing with a man who fears he is being followed by a large and terrible monster  will endeavor to convince him that monsters don   t exist .  granny weatherwax would simply give him a chair to stand on and a very heavy stick .      stand up  walter plinge     she said .   walter stood up  staring straight ahead of him .     it   s stopped .  it   s stopped .  it   s bad luck to stop the show .     he said hoarsely .      someone better start it again     said granny .      you can   t stop the show .  it   s the show .         yes .  someone better start it again  walter plinge .      walter didn   t appear to notice her .  he pawed aimlessly through his stack of music and ran his hands through the drifts of old programs .  one hand touched the keyboard of the harmonium and played a few neurotic notes .      wrong to stop .  show must go on           mr .  salzella is trying to stop the show  isn   t he  walter .      walter   s head shot up .  he stared straight ahead of him .      you haven   t seen anything  walter plinge .     he said  in a voice so like salzella   s that even granny raised an eyebrow .     and if you tell lies  you will be locked up and i   ll see to it that there   s big trouble for your mother .      granny nodded .      he found out about the ghost  didn   t he .     she said .     the ghost who comes out when he has a mask on   doesn   t he  walter plinge .  and the man thought  i can use that .  and when it   s time for the ghost to be caught   well  there is a ghost that can be caught .  and the best thing is that everyone will believe it .  they   ll feel bad about themselves  maybe  but they   ll believe it .  even walter plinge won   t be certain     cos his mind   s all tangled up .      granny took a deep breath .     it   s tangled  but it ain   t twisted .     there was a sigh .     well  matters will have to resolve themselves .  there   s nothing else for it .      she removed her hat and fished around in the point .     i don   t mind tellin    you this  walter     she said     because you won   t understand and you won   t remember .  there was a wicked ole witch once called black aliss .  she was an unholy terror .  there   s never been one worse or more powerful .  until now .  because i could spit in her eye and steal her teeth  see .  because she didn   t know right from wrong  so she got all twisted up and that was the end of her .      the trouble is  you see  that if you do know right from wrong you can   t choose wrong .  you just can   t do it and live .  so   if i was a bad witch i could make mister salzella   s muscles turn against his bones and break them where he stood   if i was bad .  i could do things inside his head  change the shape he thinks he is  and he   d be down on what   d been his knees and begging to be turned into a frog   if i was bad .  i could leave him with a mind like a scrambled egg  listening to colors and hearing smells   if i was bad .  oh  yes .     there was another sigh  deeper and more heartfelt .     but i can   t do none of that stuff .  that wouldn   t be right .      she gave a deprecating little chuckle .  and if nanny ogg had been listening  she would have resolved as follows  that no maddened cackle from black aliss of infamous memory  no evil little giggle from some crazed vampyre whose morals were worse than his spelling  no side splitting guffaw from the most inventive torturer  was quite so unnerving as a happy little chuckle from a granny weatherwax about to do what   s best .   from the point of her hat granny withdrew a paper thin mask .  it was a simple face   smooth  white  basic .  there were semicircular holes for the eyes .  it was neither happy nor sad .   she turned it over in her hands .  walter seemed to stop breathing .      simple thing  ain   t it .     said granny .     looks beautiful  but it   s really just a simple bit of stuff  just like any other mask .  wizards could poke at this for a year and still say there was nothing magic about it  eh .  which just shows how much they know  walter plinge .      she tossed it to him .  he caught it hungrily and pulled it over his face .   then he stood up in one flowing movement  moving like a dancer .      i don   t know what you are when you   re behind the mask     said granny     but    ghost    is just another word for    spirit    and    spirit    is just another word for    soul .     off you go  walter plinge .      the masked figure did not move .      i meant   off you go  ghost .  the show must go on .      the mask nodded  and darted away .   granny slapped her hands together like the crack of doom .      right .  let   s do some good .     she said  to the universe at large .      everyone was looking at her .   this was a moment in time  a little point between the past and future  when a second could stretch out and out     agnes felt the blush begin .  it was heading for her face like the revenge of the volcano god .  when it got there  she knew  it would be all over for her .   you   ll apologize  perdita jeered .      shut up .     shouted agnes .   she strode forward before the echo had had time to come back from the farther ends of the auditorium  and wrenched at the red mask .   the entire chorus came in on cue .  this was opera  after all .  the show had stopped  but opera continued        salzella .      he grabbed agnes  clamping his hand over her mouth .  his other hand flew to his belt and drew his sword .   it wasn   t a stage prop .  the blade hissed through the air as he spun to face the chorus .      oh dear oh dear oh dear     he said .     how extremely operatic of me .  and now  i fear  i shall have to take this poor girl hostage .  it   s the appropriate thing to do  isn   t it .      he looked around triumphantly .  the audience watched in fascinated silence .      isn   t anyone going to say    you won   t get away with this    .     he said .      you won   t get away with this     said andr    from the wings .      you have the place surrounded  i have no doubt .     said salzella brightly .      yes  we have the place surrounded .      christine screamed and fainted .   salzella smiled even more brightly .      ah  now there   s someone operatic .     he said .     but  you see  i am going to get away with it  because i don   t think operatically .  myself and this young lady here are going to go down to the cellars where i may  possibly  leave her unharmed .  i doubt very much that you have the cellars surrounded .  even i don   t know everywhere they go  and believe me my knowledge is really rather extensive        he paused .  agnes tried to break free  but his grip tightened around her neck .      by now     he said     someone should have said     but why  salzella .     honestly  do i have to do everything around here .      bucket realized he had his mouth open .     that   s what i was going to say .     he said .      ah  good .  well  in that case  i should say something like  because i wanted to .  because i rather like money  you see .  but more than that      he took a deep breath      i really hate opera .  i don   t want to get needlessly excited about this  but opera  i am afraid  really is dreadful .  and i have had enough .  so  while i have the stage  let me tell you what a wretched  self adoring  totally unrealistic  worthless art form it is  what a terrible waste of fine music  what a        there was a whirr off on one side of the stage .  the skirts of costumes began to flap .  dust flew up .   andr   looked around .  beside him  the wind machine had started up .  the handle was turning by itself .   salzella turned to see what everyone was staring at .   the ghost had dropped lightly onto the stage .  his opera cloak billowed around him   operatically .   he bowed slightly  and drew his sword .      but you   re dea       salzella began .     oh  yes .  a ghost of a ghost .  totally unbelievable and an offense against common sense  in the best operatic tradition .  this was really too much to hope for .      he thrust agnes away  and nodded happily .      that   s what opera does to a man     he said .     it rots the brain  you see  and i doubt whether he had too much of that to begin with .  it drives people mad .  mad  d   you hear me  mad .  .  ahem .  they act irrationally .  don   t you think i   ve watched you  over the years .  it   s like a hothouse for insanity .  .  d   you hear me .  insanity .  .      he and the ghost began to circle one another .      you don   t know what it has been like  i assure you  being the only sane man in this madhouse .  .  you believe anything .  .  you   d prefer to believe a ghost can be in two places at once than that there might simply be two people .  .  even pounder thought he could blackmail me .  .  poking around in places that he shouldn   t .  .  well  of course  i had to kill him for his own good .  this place sends even rat catchers mad .  .  and undershaft   well  why couldn   t he have forgotten his glasses like he usually did  eh .      he lashed out with his sword .  the ghost parried .      and now i   ll fight your ghost     he said  moving forward in a flurry of strokes     and you   ll notice that our ghost here doesn   t actually know how to fence   because he only knows stage fencing  you see   where the whole point  of course  is simply to hit the other fellow   s sword with a suitably impressive metallic noise   so that you can die very dramatically merely because he   s carefully thrust his sword under your armpit        the ghost was forced to retreat under the onslaught  until he fell backward over the unconscious body of christine .      see .     said salzella .     that   s what comes of believing in opera .  .  .      he reached down quickly and tugged the mask off walter plinge   s face .      really  walter .  .  .  you are a bad boy .  .  .  .         sorry mr .  salzella .         look how everyone   s staring .  .  .  .         sorry mr .  salzella .      the mask crumpled in salzella   s fingers .  he let the fragments tumble to the floor .  then he pulled walter to his feet .      see  company .  this is your luck .  .  .  this is your ghost .  .  .  without his mask he   s just an idiot who can hardly tie his shoelaces .  .  .  ahahaha .  .  .  .  ahem .  it   s all your fault  walter plinge           yes mr .  salzella .         no .      salzella looked around .   a voice said     no one would believe walter plinge .  even walter plinge gets confused about the things walter plinge sees .  even his mother was afraid he might have murdered people .  people could accept just about anything of a walter plinge .      there was a steady tapping noise .   the trapdoor opened beside salzella .   a pointy hat appeared slowly  followed by the rest of granny weatherwax  with her arms folded .  she glared at salzella as the floor clicked into place .  her foot stopped tapping on the boards .      well  well     he said .     lady esmerelda  eh .         i   m stoppin    bein    a lady  mr .  salzella .      he glanced up at the pointy hat .     so you are a witch instead .         yes  indeed .         a bad witch  no doubt .         worse .         but this     said salzella     is a sword .  everyone knows witches can   t magic iron and steel .  get out of my way .  .  .      the sword hissed down .   granny thrust out her hand .  there was a blur of flesh and steel and        she held the sword  by the blade .      tell you what  mr .  salzella     she said  levelly     it ought to be walter plinge who finishes this  eh .  it   s him you harmed  apart from the ones you murdered  o    course .  you didn   t need to do that .  but you wore a mask  didn   t you .  there   s a kind of magic in masks .  masks conceal one face  but they reveal another .  the one that only comes out in darkness .  i bet you could do just what you liked  behind a mask    .      salzella blinked at her .  he pulled on his sword  tugged hard on a sharp blade held in an unprotected hand .   there was a groan from several members of the chorus .  granny grinned .  her knuckles whitened as she redoubled her grip .   she turned her head toward walter plinge .     put your mask on  walter .      everyone looked down at the crumpled cardboard on the stage .      don   t have one anymore mistress weatherwax .      granny followed his gaze .     oh deary  deary me     she said .     well  i can see we shall have to do something about that .  look at me  walter .      he did as he was told .  granny   s eyes half closed .     you   trust perdita  don   t you  walter .         yes mistress weatherwax .         that   s good  because she   s got a new mask for you  walter plinge .  a magic one .  it   s just like your old one  d   you see  only you wear it under your skin and you don   t have to take it off and no one but you will ever need to know it   s there .  got it  perdita .         but i       agnes began .      got it .         er   oh  yes .  here it is .  yes .  i   ve got it in my hand .     she waved an empty hand vaguely .      you   re holding it the wrong way up  my girl .         oh .  sorry .         well .  give it to him  then .         er .  yes .      agnes advanced on walter .      now you take it  walter     said granny  still gripping the sword .      yes mistress weatherwax        he reached out toward agnes .  as he did so  she was sure that  just for a moment  there was a faint pressure on her fingertips .      well .  put it on .      walter looked uncertain .      you do believe there   s a mask there  don   t you  walter .     granny demanded .     perdita   s sensible and she knows an invisible mask when she sees one .      he nodded  slowly  and raised his hands to his face .   and agnes was sure that he   d somehow come into focus .  almost certainly nothing had happened that could be measured with any kind of instrument  any more than you could weigh an idea or sell good fortune by the yard .  but walter stood up  smiling faintly .      good     said granny .  she stared at salzella .      i reckon you two should fight again     she said .     but it can   t be said i   m unfair .  i expect you   ve got a ghost mask somewhere .  mrs .  ogg saw you waving it  see .  and she   s not as gormless as she looks           thank you     said a fat ballerina .         so she thought  how could people still say afterward that they   d seen the ghost .     cos that   s how you recognize the ghost  by his mask .  so there   s two masks .      under her gaze  telling himself that he could resist any time he wanted to  salzella reached into his jacket and produced his own mask .      put it on  then .     she let go of the sword .     then who you are can fight who he is .      down in the pit  the percussionist stared as his sticks rose and began a drum roll .      are you doing that  gytha .     said granny weatherwax .      i thought you were .         it   s opera  then .  the show must go on .      walter plinge raised his sword .  the masked salzella glanced from him to granny  and then lunged .   the swords met .   it was  agnes realized  stage fighting .  the swords clashed and rattled as the fighters danced back and forth across the stage .  walter wasn   t trying to hit salzella .  every thrust was parried .  every opportunity to strike back  as the director of music grew more angry  was ignored .      this isn   t fighting .     salzella shouted  standing back .     this is        walter thrust .   salzella staggered away  until he cannoned into nanny ogg .  he lurched sideways .  then he staggered forward  dropped onto one knee  got unsteadily to his feet again  and staggered into the center of the stage .      whatever happens     he gasped  wrenching off his mask     it can   t be worse than a season of opera .  .  .  .  i don   t mind where i   m going so long as there are no fat men pretending to be thin boys  and no huge long songs which everyone says are so beautiful just because they don   t understand what the hell they   re actually about .  .  .  .  ah   ah argh        he slumped to the floor .      but walter didn   t       agnes began .      shut up     said nanny ogg  out of the corner of her mouth .      but he hasn   t       bucket began .      incidentally  another thing i can   t stand about opera     said salzella  rising to his feet and reeling crabwise toward the curtains     are the plots .  they make no sense .  .  and no one ever says so .  .  .  and the quality of the acting .  it   s nonexistent .  .  everyone stands around watching the person who   s singing .  ye gods  it   s going to be a relief to put that behind   ah   argh        he slumped to the floor .      is that it .     said nanny .      shouldn   t think so     said granny weatherwax .      as for the people who attend opera     said salzella  struggling upright again and staggering sideways     i think i just possibly hate them even worse .  .  .  they   re so ignorant .  .  .  there   s hardly a one of them out there who knows the first thing about music .  .  .  they go on about tunes .  .  .  they spend all day endeavoring to be sensible human beings  and then they walk in here and they leave their intelligence on a nail by the door           then why didn   t you just leave .     snapped agnes .     if you   d stolen all this money why didn   t you just go away somewhere  if you hated it so much .      salzella stared at her while swaying back and forth .  his mouth opened and shut once or twice  as if he were trying out unfamiliar words .      leave .     he managed .     leave .  leave the opera .    argh argh argh        he hit the floor again .   andr   prodded the fallen director .     is he dead yet .     he said .      how can he be dead .     said agnes .     good grief  can   t anyone see that    .         you know what really gets me down     said salzella  rising to his knees     is the way that in opera everyone takes such a long .  .  .  .  .    time .  .  .  .  .    to .  .  .  .  .    argh   argh   argh        he keeled over .   the company waited for a while .  the audience held its collective breath .   nanny ogg poked him with a boot .     yep  that   s about it .  looks like he   s gone down for the last curtain call     she said .      but walter didn   t stab him .     said agnes .     why won   t anyone listen .  look  the sword isn   t even sticking in him .  it   s just tucked between his body and his arm  for heaven   s sake .         yes     said nanny .     i s   pose  really  it   s a shame he dint notice that .     she scratched at her shoulder .     here  these ballet dresses really tickle           but he   s dead .         got a bit overexcited  perhaps     said nanny  fidgeting with a strap .      overexcited .         frantic .  you know these artistic types .  well  you are one  of course .         he   s really dead .     said bucket .      seems to be     said granny .     one of the best operatic deaths ever  i wouldn   t mind betting .         that   s terrible .  .     bucket grabbed the former salzella by the collar and hauled him upright .     where   s my money .  come on  out with it  tell me what you   ve done with my money .  .  .  i don   t hear you .  .  .  .  he   s not saying anything .  .  .         that   s on account of being dead     said granny .     not talkative  the deceased .  as a rule .         well  you   re a witch .  .  .  can   t you do that thing with the cards and the glasses .         well  yes   we could have a poker game     said nanny .     good idea .         the money is in the cellars     said granny .     walter   ll show you .      walter plinge clicked his heels .     certainly     he said .     i would be glad to .      bucket stared .  it was walter plinge   s voice and it was coming out of walter plinge   s face  but both face and voice were different .  subtly different .  the voice had lost the uncertain  frightened edge .  the lopsided look had gone from the face .      good grief     bucket murmured  and let go of salzella   s coat .  there was a thump .      and since you   re going to be needing a new director of music     said granny     you could do worse than look to walter here .         walter .         he knows everything there is to know about opera     said granny .     and everything about the opera house  too .         you should see the music he   s written       said nanny .      walter .  musical director .     said bucket .         stuff you can really hum           yes  i think you might be surprised     said granny .         there   s one with lots of sailors dancin    around singin    about how there   s no women           this is walter  isn   t it .            and then some bloke called les who   s miserable all the time           oh  this is walter     said granny .     the same person .            and there   s one  hah  with all cats all leapin    around all singin     that was fun     nanny burbled .     can   t imagine how he thought up that one        bucket scratched his chin .  he was feeling lightheaded enough as it was .      and he   s trustworthy     said granny .     and he   s honest .  and he knows all about the opera house  as i said .  and   where everything is        that was enough for mr .  bucket .     want to be director of music  walter .     he said .      thank you  mr .  bucket     said walter plinge .     i should like that very much .  but what about cleaning the privies .         sorry .         i won   t have to stop doing them  will i .  i   ve just got them working right .         oh .  right .  really .     mr .  bucket   s eyes crossed for a moment .     well  fine .  you can sing while you   re doing it  if you like     he added generously .     and i won   t even cut your pay .  i   ll   i   ll raise it .  six   no  seven shiny dollars .      walter rubbed his face thoughtfully .     mr .  bucket           yes  walter .         i think   you paid mr .  salzella forty shiny dollars        bucket turned to granny .     is he some kind of monster .         you just listen to the stuff he   s been writin        said nanny .     amazin    songs  not even in foreign .  will you just look at this stuff      scuse me        she turned her back on the audience        twingtwangtwong        and twirled round again with a wad of music paper in her hands .      i know good music when i sees it     she said  handing it to bucket and pointing excitedly at extracts .     it   s got blobs and curly bits all over it  see .         you have been writing this music .     said bucket to walter .     which is unaccountably warm .         indeed  mr .  bucket .         in my time .         there   s a lovely song here     said nanny        don   t cry for me  genua .     it   s very sad .  that reminds me  i   d better go and see if mrs .  plinge has come rou   has woken up .  i may have overdone it a bit on the scumble .     she ambled off  twitching at bits of her costume  and nudged a fascinated ballerina .     this balleting doesn   t half make you sweat  don   t you find .         excuse me  there   s something i didn   t quite believe     said andr   .  he took salzella   s sword and tested the blade carefully .      ow .     he shouted .      sharp  is it .     said agnes .      yes .     andr   sucked his thumb .     she caught it in her hand .         she   s a witch     said agnes .      but it was steel .  i thought no one could magic steel .  everyone knows that .         i wouldn   t be too impressed if i was you     said agnes sourly .     it was probably just some kind of trick        andr   turned to granny .     your hand isn   t even scratched .  how did   you        her stare held him in its sapphire vice for a moment .  when he turned away he looked vaguely puzzled  like a man who can   t remember where he   s just put something down .      i hope he didn   t hurt christine     he mumbled .     why isn   t anyone seeing to her .         probably because she makes sure she screams and faints before anything happens     said perdita  through agnes .   andr   set off across the stage .  agnes trailed after him .  a couple of dancers were kneeling down next to christine .      it   d be terrible if anything happened to her     said andr   .      oh   yes .         everyone says she   s showing such promise        walter stepped up beside him .     yes .  we should get her somewhere     he said .  his voice was clipped and precise .   agnes felt the bottom start to drop out of her world .     yes  but   you know it was me doing the singing .         oh  yes   yes  of course       said andr    awkwardly .     but   well   this is opera   you know        walter took her hand .      but it was me you taught .     she said desperately .      then you were very good     said walter .     i suspect she will never be quite that good  even with many months of my tuition .  but  perdita  have you ever heard of the words    star quality    .         is it the same as talent .     snapped agnes .      it is rarer .      she stared at him .  his face  however it was controlled now  was quite handsome in the glare of the footlights .   she pulled her hand free .     i liked you better when you were walter plinge     she said .   agnes turned away  and felt granny weatherwax   s gaze on her .  she was sure it was a mocking gaze .      er   we ought to get christine into mr .  bucket   s office     andr   said .   this seemed to break some sort of spell .      yes  indeed .  .  .     said bucket .     and we can   t leave mr .  salzella corpsing onstage  either .  you two  you   d better take him backstage .  the rest of you   well  it was nearly over anyway   er   that   s it .  the   opera is over           walter plinge .      nanny ogg entered  supporting mrs .  plinge .  walter   s mother fixed him with a beady gaze .     have you been a bad boy .      mr .  bucket walked over to her and patted her hand .     i think you   d better come along to my office  too     he said .  he handed the sheaf of music to andr    who opened it at random .   andr   gave it a glance  and then stared .     hey   this is good     he said .      is it .      andr   looked at another page .     good heavens .         what .  what .     said bucket .      i   ve just never   i mean  even i can see   tum ti tum tum tum   yes   mr .  bucket  you do know this isn   t opera .  there   s music and   yes   dancing and singing all right  but it   s not opera .  not opera at all .  a long way from opera .         how far .  you don   t mean       bucket hesitated  savoring the idea     you don   t mean that it   s just possible that you put music in and you get money out .      andr   hummed a few bars .     this could very well be the case  mr .  bucket .      bucket beamed .  he put one arm around andr   and the other around walter .     good .  .  .  .  .     he said .     this calls for a very lar   for a medium sized drink .  .  .  .  .      one by one  or in groups  the singers and dancers left the stage .  and the witches and agnes were left alone .      is that it .     said agnes .      not quite yet     said granny .   someone staggered onto the stage .  a kindly hand had bandaged enrico basilica   s head  and presumably another kindly hand had given him the plate of spaghetti he was holding .  mild concussion still seemed to have him in its grip .  he blinked at the witches and then spoke like a man who   d lost his hold on immediate events and so was clinging hard to more ancient considerations .      summon give me some    ghetti     he said .      that   s nice     said nanny .      hah .     ghetti is fine for them as likes it   but not me .  hah .  yes .     he turned and peered muzzily at the darkness of the audience .      you know what i   m goin    to do .  you know what i   m goin    to do now .  i   m sayin    goodbye to enrico basilica .  oh yes .  he   s chewed his last tentacle .  i   m goin    to go right out now and have eight pints of turbot   s really odd .  yes .  and probably a sausage ina bun .  and then i   m goin    down to the music hall to hear nellie stamp sing    a winkle   s no use if you don   t have a pin      and if i sing again here it   s goin    to be under the proud old name of henry slugg  do you hear    .      there was a shriek from somewhere in the audience .     henry slugg .         er   yes .         i thought it was you .  you   ve grown a beard and stuffed a haystack down your trousers but  i thought  under that little mask  that   s my henry  that was .      henry slugg shaded his eyes from the footlights    glare .         angeline .         oh  no .     said agnes  wearily .     this sort of thing does not happen .         happens in the theater all the time     said nanny ogg .      it certainly does     said granny .     it   s only a mercy he doesn   t have a long lost twin brother .      there was the sound of much scuffling in the audience .  someone was climbing along a row  dragging someone else .      mother .     came a voice from the gloom .     what do you think you are doing .         you just come with me  young henry .         mother  we can   t go up on the stage    .      henry slugg frisbeed the plate into the wings  clambered down from the stage and heaved himself over the edge of the orchestra pit  assisted by a couple of violinists .   they met at the first row of seats .  agnes could just hear their voices .      i meant to come back .  you know that .         i wanted to wait but  what with one thing and another   especially one thing .  come here  young henry           mother  what is happening .         son   you know i always said your father was mr .  lawsy the eel juggler .         yes  of           please  both of you  come back to my dressing room .  i can see we   ve got such a lot to talk about .         oh  yes .  a lot        agnes watched them go .  the audience  who could spot opera even if it wasn   t being sung  applauded .      all right     she said .     and now is it the end .         nearly     said granny .      did you do something to everyone   s heads .         no  but i felt like smacking a few     said nanny .      but no one said    thank you    or anything .         often the case     said granny .      too busy thinking about the next performance     said nanny .     the show must go on     she added .      that   s   that   s madness .         it   s opera .  i noticed that even mr .  bucket   s caught it  too     said nanny .     and that young andr   has been rescued from being a policeman  if i   m any judge .         but what about me .         oh  them as makes the endings don   t get them     said granny .  she brushed an invisible speck of dust off her shoulder .      i expect we   d better be gettin    along  gytha     she said  turning her back on agnes .     early start tomorrow .      nanny walked forward  shading her eyes as she stared out into the dark maw of the auditorium .      the audience haven   t gone  you know     she said .     they   re still sitting out there .      granny joined her  and peered into the gloom .     i can   t imagine why     she said .     he did say the opera   s over        they turned and looked at agnes  who was standing in the center of the stage and glowering at nothing .      feeling a bit angry .     said nanny .     only to be expected .         yes .         feeling that everything   s happened for other people and not for you .         yes .         but     said granny weatherwax     look at it like this  what   s christine got to look forward to .  she   ll just become a singer .  stuck in a little world .  oh  maybe she   ll be good enough to get a little fame  but one day the voice   ll crack and that   s the end of her life .  you have got a choice .  you can either be on the stage  just a performer  just going through the lines   or you can be outside it  and know how the script works  where the scenery hangs  and where the trapdoors are .  isn   t that better .         no .      the infuriating thing about nanny ogg and granny weatherwax  agnes thought later  was the way they sometimes acted in tandem  without exchanging a word .  of course  there were plenty of other things   the way they never thought that meddling was meddling if they did it  the way they automatically assumed that everyone else   s business was their own  the way they went through life in a straight line  the way  in fact  that they arrived in any situation and immediately started to change it .  compared to that  acting on unspoken agreement was a mere minor annoyance  but it was here and up close .   they walked toward her  and each laid a hand on her shoulder .      feeling angry .     said granny .      yes .         i should let it out then  if i was you     said nanny .   agnes shut her eyes  clenched her fists  opened her mouth and screamed .   it started low .  plaster dust drifted down from the ceiling .  the prisms on the chandelier chimed gently as they shook .   it rose  passing quickly through the mysterious pitch at fourteen cycles per second where the human spirit begins to feel distinctly uncomfortable about the universe and the place in it of the bowels .  small items around the opera house vibrated off shelves and smashed on the floor .   the note climbed  rang like a bell  climbed again .  in the pit  all the violin strings snapped  one by one .   as the tone rose  the crystal prisms shook in the chandelier .  in the bar  champagne corks fired a salvo .  ice jingled and shattered in its bucket .  a line of wineglasses joined in the chorus  blurred around the rims  and then exploded like hazardous thistle down with attitude .   there were harmonics and echoes that caused strange effects .  in the dressing rooms the no .    greasepaint melted .  mirrors cracked  filling the ballet school with a million fractured images .   dust rose  insects fell .  in the stones of the opera house tiny particles of quartz danced briefly     then there was silence  broken by the occasional thud and tinkle .   nanny grinned .      ah     she said     now the opera   s over .         salzella opened his eyes .   the stage was empty  and dark  and nevertheless brilliantly lit .  that is  a huge shadowless light was streaming from some unseen source and yet  apart from salzella himself  there was nothing for it to illuminate .   footsteps sounded in the distance .  their owner took some time to arrive  but when he stepped into the liquid air around salzella he seemed to burst into flame .   he wore red  a red suit with red lace  a red cloak  red shoes with ruby buckles  and a broad brimmed red hat with a huge red feather .  he even walked with a long red stick  bedecked with red ribbons .  but for someone who had taken such meticulous trouble with his costume  he   d been remiss in the matter of his mask .  it was a crude one of a skull  such as might be bought in any theatrical shop   salzella could even see the string .      where did everyone go .     salzella demanded .  unpleasant recent memories were beginning to bubble up in his mind .  he couldn   t quite recall them clearly at the moment  but the taste of them was bad .   the figure said nothing .      where   s the orchestra .  what happened to the audience .      there was a barely perceptible shrug from the tall red figure .   salzella began to notice other details .  what he had thought was the stage seemed slightly gritty underfoot .  the ceiling above him was a long way away  perhaps as far away as anything could be  and was filled with cold  hard points of light .      i asked you a question .      three questions  in fact .   the words turned up on the inside of salzella   s ears with no suggestion that they had had to travel like normal sound .      you didn   t answer me .      some things you have to work out for yourself  and this is one of them  believe me .      who are you .  you   re not a member of the cast  i know that .  take off that mask .      as you wish .  i do like to get into the spirit of the thing .   the figure removed its mask .      and now take off that other mask .     said salzella  as the frozen fingers of dread rose through him .   death touched a secret spring on the stick .  a blade shot out  so thin that it was transparent  its edge glittering blue as air molecules were sliced into their component atoms .   ah  he said  raising the scythe .  there i think you have me .      it was dark in the cellars  but nanny ogg had walked alone in the strange caverns under lancre and through the nighttime forests with granny weatherwax .  darkness held no fears for an ogg .   she struck a match .      greebo .      people had been tramping to and fro for hours .  the darkness wasn   t private anymore .  it had taken quite a lot of people to carry all the money  for a start .  up until the end of the opera  there had been something mysterious about these cellars .  now they were just   well   damp underground rooms .  something that had lived here had moved on .   her foot rattled a piece of pottery .   she grunted as she went down on one knee .  spilled mud and shards of broken pot littered the floor .  here and there  unrooted and snapped  were some unheeded pieces of dead twig .   only some kind of fool would have stuck bits of wood in pots of mud far underground and expected anything to happen .   nanny picked one up and sniffed it tentatively .  it smelled of mud .  and nothing else .   she   d have liked to have known how it had been done .  just professional interest  of course .  and she knew she never would  now .  walter was a busy man now  up in the light .  and  for something to begin  other things had to end .      we all wears a mask of one sort or another     she said to the damp air .     no sense in upsetting things now  eh           the coach didn   t leave until seven o   clock in the morning .  by lancre standards that was practically midday .  the witches got there early .      i was hoping to shop for a few souvenirs     said nanny  stamping her feet on the cobbles to keep warm .     for the kiddies .         no time     said granny weatherwax .      not that it would have made any difference on account of me not having any money to buy    em with     nanny went on .      not my fault if you fritter your money away     said granny .      i don   t recall having a single chance to frit .         money   s only useful for the things it can do .         well  yes .  i could   ve done with having some new boots  for a start .      nanny jiggled up and down a bit  and whistled around her tooth .      nice of mrs .  palm to let us stay there gratis     she said .      yes .         o    course  i helped out playin    the piano and tellin    jokes .         an added bonus     said granny  nodding .      an    of course there was all those little nibbles i prepared .  with the special party dip .         yes indeed     said granny  poker faced .     mrs .  palm was saying only this morning that she   s thinking of retiring next year .      nanny looked up and down the street again .      i    spect young agnes   ll be turning up any minute now     she said .      i really couldn   t say     said granny haughtily .      not as though there   s much for her here  after all .      granny sniffed .     that   s up to her  i   m sure .         everyone was very impressed  i reckon  when you caught that sword in your hand        granny sighed .     hah .  yes  i expect they were .  they didn   t think clearly  did they .  people   re just lazy .  they never think  maybe she had something in her hand  a bit of metal or something .  they don   t think for a minute it was just a trick .  they don   t think there   s always a perfectly good explanation if you look for it .  they probably think it was some kind of magic .         yeah  but   you didn   t have anything in your hand  did you .         that   s not the point .  i might have done .     granny looked up and down the square .     besides  you can   t magic iron .         that   s very true .  not iron .  now  someone like ole black aliss  they could make their skin tougher than steel   but that   s just an ole legend  i expect           she could do it all right     said granny .     but you can   t go round messin    with cause and effect .  that   s what sent her mad  come the finish .  she thought she could put herself outside of things like cause and effect .  well  you can   t .  you grab a sharp sword by the blade  you get hurt .  world   d be a terrible place if people forgot that .         you weren   t hurt .         not my fault .  i didn   t have time .      nanny blew on her hands .     one good thing  though     she said .     it   s a blessing the chandelier never came down .  i was worried about that soon as i saw it .  looks too dramatic for its own good  i thought .  first thing i   d smash  if i was a loony .         yes .         haven   t been able to find greebo since last night .         good .         he always turns up  though .         unfortunately .      there was a clatter as the coach swung around the corner .   it stopped .   then the coachman tugged on the reins and it did a u turn and disappeared again .      esme .     said nanny  after a while .      yes .         there   s a man and two horses peering at us around the corner .     she raised her voice .     come on  i know you   re there .  seven o   clock  this coach is supposed to leave .  did you get the tickets  esme .         me .         ah     said nanny uncertainly .     so   we haven   t got eighty dollars for the tickets  then .         what   ve you got stuffed up your elastic .     said granny as the coach advanced cautiously .      nothin    that is legal tender for travelin    purposes  i fear .         then   no  we can   t afford tickets .      nanny sighed .     oh  well  i   ll just have to use charm .         it   s going to be a long walk     said granny .   the coach pulled up .  nanny looked up at the driver  and smiled innocently .     good morning  my good sir .      he gave her a slightly frightened but mainly suspicious look .     is it .         we are desirous of traveling to lancre but unfortunately we find ourselves a bit embarrassed in the knicker department .         you are .         but we are witches and could prob   ly pay for our travel by  e . g .   curing any embarrassing little ailments you may have .      the coachman frowned .     i ain   t carrying you for nothing  old crone .  and i haven   t got any embarrassing little ailments .      granny stepped forward .      how many would you like .     she said .      rain rolled over the plains .  it wasn   t an impressive ramtops thunderstorm but a lazy  persistent  low cloud rain  like a fat fog .  it had been following them all day .   the witches had the coach to themselves .  several people had opened the door while it had been waiting to leave  but for some reason had suddenly decided that today   s travel plans didn   t include a coach ride .      making good time     said nanny  opening the curtains and peering out of the window .      i expect the driver   s in a hurry .         yes  i    spect he is .         shut the window  though .  it   s getting wet in here .         righty ho .      nanny grabbed the strap and then suddenly poked her head out into the rain .      stop .  stop .  tell the man to stop .      the coach slewed to a halt in a sheet of mud .   nanny threw open the door .     i don   t know  trying to walk home  and in this weather  too .  you   ll catch your death .      rain and fog rolled in through the open doorway .  then a bedraggled shape pulled itself over the sill and slunk under the seats  leaving small puddles behind it .      tryin    to be independent     said nanny .     bless    im .      the coach got under way again .  granny stared out at the endless darkening fields and the relentless drizzle  and saw another figure toiling along in the mud by the road that would  eventually  reach lancre .  as the coach swept past  it drenched the walker in thin slurry .      yes  indeed .  being independent   s a fine ambition     she said  drawing the curtains .      the trees were bare when granny weatherwax got back to her cottage .   twigs and seeds had blown in under the door .  soot had fallen down the chimney .  her home  always somewhat organic  had grown a little closer to its roots in the clay .   there were things to do  so she did them .  there were leaves to be swept  and the woodpile to be built up under the eaves .  the wind sock behind the beehives  tattered by autumn storms  needed to be darned .  hay had to be got in for the goats .  apples had to be stored in the loft .  the walls could do with another coat of whitewash .   but there was something that had to be done first .  it   d make the other jobs a bit more difficult  but there was no help for that .  you couldn   t magic iron .  and you couldn   t grab a sword without being hurt .  if that wasn   t true  the world   d be all over the place .   granny made herself some tea  and then boiled up the kettle again .  she took a handful of herbs out of a box on the dresser  and dropped them in a bowl with the steaming water .  she took a length of clean bandage out of a drawer and set it carefully on the table beside the bowl .  she threaded an extremely sharp needle and laid needle and thread beside the bandage .  she scooped a fingerful of greenish ointment out of a small tin  and smeared it on a square of lint .   that seemed to be it .   she sat down  and rested her arm on the table  palm up .      well     she said  to no one in particular     i reckon i   ve got time now .         the privy had to be moved .  it was a job granny preferred to do for herself .  there was something incredibly satisfying in digging a very deep hole .  it was uncomplicated .  you knew where you were with a hole in the ground .  dirt didn   t get strange ideas  or believe that people were honest because they had a steady gaze and a firm handshake .  it just lay there  waiting for you to move it .  and  after you   d done it  you could sit there in the lovely warm knowledge that it   d be months before you had to do it again .   it was while she was at the bottom of the hole that a shadow fell across it .      afternoon  perdita     she said without looking up .   she lifted another shovelful to head height and flung it over the edge .      come home for a visit  have you .     she said .   she rammed the shovel into the clay at the bottom of the hole again  winced  and forced it down with her foot .      thought you were doing very well in the opera     she went on .        course  i   m not an expert in these things .  good to see young people seeking their fortune in the big city  though .      she looked up with a bright  friendly smile .      i see you   ve lost a bit of weight  too .     innocence hung from her words like loops of toffee .      i   ve been   taking exercise     said agnes .      exercise is a fine thing  certainly     said granny  getting back to her digging .     though they do say you can have too much of it .  when are you going back .         i   haven   t decided .         weeelll  it doesn   t pay to be always planning .  don   t tie yourself down the whole time  i   ve always said that .  staying with your ma  are you .         yes     said agnes .      ah .  only magrat   s old cottage is still empty .  you   d be doing everyone a favor if you aired it out a bit .  you know   as long as you   re here .      agnes said nothing .  she couldn   t think of anything to say .      funny ole thing     said granny  hacking around a particularly troublesome tree root .     i wouldn   t tell everyone  but i was only thinking the other day  about when i was younger and called myself endemonidia           you did .  when .      granny rubbed her forehead with her bandaged hand  leaving a clay red smudge .      oh  for about three  four hours     she said .     some names don   t have the stayin    power .  never pick yourself a name you can   t scrub the floor in .      she threw her shovel out of the hole .     give me a hand up  will you .      agnes did so .  granny brushed the dirt and leaf mold off her apron and tried to stamp the clay off her boots .      time for a cup of tea  eh .     she said .     my  you are looking well .  it   s the fresh air .  too much stuffy air in that opera house  i thought .      agnes tried in vain to detect anything in granny weatherwax   s eyes other than transparent honesty and goodwill .      yes .  i thought so  too     she said .     er   you   ve hurt your hand .         it   ll heal .  a lot of things do .      she shouldered her shovel and headed toward the cottage  and then  halfway up the path  turned and looked back .      this is just me askin     you understand  in a kind neighborly way  takin    an interest sort of thing  wouldn   t be human if i didn   t        agnes sighed .     yes .            you got much to do with your evenin   s these days .      there was

energy of the hitchhiker   s guide to the galaxy and the inventiveness of alice in wonderland .  it also has an intelligent wit and a truly original grim and comic grasp of the nature of things .      a . s .  byatt     humorously entertaining  and subtly thought provoking  fantasy   pratchett   s discworld books are filled with humor and with magic  but they   re rooted in  of all things  real life and cold  hard reason .      contra costa times     pratchett has created an alternate universe full of trolls  dwarfs  wizards  and other fantasy elements  and he uses that universe to reflect on our own culture with entertaining and gloriously funny results .  it   s an accomplishment nothing short of magical .      chicago tribune     discworld takes the classic fantasy universe through its logical  and comic  evolution .      cleveland plain dealer     in  pratchett   s  range of invented characters  his adroit storytelling  and his clear eyed acceptance of humankind   s foibles  he reminds me of no one in english literature as much as geoffrey chaucer .  no kidding .      washington post book world     what makes terry pratchett   s fantasies so entertaining is that their humor

unforced .      ottawa citizen     terry pratchett seems constitutionally unable to write a page without at least a twitch of the grin muscles    .  but  the notions pratchett plays with are nae so narrow or nae so silly as your ordinary british farce .  seriously .      san diego union tribune     pratchett  for those not yet lucky enough to have discovered him  is one of england   s most highly regarded satirists .  nothing   not religion  not politics  not anything   is safe from him .      south bend tribune     think j . r . r .  tolkien with a sharper  more satiric edge .      houston chronicle     the discworld novels are a phenomenon .      fort lauderdale sun sentinel     consistently  inventively mad   wild and wonderful .      isaac asimov   s science fiction magazine     he is head and shoulders above the best of the rest .  he is screamingly funny .  he is wise .  he has style .      daily telegraph  london      pratchett has now moved beyond the limits of humorous fantasy and should be recognized as one of the more significant contemporary english language satirists .      publishers weekly     pratchett   s humor is international  satirical  devious  knowing  irreverent  unsparing  and  above all  funny .      kirkus reviews     pratchett demonstrates just how great the distance is between one or two joke writers and the comic masters whose work will be read into the next century .      locus     if terry pratchett is not yet an institution  he should be .      fantasy   science fiction      other books by terry pratchett   the carpet people

thought that marriage was a very serious step that ought to be done properly  so they practiced quite a lot .         not that she sat looking out of the window .  she   d been watching the fire when she picked up the approach of jarge weaver .  but that wasn   t the point .         or  at least  dying for chocolate .         er .  that is to say  they went to bed at the same time as the chickens went to bed .  and got up at the same time as the cows got up .  loosely worded sayings can really cause misunderstandings .         distillation of alcohol was illegal in lancre .  on the other hand  king verence had long ago given up any idea of stopping a witch doing something she wanted to do  so merely required nanny ogg to keep her still somewhere it wasn   t obvious .  she thoroughly

being chased by photographers anxious to get a picture of you with your vest off .         without regret  since she hadn   t found any use for it .         bergholt stuttley     bloody stupid     johnson was ankh morpork   s most famous  or rather most notorious  inventor .  he was renowned for never letting his number blindness  his lack of any skill whatsoever or his complete failure to grasp the essence of a problem stand in the way of his cheerful progress as the first counter renaissance man .  shortly after building the famous collapsed tower of quirm he turned his attention to the world of music  particularly large organs and mechanical orchestras .  examples of his handiwork still occasionally come to light in sales  auctions  and quite frequently  wreckage .         it was central to nanny ogg   s soul that she never considered herself an old woman  while of course availing herself of every advantage that other people   s perceptions of her as such would bring .
