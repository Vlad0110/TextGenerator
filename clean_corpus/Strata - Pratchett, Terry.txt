strata      i met a mine foreman who has a piece of coal with a      gold sovereign embedded in it .  i saw an ammonite  apparently squashed in the fossil footprint of a sandal .   there is a room in the basement of the natural history museum which they keep locked .  among other oddities in there are the tyrannosaurus with a wristwatch and the neanderthal skull with gold fillings in three teeth .   what are you going to do about it .   dr carl untermond  the overcrowded eden      it was  of course  a beautiful day     a company brochure day .  at the moment kin   s office overlooked a palm fringed lagoon .  white water broke over the outer reef  and the beach was of crushed white coral and curious shells .   no brochure would have shown the nightmare bulk of the pontoon mounted strata machine  the small model for islands and atolls under fifteen kilometres .  as kin watched  another metre of beach spilled out of the big back hopper .   she wondered about the pilot   s name .  there was genius in that line of beach .  a man who could lay down a beach like that  with the shells just right  deserved better things .  but then  perhaps he was a thoreau type who just liked islands .  you got them sometimes  shy silent types who preferred to drift across the ocean after the volcano teams  dreamily laying complicated archipelagos with indecent skill .  she   d have to ask .   she leant over her desk and called up the area engineer .      joel .  who   s on bcf  .      the engineer   s lined brown face appeared over the intercom .      guday  kin .  let me see now .  aha .  good  is it .  you like it .         it   s good .         it   s hendry .  the one who   s the subject of all those nasty depositions you   ve got on your desk .  you know  the one who put the fossil dino in           i read it .      joel recognized the edge to her voice .  he sighed .      nicol plante  she   s his mixer  she must have been in on it too .  i put them on island duty because  well  with a coral island there is not the temptation           i know .     kin thought for a while .     send him over .  and her .  it   s going to be a busy day  joel .  it   s always like this at the end of a job  people start to play around .         it   s youth .  we   ve all done it .  with me it was a pair of boots in a coal measure .  not so imaginative  i admit .         you mean i should excuse him .      of course he did .  everyone was allowed just one unscripted touch  weren   t they .  checkers always spotted them  didn   t they .  and even if one went unnoticed  couldn   t we rely on future paleontologists to hush it up .  huh .   trouble was  they might not         he   s good  and later on he   ll be great     said joel .     just gnaw one ball off  eh .      a few minutes later kin heard the machine   s roar stutter and stop .  soon one of the outer office robots came in  leading        a squat fair haired youth  tanned lobster pink  and a skinny bald girl hardly out of her teens .  they stood staring at kin with a mixture of fear and defiance  dripping coral dust onto the carpet .      all right  sit down .  want a drink .  you both look dehydrated .  i thought they had air conditioning in those things .      the pair exchanged glances .  then  the girl said     frane likes to get the feel of his work .         well  okay .  the freezer   s that round thing hovering right behind you .  help yourself .      they jerked away as the freezer bumped into their shoulders  then grinned nervously and sat down .   they were in awe of kin  which she found slightly embarrassing .  according to the files they were both from colony planets so new the bedrock had hardly dried  while she was manifestly from earth .  not whole  new  old  real or best earth .  just earth  cradle of humanity  just like it said in their history books .  and the double century mark on her forehead was probably something they   d only heard of before joining john company .  and she was their boss .  and she could fire them .   the freezer drifted back to its alcove  describing a neat detour around a patch of empty air at the back of the room .  kin made a mental note to get a tech to look at it .   they sat gingerly on the float chairs .  colony worlds didn   t have them  kin recalled .  she glanced at the file  gave them an introductory glare  and switched on the recorder .      you know why you   re here     she said .     you   ve read the regulations  if you   ve got any sense .  i   m bound to remind you that you can either choose to accept my judgement as senior executive of the sector  or go before a committee at company hq .  if you elect for me to deal with it  there   s no appeal .  what do you say .         you     said the girl .      can he speak .         we elect to be tried by you  mizz     said the boy in a thick creed accent .   kin shook her head .     it   s not a trial .  if you don   t like my decision you can always quit     unless of course i fire you .     she let that sink in .  behind every company trainee was a parsec long queue of disappointed applicants .  nobody quit .      right  it   s on record .  just for the record  then  you two were on strata machine bvn   on julius  th last  working a line on y continent .  you   ve got the detailed charge on the notice of censure you were given at the time .         tis all correct     said hendry .  kin thumbed a switch .   one wall of the office became a screen .  they got an aerial view of grey datum rock  broken off sharply by a kilometre high wall of strata like god   s own mad sandwich .  the strata machine had been severed from its cliff and moved to one side .  unless a really skilled jockey lined it up next time  this world   s geologists were going to find an unexplained fault .   the camera zoomed in to an area halfway up the cliff  where some rock had been melted out .  there was a gantry and a few yellow hatted workmen who shuffled out of camera field  except for one who stood holding a measuring rod against exhibit a and grinning .  hi there  all you folks out there in company censure tribunal land .      a plesiosaur     said kin .     all wrong for this stratum  but what the hell .     the camera floated over the half excavated skeleton  focusing now on the distorted rectangles by its side .  kin nodded .  now it was quite clear .  the beast had been holding a placard .  she could just make out the wording .         end nuclear testing now        she said levelly .   it must have taken a lot of work .  weeks  probably  and then a very complicated program to be fed into the machine   s main brain .      how did you find out .     asked the girl .   because there was a telltale built into every machine  but that was an official secret .  it was welded into the ten kilometre output slot to detect little unofficial personal touches  like pacifist dinosaurs and mammoths with hearing aids     and it stayed there until it found one .  because sooner or later everyone did it .  because every novice planetary designer with an ounce of talent felt like a king atop the dream device that was a strata machine  and sooner or later yielded to the delicious temptation to pop the skulls of future paleontologists .  sometimes the company fired them  sometimes the company promoted them .      i   m a witch     she said .     now  i take it you admit this .         yarss     said hendry .     but may i make  uh  a plea in mitigation .      he reached into his tunic and brought out a book  its spine worn with use .  he ran his thumb down it until the flickering pages stopped at his reference .      uh  this is one of the authorities on planetary engineering     he said .     may i go ahead .         be my guest .         well  uh .     finally  a planet is not a world .  planet .  a ball of rock .  world .  a four dimensional wonder .  on a world there must be mysterious mountains .  let there be bottomless lakes peopled with antique monsters .  let there be strange footprints in high snowfields  green ruins in endless jungles  bells beneath the sea  echo valleys and cities of gold .  this is the yeast in the planetary crust  without which the imagination of men will not rise .          there was a pause .      mr hendry     asked kin     did i say anything there about nuclear disarmament dinosaurs .         no  but           we build worlds  we don   t just terraform planets .  robots could do that .  we build places where the imagination of human beings can find an anchor .  we don   t bugger about planting funny fossils .  remember the spindles .  supposing the colonists here turn out like them .  your fossil would kill them  blow their minds .  docked three months    labour .  you too  miss plante  and i don   t even want to know for what reasons you were helping this nitwit .  you may go .      she switched off the recorder .      where are you going .  sit down .  all that was for the benefit of the tape .  sit down  you look dreadful .      he was no fool .  she saw the embryo hope in his eyes .  best to scotch that now .      i meant it about the sentence .  three months    enforced vacation .  it   s on the tape  so you won   t talk me out of it .  not     she added     that you could .         but we   ll have finished this job by then     he said  genuinely hurt .   kin shrugged .     there   ll be others .  don   t look so worried .  you wouldn   t be human if you didn   t yield to temptation .  if you feel bad  ask joel chenge about the boots he tried to lay down in a coal seam .  they didn   t ruin his career .         and what did you do  miss .         hmm .     the boy was looking at her sidelong .      you sort of give the impression i   ve done something everyone else has done .  did you do it too .      kin drummed her fingers on the desk .     built a mountain range in the shape of my initials     she said .      whee .         they had to rerun almost half a strip .  nearly got fired .         and now you   re sec exec and           you might be too one day .  another few years they might let you loose on an asteroid of your very own .  some billionaire   s pleasure park .  two words of advice  don   t fumble it  and never  never try to quote people   s words against them .  i  of course  am marvellously charitable and understanding  but some other people might have made you eat the book a page at a time under threat of sacking .  right .  right .  now go  the pair of you .  for real this time .  it   s going to be a busy day .      they hurried out  leaving a coral trail .  kin watched the door slide across  staring into space for a few minutes .  then she smiled to herself  and went back to work .   consider kin arad  now inspecting outline designs for the ty archipelago   twenty one decades lie on her shoulders like temporal dandruff .  she carries them lightly .  why not .  people were never meant to grow old .  memory surgery helped .   on her forehead  the golden disc that multiple centenarians often wore     it inspired respect  and often saved embarrassment .  not every woman relished attempted seduction by a man young enough to be her great to the power of seven grandson .  on the other hand  not every elderly woman wore a disc  on purpose     her skin was presently midnight black  like her wig     for some reason hair seldom survived the first century     and the baggy black all suit .   she was older than twenty nine worlds  fourteen of which she had helped to build .  married seven times  in varying circumstances  once even under the influence of love .  she met former husbands occasionally  for old times    sake .   she looked up when the carpet cleaner shuffled out of its nest in the wall and started to tidy up the sand trails .  her gaze travelled slowly round the room as though seeking for some particular thing .  she paused  listening .   a man appeared .  one moment there was air  the next  a tall figure leaning against a file cabinet .  he met her shocked gaze  and bowed .      who the hell are you .     exclaimed kin  and reached for the intercom .  he was quicker  diving across the room and grabbing her wrist politely yet agonizingly .  she smiled grimly and  from a sitting position  brought her left hand across and gave him a scientific fistful of rings .   when he had wiped the blood out of his eyes she was looking down at him and holding a stunner .      don   t do anything aggressive     she said .     don   t even breathe threateningly .         you are a most unorthodox woman     he said  fingering his chin .  the semi sentient carpet cleaner bumped insistently around his ankles .      who are you .         jago jalo is my name .  you are kin arad .  but of course           how did you get in .      he turned round and vanished .  kin fired the stunner automatically .  a circle of carpet went wump .      missed     said a voice across the room .   wump .      it was tactless of me to intrude like this  but if you would put that weapon away        wump .      there could be mutual profit .  wouldn   t you like to know how to be invisible .      kin hesitated  then lowered the stunner reluctantly .   he appeared again .  he wiped himself solid .  head and torso appeared as though an arm had swept over them  the legs popped into view together .      it   s clever .  i like it     said kin .     if you disappear again i   ll set this thing on wide focus and spray the room .  congratulations .  you   ve managed to engage my interest .  that   s not easy  these days .      he sat down .  kin judged him to be at least fifty  though he could have been a century older .  the very old moved with a certain style .  he didn   t .  he looked as though he   d been kept awake for a few years     pale  hairless  red eyed .  a face you could forget in an instant .  even his all suit was a pale grey and  as he reached into a pocket  kin   s hand moved up with the stunner .      mind if i smoke .     he said .      smoke .     said kin  puzzled .     go ahead .  i don   t mind if you burst into flame .      eyeing the stunner  he put a yellow cylinder into his mouth and lit it .  then he took it out and blew smoke .   this man  thought kin  is a dangerous maniac .      i can tell you about matter transmission     he said .      so can i .  it   s not possible     said kin wearily .  so that was all he was     another goldbricker .  still  he could turn invisible .      they said that it was impossible to run a rocket in space     said jalo .     they laughed at goddard .  they said he was a fool .         they also said it about a lot of fools     said kin  dismissing for the moment the question of who goddard was .     have you got a matter transmitter to show me .         yes .         but not here .         no .  there   s this  however .     he made a pass and his left arm disappeared .     you might call it a cloak of invisibility .         may i  uh  see it .      he nodded  and held out an empty hand .  kin reached out and touched     something .  it felt like coarse fibre .  it might just be that the palm of her hand underneath it was slightly blurred  but she couldn   t be sure .      it bends light     he said  tugging it gently out of her grip .     of course  you can   t risk losing it in the closet  so there   s a switch area     here .  see .      kin saw a thin  twisting line of orange light outlining nothing .      it   s neat     said kin     but why me .  why all this .         because you   re kin arad .  you wrote continuous creation .  you know all about the great spindle kings .  i think they made this .  i found it .  found a lot of other things  too .  interesting things .      kin gazed at him impassively .  finally she said     i   d like a little fresh air .  have you breakfasted  jago jalo .      he shook his head .     my rhythms are all shot to hell after the trip here  but i think i   m about due for supper .             kin   s flyer circled the low offices and headed northward to the big complex on w continent .  it skirted the bulk of what had been hendry   s machine  its new pilot now laying down a pattern of offshore reefs .  the manoeuvre gave them an impressive view of the big collector bowl atop the machine  its interior velvety black .      why .     said jalo  peering .  kin twirled the wheel .      beamed power from orbiting collectors  slaved to the machine .  if we flew over the bowl we wouldn   t even leave any ash .         what would happen if the pilot made a mistake and the beam missed the bowl .      kin considered this .     i don   t know     she said .     we   d certainly never find the pilot .      the flyer skimmed over some more islands .  vatbred dolphins  still frisky after their journey in the megatanker  looped through the waves alongside its shadow .  blast continuous creation .   but at the time it had seemed a good idea .  besides  she had done just about everything else but write a book .  the actual writing hadn   t been difficult .  the real problem had been learning how to make paper  then hiring a staff of robots and setting them to building a printing press .  it had been the first book printed in four hundred years .  it had caused quite a stir .   so had the words inside the expensively produced card covers .  they said nothing new  but somehow she had managed to assemble current developments in geology in such a way that they had struck fire .  according to reports the book had even been the basis for a couple of fringe religions .   she looked sideways at her passenger .  she was unable to trace his accent     he spoke meticulously  like someone who had just taken a learning tape but hadn   t had any practice .  his clothes could have been bought out of a machine on a dozen worlds .  he didn   t look mad  but they never did .      so you   ve read my book     she said conversationally .      hasn   t everyone .         sometimes it seems so .      he turned red rimmed eyes to her .      it was okay     he said .     i read it on the ship coming here .  don   t expect any compliments .  i   ve read better .      to her disgust kin felt herself reddening .      no doubt you   ve read plenty     she murmured .      several thousand     said jalo .  kin kicked the flyer on to automatic and spun round in her seat .      i know there aren   t even hundreds of books  all the old libraries are lost .      he cringed .     i did not mean to offend .         who do           it isn   t necessary for an author to make the paper     said jalo .     in the old days there were publishers .  like filmy factors .  all the author did was write the words .         old days .  how old are you .      the man shifted in his seat .     i can   t be precise     he said .     you   ve changed the calendar around a few times .  but as near as i can make out  about eleven hundred years .  give or take ten .         they didn   t have gene surgery in those days     said kin .     no one is that old .         they had the terminus probes     said jalo quietly .   the flyer passed over a volcanic island  the central cone fuming gently as a tech squad tested it out .  kin stared at it unseeing  her lips moving .      jalo     she said .     jalo .  i thought the name was familiar .  hey     the big thing about the terminus ships was that they would never come back         he grinned at her  and there was no humour in it .     quite correct     he said .     i was a volunteer .  we all were  of course .  and quite mad .  the ships were not equipped to return .         i know     said kin     i read a filmy .  ugh .         well  you   ve got to see it against the background of the times .  it made a kind of sense  then .  and  of course  my ship didn   t come back .      he leaned forward .      but i did .      the ritz was in the unofficial city that had grown up around what had been the first and was now the last line .  now even the city was breaking up  being towed back up the wire to the big freighters in orbit .  in another month the last company employee would follow it .  the last snowfield would have been laid .  the last humming birds would have been released .   their conversation on the roof garden of the restaurant was punctuated by the slap and rattle of yellow tugs climbing the line two kilometres away  towing strings of redundant warehouses like beads on a wire .  they were soon lost in the cirrus  bound for line top .   kin had ordered framush  saddleback of loom and breasens .  jalo had read the menu intently and had ordered  in frank disbelief  a dodo omelette .  he looked now as though he regretted it .   kin watched him pick at it  but her mind persisted in showing her pictures .  she remembered the bell shaped bulk of a terminus probe  the pilot   s life system a tiny sphere at the tip .  she remembered the frightening logic that had led to the building of the monsters .  it went like this   it was far better to send a man into space than a machine .  in the complete unknown  a man could still evaluate and decide .  machines were fine for routine  but they flipped when presented with the unforeseen .   it was cheap to send a machine because it did not breathe and it sent its information back alone .   whereas a man breathed  all the time .  this was expensive .   but it was very cheap to send a man if you did not arrange to bring him back .      is that celery in the jug .     said jalo .      it   s snaggleroot shoots     said kin .     don   t eat the yellow bits  they   re poisonous .  now  do i have to sit here waiting .  speak to me     she murmured     of the great spindle kings .         i only know what i read     said jago .     and most of what i read  you wrote .  can i eat these blue things .         you   ve found a spindle site .     only nine spindle sites had been found .  ten  if you included the derelict ship .  the prototype strata machine had been found on one .  so had the details of gene surgery .  no wonder more people studied paleontology than engineering .      i found a spindle world .         how do you know it   s spindle .      jalo reached over and took some snaggleroot .      it   s flat     he said .   it was possible  kin conceded .   the spindles had not been gods  but they would do until gods showed up .  they had evolved on some light world     possibly .  the surviving mummies certainly showed them to be three metres tall but weighing only ninety pounds .  on worlds as heavy as earth they wore marvellous exoskeletons to prevent themselves collapsing with multiple fractures .  they had long snouts  and hands with two thumbs  legs banded alternately in orange and purple and feet big enough for a circus clown .  they had no brain or  to be more precise  their whole body could act like a brain .  no one had ever been able to find a spindle stomach  either .   they didn   t look like gods .   they had cheap transmutation but not ftl travel .  possibly they had sexes  but exobiologists had never found out where little spindles came from .   they sent messages by modulating a hydrogen line in the spectrum of the nearest star .   they were all telepaths and acute claustro phobes     they didn   t even build houses .  their spaceships were     unbelievable .   they lived nearly for ever  and to while away the time they visited planets with a reducing atmosphere and played with them .  they introduced mutated algae or oversized moons .  they force bred lifeforms .  they took venuses and made earths  and the reason  once you accepted that spindles were different  made sense at least to humans .  they were spurred by a pressing population problem     pressing  that was  to spindles .   one day they had ripped up a planetary crust with a strata machine and found something dreadful     dreadful  that was  to spindles .  in the next two thousand years  as the news spread  they died of injured pride .   that was     million years ago .   a tug plunged down the line  the braking roar leaking through its sonic screen .  the line marshals were cutting the loads adrift a few thousand miles up and sending them on their way by strap on rocket  to keep line weight down .   the tug swung through the switching system and hummed off towards the distant marshalling yards .  kin looked at jalo with narrowed eyes .      flat     she said     like an alderson disc .         maybe .  what   s an alderson disc .         no one ever built one  but you hammer all the worlds in a system into a system wide disc with a hole in the middle for the sun  and you plate the underside with neutronium for gravity  and           good grief .  you can work neutronium now .      kin paused  then shook her head .     like i said  no one   s ever built one .  or found one .         this one is not much more than thirteen thousand miles across .      their gazes met .  she rolled out the word he was waiting for .      where .         you   ll never find it without me .         and you think it   s a spindle artefact .        it   s got things you   d never believe in a million years .         you intrigue me .  what is your price .     for an answer jalo fumbled in a belt pouch and brought out a wad of        day bills .  company scrip was harder than most world currencies .  any one of them represented almost twenty eight years of extended life if cashed at a company trading post .  the company   s credit was the best .  it paid in extended futures .   without taking his gaze off kin  jalo summoned the nearest robot waiter and pushed a handful of bills into its disposal hopper .  every instinct cried out to kin to leap up and grab them back  but even with science on your side one did not live past the first century by obeying instincts .  the automatic incinerator would have burned her hand off .      how        she croaked .  she cleared her throat .     how juvenile     she said .     forgeries  of course .      he handed her a methuselah bill  the highest denomination issued by the company .      two hundred and seventy years     he said .     a gift .      kin took the gold and white plastic .  her hands emphatically did not tremble .   the design was simple  but then there were more than     other tests for the authenticity of company scrip .  nobody forged it .  it was widely advertised that any hypothetical forgers would spend all the years that had been fraudulently manufactured  in the company vaults  passing them in novel and unpleasant ways .      in my day     said jalo     i would have been called rich  rich  rich .         or dead  dead  dead .         you forget i was a terminus pilot .  none of us really believed in the inevitability of our death .  few people do .  i have been proved right so far .  in any case  you are welcome to test the bill .  it is genuine  i assure you .      i have not come to buy .  i want to hire you .  in thirty days i   m returning to the     flat world  for reasons that will become obvious .  i intend to be away less than a year  and the pay i offer is the answers to questions .  you may keep that bill  of course  even if you do not accept .  perhaps you would like to frame it  or maybe keep it for your old age .      he vanished like a demon king .  when kin lunged across the table her hands met empty air .   later she ordered a check on all shuttles going up the line .  not even an invisible man could have got past the telltales secreted in the gangways .  he   d hardly attempt to board a freight shuttle     most were not even pressurized .   he didn   t .  kin realized later that he had bought a ticket under an assumed name and just walked past the security net  flaunting his visibility like a cloak .   the message came twenty five days later  along with the first wave of colonists .   the main line had long since gone  winched up into its synchronous orbit satellite and loaded aboard a freighter .  there were still a few cosmetic teams just finishing work at the antipodes .   around kin  as she stood on a knoll in the midst of the tangled jungle  the steaming  scent encrusted land was bare of any obvious human mark .  eight thousand miles under her feet  she knew  men  robots and machines were converging on and boiling up the antipodal wire  soaring into the last of the freighters  a twelve mile skeleton with one big fusion motor  and leaving the world to the newcomers .   despite appearances  it would be a planned withdrawal .  last off would be the sweepers  carefully scuffling over the ruts .  a company publicity film had once shown the last man off being winched up a few feet on the line  then bending back to brush out his footprints .  not true  of course     but it missed the truth by mere inches .   it was a good world .  better than earth  but they said now that earth was improving     population up to nearly three quarters of a billion now  and that didn   t include too many robots .   better than her childhood .  kin had long ago dispensed with most of her early memories in a periodic editing  but she had kept one or two .  she winced as she recalled the oldest .   a hill like this one  overlooking a darkening countryside wreathed in ragged mists  and the sun sinking .  her mother had taken her there  and they stood in the small crowd that was the total population of almost half of a country .  most of them were robots .  one of them  a class eight  hide criss crossed with repair welds  lifted her onto its shoulders for a better view .   the dancers were all robots  although the fiddler was human .   thump  thump went the metal feet on the dark turf  while early bats hunted for insects overhead .   the steps were perfect .  how could they be otherwise .  there were no men to hesitate or stumble .  the world was too full of things for the few humans to do that they should concern themselves with this .  yet they knew that such things must be continued against the day men could once again pick up the reins .  back and forth  crossing and leaping  the robots danced their caretaker morris .   and young kin arad had decided then that people should not become extinct .   it had been a near thing .  without the robots  it would have been a certainty .   while the stamping figures rocked darkly against the red sunset sky  she made up her mind to join the company      the first of the big gliders swept over the trees and touched down heavily on the grass .  it slammed into a tree  spun around and stopped .   after a few minutes a hatch slid back and a man stepped out .  he fell over .   kin watched him haul himself up and lean back into the hatch .  two other men came out  followed by three women .  then they saw her .   she had taken pains .  now her skin was silver and her hair black  shot with neon threads .  she had chosen a red cloak .  in the absence of wind  electrostatic charges kept it floating about her in a sufficiently impressive way .  no sense in skimping details .  these people were coming to a new world .  they had probably already drawn up a proud constitution writ in gold and freedom .  they ought to be welcomed with dignity .  there would be too much time later for reality .   more gliders were drifting down  and the man who had been the first to step out climbed up to kin on her knoll .  she noticed his pioneering beard  his chalk white face .  but most of all she noticed the silver disc on his forehead  glinting in the first rays of sunlight .   he topped the rise still breathing evenly  pacing himself with the effortless self control of most centenarians .  he grinned  exposing teeth filed to points .      kin arad .         bjorne chang .         well  we   re here .  ten thousand of us today .  you make some good air     what   s the smell .         jungle     kin said .     fungi .  decaying pumas .  purple scents from the flowers of hidden orchids .         you don   t say .  well  we shall have to see about that     he replied evenly .   she laughed .     i   m frankly surprised     she said .     i had expected some jut jawed young fellow with a plough in one hand                and a model constitution in the other .  i know  i know .  someone like that headed up the colony on landsheer .  did you hear about land sheer .         i saw pictures .         did you know they spent a week arguing about forms of government .  and the first thing they built was a church .  and then the winter hit them .  and i   ve been up there in the northern continent in the winter .  you make your winters cruel .      kin started to stroll down  chang loping along beside her .      we did not want them to die     she said at last .     we told them about weather patterns .         you didn   t tell them that the universe is unfair .  they were too young to be properly paranoid .         and you .         me .  i think even i   m out to get me .  that   s why these people have hired me .  i   m going on     .  i don   t want to die  so i will watch the weather like a hawk  and only swim in shallow water  and eat nothing until i   ve seen a complete laboratory analysis .  i   ll even duck in case of meteorites .  i   ve got a five year contract down here  and i intend to survive it .      kin nodded .  his self confidence reassured even her .   but she also knew it wasn   t quite so simple .  in theory  the older you grew the more careful you were to stay near a gene surgery and the local company store  where your days could be cashed for carefully calculated longevity treatment     at the guaranteed rate of twenty four standard hours extra life per day .  only the company paid in days  and only the company gave the treatment .  textbook economics followed that the company owned everywhere and everybody .   but textbook economics also spoke of the law of diminishing returns .  at twenty you acted circumspectly  taking no risks  because if you worked for the company you had centuries ahead of you .  a shame to throw them away by fast driving or high living .   at      who cared .  you   d been everywhere  done everything .  all new experiences were just old experiences  rearranged .  by     you were probably dead .  not quite by suicide  however     not quite .  you just climbed higher and higher mountains  or free fell higher and longer  or back packed across mercury the difficult way  and sooner or later the odds ran out .   boredom drove you frenetic .  death was nature   s way of telling you to slow down .   that   s why chang led a party of green hand colonists to a new world .  there was really nothing to lose except a life stretched thin by endless living .      we don   t build pleasure planets     said kin .     you   ll have to win this one .      a glider drifted overhead and was lost among the treetops .      they   ll hate it first     said chang .     that thing   s got all the supplies in it  the blankets and the dumbwaiters .  i told control to land it ten miles away .  it   s a nice day .  a walk will do us good  and we can see who is the type to tread on poisonous spiders .         what will you do when the five years is up .         oh  i don   t know  probably stay and become the grand old man for a while .  anyway  by then i   ll have this place too civilized for my own comfort .         hmm .  reme wasn   t built in a day .         i wasn   t a foreman on that job .      the colonists were watching her silently .  no gene surgery  no treatment  no company store     yet they had volunteered .  not one in ten of them would see a century .   they would have the immortality granted to simple people .  there would be children .  there were few enough children now  even on earth .  genes would survive  while conditions on this world worked their own surgery on them .  hammered on the anvil of a different sun and moon  in a thousand years the people here would be different .  just different enough  according to the plan .      here   s where we say goodbye     said kin  reaching for the pouch at her belt .     here   s the deed  the conveyance and a       year warranty against faulty construction .      chang pushed the documents into his shirt .      have you thought of a name .     kin asked .      the vote went in favour of kingdom .      kin nodded .     i like it .  simple  but not jokey .  maybe one day i   ll be back to see how well you work  mr chang .      the last glider down was a company carrier  in contrast to the cheap vermifoam of the disposable pioneer machines .  as kin walked towards it the hatch opened and a company robot let down the steps .      when did you last have the treatment .     said chang suddenly .  kin stared at him .      eight years ago .  should it matter .      he paused  and moved closer so that the crowd couldn   t hear .      the company   s in trouble .  perhaps our days are numbered .         trouble .      the robot pilot registered that kin was aboard  counted three seconds  and slid the door .  the last the pioneers saw of kin was her perplexed face in the big rear port as the machine drifted away and up .   chang watched until it was high enough to use the ramjets .  then he reached into the hatch of his own glider  and lifted out a megaphone .   the crowd became a smudge  a dot  and lost itself in the jungle .  kin sat back .  the company owned sixty per cent of infinity .  what trouble .   soon the glider overtook the sun  which set in a reverse dawn .  later they landed on a small sandy island  white in the starlight surrounded by phosphorescent seas .   the line was black against the sky .  at its base was one small capsule  and a man leaning against it .      joel .      he grinned his neanderthaler grin .     hi  kin .        i thought you   d gone to be a sector master on cifrador .      he shrugged .     i was offered it .  didn   t suit me .  come aboard .  robot .         sah .         hook the glider on tow .        sho nuff  sah .         and knock off the slave talk  will you .      they climbed up to the linesman   s cabin and sat down on either side of the central traction tube .  joel chenge sighed and flicked a switch .  there was a jolt  and line started to flow hypnotically past them as the capsule climbed .      i   m the new watcher here     he said .      oh  joel .  surely not .     kin had a sudden feeling that the bottom was dropping out of the universe .      surely yes .  just between ourselves  i   m rather looking forward to it .  wouldn   t you .         but i can   t see you       kin stopped .      you  she meant  spending centuries in a deep freeze cabinet on a high orbit satellite of this world .  never growing older .  she could picture it  and it was horrible .   robot waldoes hovering eternally with syringes held a few inches from the ice hard skin  while other robots watched the world below .  looking for certain signs .  fission .  fusion .  space flight .  high power use .   some worlds made space flight a prime target  hoping to achieve early interstellar recognition .  it never worked .  even sub orbital machines were the apex of a pyramid  huge and old  resting on things like subsistence agriculture .  it was no good trying to fly before you could eat .   joel leaned over and punched up a meal on the console dumbwaiter  which extruded a laden table .  he caught kin   s eye and grinned again .  joel often grinned .  palaeolithic genes had somehow met again at his conception  and a slab face like joel   s had to smile frequently lest it frighten small children .  when his face brightened it was like the dawn of man .  they spoke  and not merely with words .  between them they were four hundred years old .  now words were mere flatcars on which towered cargoes of nuance and expression .   kin looked down at the table again .      it   s familiar     she said .     uh  i   m trying to remember           one hundred and thirty years ago .  we got married  remember .  on tynewalde .  there was that mad religion           icarus risen     said kin suddenly .     hell  i   m sorry .  and you even remembered the menu .  how romantic .         actually i had to look it up in my diary     he said  pouring the wine .     were you my fifth wife .  i neglected to make a note .         third  wasn   t it .  you were my fifth husband .      they looked at one another and burst out laughing .      good times  kin  good times .  three happy years .         two .         all right  two .  good grief .  that time on plershoorr  wasn   t it  when we           don   t dodge .  why a watcher .      the temperature fell like collapsium .  beyond the cabin windows kingdom was turning from a landscape to a disc  sunlight driving the terminator ahead of it .      uh .  life gets a bit stale .  on treatment alone i   d never live as long as a watcher  nice to see a new world grow  see what the future holds  it   ll be as good as visiting a new universe           you   re gabbling  joel .  i know you  remember .  i   ve never known you bored .  i recall you spending two years learning how to make a wooden cartwheel .  you said you   d never rest till you had mastered every skill .  you said you   d never learned to spear a seal  or cast copper .  you said you were going to write the definitive work on robot pornography .  you haven   t  yet .         okay .  i   m ducking out because i   m a coward .  is that good enough .  things are going to happen soon  best place   ll be in a freeze box .         things .         trouble .         tro       she paused .     chang said that .         the big pioneer .  i talked to him yesterday  when they were all in orbit .  he   s getting out before the storm breaks too .         what are you talking about .      he told her .  kin had reported the visit of jalo .  she had also reported his ability to produce high denomination day notes .      the company examined that methuselah bill you sent in  kin .         a forgery .      he shook his head slowly .     wish it had been .  it was     sort of genuine .  only we didn   t print it .  the numbers were all wrong .  all the codes were wrong .  not inaccurate  you understand .  it was just that they aren   t our numbers .  we haven   t issued those numbers yet .      now think about it .  there   s a process for duplicating company currency .  think what that means  kin .      she thought about it .   company scrip was subject to so many hidden checks and codes that any forgery would have to be a duplication .  and you couldn   t duplicate a day bill even by running it through the works of a strata machine  because the company owned all the machines and one hidden key in every thick plastic note would fuse the whole thing .  no one could duplicate company currency .  but if they could     multiple centenarians would be the first to suffer .  company scrip was so reliable it was a wealth in its own right .  but if day bills were just bits of plastic  if the market was flooded with ten or twenty times the real amount     the company wouldn   t exist .  its wealth was its credibility  and its credibility was the hardness of its currency .   gene surgery merely stopped you dying .  you could go on living without the additional treatments that days would buy  but you would grow old .  immortal  but senile .   no wonder they were hiding out .  joel was grabbing a sort of immortality  chang was at least escaping the crash .  probably the less levelheaded were doing things like taking a space walk without a suit .   there must be millions of us  kin thought .  we complain about never eating a dish we haven   t eaten before and the colours slowly draining out of life .  we wonder if the short lifers live more vividly  and dread learning that they do  because we gave up the chance of children .  it would be so unfair .  as if a man has only a certain allocation of things like elation and delight and contentment  and the longer he lives the more they must be diluted .   but life is still sweet and death is just mystery .  it is age we dread .  oh hell .      did they look for him .     she said .      everywhere .  we know he   s been to earth  because all the terminus probe records in the spaceflight museum have been wiped clean .         then we know nothing about him at all .         right .  find a bolthole  kin .     he gave a short laugh .     at least company policy was right .  our worlds will last .         one man can   t bring down a civilization     said kin .      show me where it says that   s a universal rule     he snapped  and then relaxed .     this cloak     really invisible .         we ell  if you looked directly  i remember things behind it being just slightly blurred .  but you wouldn   t notice if you weren   t expecting it .         useful for old fashioned espionage  maybe     mused joel .     very odd  though .  i don   t think we would make one .  you have to have a pretty high technology for that sort of thing  and in a high technology invisibility wouldn   t be a very great asset .  so many other things would detect you .         i wondered about that     said kin .      then all this about matter transmission     all the theories say it isn   t quite possible .  the wasbile double effect almost does it  the same way you can always build an almost perpetual motion machine .      the satellite at the line   s end was a bright star ahead .  joel glanced down the controls .      i   d have liked to have met him     he said .     i read about the terminus probes when i was a wee lad .  then once when i was on new earth i went to see rip van levine   s farm .  he was the one who landed on the planet and found           i know about him     said kin .   if joel had noted the tone in her voice     and surely he must have done     he didn   t show it .  he went on cheerfully .     couple years ago i saw this film they made of the t  and t  .  they   re the ones who are still travelling .  there   s a charity on new earth  every ten years or so they put a couple of ships on a flick orbit to build up acceleration and           i know about that  too     said kin .   the ships built up acceleration by diving into new earth   s sun  then making an elsewhere jump back a few million miles  then diving  then jumping     and finally popping out of nowhere a few hundred light years away at a light squashing speed and a few miles from the probes .   terminus four hadn   t decelerated at turnover point  and a fault in six   s primitive computer had guided it precisely to a star that wasn   t there .  in the normal course of events the pilots would have decomposed centuries ago .  suspended animation had been pretty primitive then  too .  but the ailing machinery had long ago been piecemeal replaced  and the visiting crews added refinements every decade or so .   it wasn   t cheap .  it would have been a lot easier to thaw out the pilots and bring them back to a life of luxury .  but rip van levine  the death and glory terminus pilot who after a thousand year voyage landed on a world settled by elsewhere driven ships three hundred years previously  had been a rich man when he suicided .  rich enough to employ good lawyers  and to insist that his trust do everything that could be done for the last two pilots     except wake them .      the levine trust has us tied in knots     said joel .     the first thing the company thought of was to wake the t  pilot and ask her about jalo .  they all trained together  so she might know something .  but apparently the whole of new earth would raise hell if we tried it .         joel  what do you think of that idea .     said kin .   he met her gaze .     i think it   s despicable  what else .         so do i .      she stayed at the satellite until joel had finished setting the system  and watched while he activated the circuit that broke the long chain artificial molecule that was the line .  now kingdom was on its own .   she didn   t stay to watch him ready the freeze room .   her private boat had been left in orbit near up .  technically she was on leave until she joined the rest of the team at trenchert  where the advance parties had already cleaned the atmosphere and strengthened the crust .  months ago she had planned to stop off at momremonn spitz for a look at the new spindle excavations there .  there had been rumours of another working strata machine .   right now it seemed less than important .  she slammed the airlock   s inner door shut behind her .      salutations  lady     said the ship .     the sheets are aired .  we are fully fuelled .  shall we run you a bath .         uhuh .         we have the course computed .  do you wish a countdown .         i think we can dispense with all that excitement     said kin wearily .     just run that bath .      when the ship boosted the bath water slopped gently against the edge of the tub  but did not spill .  kin  who had been brought up to be polite to machines  said     neat .         thank you .  five hours and three minutes to flickover .      kin soaped an arm thoughtfully .  after a few minutes she said     ship .        yes  lady .         where the hell are we going .  i don   t recall giving you any instructions .         to kung  lady  as per your esteemed order of     hours ago .      kin rose like a well soaped venus anadyomene and ran through the ship until she dropped into the pilot chair .      that order     she said softly     repeat it .     she watched the screen intently  one hand poised over the panel that would open a line back to kingdom up .  joel wouldn   t have frozen himself yet  the process took hours .  anyway  a machine could just unfreeze him .  the important thing was that the station had a big enough transmitter to punch a message through to the company .  she recognized the touch of jago .   the transmitted order had been simple enough  prefaced by the ship   s call sign and kin   s own code .  it had come over the normal ground to orbit channels .  it could have come from a dozen transmitters while work on kingdom was being completed .   it had ended     a flat world .  you  kin arad  are a very curious person .  cheat me and you will forever wonder what sights you missed .      kin   s hand dropped     and didn   t touch the message switch .   you couldn   t build a flat world .   but then  you couldn   t come back if you were a terminus pilot .   and you couldn   t duplicate company scrip .      ship .         lady .         continue to kung .  oh  and open a channel to the screen in my study .         done  lady .      it was wrong .  it was probably foolish .  it would certainly get her fired .   be there or forever wonder .   she filled the hours by relearning primary ekung and reading the supplements to the planetary digest .  it appeared the kung now had a line  but no one had got around to banning ship landings on the world itself .  nothing much was banned on kung  even murder .  she checked and found it was now the only world in local space that actually allowed ships to land under power .  was that relevant .   kung was hungry for alien currency .  there wasn   t a great deal kung could produce that humans could use  except a whole variety of pneumonia type illnesses  but there was a lot kung wanted .  it was trying to start a tourist industry      kin had been there .  she recalled rain .  the kung had forty two different words for rain  but that just wasn   t enough words to encompass the great symphony of water that fell for fifty five minutes in every hour .  there were no mountains .  the light gravity had allowed plenty to rise  but it allowed lots of ocean spray into the wind to wash them down .  the nubs that remained had a dispirited  back turned look .   of course  sometimes they became islands .  kin remembered about the tides .   an over large moon and a cool  close sun meant nightmare tides .  vegetation was either fungal  able to spring up and fruit hurriedly at low tides  or it was resigned to a semi submerged life .   and tourists came .  even though they had to wear float jackets most of the time in case of flash tides  the tourists came .  they were fishermen and mist enthusiasts  microphiles and wanderjahr biology students .  as for the kung themselves      she switched off and sat back .      you should have told the company     she said silently .     there   s still time .      she answered     you know what will happen .  he might be mad  but he   s no fool .  he   ll be prepared for any trap .  besides  kung isn   t a human world .  company writ runs thin down there .  he   ll duck and weave and we   ll lose him .      she said     you have a duty .  you can   t let a menace like him run around loose just to satisfy your curiosity .      she answered     why not .             how rich is kin arad  daughter of the genuine earth and author of continuous creation  q . v .   .  the company paid its servants in days  but since they could earn far more than a day in a day  they often sold surplus time for more traditional currencies .  temporally  then  her account showed that she had another three hundred and sixty eight years  five weeks and two days in hand  plus one hundred and eighty thousand credits     and a credit is worth a credit these days .   in any case  credits were backed by days .  the galaxy had rare elements in plenty .  the transmuter at the heart of every strata machine or dumbwaiter could make anything .  what else but longevity itself could back a currency .  kin could buy life .  could solomon have done it .  could cloritty have done it .  could hughes have done it .   she was rich .   an alarm bleeped .  kingdom   s sun bulked in the forward screen as a fire rim black disc  the sensors having long ago been appalled by its brightness .   kin switched off the ship   s voice  because she hated the count down to an elsewhere jump .  it was like waiting for death .  if the computer was right  and it was never wrong  the ship would jump just as soon as it was at an acceptable orbital speed with regard to     a few seconds of vertigo  a brief agony of despair .  soullag  it was called on little evidence .  certainly something in the human mind refused to travel faster than     it had been experimentally verified       .   light years per second  so that after even a short jump through elsewhere space there was a hollow black time before the rushing mental upwellllll         the destination world .  kin caught her balance  and looked out .  the kung sun was a cool red dwarf .  statistics said it was small .  they lied .  from four million miles away it was a giant .  kung practically rolled through its upper atmosphere     and there it was  a perceptible black disc .  kin smiled .  kung  living under permanent cloud cover  were mad enough to begin with .  what sort of religion would they have developed if they had been able to see the sky .   three hours later she left the ship a few miles from kung line top .   the satellite was decorated in kung style     grey and brown purple predominated  with startling touches of heart attack red .  there was no immigration control .  kung welcomed smugglers .  smugglers were rich .   her suit   s jets wafted her gently into one of the airlocks  which cycled automatically .   line top .  the spaceward end of the mono molecular wire that linked every civilized world with the greater galaxy .  the gateway to the stars  where robots jostled with ten eyed aliens  spies moved circumspectly  golden bearded traders of strange and subtle wares sold curious powders that made men go mad and talk to god  and cripple boys busked strange electronic instruments that plucked emotions .  line top .  a hefty kick and you had escape velocity .  line top .  threshold of the universe .   anyway  that was the idea .  but this was reality  and kung was in a poor time for the tourist trade .  the kung that loped through the tethered satellite   s corridors were admittedly colourful  but familiar .  there was an unipodal ehft operating a sweeping machine in one corridor .  if it was a spy for the galactic federation  it was a master of disguise .   the big board on the main concourse said there was an hour to wait until the next downward shuttle .  kin found a bar with a window overlooking the shuttle hall .  the bar was called the broken drum .      why .     she asked the kung behind the bar .  saucer eyed he fixed her with the bland stare of barmen everywhere .      you can   t beat it     he said .     your wish .         i thought kung had no sense of humour .         that is so .     the bar kung looked at her carefully .     from earth .     he asked .      yes     said kin .      which one .  i   ve got a brother uncle on real ea           the genuine one     said kin sharply .  he looked at her thoughtfully again  then reached under the counter and pulled out a filmy cassette that kin recognized with a sinking heart .      i thought the face was familiar     said the barkung triumphantly .     soon as you walked in  i thought  very familiar face     of course it   s a bad holo on the filmy  but still     ha .  do you think you could do a voice print on it  miss arad .     he grinned horribly .   she smiled valiantly  and took the tape translation of continuous creation from his damp four fingered hands .      of course  it   s not for you  i understand  it   s for your nephew sam     she murmured cruelly .  the kung looked startled .      i have no nephew sam     he said     although i had intended it for my son brother brtkltc .  how did you know .         magic     sighed kin .   she took her drink to the big window  and idly watched tugs shunting cargo shuttles across the marshalling wires while behind her she half heard the bar kung talking excitedly to someone on the intercom .  then a someone was standing by her chair .  she looked round  and then up .  a kung was standing beside her .   look at the kung .  seven feet tall  and then topped off with a red coxcomb that was made of something like hair .  two saucer eyes filled the face  and they were now two thirds closed against the lights that had been turned up by the bar kung out of deference to kin .  the body was skeletal  with body builder   s muscles strung like beads on a wire and a bulge between the shoulder blades for the third lung .  the shipsuit it wore was a masterpiece of tailoring .  it had to be .  the kung had four arms .   it grinned .  a kung grin was a red crescent with harp strings of mucus .      my name is marco farfarer     he said     and if it will help you to cease staring  i am a naturalized human being .  you only think you   re seeing a kung .  don   t let a mere unfortunate accident of birth confuse you .         my apologies     said kin .     it was the second pair of arms .         quite so .     he bent lower  and said in the voice laden with the breath of swamps     a flat world .      then he sat down  while they sought for clues in each other   s face .      how did you know .     said kin .      magic     he said .     i recognized you  of course .  i enjoyed your book .  i know kin arad works for the company .  i see her sitting in kung line top  a place one would not expect to find her .  she looks ill at ease .  i recall that about a month ago  when i was on ehftnia and couldn   t get a ship out     being only the third best long haul pilot in the region     i was approached by a man who           i think i know the man     said kin .      he said certain things and made certain offers .  what did he offer you .      kin shrugged .     among other things  a cloak of invisibility .      the kung   s eyes widened .     he offered me a small animal skin pouch which produced these     he murmured .  kin picked up the notes he laid on the table .  there was a wad of     and      day bills  an ehftnic ceramic     pjum bar  a thin roll of assorted human currencies  several hundred star chamber tokens and a computer card .      some of the currency i tendered to a moneychanger on ehftnia     said marco     and she accepted it .  there can be no greater proof of its genuineness  if you have ever done business with an ehftnic .  i think the card is a keycard to an autobank  probably on ehftnia .      there was a lot more  mostly ehftnic dollar bars .  i was poor at the time .      kin flicked a pjum bar and watched it roll across the table .      the bag produced them .     she asked slowly .      aye .     twas no more than hand sized .  i watched it all come out .  i thought he was company .  he wished to buy my services .         as a pilot .      the kung waved two hands vaguely .     i can fly all kinds of ship  no error .  even without matrix tapes .  i   m the best     what do these want .      the bar kung approached the table diffidently towing behind him a very large hairy bell  which kept up by hopping on its one foot .  there was a voicebox strapped to the tuft at its tip .      this is green shading to indigo .  it   s an ehft     he said  helpfully .     it   s the line top sanitary officer .         pleased to make its acquaintance     said kin .  with a deft flick the ehft produced a transparent box from under its     cloak  skin .      and flourished it a few inches in front of kin   s eyes .  she heard marco hiss .      voil   .  regardez .     screeched the voicebox .     earthian .  moutmout .  sapient .  question .      a large black bird in the box looked beadily at kin  and went back to preening its feathers .      it turned up yesterday     said the bar kung .     i told him  it   s a bird  an earth animal .  only it talks .      we looked it up in the guide to sapient species  but there is only one avian  and this is not it .         it looks like a damn big raven     said kin  taking the box .     what   s the problem .     she paused .     i see the problem .  you want to know  do you arrest it or destroy it .  anyway  how did a bird get in here .         puzzle .         we don   t know .      on an impulse kin opened the box .  the bird hopped up onto the rim and looked at her .      it   s harmless     she said .     probably someone   s pet .         pet .         mental symbiote     drawled marco .     humans are crazy .      the ehft shuffled forward uncertainly and shoved its tentacle towards kin again .  it held a thick loop of intricately knotted string .  with a sinking heart she recognized it as an ehftnic touch book .      when i told it you were you  it went all the way back to its pod for its translation of your book     said the bar kung proprietorially .     it wants you to        but kin was already tying a personalized knot at the beginning of the coil .      understand .  not .  self .     squawked the voice box .     for .  pup .  belong .  sibling .         he means           i understand     said kin wearily .      jalo     screamed the raven .      you take it away     said the bar kung  thrusting the    cage    into a pair of marco   s arms .     she can feed it or eat it or make love to it or teach it to sing or whatever humans do with pests .         pets     said marco .  he took the cage .  there didn   t seem to be any alternative .   the ehft watched them head towards the shuttle bay .      crazy .     it ventured .      humans run the universe now     said the bar kung bitterly .     such craziness  i wish i could get hold of some .  notice the way humans walk as if they own the galaxy .      the ehft considered this .  it had always found it an effort to comprehend a method of locomotion that didn   t involve tentacles .      no     it said .   there were few passengers on the shuttle .  there was a moment of high gee as strap on rockets sent it swinging out of the hangar and down the line .      at least i   ll have a native guide     said kin  and grinned to show that it was a joke .  but this kung seemed to know about humour .  legally human .      i was hoping you might be able to help me there     said marco  fishing a pouch out of his travelling bag .     i   ve never been down there in my life .  sometimes i   ve run freighters here  but only as far as up .         you mean you got that close and never went to look at your people   s world .         whose people   s world .  i was born on earth .      he brought out a bone coloured pipe  filled it from a pouch and lit it with an everglow .  kin wrinkled her nose .      what   n hell   s that .         tobacco     said marco .     cutty peerless vi .  there   s a man in london sends it out to me .  that   s london england  you understand .         do you enjoy it .     there was a click as the cabin air filters came on .  marco took the pipe out of his mouth and looked at it reflectively .      on the whole  no     he said     but it is historically satisfying .  may i ask you a question .         go right ahead .         do you have a thing about kung .  sexually  i mean .      kin stared into the great grey eyes and at the mottled skin  and the snappy answer died in her throat .  she recalled occasional rumours .  marco radiated maleness from his matchstick figure .  kung males were almost unbelievably masculine .  and priapic  apparently .  kung were directly polarized  male and female  with none of that subtle elision between the absolute male and absolute female psyches that humans possessed .  to some human women the kung machismo was magnetic .      never in a thousand years     she said levelly .     you can call me old fashioned if you like .         thank goodness     said the kung .     i hope i did not cause offence .         nothing that won   t heal .  what  er  made you ask .         oh  you wouldn   t credit the stories i could tell you  kin arad .  of young human females with freffr comb hairstyles and what they think is genuine kung style dress and a superficial and uninformed taste in tleng music .  when i played piano in a nightclub on crespo during the spacer slump i had to lock my windows at night  and once two young       he paused  then went on .     of course  i realize you are a cosmospolitan woman .  but i once had to hit the wife of a new earth ambassador with a chair .      the raven fretted in its transparent cage .  kin glanced at it .      what are we going to do if jalo contacts us .     she said .   marco took the pipe out of his mouth .     do .  i intend to visit this flat world .  what else .      tide was up when the shuttle juddered into the terminal  smoke pouring from the brake pads .  the kung had solved the water level problem by building the terminus buildings on a raft that rose up and down the line as the migrating oceans shifted around the planet .   kin peered out into the grey rain .  around the station raft other woven buildings were bobbing at their anchor poles .  a few kung were abroad this early  paddling coracles along the shifting streets like a regatta for gollums .   marco splashed up  dragging a small and terrified kung behind him .      this says it   s been hired to pick us up .  not very dramatic  is it .      prodded by marco  the boatkung led them over the gaggle of boats moored around the platform to a human built tourist speedster  its four balloon tyres now doubling as flotation bags .  kin settled into the back seat .  the rain was warm  and she was already sodden .  maybe there was something particularly penetrative about kung water .   marco shoved the boatkung into the front passenger seat and fumbled with the controls .  the mooring rope groaned and parted as the boat bucketed forward between wings of spray .   he drove with three arms draped nonchalantly over the seat .   four arms .  four arms were rare .  in the bad old days before the revolution  high caste kung had used mitogenetic techniques to influence the growing embryo .  four arms meant warrior caste .  kin decided to try tact .      how come     she asked     how come you have to have shirts specially made .      he didn   t look round .     family tradition     he said .     my family always sent one male into the warriors  and they operated on my mother  but     you remember the line break of       .         sure .  earth was cut off for a month .  some lunatic bombed both termini simultaneously .         yes .  my parents were on the embassy staff at new stavanger .  by the time the line was replaced my mother was in labour .      and the kung believed that when a child was born its receptive mind was taken over by the nearest available discarnate soul         as a matter of fact my father was prevented from killing himself by the shad cultural attach    who was dining with him     said marco levelly .     he thought he could get to me first  you see .  it didn   t work .  so they put out humanity papers on me and found me a home with an old couple down in mexico  and then they left earth .  end of story .  how come you   re bald .      kin   s hand flew to her wig .      uh .  age .  hair can   t take it .      marco was watching the horizon intently .     oh     he said .     i wondered .  i always think one shouldn   t be shy about this sort of thing  don   t you .      the boat chattered through half drowned groves and flotillas of villages until it was brought to a dead halt by weeds brushing against the hull .  marco swore  and kicked the power changeover .      it   s the tide     said marco .  hull out of water  they whirred on through streaming vegetation .  a few late fish  abandoned by the water  were hopping awkwardly after the departing sea .  on kung only amphibians survived for long .   presently the vegetation and the gradient suggested country that was seldom inundated for more than one hour in twenty .  under the boatkung   s direction they picked up a track that wound up into permanently dry grassland .  if kung had been a human world it would have been cultivated to within an inch of its life .  the kung shunned it as a desert .   the boat jolted over a ridge .   there was a round valley  with the inevitable lake at the bottom  and a spaceship bobbing at its centre .      it   s a general motors neutrino  ground to ground ring rim fusion motor  spindle unibrake  thirty four staterooms  choice of extras     said marco  lighting his pipe .     the insystem systems are a bugger .  i flew one once .  they were built to meet a demand which wasn   t .      it looked like a fat doughnut .      has it got any armaments .     asked kin weakly .      jalo .     screamed the raven .      wouldn   t like to be on the wrong side of the fusion flame .      the boatkung was looking at marco   s pipe in terror .     apart from that     there   s a roomy hold .  name your own horrors .      as they stepped into the ship   s open hatch the boatkung gunned his craft and headed back across the lake .      looks like the only way off is up     said kin .     i wonder what frightened him .         me     said marco  and walked aboard soundlessly     then hissed and crouched into a fighting stance .   a shape lurched towards them .  racial memories told kin to run and climb a tree .  the thing bearing down on them could only be intent on clawing gashes in soft membranes  and gouging with those fangs .  racial memories were behind the times  as usual .  kin grinned politely .   the shand could just about stand in the high corridor without its tiny ears touching the ceiling  which meant it was almost three metres high .  it was  though  holding the knee sagging  self effacing posture that shandi always adopted inside the artefacts of smaller races  as if in terror lest they accidentally eat someone .   typically  it     she     was as broad as she was high  with wide arms ending in calloused knuckles that could double as another pair of feet .  there was an intelligent bear   s face  but it was a bear with binocular vision and a domed skull and several walruses in its ancestry .  it had two tusks said to have been used originally for scraping molluscs from the beds of freezing oceans  now as useless as the vermiform appendix  and carved into status denoting shapes .  its snout        if you have klite fliniffed .     she lisped reproachfully .   there was something altogether familiar about some of those tusk carvings .  kin stuck her fingers in the corners of her mouth for tuscal effects and tried her shandi .      i am relative almost parched and dry and the kung is     small stain go far     she spat .     i greet you in all grease  o shand of the lower conwexi delta moraine region  unless i am very much mistaken .         i congratulate you on your mastery of the speech     said the shand graciously .     my name is fifty six syllables long  but you may call me silver .  are you coming to the flat world .  is the kung dangerous .  he looks uneasy .         i think it   s because he can   t understand shandi .  on the other hand  all kung look uneasy .  it   s probably something to do with the flash tides .  this one   s human  by the way  don   t press the point .         what are you talking about .     marco asked suspiciously .   by the time silver had led them into the ship   s observation cabin they had reached a compromise .  kin and marco spoke to silver in allspeak  which the shand understood but  because of her tusks  could not speak  silver spoke in shandi  which she could pronounce and marco could not understand  and kin translated into allspeak for marco .  eventually it was established by careful retranslation that silver was a sociologist  comparative historian  linguist and meat animal herder .      all of them .     asked marco .      i once knew a shand who was a lift attendant  biochemist and seal hunter     said kin .      i got here yesterday     said silver .     i was working on prediquac when this man           we know him     said kin .     what did he offer you .         i do not understand     said silver blankly .      bait     said kin .     to go with him to the flat world .         oh  i see .  nothing .  should he have done .      kin translated .  marco stared at the shand in astonishment  then snorted and wandered off into the depths of the ship .      there is something familiar about your name     said silver to kin .      i wrote a book called continuous creation .      silver smiled politely .     did you .      marco had disappeared .  the two females took a stroll through the doughnut hull .  with every step kin became more uneasy .  this was a strange ship .   it had been converted to a freighter .  there were four staterooms .  the rest of the torus was fuel tank .   the ship had been designed to be a rich idiot   s toy .  only rich men and spies used ships that could stagger out of a gravity well under their own power .   consider  there was a line on every useful world  and once up the line all that was needed was a pressurized box with altitude jets and an elsewhere matrix to get you to the top of any other line .  a few specialized trades and the tourist industry used ships capable of traversing a solar system .  there were even some ships that could fly ground to orbit in an emergency .  no one needed a ship that could reach orbit and fly across a system and jump via the elsewhere .   this one could .  kin   s unease began to be tinted with excitement .  the line and the matrix had chopped space into mere pauses between identical line top arrival lounges .  this ship was something else .   there was a dumbwaiter  a big model programmed to produce anything from lobster thermidor to sawdust .  it could even reproduce shand proteins .   there was a medical room that would not have disgraced a city .  there was also a deep freeze  a fact so unusual that kin lifted the lid .      now here   s a thing     she murmured .  silver peered in  and rooted around among the frosted packages .      nothing remarkable     she said .     meat  fish  fowl  leaves  swollen tubers     human food .      kin pointed at the dumbwaiter  humming seductively to itself .      ever known one of those to fail .     she said .      they don   t     said silver .     if they did  you humans would never have allowed us into space .         then why waste space and weight hauling this junk .  if he was nervous  he   d bring shandi food     uh .  of course .  i forget he   s old .         old .         old enough to be fussy about machine made food .  this lot here must have cost him a fortune .         please explain about    old        said silver insistently .   kin told the shand about the terminus probe .  when she finished she was aware that the giant was looking at her oddly .      you humans must have been mad for space     she said .   they turned as marco strode silently into the room  trembling with rage .      what is this ship .     he bawled .     there   s enough weaponry in the hold to blow a hole through a planet .         and small arms     murmured kin .  marco stared at her  while she felt her mind beginning to think very fast indeed .      precisely .  but how did you guess .         no guess  i think i   ve seen enough .  silver  was there a message from jalo when you got here .         the kung in the ferry said i was to wait .  why .      kin shook her head urgently .     marco  there must be spacesuits around .  if we got into them  could you evacuate the ship .         down here .  it   d implode .  i   d have to take her up  and that           this is a  .      clipe automatic .  if you all leapt at me the chances are i would not get you all  but who could i shoot first .      jalo was standing by the door  the pistol dangling nonchalantly from one hand .  kin thought about what a stream of clipe needles could do  and decided to stand very still .  she glanced at silver .   the shand wasn   t looking at jalo .  she was staring at marco .   he had dropped into a curious bowlegged stance  arms held out from his body like an ancient gunfighter  and he was hissing softly .      tell it if it attacks  i will shoot     said jalo .     tell it .         you know he can understand you     said kin coldly .  she heard silver say in shandi     in a minute there   s going to be an almighty fight  kin .  no one threatens a kung and lives .         marco is legally human     said kin in allspeak .      yes  that fooled me     said jalo .     i should have known better .  i told that agency computer on real earth to pick three people that fitted my specifications  and it gave me three names .  the damn thing never bothered to say two of them were bems .      only silver  student of history  understood the term .  she growled .      it surely mentioned planets of origin     said kin .      the big frog was born on earth  though  and the bear born in a ship orbiting shand     said jalo .     doesn   t anyone ever mention species these days .  legally human .  ye gods .  do not move .         i was wondering where you were     said kin .     i should have been looking for a patch of fuzzy air     looter .      he grinned lopsidedly .     the word is  uh  nasty but true .  just like the company looted strata machines and the line monomolecular technique .         not true .  the company administers them for the general good .         fine  so on this trip the profits will be for my general good .  i figure i   m owed something .  i knew levine and the rest .  i trained with them .  i   m taking my reward now .  i   ve got the jackpot .      something small and black hopped around the curve of the corridor behind him .  kin recalled that marco  determinedly human  had been trying to make a pet of the raven .  it was feeding time .      i shall need assistance     jalo said .      you   ve got the self filling purse     said kin .     that sounds like a jackpot to me .         nah .  with what   s here we can start our own company where we   re going .     he reached into a sidepocket and pulled out a navigation reel .     it   s all here .         i would prefer to talk further without the piftol threatening uf     said silver painfully .     it if not kind .      the raven flew up onto jalo   s shoulder and screamed in his ear        a stream of clipe needles zonked into the ceiling        marco moved so fast that his passage across the space separating him from jalo could only be deduced from the fact that he was suddenly astride the fallen figure  the clipe held in one hand and the other three raised to smash a skull        he blinked  and looked around as if waking from a dream .   he stared at jalo  and then leaned forward .      he   s dead     he said helplessly .     i didn   t even strike him .      kin knelt down by the man .      he was dead before you got there .      she had seen the face go snow white after the bird   s scream .  jalo had already been dropping when marco reached him .   he was sufficiently recently dead for it to be worth slotting his body into the ship   s medical sargo  which immediately flashed a row of red lights .  kin checked the readings on the panel below .  cell rupture  organ rupture  brain damage     when they got back to a human world it would be six months in a resurrection vat for jalo .      a coronary .     suggested silver .      massive     said kin .     he   s lucky .      there was silence  and when kin turned the shand was looking at her in astonishment .      coronary is easy     she explained .     we can repair that .  simple job .  if marco had got to work on him there wouldn   t have been anything left to put in a vat .  he threatened marco .      silver nodded .     kung are paranoid .  but he also acts like a human .         you watch him enter a room .  that walk of his is a fighting stance .  kung don   t know the meaning of the word fear .         fine     said silver pleasantly .     half kung  half human .  well  i know the meaning of the word fear  and right now i   m scared .         yeah  i can see         a few seconds of vertigo  an eternity of despair   the first thing kin registered when her sight came back was the cabin window and the view outside .  the ship appeared to be surrounded by a fog full of icebergs .   she was dimly aware of an alarm  which cut off abruptly .   she was aware of hazy stars  and of drifting across the cabin because there was no gravity .  silver was floating near what had been the ceiling  out cold .   let   s see .  the ship had been floating on a lake .  now it was floating in space .  outside was frozen air and quite a bit of the lake  so down on kung storms must be raging since a few cubic hectares of air and water had suddenly been dragged into space inside the ship   s elsewhere field      in free fall kin   s natural genius felt somewhat cramped .  she swam and bounced her way to the control room  where marco was hunched over the main consol like a spider  and screamed in his ear .   he grabbed her out of the air and turned her to face the big screen at the far side of the cabin .   she stared  open mouthed .   after a while she fetched silver  who was treating a slight headwound in the medical room and cursing in several languages  and made her watch .   when the film was finished they ran it through again .      i put jalo   s reel in the navigator     said marco finally .     it included this .         run it again     said kin .     i want to have another look at one or two bits .         the picture quality is exceptionally good     said marco .      it had to be .  they were meant to be transmitted over tens of parsecs           if i may interrupt for a few seconds     said silver .  she reached up to her tusks  and began to twist them .  kin watched in fascinated horror as the fangs unscrewed and were stowed away in a small leather case .  she had seen fangless shandi on shand itself  but they were children or condemned criminals .      in order to be a good linguist one must be prepared to make sacrifices     said silver in faultless allspeak .     do you think i submitted to the operation without much secret shame and soul searching .  however  i have something to say .  do i strike you  marco farfarer  as a character of ill humour and short temper .         no .  why .         if you try a stunt like you just did once more  i will kill you .         i thought it was impossible anyway     said kin  with hasty diplomacy .   marco looked from one to the other .      it   s not impossible  simply tricky and highly illegal     he said carefully .     do it wrong  and you end up in the middle of the nearest sun .  as for your  uh  statement  silver     i have noted it .      they both nodded gravely .      right     said kin brightly .     fine .  now show the film again .      either the film was genuine or jalo was an unsung special effects genius .   it might have been the polar regions of new earth  or anywhere on serendipity .  not njal and milkgaard  because those worlds had no birds and one picture showed a flock of birds in the distance     until silver turned up the magnification .  whatever they were  they were not birds .  not with those horse heads  black scales and bat black wings .  but there was a word for them in human history  and the name dragon unfolded in kin   s mind .   there was a seascape  and unless there was something very wrong with the size of the waves  the snake headed beast looping through them was fully a kilometre long .   there were distant views of what might have been cities .  there were several sunsets  at least one taken from the air  and a number of night shots of starscapes .      go back to the aerial sunset     said kin .     now what   s wrong .         horizon   s odd     said marco .   it was .  the curve was oddly flattened .  there was something else wrong too  something kin couldn   t immediately spot .      apart from that  it could be any human world     observed silver .      funny     said kin .     jalo talked about a flat earth  not just a flat world .         that does not surprise me .  humans have been the only race to entertain the primitive idea of a flat world     said marco  running the film back to the starscapes .     if you don   t believe me  look it up .  kung always thought they lived on the inside of a sphere  and shandi always had big twin hanging up there to teach them a basic lesson in cosmology .      kin grunted .  later on she found time to check it in the ship   s library .  it was true  but what did it prove .  that men were slightly stupid and very egocentric .  aliens already knew that .      we shall be able to ascertain the precise nature of the flat world     said marco     when we arrive .         hold it     said kin .     stop right there .  what do you mean  when we arrive .      the kung gave her a withering look .     i have already set up the program .  that whine you hear is the matrix battery charging up .         where are we now .         half a million kilometres from kung .         then you can land and let me off .  i ain   t coming .         what plans had you  then .      kin hesitated .     oh  we could take jalo to a resurrection clinic     she said at last .     we could wait around and  uh  we  uh         she stopped .  it sounded pretty feeble  even to her .      we have the course  the ship and the time     said marco .     the man will come to no harm in the sargo .  if we hesitate we will have to explain  and probably the company will want to know why you weren   t frank with it in the first place .      kin looked at silver for support  but the shand just nodded heavily .     i would not like to lose this opportunity     she said .      look     said kin .     taking this trip with jalo seemed a good idea  right .  but now we don   t know the half of what we   re embarking on .  i   m just using a bit of intelligent caution  is all .         so much for the vaunted monkey curiosity     said marco to silver .     so much for the dynamic manifest destiny we hear so much           you   re mad     the pair of you .      marco shrugged  a particularly effective gesture with two sets of shoulders  and unfolded his bony frame from the pilot chair .     okay     he said .     you fly us back .      kin flumped into the seat and pulled the wraparound screen down to her level .  she looked at the three quarter consol .  there were several dials that looked vaguely familiar .  that black panel might control air and temperature  the rest was gibberish .  kin was used to ships with big brains .      i can   t fly this .     she said .     and you know it .         glad to have you with us  then     said marco  looking at his watch .     why don   t you two get some sleep .      kin lay in her bunk  thinking .  she thought of how attitudes to aliens got stereotyped .  kung were paranoid  blood thirsty and superstitious .  shandi were calm  bloody thirsty and sometimes ate people .  shandi and kung thought humans were blood thirsty  foolhardy and proud .  everyone thought ehfts were funny  and no one knew what ehfts thought about anyone .   it was true that  once  four kung had boarded a grounded human ship during the bad old days and killed thirty five crew before the last kung went down under the weight of clipe needles .  it was true that on certain diplomatically forgotten occasions shandi had  with great ceremony  eaten people .  so what .  how could you evaluate this unless you could think like an alien .   we dismiss each other with a few clich  s  she thought .  it   s the only way we can live with one another .  we have to think of aliens as humans in a different skin  even though we   ve all been hammered by different gravities on the anvils of strange worlds      she sat up in the darkness  listening .  the ship hummed to itself .   she padded naked down the equatorial corridor .  something that had been nagging at the back of her mind had surfaced  and she had to find out      ten minutes later she entered the control room  where marco was still sitting under the screen .      marco .      he ducked his head  then pushed the screen up and grinned .      everything   s going fine .  what   s that you   re holding .  it looks like a melted plastic sculpture .         this was the box the raven was in .  bioplastic .  it doesn   t melt below one thousand degrees .  i found it in the airlock     snapped kin  tossing it onto his lap .   marco turned the shapeless mass over  then shrugged .      well .  are these birds intelligent .         sure  but they don   t tote cutting torches around .      there was a pause while they both gazed at the melted box .      jalo could have done it     said marco uncertainly .     no  that doesn   t work     he was surprised to see the bird .         to put it mildly  yes .  i don   t like this sort of mystery  marco .  have you seen the raven .         not since jalo did .  hmm .     he reached out one lank arm and punched the ship   s panic button .   bells and sirens echoed through the ship .  within forty seconds silver thundered in  crushed snow from her sleeping pit still sticking to her fur .  she braked when she saw them watching her  and growled .      a human joke .     she said .  they told her .      it is odd     she agreed .     shall we search the ship .      marco spoke at length about the number of small spaces in a spaceship .  he added details about what happened if something small and feathered crawled into a vital duct  or blundered into the wrong cable .      all right     said kin .     what are you going to do .         you two go back to your rooms     said marco .     seal them off  and search for the bird .  i will evacuate the rest of the ship .  this is standard anti vermin drill anyway .         but you   d kill it     said kin .      i don   t mind .      later marco sat watching the build up of power in the ship   s fusion driver  out there in the centre of the toroids ring field  and wondered about the bird .  then he dismissed the thought  and wondered instead if either of the others had noticed him hide the magic money purse after jalo   s death .  just a matter of prudence      silver turned over in the snow hole in her environmentally frozen cabin  and wondered if either of the others had seen her remove the magic purse from marco   s hideaway and secrete it in one of her own .  for later evaluation      kin lay watching the blinking red light that indicated vacuum in the corridor outside her cabin  and felt a vague sympathy for the raven .  then she wondered if either of the others had seen her take the magic purse from the place silver had hidden it and drop it out of a disposal chute during an elsewhere jump .  by now the purse was barrelling on towards the edge of universe  propelled by the steady ejection of day bills from its open mouth .   spaced at four arbitrary compass points around the ship were quick air chambers  installed during its construction to conform with board of trade regulations .  they meant that  if caught during sudden decompression  a crewman could duck into a chamber instead of having to struggle with a suit .  they were a good idea .   the big red light on each one was supposed to flash so that later rescuers could see it .  there was no one to see it now  but one was flashing .   inside  both claws gripping the pressuring lever  the raven leaned with its beak pressed against the air vent  and thought about survival .   during a dull moment  of which any voyage had plenty  silver once asked the ship   s library to provide her with a copy of continuous creation .  it couldn   t  but it did furnish this extract from the relevant ten worlds literary digest     after     lines on the book   s contribution towards the rediscovery of paper making .      the book   s achievement was that it drew together a few dozen strands of research on archeological  paleontological and astronomical fronts  and wove the theory out of them .  it is easy now to say that  of course  the theory was obvious .  obvious it was  but it was so obvious that it was almost hidden     except to a planetary designer who was used to thinking in terms of secondary creation  and who was also a voracious reader .     this was the theory   there were the spindles  telepaths  so telepathic that no more than a thousand of them could occupy a world at a time  because of the mental static .  and we humans thought we had a population problem .  they left libraries and scientific devices  and it was already known that they could reshape planets more to their liking .  they needed room to think .  they were proud .  when they discovered  on bery  the remains of a wheeler strata machine under half a mile of granite  their pride was shattered .  spindles were not  as they had believed  the first lords of creation     the wheelers had beaten them to it  half a billion years before .  the shock led them to cease reproduction .   one ship  conveniently stocked with library tapes  had eventually tumbled slowly enough across earth   s system to be stopped .  inside its meteor ripped skins were three mummies .  they had been the crew .  three crew .   the ship had been over a hundred miles across .  most of it had been empty balloon .  room to think      the wheelers were silicon hemispheres  propelling themselves on three natural wheels .  nothing except shell and wheels had survived  but there were  under the granite  the compressed remains of wheeler cities .  other wheeler remains began to be discovered .   wheelers had recorded traces of an earlier race  the paleotechs .  paleotechs were said to have created the type ii stars and their planets .  one of their specialities had been the triggering of novas as a crucible for heavy metal creation .  why .  why not .  paleotechs weren   t easily understandable .   once  kin arad answered to her own satisfaction at least the question of why the paleotechs had created stars .     because they could     she said .    in one interstellar gulf a ship dropping out of elsewhere for repairs had discovered a paleotech     dead  at least by human terms  though kin arad has pointed out that paleotechs probably lived by a different time scale and that this apparently lifeless hulk may have been very much alive if considered by slow  metagalactic time  .  it was a thin walled tube half a million miles long .   wheeler legends spoke of a polished smooth world where paleotechs had inscribed their history  which included the legend of the prepaleotech chthones  who spun giant stars out of galactic matter  and the rime  who produced hydrogen as part of their biological processes      this was the theory  that races arose  and changed the universe to suit themselves  and died .  and then other races arose in the ruins  changed the universe to suit themselves  and died .  and other races arose in the ruins     and arose  and arose  all the way back to the pre totalic nothingness .  continuously creating .  there had never been any such thing as a natural universe .    kin once heard a speaker refer disparagingly to the spindles because they had manipulated worlds .  she stood up and said     so what .  if they hadn   t  earth would still be a mess of hot rocks and heavy clouds .  they changed all this and they brought in a big moon  but do you know the best of all .  they gave us a past .  they jiggered their strata machines to give us fossils of things that had never existed .  icthyosaurs and crinoids and chalk and ancient seas .  maybe they didn   t feel at home unless they had a few hundred metres of fossil strata under them  like they couldn   t feel happy if there was another spindle within fifty miles .  but i think they did it because it was their art .  they didn   t know anyone would see it  but they went ahead and did it .       kin found a quiet moment to explore the weapons hold .  if marco had flown the ship to a world with a shaky government  there was enough stuff on board to equip a rebel army .  there was what looked like a complete missile system  and several racks of small arms that jalo must have had made to ancient patterns .  one handgun fired sharp wooden bullets .  why .   the ship     they never did get round to naming it     dropped into real space .  marco   s hands hovered over the controls as he waited for a welcoming barrage .   there was nothing .  there wasn   t even a star near the ship .      we   re still on the edge of explored space     said marco .     that blue giant there is dagda secundus .  it   s about half a light year away .         well  here we are and where are we .     asked kin .     a star like that shouldn   t have planets  especially nice sunny ones .         the computer is searching     said marco gloomily .     needle .  haystack .  perhaps we   ll find some iceball whipping along at maybe twenty knots orbital velocity .         meanwhile  we could eat     suggested silver .   they each dialled their meal from the dumbwaiter and wandered back into the control room .      give it an hour     said kin .     this area of space has been explored .  what the hell can it find that the survey teams missed .         i doubt if they looked out here     said silver .  there was a brief moment of nausea as the computer flicked the ship a few million miles for a parallax measurement .      we followed jalo   s course tape     said marco .     i   d hate to have to        the computer chimed .  marco vaulted into the control chair and juggled the screen controls .   at the limit of magnification there was a small fuzzy hemisphere .  they looked at it blankly .      just a planet     said kin .      rather brightly lit for this distance out     agreed marco .     highly polished ice .      silver coughed apologetically .     i am no astronomer     she said     but surely it is wrong .         not ice .     said marco .     could be helium iv  i suppose .         you misunderstand me     said the shand .     surely the light hemisphere should be pointed towards the star .      they stared at it .  finally marco exclaimed     bleeding hell  she   s right .     he glanced down at the shouter screens .     it   s half a billion miles away     he said .     i should be able to make a straight line jump .  uh         for a moment four hands hovered like a flight of hawks over the controls .   and dropped .   the sky was falling in on them .  then marco  almost in hypnosis  turned the ship and there  spread out below like a bowl of jewels  was the flat earth .   it was like a plate full of continents .  a coin tossed into the air by an indecisive god .   the ship had come out perhaps twenty thousand miles above it  and out of vertical .  kin looked out at a hazy map of black land and silver seas fuzzed with moonlit cloud .  there was what  for want of a better term     how many people had mapped flat planets .      a polar cap  hugging one side of the disc .   moonlit .  there was a moon  apparently a few thousand miles above the disc  and it shone .  it couldn   t be reflected light .  there was nothing to reflect .  and there were stars     between the ship and the disc  there were stars .   the shadowy oval lay inside a hazy globe .  marco translated what the machines were emotionlessly telling him .  the disc was inside a transparent sphere sixteen thousand miles across  and the stars were        that   s what i said  kin        were fixed to this .   one edge of the disc glowed brighter .  it flashed green fire  which ran around the rim until they were looking at a hole in space surrounded by green and silver flames .  then the ring grew a gem  and died as suddenly as it had come .  the sun had risen .  a tiny sun .   one machine said it was an external fusion reactor .  it looked like a sun .   this is what i   ll remember  thought kin .  the green fire at sunrise  because all around the disc there   s a sea  and it flows over the edge in a waterfall thirty five thousand miles long and the sun shines through the falling water     no wonder jalo was mad .   dawn rushed across the disc .  silver was the first to react .  she giggled .      he did call it a flat earth  didn   t he .     she asked .     it was the truth  wasn   t it .      kin looked .  the continents had moved  it was true  and there didn   t appear to be a new world at all .  it was earth down there     she recognized europe .  earth .  and it was flat .   marco put them into a fast orbit  and no one left the cabin for three hours .  even silver let a mealtime go past  and fed on curiosity instead .   they watched the waterfall slide past under high magnification .  there were rocky islands  some tree lined  overhanging the drop .  it was a long drop     five hundred miles into a turmoil of steam .  but the disc itself was only five miles thick .  as the ship passed under the disc there was nothing but a space black plain on the underside .      some humans used to believe the world was flat and rested on the backs of four elephants     said silver .      yeah .     said kin .     what did the elephants stand on .         a giant turtle  swimming endlessly through space .      kin tasted the idea .     stupid     she said .     what did the turtle breathe .         search me .  it   s your racial myth .         i   d give a lot to know how the seas can keep on spilling over the edge .         probably a molecule sieve  down there in the steam     said marco without looking up from the shouter screens .     the plumbing is a minor matter  however .  where are the inhabitants .  this thing is obviously an artefact  a created thing .         no one   s trying to contact us .         just listen to my excitement .         i suppose you mean no .  perhaps it   s as well .  i keep thinking of all those weapons in the hold .         the thought seldom leaves my mind .  perhaps jalo meant to hunt sea serpents  but i think not .  i cannot help thinking that anyone capable of building the artefact would hardly be bothered by any weaponry this ship could carry .         perhaps the inhabitants are dead     suggested silver .  kin and marco looked at each other blankly .      unlikely     said marco .     more likely they   ve passed beyond the stage of gross physical existence .  maybe even at this moment they are screwing the inscrutable .         they   re due for a big shock one of these days  then     said kin .     this set up must take vast amounts of power just to keep it going .  the sun   s orbit is all wrong .  what keeps the seas from emptying .  why have they got their own private stars when there   s real ones out here           i can answer that one     said marco .     it looks as though the big sphere is only transparent from the outside .  we can see in  they can   t see out .  don   t ask me why .         do we land .     said silver .      how could we get in .     said kin .  marco grimaced .      that is easy     he said .     there   s an eighty metre hole in the shell .  we passed it last orbit .         what .         you were busy looking at the waterfall and in any case it did not seem particularly important .  no doubt the disc dwellers have space travel .      they hovered over the hole twenty minutes later .  it was slightly elliptical  and the edges seemed to have been melted .  it could have been made by careful jockeying of a ship with a fusion drive  thought kin .  or a geological laser .  would a terminus probe have carried one .  probably .      we   re still way above atmosphere     said marco .     i hope the disc dwellers aren   t sore about people making holes in the sky .         we could offer to pay for repairs     said silver .   kin wondered if that was a joke .  why would anyone shut themselves away from the universe like this .  it didn   t make sense  unless they were completely paranoid .  if they weren   t to start with they would be now .      no     she said out loud .     they couldn   t have built something like this if they were mad .         it looks like earth  and earthmen are mad     silver pointed out .     i suppose humans haven   t been doing a little secret world building .         no        began kin  and saw they were both looking at her slyly .     i don   t know     she finished lamely .     it certainly looks like it  i   ll admit .         it certainly does     said marco .      it does too     agreed silver .      don   t breathe     said marco .     there   s just enough room .  we   re going in .      the ship dropped through with a few metres to spare  and the proximity detectors shrilling .  they were still going mad when kin looked up and saw a ship speeding towards them .   it hit in one of the holds  buckling the hull and sending the sky wheeling crazily .  damage doors crashed into place and then the control room lurched again as it fell away from the ship under its own power  a self contained emergency craft .   the damage to the ship was nothing to what happened to the attacker .  it disintegrated .   blue green shards were spreading across the sky and  as kin pulled herself up from the cabin floor  the screens were sparkling like glitter dust .   the inner door of the emergency airlock opened and marco loped in  tugging at his helmet with two hands .  another one held a laser rifle  salvaged from the other half of the ship .  the fourth held a long sliver of glass  gingerly .      looks like someone threw a bottle at us     said kin .      their aim was remarkable     said marco coldly .     i can take us back to the rest of the ship  but it is hardly worth it .  we   ve got no elsewhere capability .  i can   t build a pinch field .  most of the contents of the hold are floating out there somewhere  and they were our weapons .  the auxiliary systems are all working .  i could probably fly us home on the ringrim motor alone .         then all is not lost     rumbled silver .      no  except that it would take about two thousand years .  even this bloody gun is useless .  someone thought it a safe idea to pack the main coil in a separate box .         so we land on the disc     said kin flatly .      i was wondering when someone was going to say that     said marco .     it   ll be a one way trip .  this craft won   t lift off again .         what hit us .     said silver .     i thought i saw a ball about ten metres across            i   ve got a horrible feeling i know what it was     murmured kin .      yes .  it was a weapon     said marco .     i admit i find its complete destruction difficult to understand  but the fact remains that we had a stargoing ship .  now we have not .  i intend to make one orbit before landing .      silver coughed gently .     what     she said     will we eat .      it took several hours to ferry the dumbwaiter across from the lazily spinning ship .  at kin   s insistence they also brought the sargo with jalo in it  and linked it into the emergency system .  the waiter had its own internal power supply     as laid down by regulations .  no one wanted to spend their last hours in a blacked out ship with any hungry shand that might be aboard .   the new orbit took them past the disc   s moon  no longer shining and obviously invisible in the disc   s day sky .  they saw that one hemisphere was black .      phases     said kin .     wobble the moon on its axis and you get phases .         who does the wobbling .     asked marco .      i don   t know .  whoever wanted this thing to look like earth  from the surface .  and don   t look at me like that     i   ll swear this wasn   t built by humans .      she spoke to them about artificial worlds     rings  discs  dyson spheres and solar tunnels .      they don   t work     she said .     that is  they   re vulnerable .  too dependent on civilization .  and there   s too many things to go wrong .  why do you think the company terraforms worlds when there are cheaper alternatives .  because planets last  that   s why .  through anything .      and i   m certain this wasn   t built by spindles .  planets were important to them .  they had to feel the strata below and the unlimited space above .  somehow they could sense it .  living on something like this could drive them out of their skulls .  anyway  they died out four million years ago at least  and i   m positive that this thing isn   t that old .  it must be all machinery just to keep going  and machines wear out .         there   s cities down there     said marco     in the right place  too .  if this was earth .     he looked up .     okay  kin  you   ve been dying to tell us .  what did hit us back there .         was the hole on the ecliptic .      marco leaned over and played with the computer terminal for a few seconds .     yes     he said .     is it important .  the sun was well below us .         we were pretty unlucky .  i think we were hit by a planet .         that was my thought too     said silver gravely     but i did not like to say anything in case i was thought a fool .         planet .     asked marco .     a planet landed on the ship .         i know it   s usually the other way around  but i think i   m beginning to grasp the workings of this system     replied kin .     there   s a fake sky  so there   s got to be fake planets .  their orbits must be something to see .  if it   s really supposed to look like an earth sky they   d have to be retrograde sometimes .         i was wrong     said marco .     we should have started for home .  we could have rigged up the sargo and taken turns to wake up .  two thousand years isn   t all that long .  i don   t know what agency told jalo i was the man for the job  but he   s owed his money back .         still  the view   s good     said kin .   the ship was passing under the disc again .  and again there was the flash of green fire as  for a few seconds  the sun shone through the waterfall around the disc .   something hit them     again .   it wasn   t a planet .  it was a ship  and most of it was still hanging in the rearward aerial array when marco had fought the spin it gave them .   kin went out this time  and she steadied herself on an aerial stump as she looked at the frosted wreckage .      marco .         i hear you .         it   s made one hell of a mess of the antennae .         i have already deduced that .  we are also losing air .  can you see the leak .         there   s fog damn near everywhere .  i   m going to take a look .      they heard her boots clump around the hull  and then there was a silence so long that marco shouted into the radio .  when kin spoke  she spoke slowly .      it is a ship  marco .  no  wrong word .  a boat .  a sailing boat .  you know  like on seas .      she looked across at the fire rimmed disc .   a waterfall pouring over the edge of the world .   the mast was broken and most of the planking had been whirled away by the force of the impact  but enough rope had held together to make it obvious the boat had a passenger .      marco .         kin .         it had a passenger .         humanoid .      kin growled .     look  it went over the waterfall and then into vacuum and then hit the ship .  what sort of description do you want .  it looks like an explosion in a morgue .      kin was used to violent death .  oldsters died that way     freefall diving without a backpack on  deliberately wandering near when they released the cloned elephants on a new world  banjaxing the safeties and stepping into the hopper of a strata machine     but then ambulance crews took over .  there had never been anything to see  except in the strata machine case .  and that was only a strange pattern in a freshly laid coal measure .   she knelt like a robot .  wet cloth had frozen in vacuum  but it had been good cloth  well woven .  inside      silver later analysed tissue samples  and announced that the passenger had been human enough to call kin cousin .  she would have been surprised at any other result  without being able to say quite why .   he had sailed over the edge of the world .  the thought made her go cold .  everyone knew the world was flat  everyone had always known the world was flat  it was obvious .  but there was always someone who would laugh at the old men and voyage into the terrifying seas to prove a different theory .  and he had been horribly wrong .   kin was glad about the argument over the suits .  there were five  two of which were shand size .  one of the others seemed to be faulty  and the trio were all sufficiently space cautious not to trust a suspect suit .      we must take the dumbwaiter     said silver .     maybe you and kin will be able to eat what is down there  but i will be poisoned .         get the machine to dish out a sack of dried food concentrates then     ordered marco .     we need that fourth suit .      silver grunted .     not as much as we need the machine .  it can analyse food .  it can supply clothing .  if necessary we can live off it .         i   m inclined to agree     said kin .      it   ll take the lifting power of the entire suit .         would you rather take a laser rifle that won   t fire .     said silver .  they glared at each other .      let   s take it for silver   s sake     said kin hurriedly .     hunger can be a big problem for shandi .      marco shrugged twice .     take it then     he said  and snatched the tool kit from a wall locker .  while they manhandled the big machine into the space suit and padded it around with thermoblankets  he took the control chair apart and ended up with a strip of metal trim sharpened to a killing edge and with a plastic handle at one end .  kin watched him weigh it thoughtfully in his hand .  ready to take on the makers of a fifteen thousand mile wide world with a homemade sword .  was that commendable human spirit or stupid kung bravado .   he turned and saw her watching him .      this is not to put fear into them     he said     but to take fear out of me .  are we ready .      he programmed the autopilot to hover for ten minutes a few hundred miles from the waterfall .  they took off on the suits    lift belts  silver towing the spare suit on a length of monofilament line .   kin glanced over her shoulder as the ship sped away on a spear of flame and climbed towards a high orbit .  then she turned back to the great wall of water  and the little islands on the very edge .  way around the disc the orbiting sun was sinking .   there were no city lights  anywhere .   in a ragged line they flew towards the tumbling water and the thunder at the edge of the world .   no one had seen  just before the ship soared away  the now perfectly workable fifth suit tumble from the airlock .  it inflated instantly  like an empty balloon .   in the big bubble helmet the raven surveyed the emergency controls carefully .  the suits were designed for anything     they could fly across a star system and land on a world .  there were tongue controls .   the raven reached out  pecked gently .  the suit surged forward .  the raven watched intently  then tried another control      the dawn came wetly .  kin awoke soaked with dew .  so much for thermoblankets .   it had been a long night .  the island  at the very lip of the rimfall  was hardly big enough to support a dangerous carnivore  unless it was semi aquatic .  but marco had pointed out that the disc might abound with semi aquatic carnivores  and had insisted on mounting guard .  kung could do without sleep for weeks at a time .   kin wondered whether to tell him about her personal stunner  now carefully hidden in a suit pocket .  feeling like a heel  she decided not to .  she had a long struggle with her conscience but she won  she won .   marco had evidently slept with the coming of the sun .  he lay curled bonelessly under a dripping bush .  through the mists  kin saw silver sitting on the rock outcrop on the fall side of the island .   kin scrambled up towards her .  the shand grinned and made room for her on the sun warmed stone .   the view was as though from the point of a wedge .  the rocky peak rose out of what looked suspiciously like a small wood of ash and maple .  beyond  the sun glinted off silver green sea .  to either side the fall was a white line of foam seen dimly through mist clouds .  behind      silver grabbed her in time .   when kin regained her balance she moved carefully down the slope to a seat that did not hang so obviously over a drop  and asked     can you really sit there and not worry .         what   s to worry .  you did not fret in the ship when there was only a metre of hull between you and eternity     said the shand .      that   s different .  that   s a real drop behind you .      silver raised her muzzle and sniffed the air .      ice     she exclaimed .     i smell ice .  kin  may i give you a lecture on sunshine .      kin automatically squinted at the sun .  her memory told her it was asteroid size .  but it looked right for earth .  it felt right on her skin .      go ahead .  tell me something i don   t know .         i have noticed pack ice going over the fall .  why should this be .  we know the disc has polar islands .  yet there are green lands nearby .  consider the distance between the equator and the polar islands .  why are not the north and south extremities frozen solid and the equatorial regions burning .      kin leaned her chin on her hands .  the shand was talking about the inverse square law .  if the sun was eight thousand miles from the equator at noon  it was eleven thousand miles from what had to be called the poles .   well  the path that sun followed couldn   t be called an orbit .  it moved like a guided spaceship .  but that didn   t explain the warm air around her .  consider  on most worlds the poles were but a few thousand miles further from the primary than was the equator  yet the temperature was wildly different .  on the disc  if one thought of the temperate zone as being effectively earth distant from the sun  then the poles were out around wotan and the equator broiled like venus .      some sort of force lens .     she hazarded .     i could believe anything .  certainly the sun   s path must be changed regularly .         i do not understand .         to get seasons .         ah     seasons .  yes  humans would require seasons .         silver        the shand sniffed again .     this is good air     she said .      silver  stop dodging .  you think we built this .         ah     the kung and i have discussed the topic  it is true .         the hell you have .  we   d better get this clear .  humans may be mad  but we   re not stupid .  as a work of celestial mechanics this disc is about as efficient as a rubber spanner .  it must drink power to keep going .  for crying out loud  you don   t want to hang your descendants    lives on the efficiency of dinky little orbiting suns and fake stars .  why didn   t the disc builders orbit it around a real sun .  they must have had the power .  instead they came out here to nowhere and built a world according to the ideas of some kind of medieval monk .  that   s not human .         the man on the ship was human .      kin had been thinking hard and long about him .  sometimes he came into her thoughts unbidden  in the long sleep hours .  she hesitated before replying .      i     don   t know .  maybe the disc builders kidnapped a bunch of humans back in prehistory .  or perhaps there was parallel evolution somewhere         she felt angry at herself for her ignorance  and even angrier at the shand for diplomatically not picking at the big holes in her argument .  if someone had offered kin an instant return to the comforts of earth at that moment  she would have spat .  there were too many questions to be answered first .   out loud     jalo talked about matter transmission .  i wonder how they get the water up from the bottom of the fall back into the ocean .      marco scrambled up the rocks towards them .  a change had come over him since the landing on the disc .  on the ship kin remembered him as being moody  cynical     now he seemed to vibrate with undirected enthusiasm .      we must make plans     he said .      you have a plan     kin corrected .      it is imperative we contact the masters of the disc     said marco  nodding and not appearing to notice her sarcasm .      you have changed your mind  then .     silver   s voice floated down from the heights .  she was standing up  sniffing the air again .      i face facts  however distasteful .  we cannot repair the ship .  they will have the capacity to do so  or spacecraft we may hire .  jalo got back .  or do you wish to spend your life here .         i do not think the disc people can help us     said silver .     we detected no power sources  no energy transmission .  we landed unaccosted .  these are my secondary reasons for suspecting a lapse into barbarianism .         secondary .     said kin .   silver grunted .     there is a ship approaching     she said .     by its lines i do not suspect it is a sports plaything of an advanced race .      they stared at her  then raced up the crag .  marco beat kin to the top by a series of long leaps and peered out across the water .      where .  where .      kin saw a speck on the edge of sight .      it is a rowing ship  twelve oars to a side     said silver  squinting slightly .     there is a mast and a furled sail .  it stinks .  the crew stink .  on their present course they will pass a mile to the north .         over the falls .     said kin .      surely the disc people have mastered the art of dealing with the waterfall     said marco .     the current does not appear to be strong .  there is a weir effect .      kin thought of the man in the fallen boat .      they know they   re heading for the falls but they don   t know what the falls are     she said .  silver nodded .      they stink because they are afraid     she said .     they are changing course for this island .  there is a man standing in the forward end  looking towards the falls .      marco became a blur of action .      we must prepare     he hissed .     follow me down .     rocks crashed behind him as he bounded back towards the trees where they had spent the night .   kin glanced from the shand  standing like a statue  to the boat .  even she could see the figures now .  water gleamed as it cascaded off whirling oars .  she even thought she could hear shouts .      i don   t think they will make it     she said quietly .      that is so     said silver .     see how the current swings them round .         it may be a test     said kin .     i mean  the very day we   re here and all .      silver sniffed .     my nose says not .      they looked at each other .  kin certainly was not going to argue with     million smell cells .  she could see the men in the boat clearly .  there was one  a small  bearded man  racing between the bent rowers and urging them on .  at best the boat was standing still .      ahem     suggested silver .   kin squinted up at the sun .      you recall that line we   re using to tow the spare suit .     she said .     how long is it .         standard monofilament length  fifteen hundred metres     said silver  adding     it could tether a world .         of course  we could be making a big mistake     said kin  starting to run down the slope .  silver lumbered after her .      the stomach says not     she said .  kin smiled .  shandi had different ideas about the seat of the emotions .   she flew out in a suit lift belt shorn of the bubble suit  dragging one end of the cable by a wide loop .      i consider this foolhardy in the extreme     said marco   s voice in her earpiece .      maybe     said kin .     just remember it was me that went out to the crashed boat .      there was a pause  with just the hissing of the wind in one ear and the carrier wave in the other .  finally marco said     point your belt camera at the boat .      the rowers had seen her .  most of them were hanging transfixed on their oars .   the boat was perhaps twenty five metres long  built like a pod .  silver had been too critical .  whoever had built it had a keen knowledge of hydrodynamics .  there was one mast  amidships  with a furled sail .  what space there was among the rowers appeared to be filled with jars and bundles .   kin aimed at the red haired man in the prow and dived  skimmed the wavetops and braked on a level with his astonished face  dropping the cable loop over the ornate prow and yelling to silver .  spray drenched her as the cable sprang out of the water .      get them rowing     said kin  making desperate arm movements .     to the island     she insisted  pointing dramatically .   redhair stared at her  at the island  at the taut cable and the curving wake of the ship as silver took the strain .  then he vaulted down the length of the boat  screaming at the bewildered men .  one stood up and started to argue .  redhair picked up a spar from the deck and hit him hard  then hauled him from his place and took his oar .   kin barrelled skyward  looking down on a ship that was already leaving a wake like a powerboat .  then she levelled out and headed back to the island .   its wooded shores passed far below her and she began searching in the misty blue sky beyond the falls .   she found what she was looking for .  there was a tiny white speck  drifting outwards .  she swooped  hearing the slight whump as the belt   s field took up a new protective shape around her .   silver   s belt motor was whining .  suit belts could lift their owners against ten gravities  and silver probably weighed     pounds .  it added up to a lot of pulling power at the end of the cable .   as kin waved and turned back for the disc  silver   s voice grunted in her ear .     there have been several jerks on the cable .      kin looked down .  there was a swathe of felled timber across the island .  the tree they   d used as an anchor hadn   t been tough enough after all .  now the cable was bent round the crag itself .      everything   s fine     she said .     we   ve got the edge on the current .  the cable cut through some trees  that   s all .      the boat was broadside on to the falls  but bouncing across the already whitening water .      fine  silver     she said .     fine .  marco wanted to meet the natives and he   s going to get a basinful in a minute .  steady .  steady .  stop .  stop .      the boat crunched on to the beach and bounded up into the trees  oars snapping .  several men fell overboard .      we   ve beached it .     said kin  dropping towards the wood .      if they   ve got any imagination they   re kissing that ground     said silver .      right .  let   s hope marco has the sense to stay out of sight .      her earpiece crackled .     i heard that .  i wish to disassociate myself from this entire undertaking         kin swooped .  she remembered being told that  ultimately  and whatever the science fiction blats may say  no one ever learned a language by eavesdropping on a culture   s communications .   it always came down to face to face confrontations .  to pointing .  to drawing circles in the sand .   circles in the sand .   well     it came down to pointing .   much later she found silver and marco in their clearing higher up the slope .  silver was sitting beside the dumbwaiter  scooping handfuls of grey and red goo out of a bowl .  marco was lying full length  peering through the leaves at the men on the beach .   they had lit a fire  and were cooking something .   silver nodded at her and did something to the dumbwaiter   s controls .      i already ate     sighed kin .     some sort of grain meal and dried fish .  didn   t you see .         i was  in fact  programming for an emetic .      marco turned over .     you ate food without even a rudimentary analysis .  do you wish to die so soon .         we need their trust     said kin .  she tossed a sliver of fish to silver .     i   ll take your damn potion  but hold that under the    waiter   s nose .  you know    waiter food always tastes like some body already ate it .  while we   re here we might as well have full stomachs .      she took a bowl of pink fluid from silver   s paw and retired to the other side of the clearing  where she was briefly and noisily sick .  silver reached up and dialled the    waiter for coffee .   presently the machine extruded a tongue of green plastic .  she tore it out and read it .      high on usable protein and vitamins     she said .     there is a hydrocarbon content from the drying process which may be carcinogenic in the long term  but it appears to pose no great risk .         great     said kin  helping herself to coffee .     suddenly i feel i could never look another dried fish in the face .  now  are you ready for the big answers .  as far as i can understand it  the small red haired man calls himself leiv eiriksson .      silver flicked the green printout neatly into the machine   s intake hopper .      that is a remarkable coincidence or something else     she said calmly .      you   re not kidding .      marco turned back from his surveillance .     what is coincidental .     he said .     did you observe their weaponry .         they have swords made out of  uh  bog iron  hand beaten .  easily blunted     said kin thoughtfully .     their greatest weapon is their boat .  are you familiar with the term clinker built .      he nodded .      good  it means nothing to me .  they   re fast .  these people rule a large part of the sea with those boats and those swords .  sometimes they are pirates  but they   ve got a sophisticated system of law .  they   re brave .  a thousand mile journey in a boat like that is commonplace .      marco stared at her .     you learned all that .         no  all i understood was his name  and only because i   ve heard it before .  it   s all from memory .     she looked at silver for confirmation .  the shand nodded .         in the year three hundred and twenty two        she intoned        eiriksson sailed the ocean blue    .         very poetic     said marco levelly .     now  will you please explain .         if you were raised in mexico you wouldn   t have heard about this     said kin .     they   re snobbish about their history down there .  leiv eiriksson        she began to outline earth   s history        discovered vinland  more than three hundred years after the battle of haelcor had ended the third and last remem empire .      the big migration followed automatically .  the turks were again pushing west and north .  leiv   s father  eirik  was a shrewd salesman .  his greenland had turned out nowhere like as green as it had been in his imagination  but from vinland leiv had thoughtfully brought rich berries and wild grains .  the northmen went west again .   they leap frogged colony after colony down the eastern seaboard  up into the base rugged lands around tyker   s sea and down the long fjord into the middle seas .  it was the landscape of their dreams .  they called it valhalla .   there were natives .  but the newcomers were only half hearted farmers     underneath the agricultural veneer they thought bloody .  those tribes they couldn   t out fight they out thought .  when they met the objibwa confederacy they made treaties .  and they spread  and merged .   by all the theories it should have ended there .  neither the natives nor the invaders had the textbook kind of social dynamic that builds remes .  the northmen should have become just another tribe  with blue eyes and fair hair .   the theories were wrong .  something latent in both races was sparked into fire .  it was a big continent  and it was rich .   in short  three hundred years after leiv  a fleet arrived at the mouth of the mediterranean .  most of the vessels were under sail although there were one or two  small  fast and inclined to blow up  that could move into the wind .  the sails of the big ships bore the great eagle of valhalla on a striped background alternating the colours of the sky  the snow and blood .   the battle of gibraltar was short .  europe had been through two hundred years of stagnation .   there was no answer to cannon .      i take the point     said marco .     this leiv is an important figure in earth history .  this is not  however  earth .         it looks like earth     said kin .     an earth that was only imagined  but earth .         are you seriously suggesting           i   ll tell you what i   m suggesting .  i think you and silver are right .  i think humans built this place .  i can   t think why .      silver grunted .     surely there would be records           not if the company suppressed them .      it was the logical answer .  the company had built this artefact in secret .     jalo    had been a plant  sent to bring them here .  why would the company build the disc .  kin thought she knew the answer  and she didn   t like it .  but she couldn   t figure out why there had been such a performance to bring them here .   but at least it was all logical .  what other answer was there .  mysterious aliens .  they would have to be very mysterious .  if it was the company  kin hated it .      we are in danger from every quarter     said marco enthusiastically .     we must wear our lift belts at all times .  i suggest we move towards a centre of civilization .  we might find some clues as to the disc   s origins .         then there   s our transport     said kin  pointing .     i don   t know how long suit power lasts against gravity  but if there   s any sea to cross i   d like to do it in a boat .         they may yet turn out to be hostile     said marco  watching the men .      when they see you and silver .      in fact introducing the aliens presented a problem .  kin solved it by walking down to the encampment naked .  after her earlier appearance as the goddess of mercy  she was confident that the men would sooner rape an alligator .   leiv rushed towards her and sank to his knees .  she looked down at him with an expression she hoped was benevolent .   he was smaller than most of the crew .  she wondered how he exerted his authority     until she saw the shrewd glint in his eye  even now  that said here was the master of the unsporting kick and the kidney punch .  she felt glad of the stunner  now concealed in her palm .      you   re about to have an amazing opportunity to make new friends     she said sweetly .     this is one saga they   ll never believe .  okay  silver  come on out .      the shand appeared at the decent distance  pushing through the bushes further along the beach .  as she plodded nearer several men hurried off in the other direction .  when they saw her tusks several others followed them .   grinning fit to burst  kin walked across to the shand and put a hand in one huge  leather palmed paw .      stop smiling     she said through clenched teeth .      i fought it would put them at eafe .         on you it looks hungry .      leiv was still standing rooted to the sand as kin led the shand up to him .  she took the man   s hand in hers .      kneel and grovel     she murmured .   silver folded up obediently .  leiv looked at her and then at kin .  finally he reached out and prodded silver   s arm .      good boy     said kin  beaming .  he jumped back .   to introduce phase two kin began to whistle the old robot morris tune mrs widgery   s lodger .   silver danced mournfully on the sand  gazing heavenward with an expression of acute distaste .  but she held the rhythm .  she also moved awkwardly .  kin  who had seen her move like oiled water  admired that last touch .  anything sufficiently ungainly was funny .  funny wasn   t dangerous .   the men began to trickle back .  silver danced on  kicking up little sandstorms and shuffling from one foot to the other .  kin stopped whistling .      you   ve passed     she said .     they   re practically about to feed you lumps of sugar .  have a rest .  try to avoid yawning .  marco .      marco hissed .  he stepped out of the bushes .   in his grey ship suit and a cloak hastily made out of a thermoblanket he looked passably human  if emaciated .  his eyes were too big and his nose was too long .  his face was grey as the suit .   but he had masses of flame red hair .  it wasn   t really hair but it was red .  perhaps it made up for the eyes .   the men watched him warily  but no one fled this time .   one of them stepped up to leiv and growled something  drawing a short sword .  that led to a moment of confusion that ended with marco crouched to spring and the man lying on the sand with his sword ten feet away .  then leiv stopped twisting his arm and took a running kick .  the man screamed .      now we launch the boat     said kin firmly .   silver padded towards the beached vessel and braced herself with a shoulder against the prow .  nothing happened for a moment  and then the boat slid down the beach  only stopping when the stern was moving urgently in the current .   kin took leiv   s arm and led him firmly towards it .  he was quick on the uptake .  within five minutes the men were on board  the dumbwaiter was humming to itself by the mast  and all eyes were on silver  hovering out to sea on the end of the cable .   there was an area of dead water where the sea parted round the island before dropping into nothingness .  by the time the current tugged feebly at it the boat was flying over the waves .          two incidents enlivened the journey .  marco was handed a horn of some sweet substance by a nervous leiv .   he sniffed it suspiciously and poured some into the    waiter .     it appears to be some kind of glucose drink     he said .     what do you think  kin .         did you try it on the    waiter .         it gave a green light .  could it be some form of strengthening potion .      he drank half the horn  and smacked what passed for lips .  then he laughed vaguely and drank the other half .   later he programmed the dumbwaiter to duplicate it  and when the men had got over their amazement at the disposable plastic cups they were passed back as fast as they could be filled .  spasmodic singing broke out  and there was an occasional clattering of oars as rowers missed their stroke .  finally kin  after leiv   s unspoken plea  switched off the machine .   later silver tried her hand at rowing .  sitting amidships and grasping two oars  she followed the stroke easily .  one by one the rowers stopped to watch her .  the boat didn   t slow until her oars snapped .   marco found kin sitting in the skin shelter behind the mast  drinking martinis and thinking .      i wish a private word     he said .      fine     said kin  patting the rug beside her .     how is the head now .         better .  that drink obviously contains dangerous impurities .  i don   t think i will try any more for an hour or so .     he fished in his belt pouch and pulled out a roll of plastic .  it opened out into an aerial photograph of the disc .      i got the computer to prepare it before we left the ship     he said .      why didn   t you show it to me before .         i did not wish to encourage any foolhardy explorations .  however  now that we are penetrating the disc     look at the photo .  what is missing .      kin took the sheet .     a lot     she said .     you know that .  no valhalla .  that   s why leiv found the waterfall .  no brasil .  the peaceful ocean is tiny  look  round here on the back of asia           any additions .      kin peered at the map .     i don   t know     she said .  marco used a double jointed thumb to point to the centre of the disc .      the cloud cover makes it a bit indistinct  but that shouldn   t be there .  that island in the arabian sea .  you notice it   s perfectly circular .  it is the geographical hub of the disc .         what about it .         don   t you see .  it is an anomaly .  we   ll find the disc civilization there if anywhere .  these people are barbarians .  intelligent  yes     but space going .      he looked at her .      are you afraid this may turn out to be a company artefact .     he said carefully .  she nodded .      there is an old kung story     said marco softly  his voice like the currents in a quicksand     concerning a lord who had a high tower built .  then he called various wise kung together and said     i will give my finest oyster farm and the famed kelp beds off tchp pch to the kung who can determine the height of that tower using nothing but a barometer .  those who fail will be exiled to the dry lands because that   s the way it goes for the not wise enough .     so the wise kung tried and  although they could find the height to within a few chetds  this was not considered accurate enough and they were sent to the dry lands .         i like folk tales     said kin     but do you think this is           then one day     said marco loudly     the wisest kung  who hadn   t hazarded an answer yet  took his barometer to the home of the lord   s master builder  and said     i will give you this beautiful barometer if you will be so good as to tell me the height of the tower .         a shadow loomed over them as silver thrust her fangs over the deck awning .      forry to interrupt     she said     but you might be interefted in thif         they looked past her .  most of the men had stopped rowing and were staring up into the sky .   kin stared with them .  there were three specks moving across the haze like high altitude jets .      vapour trails     said marco .     obviously they have come looking for us .  we won   t have to go and offer them our barometer .         what can you see  silver .     kin asked .  the shand twanged a fang .      they appear to be flying lizards     she said .     the method of propulsion seems mysterious  but we may learn more  since they are losing height fast .      leiv tugged at kin   s arm .  around them men were methodically tossing oars and bundles into the water and diving over the side after them .  the little man seemed to be desperately searching for words .  finally he remembered one .      fire .     he suggested  and tumbled her backward into the sea .  the coldness numbed her  but she knew enough to twist and kick out convulsively .  treading water and gripping a handy oar she watched the sky .  the specks had made a wide turn and the distant double thump of a sonic boom rolled across the sea .  marco and silver had stayed on the boat  staring .   soon three lizard shapes with theatrically batlike wings glided over the wave tops to circle the boat in perfect formation  treading the air with two sets of cruel talons .  wisps of smoke trailed from their dilated nostrils .   then they drifted towards the north  becoming specks again as they made another turn .  they also gained height .  if they were aircraft  thought kin  i   d say this was going to be a bombing run .   as the first dragon plummeted towards the ship  leiv put one hand firmly on her head and pushed her underwater .   she bobbed up furious  her ears ringing .  the water was steaming .  smoke was rising from the boat .   there was a sudden mound in the water beside her and marco surfaced  gasping and cursing .  a bigger splash further along marked silver   s return from the depths .      what happened .  what happened .     gasped kin .      it hovered and breathed fire     said silver .      and no bloody lizard does that to me .     screamed marco .  he struck out for the charred hull  rocking it violently in his attempt to get aboard .   another beast drifted down .  there was a quiet splash as silver somersaulted and kicked away for the green depths .   there was also a groan from the water treading men as they saw marco uncloaked for the first time  grasping an oar with all four hands .  as the dragon homed in it was bright enough to tread air just out of reach of marco   s impromptu weapon  wingbeats making spray patterns on the sea while it gathered its breath .   something white shot through the water like a cork and gripped a pair of hovering claws .  for a second silver and the startled creature hung there .  then the wings met with a clap as they shot down into the sea  and kin heard a distinct hiss .   the third dragon must have been the brightest  thought kin .  the brightest always fought last .  it was too late for it to stop its flight .  instead it passed over the boat with its wings spread like parachutes  and  as it thundered by above his head  marco screamed and leapt .   he was wearing his lift belt .  the dragon tried to twist in mid air  tumbled  regained its balance and tried to flee for height and safety .  it didn   t work .   on the other side of the boat the water foamed and a wingtip beat the surface listlessly .  then the hull canted sharply .  silver was climbing aboard .   the men around kin shouted and struck out  laughing as they heaved themselves up the side .   high above the dogfight the surviving dragon screamed and disappeared speedily into the east  giving kin a short and tantalizing glimpse of its high speed propulsion .  those horror story wings were too clumsy for anything except ponderous flight .  to travel fast  the dragon folded them along its side  bent its head back under its body  and exhaled .  by the time it was too far away for kin to see details its breath was yellow hot .   she followed something else down the sky as it tumbled lazily .  it was a dragon head .  shortly afterwards  although to the silent crowd on the boat it seemed much longer  the body followed  wings still spread wide  spiralling slowly with marco climbing to its back and still hacking with the knife .  when he hit the water a cheer went up .   it turned to anger when they saw that silver was dragging her dragon aboard  still alive .  when the men moved hurriedly aside they gave kin a good view .   the beast flopped mournfully on the deck  water streaming from its wings .  it raised its dripping head towards her and sneezed  violently .   two jets of warm water hit kin on the legs .   marco was helped aboard by all four arms .  his comb blazed blood red and  as he stood up amid the admiring crowd  he raised his black stained knife over his head and yodelled      refteg .  ymal refteg pelc .      kin looked across at silver  who was unscrewing her fangs .  the shand grimaced .      tell me again about his being officially human     she said .     i keep forgetting .         what     asked kin     do you intend to do with that .     one of the men beside her had drawn his sword and was offering it proudly to the shand  hilt first .  silver ignored him .      it   s dead     she said     but we have the body .  i would very much like to know how an organic creature can breathe fire .     she grabbed the corpse by neck and tail and dragged it aft .   marco swaggered over to kin .      i triumph .     he shouted .      yes  marco .         they declare war on us .  they sent dragons .  but they reckoned without me .         yes  marco .         together they conspire against me yet i overcome .     he screamed  eyes glazed .  then his expression faded .      you just think i   m a paranoid kung  don   t you     he said sulkily .      since you mention it            i   m proud to be human .  make no mistake .  as for the other     he said  turning     just because you   re paranoid doesn   t mean they aren   t out to get you .      she watched him stride back to the men  who clustered around him .  frightened of everything except immediate physical danger .  and as human as a tiger .   silver was gazing ruefully at the dumbwaiter .  it was not damaged  but the plastic panelling would never be the same again .   when the men were at the oars again kin took out her suit toolkit and arranged the dragon corpse as best she could on the tiny foredeck .  the kit was small but comprehensive .  a marooned spaceman could use it to survive on an alien world for years .  some had .  kin selected a medical scalpel .   later she opened the kit fully and found a multi chisel .   a minute later she reached in and assembled the vibro saw .  the screeee as it skidded and juddered over scales set her teeth on edge  but she didn   t switch off until the blade broke .   she went to find marco and silver  who were taking a turn at the oars  and hunkered down between them .      those dragons are jet powered     she said .     i could open the neck     it   s lined with some sort of light spongy substance .  it cut like jelly .  when i tried the welding laser on it it didn   t even warm up .         how about the body .     said marco .      those scales are tough .  you will note i am holding the remains of a vibro saw .  they say a saw like this will cut hull metal .      silver grinned .     one finds oneself thinking in terms of creatures that drink kerosene .      the kung snorted .     no doubt you neglected to run a geiger over it .     he said .      no .  i tested it all right .  nothing .         i am surprised .         want to hear what happened when i cut the neck off and dropped the geiger head into the body cavity .         i am agog .         it   s as hot as hell in there .  that creature is a living atomic furnace .  and you can   t tell me it evolved  not on an earth type world .  it   s a construct .  that   s where you   ll find the disc builders     wherever that thing came from .         the centre of the disc     said silver thoughtfully .  kin gawped  and the shand nodded casually as she leaned on the oar .      i have some facility with languages  as you know     she said .     i have been talking to some of these men .  we   ve got to the say and point stage .  they see these things sometimes .  in these parts they come from the east  but when the boats sail down south the dragons pass over from the north east .  therefore i deduce they come from the central regions .  why are you staring .         marco already wants to go to the centre     said kin .     he wants to offer them a barometer     i think .      the next dawn saw them sailing through an increasingly choppy sea into a fjord between white mountains .  there was a colony of turf roofed stone huts  and some sparse meadows .  people hurried down to the shingle  then shied back noisily as  with the crew in their seats smirking like demons  silver dropped over the side and ran the boat up the beach by herself .   there was a glassy eyed dragon head roped to the prow .   leiv led them into a long high roofed hut that made kin wonder whatever happened to grendel .  but  of course  grendel was slinking alongside her  swinging his too many arms and eyeing the crowds for possible assassins .   when her eyes grew accustomed to the gloom inside she saw an open fire in a pit and  beside it  a man sitting on a rough stool .  one leg was stretched out in front of him .  he was redheaded  and bearded .   he rose unsteadily from his stool and embraced leiv  both men holding themselves as if there was just the faintest possibility that the other might attempt a stabbing .  then the younger man spoke .   it was a lengthy saga .  after a while the older man was taken outside and shown what remained of the dead dragon .  he was introduced to silver  and hobbled several times round marco  who looked at him sidelong .  he grinned at kin in a way that expressed horizontal desires .   encouraged by this display  other inhabitants turned up .  kin   s attention was drawn to two men in black robes .  one of them was looking at marco fearfully and reciting some sort of incantation .   silver   s head swivelled round .   she spoke a sentence in the same language .   from then on silver did the translating .      the tongue is latin  the remen tongue .  except that these men refer to rome not reme .      kin considered it .     romulus and remus     she said at last .     the founders of rome .  ever hear the legend .         i think i recall it in a folklore anthology .         so on the disc remus won the naming privilege .  what else did they say .         oh  quite a lot of gibberish about demons  the usual primitive world stuff .  ever heard the word troll .  they keep looking at marco and saying it .  there   s also a lot about gods  i think .      kin looked around .  these people were either primitive or superb actors .  perhaps the gods were the disc builders .      ask about them     she said .  a long conversation followed .  sometimes the older of the men would point to the sky .  leiv and his father watched carefully .   finally silver nodded and turned to kin .     let   s see if i get this right  now     she said .     there   s a whole lot of gods about  but the top god is called christos .  the high priest lives at rome .  there was also another kind of god who created this world in six days .  anticipating your questions     she said  raising a paw to interrupt kin     i asked for more details .  this creator god has a lot of minor assistant gods with wings  and there   s another lesser being called saitan who sounds like an agitator .  there   s a lot of other usual  religious stuff too .         six days is too fast     said kin .     it   d take the company six years even with prefabricated parts .  frankly  i   d put it all down as a myth .         it   s unusually straightforward     silver pointed out .     in most myths the world is usually made from the supreme being   s step father   s pancreas or the blood of the sacred beetle or something .      kin frowned .  earth had plenty of religions  and had exported as many as she had imported .  for every sect of humans engaged in complicated ehftnic time rituals there was a group of saffron dyed shandi drumming and chanting through the frozen shandi streets .  generally company people  being in the creation business  didn   t bother with religion or went along with something basic and non controversial  like wicca or buddhism .   kin had drunk of many cups in her time  just out of curiosity .  stand up  kneel down  climb a mountain  chant  go naked  whirl  dance  fast  abhor  gorge  pray     sometimes it was enjoyable  but it was always introverted  unreal .   leiv   s father spoke at length to one of the priests  who spoke to silver .  silver laughed and replied .      he wants to buy the valhalla oven     she translated .      the what .         the dumbwaiter .  he says that he knows that in valhalla all men eat and drink endlessly and now he knows it is because they have these ovens that grind out food and drink .         tell him it   s not for sale .     she looked directly at eirick raude .  red eric .  back on earth there was a worn mound in the heart of valhalla where the water from the five inland seas spilled over into the long fjord .  eirick   s beard  they called the water .  red eric had been buried in the mound .  it was a big tourist attraction .   silver took a deep breath .      he also wants us to adjust the sun     she said .  the man  seeing kin   s face  began to speak slowly in latin .      there has been spring in winter  he says .  the sun has sometimes dimmed .  on several nights the stars have flickered .  and  uh  something happened to one of the planets .      kin stared .  then she walked into the hall where silver had deposited the dumbwaiter and dialled for a big cup of the sweet ale .  she brought it back and put it in eirick   s scarred hands .      tell him that was our fault .  tell him that if only we can learn the secrets of the world  we will replace the planet and do what we can about the sun .  did he say that stars flickered .         apparently this is expected .  the aforesaid christos was born almost a thousand years ago  and it is widely believed that he will come again around about now .  take a look at the sea  will you .      kin turned .  the waves were lashing at the beach  even here .  she could hear the thunder of the storm out in the open sea .  but the sky was blue  windless         i said the disc wasn   t a reliable artefact     she said .     it sounds like its governing systems are going wrong .  eirick doesn   t seem all that worried  silver .         he says he   s seen and heard of a lot of gods .  he can take gods or leave them alone .  if we can repair the weather  he will give us much timber .         timber .      silver turned to look at the village .     it seems to be a scarce commodity here     she said .     notice the lack of trees .      this should be the climatic optimum  kin told herself .  on earth it had been .  the northern expansion had taken place during a long warm spell  when even a strip of coastal greenland was reasonably habitable      here  on some nights  the stars flickered out .   marco and kin spent the night in the hall  although silver opted for the chill air of the boat .  no one had attempted to bundle kin off with the women .  goddesses were different .   she lay looking at the glow of the fire .  the boom of the surf was still loud .  tides  she thought .  that half pint moon couldn   t cause them .  there must be some sort of regulated rise and fall of the sea  and it   s going haywire .   she longed for a sleepset .  they left your mouth tasting like an ape   s urinal  but they were quick .  you didn   t suffer from insomnia with a zizz  or get bothered by rocks sticking in your back .  a short  deep  dreamless sleep .   finally she gave up  got up and walked through the darkened hall .  the man at the door moved aside hastily to let her pass .   the sky was ablaze with fake stars .  kin shivered  but couldn   t help but admire the ersatz universe that blazed over the dark  sea noisy fjord .   this wasn   t earth .  it was a disc about fifteen thousand miles across  massing around   .    x      tons .  that meant it either had generated gravity or neutronium veneer as a bedrock .  it spun very slowly  like a tossed coin in treacle  dragging with it a fake sun and a fake moon and a family of fake planets .  she knew all that  but sitting here it was hard to believe .   she shivered as the frost clawed at her .  frozen starlight .   a clockwork world .  a world without astronomy .  maybe there was astronomy  but it was a horrible joke on the astonomers .  a world where the venturesome dropped into the abyss .  dragons .  trolls .  a myth mash .   she found a planet  near what for want of a better word had to be called the disc   s horizon .  no  it was moving too fast for a planet .   and then it was suddenly a pennant of fire in the sky .   it hit the disc somewhere to the east .  kin told herself she could feel the impact .   she ran towards the line of beached ships to where a broad shape glittered with frost .     silver .      foolish  foolish .  how many shandi on the disc .      ah  kin .  no doubt you saw it .         what was it .         most of the main part of our ship .  it was only a matter of time .  marco should have exploded it rather than just leave it  and we can only hope it landed in the sea or a desert .  i was hoping it would impact on the underside of the disc .         it   s certainly a good way of saying    we   re here    to any disc lords .  first we take out a planet  then we drop our ship on them     said kin .      i noticed something before i saw the ship     said silver .     see that planet  right down there .  what would that be .         if this was earth  that   d be venus in that posi    no  it           quite so .  it is moonless .      kin felt a tingle of excitement .  the disc builders had forgotten something .  how could they .  venus and adonis  a moon almost as big as lunar  had always dominated earth   s dawn or sunset sky .  why leave out the moon in the disc universe .  a mystery .      one could write a filmy on astronomy and sociology     said silver .     for example  i have always felt that humans were the first into space because of the continual reminder that in our universe everything orbits something .      you always had that other double world system in your sky to hint that not everything revolves around the earth .  whereas we had the twin  and the kung couldn   t see the sky at all .  had your sister world not had her moon  i doubt if your history would have been quite so uncomplicated .      together they sat and watched the moonless world sink in solitude in the faintly glowing sky .  kin snuggled against silver   s fur  and wondered whether the dumbwaiter would be safe .  probably .  the men had a healthy respect for marco .   silver was thinking about the same thing  because she said     kin .  are you awake .         unk .         if the dumbwaiter misfunctions  you must promise me you will stun me and allow marco to put me to death .      kin sat up  grimacing in the darkness .     certainly not .  anyway  how could we stun you .         you have a palm stunner on you at this moment .  i have noticed it on several occasions     said silver .     i was taught to observe .  you will kill me  for fear of what i will become .  my fear .      kin grunted non committally and lay back  thinking about shandi .   they couldn   t take kung or human proteins .  before the dumbwaiters were common  it meant that shandi could only go offworld with a personal deep freeze .   there had been a time when a human ship had been ferrying four shandi ambassadors to greater earth and the freezer malfunctioned .  the ambassadors were civilized .  usually  when a shand was deprived of food  it turned into a ravening animal within two days .  a million years of evolution was drowned in a wash of saliva .   with the ambassadors  it took fifty six hours .   none survived .  the last one took her life after awakening from a bloated sleep and seeing what lay around her in the cabin .  the average shand wouldn   t have done so  but the average shand was not an ambassador trained to think in cosmospolitan ways .   the plain truth was that the shandi liked eating shand .  can you fit ritual cannibalism into a civilization .  they did .   there was a game .  the rules were ancient  venerated and simple .  two shandi would enter  from opposite sides  a stretch of tundra or forest set aside for the purpose .  there were special rules about weapons .  the winner ate well .   curiosity overwhelmed kin .      did you ever play the game  silver .     she asked softly .      why  yes .  three times  when the urge was strong in my mouth     said the shand .     twice at home  and once illegally elsewhere .  my opponent in the latter case was the regius professor of linguistics at the university of gelt .  much of her stocks my freezer at home even now .  i grieve that her death may largely have been in vain .         but you   ve got dumbwaiters now .  there   s no need for the game .      silver shrugged .     now it is a tradition     she said .     what we did out of need we do for     sport  i think it would be called  although there are elements of bravado  identification with our ancient past  the affirming of our shandness .  you think this is barbaric .      it was a statement  not a question .  kin shook her head anyway .      some humans have taken part in the game     said silver .     they pay highly for the chance to prove their     what .  machismo .  if they win  all they get is the head of their victim to hang on the wall .  that is barbaric .         uh  what happens if the shand wins .         she gets two convicted criminals .      kin thought  this is what shandi do on their home world  and none of your business .  you can   t apply humans    values to aliens .  but you keep trying .   the train of thought was derailed by a scream from the big hall .  a man burst out into the starlight and tumbled over on the grass  clutching at his side .   kin landed running  snatching the stunner from her belt .  she heard the heavy crash on the shingle as silver landed behind her .   the hall was full of dark fighting shapes .  kin jerked aside as a leather clad man ran out  followed by a tall man hefting an axe .  she pointed the stunner and fired .   the effect was not immediate .  the two kept on running .  then their legs collapsed under them in slow motion  and they hit the ground asleep .   kin entered the hall with the stunner turned to minimum power maximum beam  swinging it like a scythe .  a fighter staggered towards her with a raised sword and began to dream on his feet  sending her sprawling as fifteen stone of norseman cannoned into her .  for a moment she suffocated in a reek of stale sweat and badly tanned hides  then managed to roll away .  the stunner was gone  dropped in the collision .  she was in time to see a teetering giant pick it up curiously and look down the barrel .  in the middle of the tumult  a look of perfect peace passed over his face .  he fell like a tree .   another man rushed at kin .  she kicked out and upwards  and was rewarded with seeing his eyes cross before he rolled over  screaming and clutching his groin .   there wasn   t a fight going on  it was a brawl .  most of the men were simply hacking blindly at everything .   she managed to get to her feet  almost slipping on the curiously muddy floor .  through a gap in the figures she saw marco dodging like a demon in the torchlight  a sword in all four hands .  the dumbwaiter hummed behind him  a sticky  sweet smell in the air .   there was a bellow from the door and eirick hobbled in  his face contorted with rage .  he was flailing about with his crutch .   then the roof fell in .  one of the fighters backed into kin  and she felled him with a backhanded chop as dawn pale light flooded the hall .  part of the nearest wall bowed inward and crumbled away .  there was a brief glimpse of a wide  white haired foot .   silver appeared at the roof hole  black against the gold sky .  there was silence  broken only by the whimpers of the wounded and a background trickle .   silver roared again .  there was a brief moment of pandemonium as those who could rushed for the doorway .   kin looked down .  she was standing ankle deep in a sticky  frothy puddle .   she looked at the dumbwaiter .  a yellow brown waterfall was spilling out of the food hatch  filling a deepening puddle .  marco looked at her  trying to focus .  then he sighed contentedly  and fell backwards .   resignedly  knowing what to expect  kin held her cupped hand under the stream and tasted it .  it was sweet and potent  a super beer .  here and there in the pool  darker stains were spreading from the wounded and dying .   kin stopped the flow and set the machine to producing an antidote .  when it delivered a bowl of foul blue liquid she dragged the kung up by his comb  tipped the bowl into his mouth in one motion  and let him fall back into the mire .   after silver dropped through the ruined roof she and kin toured the hall .  the    waiter was instructed to produce the various seal and heal ointments in its repertoire  and after some thought kin dialled for limb replacement stimulants .  usually such sophisticated medicine was frowned on for its cultural shock effects  but hell  the disc was one big cultural shock .  with some of the wounded she plastered the stuff on like mud  and hoped .   after a while marco groaned and sat up .  he looked at them hazily .  kin ignored him .      leiv   s men told them about the    waiter producing alcohol     he said thickly .     then when i gave them a demonstration they began acting irrationally and demanding more .  and then they started fighting .         a fucking valhalla machine     muttered kin  and turned back to her work .   there was a hoarse chuckle from the darkness under the room  and a black feather floated down .   they left at noon .  the colony gathered to see them off .   many of the men had new white scars .  some displayed tiny limbs already growing from healed stumps .  but several had died in the hall  the valhalla machine had been too efficient .   eirick made a long speech in latin and produced rare furs and two white hunting birds as farewell gifts .      say we can   t accept     said kin .     say anything .  we can   t afford to carry the weight .  say we can   t go and repair the sun if we carry too much weight .  it   s almost true .      eirick listened to silver   s careful reply  and nodded graciously .      i   d like to give him something  though     said kin .      why .     snapped marco .      because she   s still afraid the company might be behind the disc  and she wants to apologize .  isn   t that right .     said silver .  kin ignored her .      ask him for some timber     she said .     scraps .  and grass or hay .  old bones .  anything that was living .  what i have in mind   ll mean the    waiter will want feeding .      they set the dumbwaiter up as a timber mill .  after the first metre of fragrant  smooth plank had been extruded from the hatch the colony worked like robots .  great drifts of seaweed  washed up by the pounding sea  helped swell the heap by the input hopper .  today the sea moved like liquid mountains .   kin took the others aside while the colony was carting planks .      we fly     she said .     over land as much as possible  but we fly .  if the belt power looks like running out before we get to the hub  then we   ll charge up one belt from the others and marco or i will go on alone .  that means silver can stay with the    waiter .         i am inclined to agree     said silver .     there can be nothing to lose .  marco should be the one to go on  of course .  i am big enough to scare predators  and you can survive by engaging any male humans in sexual congress if necessary .  marco is best equipped to reach the hub .      it was an elephantine attempt at diplomacy  but marco turned his head away .      i am equipped for nothing     he said distantly .     i allowed myself to be provoked by humans .  i am shamed .         the blame is not wholly yours     said silver generously .      but silver  i outnumbered them one to thirty .      spray flew like sleet over the village .  a respectable pile of planks had grown round the dumbwaiter .  kin switched it off and adjusted its lift belt .   the two christos priests were standing apart from the crowd  chanting in latin .      what   re they saying .     said kin .   silver listened for a moment .     it   s an invitation to christos to allow us to repair his planets and sun or alternately to strike us down if  as they suspect  we   re servants of saitan .         nice of them .  say goodbye for us  will you .      they rose quickly .  the huts and then the beach were lost against the background of snow and foam topped sea .   the sea had gone mad .  waves piled on top of one another and burst and roared  sending spray almost as high as the flyers .   on the disc east couldn   t be a direction  it had to be a point of the circumference .  there were four directions on the disc  circle right  circle left  in  out .  they headed in .   they circled the thing in the water carefully  was it alive  kin wondered  or was it just that the waves made it appear so .  once  a flipper broke water and slapped down again .   she decided to go lower .  she waited for warnings from marco  but he had been subdued all day .  silver said nothing  but took advantage of the mid air stop to reel in the    waiter on its towline .   kin thought she could feel the cold air through the suit   s twenty five layers as she dived .  the sky was pure blue  ice clean .   the creature was floating belly upwards .  most of it was tail  which snaked back until it was lost in surf .  when a particularly heavy swell moved the body  kin glimpsed a long equine head and one empty eye socket .   it must have been old .  no creature could grow that big fast .  and the white belly was pitted with seaworm holes and studded with shellfish .   she flew back up .  it would be nice to get it on a dissecting table     with a winch .      it   s dead     she announced .     there   s a gash in it you could sail a boat through .  fresh  too .  it   s the same sort of creature as the one we saw this morning  i think .      it had been far to the right  looping through the water like a scaly backed sine wave .      it   s very definitely dead     she said reassuringly  seeing silver   s face .      what is currently occupying my mind is what killed it     said the shand .     i will be happy to get my feet on terra firma .      the more firmer the less terror  thought kin .  she found she preferred the sky .  there was something reassuring about lift belts  far more so than the disc .  she knew belts didn   t fail .  the disc might break up at any moment  but she would remain safely hanging in space .      there is an island a few miles off     said silver .     just a dome of rock .  i can see the marks of fires .  shall we land .      kin peered ahead .  there was a smudge  a long way off .  the sea seemed to be calm  too .  the idea of a short stop had merit .  the flying suits had never been designed for extended use in gravity .  her legs had been trailing uselessly below her since they left the settlement  and felt like lead .  it would be nice to stamp some new blood into them .      marco .     she said .  he was hovering some way off  still wrapped in self recrimination .   there was a sigh in her ear .     i can hold no useful opinions     he said     but i see no obvious dangers .      the island was small and obviously tidal .  seaweed  now almost dry  covered most of it .  so many fires had been lit at the highest point of the rock  about three metres above the sea now  that it was black .   kin landed first  and keeled over as her legs refused to support her .  a crab scuttled out of the seaweed in front of her face .   silver landed lightly and then hauled on the line to tow the dumbwaiter out of the sky .  while kin sat massaging some life back into her legs the shand bustled round cutting seaweed for the machine   s intake hopper .  in normal use the dumbwaiter extracted all its molecules from the air around it  but silver had a big appetite .   after a while she tapped kin on the shoulder and handed her a cup of coffee  reserving a large bowl of something red for herself .  it was quite possibly synthetic shand .  so what .      where   s marco .     said kin  looking round .  silver swallowed and pointed upward .      he   s switched off his transmitter     she said .     he has problems  that one .         you   re not kidding     said kin .     he thinks he   s a human and knows he   s a kung .  and every time he acts like a kung he feels ashamed .         all kung and humans are crazy     said silver conversationally .     he   s craziest .  if he thought about it he would realize there   s a logical impossibility about all this .         oh  yes     said kin wearily .     i know he   s not physically human  but the kung believe one   s being is determined by the place       she stopped .  silver was grinning encouragingly  and nodding .      go on     she said .     you   re nearly there .  kung think the nearest available soul enters the offspring at birth .  but marco is supposed to be human .  humans don   t really believe that kind of superstition  do they .  ergo  he must be a body and soul kung .      there was a gasp in kin   s ear .  marco may have switched off his transmitter  but kung were paranoid .  he   d never switch off his receiver .  kin looked up at the distant dot in the air .  silver mouthed the words  ignore him .      i suppose leiv   s people lit those fires     said kin vaguely .     we must be on a trade route .         yes .  have you noticed the variations in the sea   s roughness .      kin had .   there were billions of tons of water on the disc  constantly draining over the edge .  it had to get back somehow .  assuming the disc builders couldn   t work magic  there was a molecule sieve down there  connected to     kin writhed     a matter transmitter .  simple .  you clamp receivers to the sea floor and pump the water back  only things were going wrong .   over the last day and a half they had passed over circular areas of raging sea .  too much was coming up  or maybe only a few receivers were still available to take the volume .      i keep forgetting this is just a big machine     she said .      i think you are being too hard on the disc builders     said silver .     apart  of course  from the possibilities of a breakdown  there is no great disadvantage to living in a cosmos like this  surely .  you can still evolve a science .         sure .  the wrong science .  science is supposed to be the tool with which you can unscrew the universe  but disc science is only fit for the disc .  it   d be closed  stagnant .  try to imagine a sophisticated disc astronomer trying to figure our sort of universe .  the disc is only good for religions .      silver dialled herself another bowl of goo .  when she looked back kin was shrugging out of her suit .      do you think that is wise .         almost certainly not     said kin  swaying slightly as a swell caught them .     but i   m damned if i   m going to sweat in there all day long .  i   d give a handful of days for a hot bath .      she walked naked towards the water and stopped abruptly as another swell nearly made her miss her footing .   on an island .   marco dived out of the sky  screaming in kung .  a wave washed over kin   s feet  and as she turned the next one came in waist high and knocked her over .  through stinging spray she saw silver and the dumbwaiter rocket out of the surf .   cold water rolled over her .  she groped in the green  ear blocking light and managed to grab the fabric of the suit .  it dragged at her as the dead weight of the lift belt pulled it down .   beside her the water exploded into bubbles .  marco thrashed past  and there was a horrible moment before the suit pulled again     upwards .   silver was waiting .  as the suit came up with kin gripping it desperately she drifted closer .  marco surfaced in a rosette of foam .      no .     he screamed .     height .  get height .  we   re too near the sea .      the grim pantomime started again two hundred metres up .  with silver holding kin by the shoulders and marco arranging the suit  they managed to slot her into the lower section  then forced her freezing arms into the sleeves .  the inner thermal suit clicked on  by the time kin was fit to talk the inside of the suit was a turkish bath .      thanks  marco     she said .     you know  i never would have had the intelligence to switch           look below     said the kung .   they looked .   a shadow moved under the sunlit waves  a big turtle  island sized  with four paddle legs and a head the size of a small house .  as they watched it flapped lazily into the depths .      i saw it wake     said marco .     i had been pondering the regularity of the legs  wondering if they were shoals  and then one moved .  no doubt it makes a practice of this and feeds on the unfortunates who light fires on its shell .         a carapace length of a hundred metres     mused silver .     remarkable .  do such exist on earth  kin .         no     said kin  through chattering teeth .      enough of this scientific chit chat     said marco .     we must make speed for the nearest land mass .  silver  will you look yonder .  about out by right  middle heaven .  i only see a dot .      silver turned her suit .      it   s a bird     she said .     black .  possibly a raven .         then at least we cannot be far from land     said marco .     i was afraid it was a dragon .      they switched the belts to maximum horizontal motion and headed on .  imperceptibly marco pulled ahead  so that they travelled in delta formation .  kin assisted by slowing her suit fractionally  and noticed that silver had done the same .  marco the kung was in command .   after a while he started to climb  the others following obediently .  below          the disc unfolded .  at their old height kin could have believed they were on a globe  but now the disc spread out below them for what it was     a lunatic map  a madman   s great circle projection .   cloud and the opacity of the air were the only barriers to vision .  kin could see the far rim of the disc  a darker line against the sky  and from that distant confusion of earth and sky two white horns grew and spread outward .  the waterfall .  the oceanfall  encircling the disc like a snake .   there was a hurricane building up  off the coast of africa .  as kin climbed she watched the frozen spiral of cloud  fascinated .   she had seen worlds from space  but the disc was different .  and it was big .  she was used to thinking in terms of millions and the disc  spinning through space inside its own private universe  had sounded small .  seen from a few hundred miles up it was huge  real .  it was the light years of nothingness that were small and meaningless .  it was enough now just to stare         note the circles of disturbance in the ocean     said marco .      kin suggests there is something the matter with the mechanism that recirculates the sea water     said silver .      logical .  certainly i feel increased admiration for a people who face all this in small boats  with no air support .      silver said     seeing the disc like this  one feels one would be nervous of setting foot on it again .  it is too thin  too artificial .  we do not as a rule suffer from vertigo  but seeing the disc like this i begin to comprehend what it means .      marco nodded .     quite so .  it gives one an uneasy feeling around the ankles  akin to standing on a ledge a hundred storeys up     a wide ledge perhaps  but a high one .         i begin to see what kin meant when she wrote about the spindles    insistence on having a few thousand miles of planet beneath their feet     said silver .     it is a mental anchor .  the subconscious fears the endless drop towards the bottom of the universe .  could our vague feeling be a shadow of the spindle imperative .         it is said that they helped us evolve  so that is always possible .  what do you think  kin .  kin .         hunh .  wassat .         were you listening .         sorry  i was looking at the scenery .  silver  what   s that smudge down there .  in what would be central europe .         i see it .  that  i suspect  is where our ship crashed .      they all looked .  the smoke was a mere wisp at this distance .      it looks like a pretty lifeless region     said silver  in tones of comfort .      it is now     said kin bitterly .   invisible a few miles below  its wings a blur of speed  the raven focused on the smoke .  behind its eyes  something went click .   the moon rose  full but reddish  underpowered .  it illuminated a speeding landscape that was mainly forest .  here and there patches of land and a few orange lights indicated a settlement .   marco called them to a halt after a long stretch of dark forest roof had passed below .      marco  let   s land     said kin wearily .      not until we have spied out the land .         that bit immediately below us looks unmatched  believe me .      silver landed first  on the reasonable assumption that wild animals would be unlikely to attack her .  she switched off her suit and unzipped the helmet  then stood silently  nostrils dilating .  after a minute she turned  sniffed again .      it   s okay     she said .     i smell wolves  but the scent is old .  there are some boars about a mile hubward  and i think there   s some beavers in that river about two miles towards the rim .  no men .     she sniffed again  and hesitated .      there is something else .  can   t identify it  though .  odd .  vaguely insectile .      they landed anyway .  kin was dozing in her suit  but concentrated just long enough to stop the belt from crashing her into the turf at the side of the hill .  she switched off  and allowed herself to sink gently into the scented grass .       she awoke when marco gently put a bowl of soup into her hands .   he and silver had lit a fire .  orange flames shot up and illuminated the forest leaves thirty metres away  and made the camp a circle of comforting firelight .  it glittered off the dumbwaiter .      who should know better than i that it is unsafe     said the kung  seeing the questioning look in her face     but i   m human enough to say  what the hell .  silver has taken first watch .  then it   s you .  better get some more sleep .         thanks .  uh  look  marco  about that floating island           we will not mention it .  we will be over land most of the rest of the way to the hub .         we may find nothing .         of course .  but what is all life but a journeying towards the centre .         i   m more worried about the belt power sources .  can we be sure they   ll last out .         no  but there is a built in hysteresis effect .  if the power sinks below a certain level it   ll waft you gently to the ground .         or the sea     said kin .      or the sea .  but i know what is worrying you .  it is the fear that your company did all this .  but why should they .         because we can .         i don   t understand .         no .  but we could build dragons  we could create people in the vats as easily as we breed up extinct whales .  the theory is all there  but we don   t do it because of the code .  but it is possible .  we could have built this disc  but no one would dare do it in home space .  out here     it   s a different matter .      marco looked at her sadly .     silver convinced me     he said .     if i   m rational  i   m a kung .  i   m glad i   m not human .      kin finished her soup and lay back .  she felt warm and full .  marco had curled up with four norse swords beside him  but she could dimly make out silver sitting motionless higher up the hill .  always a comforting sight  she told herself .  as long as the dumbwaiter works .   she did not dream .   silver shook her awake before midnight .  kin yawned and staggered to her feet .      anything been happening .     she mumbled .   silver considered .     i think an owl hooted about an hour ago  and there were some bats .  apart from that  it has been pretty quiet .      silver lay down .  within a few minutes deep snores told kin she was on her own .   the moon was high  but still too red .  the stars had taken on that deep light that always comes around midnight .  grass  heavy with dew  rustled as she walked away from the dying fire .   even now there was still some light on the sunset rim  a green glow that just managed to delineate the boundary between disc and sky .  moths hummed past her face  and there was a smell of crushed thyme .   later  she wondered if she had dozed on her feet .  but the moon was still up and the     call it the west     was still a line of faint luminosity .  yet the music came pouring down the hillside confidently  as though it had been there all the time .   it trilled  then soared into a few bars of evocative melody .  evocative of what  kin could not decide     perhaps of things that never were  but which ought to have been .  it was distilled music .   the fire was a sullen eye between the two sleeping figures .  kin started to climb the bare hill  leaving darker footprints in the damp grass .   a picture came into her mind of the music as a living thing  coiling around the hill and disappearing into the hushed forest .  she told herself she could always turn back if she wanted to  and walked on .   she saw the elf on a mossy stone at the top of the hill  outlined against the afterglow .  it sat crosslegged  hunched over the pipes  intent upon the music .   inside the woman who stood entranced  another kin arad  imprisoned in the corner of the mind  hammered on the consciousness   it   s an insect .  don   t listen .  it looks like a cross between a man and a cockchafer .  look at the antennae .  those things aren   t ears .    the music stopped abruptly .      no       said kin .   the triangular head turned round .  for a moment kin looked into two narrow  glittering eyes that were greener than the light behind them .  then there was a hiss and a patter of feet over the turf .  a little later  there was a rustle in the forest .  then the night closed in again  like velvet .   at dawn they rose above the forest and headed hubwards  leaving long curling trails in the rising mists .   on the horizon a pillar of smoke loomed like the finger of judgement .  it was so thick it cast a shadow .      i don   t know what effect it has on the natives  but it terrifies me     said kin .     we should have blown up the ship in the air  marco .         their planet hit us     he said testily .     it is their responsibility .      the forest gave way to fields  striped with crops .  a distant man  walking behind a plough drawn by ant sized oxen  fell on his knees as their shadow passed over him .  from the boundaries of the field a dirt road ran through a cluster of turf huts  forded a river and disappeared under the trees .      he didn   t look like a whizz planetary technician     said kin .      no     said marco .     he looked shit scared .  but someone built this disc .      breakfast they had on a cliff top overlooking the sea .  marco watched it carefully .  after a while he asked     kin  if you were the disc master  how would you arrange for tides .         easy .  have a water reservoir under the disc and occasionally allow extra water into the sea .  why .         this tide is bloody high .  there are half drowned trees down there .  what is the matter .  are you being attacked .         yes  and the sooner i can get a nice hot bath the better .  with soap .  soap .  ever since greenland i   ve been carrying passengers .      marco looked blank .  kin sighed .      fleas  marco .  irritating parasites .  right now i could forget about the preservation of extinct species law and kill the lot .      and you can   t scratch very well in a bubble suit .      silver coughed .     i too would like the chance of some hygienic reparations     she said .   marco finally consented to make an extended stop later in the day  after kin announced that if he did not she would land outside the first building that looked like a tavern .   as they sped over the sea silver added     we are heading for germany .  not a good place .         why .     asked marco .      a battleground .  danes spreading southward meeting magyars heading westward and turks heading everywhere  with the locals fighting everyone .  according to history  that is .         anyone have an airforce .         the technology was pri           it was a joke .      kin itched  and stared morosely at the sea .  she thought she saw a boat  hull uppermost  rolling in the waves .  they were past before she could take a closer look .  but she was the first to see the rosette .   from above  the sea had put forth a flower  green petals edged with white .  losing altitude  they saw the mounds of water burst through the surface every few seconds and spread in a succession of roaring  concentric waves .      tide pump     said marco  and flew on .   they crossed a wide beach  a chequerboard of fields  and a forest .  and then a town     small  bucolic  but a town .      the fortress i can recognize     said marco  pointing to a squat stone building among the canted roofs     but what is the large wooden construction .         could it be a large heated swimming pool .     murmured kin .     don   t look at me like that .  the remens had hot baths .         romans     corrected silver .  marco grunted and glided off  leaving them to chase after him .      why the big rush .     said kin .   he pointed to the smoke column .  kin had to admit it was impressive  even at this distance .      that   s why     he said .     according to silver the disc people are ripe for mob hysteria .  what do you think they   d be doing now that   s in their sky .      they landed in a mixed forest well out of sight of habitation  where a stream flowed between low sandy banks .   kin stripped off her suit as soon as she landed and  while silver scrabbled at the sand  switched the dumbwaiter to one of its least complicated settings .  soon it gushed hot water  filling the hole .  she wallowed .   marco prowled uneasily along the bank and disappeared up a steep  tree shaped slope .  a moment later he came bounding down .      we must leave .  there   s a track up there .      silver looked at kin and shrugged  then wandered up the slope .  she came back looking thoughtful .      there is a distant odour of humans     she said     but it is a forest track that   s all  and there are plants growing undisturbed all over it .      they glared at marco .      people use it     he said .     they may have weapons .         only axes  i should think     said kin .     anyway  superstition will protect us .  there are tidal forests on kung  aren   t there .         i understand so  yes .         well  what would be the reaction of a simple peasant kung forester who suddenly chanced upon strange and fearsome monsters in his forest .         he would fall upon them and destroy them utterly .      kin bit her lip .     i guess he would  at that .  well  humans are different .  don   t worry .      later she dialled for soap and did her laundry .  silver had paddled off downstream and found a deep pool  nicely cold  in which she was floating contentedly .  marco relaxed sufficiently to bathe his broad feet in the stream .   there was a sudden movement in the water and he hissed shrilly  jumping up and landing ready to fight .  kin watched wide eyed  then reached down and quickly grabbed a small yellow frog .   she showed it to him without speaking .  marco glared .  finally kin ran out of air and burst out laughing .  the kung looked from her to the impassive frog  hissed menacingly  turned and stomped off along the river bank .   that was unfair of me  she thought .  kung have no sense of humour  even kung brought up on earth .  she released the frog and paddled further out into the stream .   it was clear  and slow enough for yellow water lilies to have established a roothold .  water boatmen rowed furiously underwater to escape her as she dived .   she drifted in the golden brown water between the lily stalks  moving with just the faintest motion of wrists and ankles .  there were ramshorn snails with red skin  and small fish darting like swallows in the shadowy cathedrals made by the weeds      she rose in a cloak of bubbles and surfaced in a clump of flowers  shaking the water out of her hair .   the archers were well disciplined .  kin looked at the row of arrow heads  wavering only slightly  and quickly decided against diving .  refraction of light or not  they could still hit her under water .   there were eight archers in rough clothing and a haphazard assortment of armour and chain mail .  they wore close fitting metal helmets and beneath them their blue eyes bored into kin stolidly .   a voice was squeaking in her earpiece .          and don   t start anything stupid     it said .     there   s too much risk of being hit .  we must handle this carefully .      kin looked round slowly .  there was nothing to be seen downstream but stands of reed mace and thick bushes .      i like the we     she said aloud .      just don   t stare too intently at the big bush with the purple flowers     said marco .   before she could answer  a man pushed his way between the archers and grinned down at her .   he was short and built like a wall .  even his skin was brick coloured .  a thatch of yellow hair and wide moustaches framed eyes that glittered enough to remind kin that intelligence didn   t necessarily start with an industrial revolution .   he wore leggings  a belted smock that fell to his knees  and a red cloak .  they all looked as though they had been slept in  if not worse .  one calloused hand tapped thoughtfully at the hilt of a half concealed sword .   kin smiled back .   finally he stopped the grinning contest by kneeling down and extending a hand .  jewels gleamed on the dirt engrained fingers  with a suggestion that they had once belonged to other people .   kin accepted the hand as gracefully as she could  and climbed out onto the bank .  there was a faint sigh from the men .  she treated them all to another smile  which caused them to step back uneasily  and plucked a waterlily flower from her hair .   brickface broke the spell with an appraising glance and a short comment that caused a general snigger .      turn up the gain control     said the voice in her ear .     if he is speaking latin  silver may be able to translate .         i don   t need a translation of that     said kin .  she treated her audience to another toothpaste grin and stepped forward .  brickface nodded and one man darted hurriedly out of the way .   a group of three men were standing around the dumbwaiter .  two of them wore heavy grey robes and the third  a youth  wore clothes that were bright and obviously impractical .  all three pulled back guiltily as she approached .   then the youth said something and reached inside his shirt  pulling out an amulet which he held in front of him as he advanced stiff legged towards her .  he held it like a weapon .  kin noticed that his eyes were glazed .  sweat glistened on his forehead .   he stopped in front of her  staring straight ahead .  she sensed that everyone was expecting something of her .   she reached out gingerly and took the amulet .   there was a gasp from the robed pair .  behind her brickface doubled up with sudden laughter .  the young man stared  lips moving on soundless words .  kin peered politely at the thing in her hands .  it was a wooden cross  with what she at first thought was the figure of an acrobat  she handed it back as graciously as she could manage .   the young man grabbed it  looked frantically around the clearing  and scurried away up the slope to the track .   as the robed men started to follow him kin could see what they had been doing .  they had run a sword into the dumbwaiter   s output slot .      they   re breaking up the    waiter .     she hissed .      okay  kin .  when i say duck  duck .  duck .      something whirred past her head and struck one of the men between the eyes .  he gave a sigh and toppled backward .      cape illud  fracturor     said a satisfied voice in her ear .  brickface gripped her wrist firmly and stalked towards the slope  the archers following him as closely .  they glanced fearfully at the forest .      what was that .     said kin as she was jerked up the slope .  pine needles clung and pricked her feet .      silver threw a stone     said marco  the awe in his voice recognizable even in earpiece reproduction .  kin looked back and saw the    waiter  her suit and the fallen man lying forlornly near the water   s edge .      there is little we can do at present     said the kung conversationally .     the weaponry is laughable  but the situation is not sufficiently desperate to warrant a direct confrontation .         uh .         i would not wish you to think that i am motivated by anything other than intelligent caution .         no  marco .         now silver would like a word .     there was a rustle .      you are thought to be some kind of water spirit     said silver .     apparently they   re not uncommon .  you should have screamed when they showed you that figure of the christos .  my immediate advice is to cover yourself as soon as possible .  there appears to be some rigid prohibition concerning nudity .      there were more armed men waiting on the track  with some robed men among them .  brick face swung himself into the saddle of a waiting horse and lifted kin up behind him  dumping her on the beast   s rump without a word and then ignoring her .  at his brief command the entire troop moved off .      this is silver again .  do not despair .         i am not despairing     said kin .     i am just getting good and mad .         we have returned to the clearing .  marco is reviving the stunned priest .     there was a thin scream which stopped abruptly .     kin .         i   m still here     she said .  one of the robed men had ridden up alongside brickface .  he wore a fur edged cloak over his robe and appeared to be important .  he was also furious .      this is a perfect opportunity     said silver .     hopefully we shall shortly learn more about these people .  if you find yourself in difficulties  you can of course initiate sexual relations with your captor .  the men call him lothar .      the cloaked man was shouting and pointing back along the trail  with occasional poisonous looks at kin .  lothar   s replies were distant and monosyllabic  until he reached over and in one movement grabbed the priest by the front of his robe and almost lifted him off his horse .  he snarled a sentence and spat a full stop .  the other man went white  out of either fury or fear .      this is exceptionally interesting     said silver .  kin thought she could also hear a babble of high pitched latin in the background .      is the    waiter badly damaged .     said kin .      not badly .  it can be repaired .  another centimetre and the sword would have hit the       kv line     marco .  it is essential he does not faint again .      the party left the forest and headed hub wards by kin   s estimation  on a track that ran alternately between stretches of half cultivated ground and marshes .   the smoke pillar loomed  dominating the sky .  its tip was now made ragged by high altitude winds .   soon they met a straggle of people coming the other way .  they ran off the track when they saw lothar   s band  but he wheeled after them and one man was caught .  he was brought before lothar  struggling and gasping out answers to the questions that were grunted at him .      silver     said kin     how do you say    i   m nearly freezing to death    .      silver translated .  kin tapped lothar on the shoulder and repeated the phrase  as best she could .   he turned in the saddle and stared at her in astonishment  before unfastening the heavy brooch that held his cloak .  kin wrapped the heavy and odorous cloth around her .  there was a comment  almost inaudible  from the senior priest .      he said    soon you will both be warmed by the fires of hell        murmured silver helpfully .      great .  i   ve only been here a few hours and already i   ve made friends .         listen carefully .  your party contains priests of the christ creator religion .  they are heading towards the smoke column in the belief that it is a sign that the christ has returned .  lothar  however  is a minor noble with a line in brigandage and part time looting .  according to our informant  he is a son of saitan .         saitan has a lot of relatives in these parts     said kin .      it is a strange religion .  everyone is evil until proved holy .  our informant says the priests met up with lothar on the road and they banded together for mutual protection  but this liaison is likely to end at any moment .         are you telling me that lothar   s god is returning and he   s thinking of nothing but pillage .         probably rape and murder as well     said silver .     you are heading for a holy house for the night .  we will endeavour to rescue you then .  now i must sign off for the moment  i   ve got an injured man to attend to .  i   ll say this for these christers  they   re brave .  this one hit out at marco .  picture the result .         dead .         i persuaded marco that the man was more useful alive .  he just broke both his arms .      in the early evening they came to a town of thatched houses surrounding what silver identified as a religious foundation .  the muddy streets were thick with people and carts .  the party got through only after lothar sent men ahead to clear a path with the flats  and sometimes the points  of their swords .   there were noisy crowds around the holy buildings  dressed in the main in drab and holy colours .  the senior priest was greeted effusively  even frantically  and helped to dismount .  lothar watched impassively .  looking round  kin saw that his men had fanned out among the crowd with drawn bows  sometimes glancing at the sky .   the senior priest  identified by silver as otto  spoke sharply to a holy man .  he ran off and returned a few minutes later at a respectful distance in front of one who  to judge by the way the crowd parted for him  was even holier .   he was tubby and red eyed  as if he hadn   t slept for some time .  over the standard robe he wore a red cloak with patterns in gold thread  now crusted with dirt .  he listened gravely as otto spoke .  then he walked over to lothar   s horse and peered at kin .  finally he reached out and pinched her sharply on the thigh .   in the circumstances  she decided against any action .   lothar dismounted and fell on one knee in front of the priest  one hand on his heart .  he spoke eloquently .  to kin he sounded like a salesman .   she tried to raise silver .      i can be of little help     the shand reported .     latin is a ceremonial language  like a religious allspeak .  this is one of the early german tongues  i think .  the fat man is possibly the local bishop  and this is a trial .  what appears to be at stake is whether lothar keeps you or hands you over .         what about the heroic rescue .  it   s wearying  you know  constantly being tensed up waiting for one   s friends to plummet out of the sky with lasers blazing           i had intended using your stunner  but it was not in your suit     said silver .     no doubt you lost it on the floating island .  plan b also will not work .  marco intended to swoop down wearing two belts to carry you off  but lothar   s men maintain a constant skywatch .  for dragons  do you think .         what   s plan c  then .      there was a sigh .     marco intends to land and hack and slash at everyone .         that   s a good plan     said kin .      he is mad .  the norsemen have a term  berserker .  it was designed for marco .      lothar stopped speaking .  the bishop looked down at him  then up at kin .  he beckoned .   after a few seconds she slid off the horse   s back  the cloak slipping from her as she landed .  there was a rustle of voices from the crowd .   the bishop nodded and waddled off  beckoning kin to follow him .  the crowd pressed in silently behind her .   they went between the holy buildings to a stamped earth yard  full of long shadows in the sinking sun light .  part of the yard was roofed .  under the roof were bars .      i   m about to be locked up  silver .     she hissed .     where the hell are you .         a wooded eminence outside the town .  the bars do not look alarmingly thick .  they may trust to them to guard you .         silver  how can you see the bars .         marco is behind you in the crowd .  he is giving me eyewitness reports .  do not look for him .      the bishop stopped by the middle cage  and swung open the door .  when kin stopped there was a gentle prod of a sword in her back .  she stepped in .   the lock was primitive but big .  the bars did not look alarmingly thick  according to silver .  they were six inch posts .  what was normally kept there that needed six inch thick bars .   they left her sitting in the dirt and walked away .  after a while the last of the crowd left the compound  leaving a group of bowmen who spread out  watching the sky .  presently a man brought her a bowl of scraps  dropped them within her reach  and bolted .   a few stars lit up .  beyond the compound   s walls came the rattle of carts  and many shouts .      silver .     she said querulously .   there was a heart stopping pause before the reply came back .      ah  kin .  i am now better informed .  your precise status is still to be determined .  your friend lothar has at least saved you from arbitrary execution .  i have also learned more about the current disc situation .  would you be interested in hearing it .  we will not collect you until it is fully dark .  i doubt if those bowmen can better marco   s excellent night vision .         go ahead and amuse me     said kin  wrinkling her nose over the food bowl .  it could make me sick  she decided  it looks as though it   s already done so to someone else .      this is all exceptionally interesting     said silver .     there is no doubt among the populace that this is either the return of the christ or the end of the disc or both .  fires are raging     our ship  you understand .  there have been strange signs in the sky .  the town is divided between travellers hastening to the advent and those fleeing from it .      kin listened to the cries outside .      what are they fleeing for .     she asked .      he   s a very choosy god .         how did you find out about this .      there was a pause .  at last silver said     promise me that if we get back home you won   t reveal the information gathering system we  uh  evolved .  i could be subject to severe disciplinary action from the all planet committee on anthropological research procedures .         my lips are sealed     promised kin .      marco slugs a likely looking subject  flies him over here and knocks the shit out of him until i   ve heard enough .      kin grinned .     it   s not like drawing circles in the sand  is it .         much more efficient  though .      there was a commotion at the entrance to the compound .  in the half light kin saw a knot of men approaching  surrounding a taller shape that moved across the ground in hops .   when it drew nearer the cages kin saw that it was roughly man shaped but at least three metres high .  once it reared and spread a pair of dark wings the size of sheets .  one of the men darted forward .  the tall shape whimpered  and cowered .  kin  pressed against the bars  got an impression of scales  and pectoral muscles like barrels .   she jumped back as the door of the neighbouring cage was opened and the thing prodded inside .  she saw a stubby horned head and glowing green eyes that narrowed when they saw her .   the door slammed shut and the men retreated quickly .  the creature grunted  gave the door an experimental shake  went and sat down in the far corner of the cage with its arms around its knees .   the men returned  and they were carrying a small struggling body .  kin made out the shape of a creature like the one she had seen on the hilltop     part human  part animal  part insect .  it whistled shrilly as it was carried .  as one of the men let go to reopen the cage door  it screeched and raked his chest with a claw .  when he fell back it wriggled free  kicked another man in the stomach with a small hoof  and sank its teeth into a third   s arm before it was grabbed .   the man who had been clawed stood up silently and landed a swinging blow that crunched when it hit  like the crushing of beetles .  it landed in a heap inside the cage  and lay still .   the men retreated but did not leave the area .  after a while a watchman   s fire sprang up .  kin called up silver .      they are staying     she said .     there must be ten of them now .  marco   ll never get in .         i think the guard is for the benefit of your friend in the next cell     said silver .     marco has a plan  though .  two plans  in fact .  if the first doesn   t work  he proposes to explode the    waiter   s powerpack .      kin thought about it .     that would kill us all     she said     and leave a crater about a mile across .         quite so .  but we would have won .      there had never been a man   kung war  just a few early skirmishes now diplomatically forgotten .  kung had no concept of conquest  mercy  prisoners or rules .  marco was tainted with human ideas  but         is he serious .         i think he is frightened almost to death .      the big winged creature was watching kin .  she was aware of two pale lights in the gloom .      i have my own plan     said silver .      oh  good .  i like listening to plans .         i have compiled a speech .  when a priest next approaches you will recite it to him .      you are an ethiopian princess  left stranded in this country when your party was attacked by robbers .  you demand to be released .  you are a devout christer  by the way .  so is your father  who is a king  and who will be angry in very physical ways when he hears about this treatment .         it sounds a bit contrived     said kin .  she was watching the giant in the next cell .  three metres high .  what did it use for ankle bones .      kin arad     said the winged demon .   she stared .  nothing had moved .  the creature was still slumped against the bars  watching her .  when he spoke again     kin couldn   t be sure in the dim light  but the lip movements didn   t seem to coincide with the sounds she heard  as if something was being badly dubbed .      i am kin arad     she said .      what is your dominion .     said the demon in perfect allspeak .      i don   t know what you mean .         i am sphandor  of the dominion of aglierap .  i cannot determine your dominion or place .         it seems to be speaking shandi     said silver .      speak .  are we partners in adversity .         i hear it in allspeak     said kin urgently .     i think it   s using some kind of direct mind stimulation .  its lips aren   t moving properly .         do not mumble .  do you think i do not know of the creatures to whom you talk by the power of the lightning .  the thinking bear and the upright frog with four arms .  and the mechanical device that prepared food beyond the powers of huictigraras .         are you reading my mind .         of course i am  you stupid bitch .  but it is difficult .  you are of this world yet not of this world  neither are you of the brotherhood of the damned  yet the praying ones have captured you .         keep it talking     said silver .      the christers think i am a water sprite     said kin .      sprites cannot speak and are of low intelligence  as everyone knows .  they are like this thing .      sphandor kicked out and managed to hit the wheezing faun with a curved toenail .  it whimpered .      it   s injured     said kin .     can we do anything to help it .         why should we .  it barely knows it is alive .  elves breed like flies in the woods .  you think they make nice music  but it is as a cricket chirps   mindlessly .      i gather you had something to do with the explosion that knocked me out of the air three days ago .         uh  yes .     kin thought quickly .     there was a flying chariot  you see           a three thousand tonne starship     sphandor agreed     impacting at four hundred miles an hour .         do you know what those words mean .         no  but they were at the forefront of your mind .  the shock waves knocked me out of the air  and some christers reached me and bound me before i could rise .  if i but had my freedom i would tear their ears off .      it must be vat grown  thought kin .  nothing like that could have evolved naturally .  if those wings worked it would have to be very light  bird boned .  she would have to ask it questions     later .      i want to escape     she said .     silver .     there was no answer from the earpiece .      i likewise .  it is unfortunately impossible .  tomorrow we shall be brought before the bishop   s court .  i shall certainly be executed .         will they waste time with a court when they think their god is coming .         all the more reason to be seen going about what they consider to be his business  kin arad .         what will they execute you for .         i am sphandor .  i spread arthritis  the bone ache and ague of the neck .  i blight crops and cause abortion in cattle .  they say i foul streams and hurl the lightning stone .         and do you do all that .         i suppose so .  i certainly always intend to .      kin glanced towards the fire .  the men had spread out  and she could just see them outlined against the last stains of sunset  watching the sky .      they think my brothers will try to rescue me     said sphandor .     fat chance .      a holy man entered the compound with a tray of food .  kin watched him absently .   one of the guards sauntered over to the priest and took a bowl off the tray .  he had his back to kin  who saw him stiffen  drop the bowl and slump down .  a third hand had shot out of the robe  holding a sword      some of the others came running after hearing the priest   s anguished cry  and the fallen man was lost to sight as his fellows gathered round .   there was an explosion of flesh .   two men staggered back and two  a little faster  turned to run and slid along the ground with knives in their backs .   laughing like a hyena  marco leapt barehanded at the others .  the few seconds of astonishment they experienced helped him  and he worked through them with a mixture of kung digitsju and blind destruction while arrows from the men who had the sense to stay out of it hissed around him .  sphandor giggled .   marco screeched a kung battle cry and stalked towards the nearest archer  glistening in the firelight .  the man fired one arrow which hit him fairly in the chest  rocking him back on his heels for a moment .  then he walked on .  the archer was still staring when two hands grabbed him by the throat and two more swung up in a gristle cleaving arc .   as one man the surviving guards dropped their weapons and ran for the compound entrance .      marco .     shouted kin .     keys .  find the keys .      marco glared at her stupidly  then looked up .  a white shape dropped out of the night  towing the familiar form of the dumbwaiter behind her .   silver landed lightly .  behind her  marco wrenched the arrow from his chest and looked at it absently .      neat     commented sphandor with interest .   the shand examined the cage closely .      i do not like to damage private property     she said     but speed is of the essence .     she stepped back a few paces and hit the bars at a dead run .  as kin jumped over the debris the shand nodded towards sphandor .      what about that .     she said .      i plead     said the demon .      let him out     said kin  taking her suit and stepping into the lift belt .     right now i   d just love him to spread bubonic plague or whatever it is he spreads .         does he do that .     said silver .     the ancients always said demons spread disease .         this one is a mobile disaster area     said kin .      is it wise to let him loose  then .         we might learn a lot from him .  if you   ve got any scruples  remember marco   s just killed half a dozen men and you   ve been involved in the molestation of research subjects .      silver considered this .     true     she said  and splintered the bars with a backhand swipe .     if we   re baddies  let   s be bad .      marco stepped forward with two knives levelled to throw as the demon wriggled through the gap .  there was a smear of pink blood around his wound .  would it have helped the dead archer to know that a kung in a fighting rage was practically awash with regenerative enzymes .  it had been hard enough for earthmen to see kung fight on with their flesh healing like boiling wax .      i do not trust this creature .  grab him .      silver shot out an arm and caught sphandor by his scaly tail .  with the other hand she unwrapped a length of cable from her waist and knotted it several times around the creature   s neck .  sphandor screeched .      where are you  soignatorie  unsore  dilapidatore       he began .      shut up     advised marco  taking the other end of the cable from silver .     all ready .  soon people will overcome their fears .      they rose quickly .  marco hovered fifty metres up and looked down at the demon  a tall shadow in the moonlight .  sphandor shrugged .  the big wings unfolded .      i shall require a run to take off .      kin watched marco bob above him as the demon loped across the ground  the wide wings rattling .  halfway across he brought them down with a whump that threw up a dust cloud  and he hung there for several seconds while the wings hammered on the air .  then he rose ponderously  like a giant heron .   when he was level with them  but a hundred metres away  he took a length of cable in his talons .      farewell  fools .     he bellowed  and tugged .  a look of dismay crept over his face .   with the belt   s lateral stabilizers full on marco hung immovable in the air .  when he reeled in the line no amount of wing flapping could budge him .  when the horned head was just a few metres away the kung whispered     i   m told you can read minds            only surface thought  lord .         read mine .      after a second sphandor   s face was a mask of terror .   with the creature in tow they moved slowly  because the wide wings acted as an air brake .  the demon held a loop of cable in both hands and glided behind them unsteadily  peppering them alternately with entreaties and curses .   the smoke no longer dominated the sky .  it was the sky .  winds in the upper air had teased it out into a ragged mushroom .   apart from the background noise behind them they flew in silence  kin and silver following a little behind marco .  finally kin   s radio chimed .      this is silver  transmitting on your suit frequency only  kin .  you had something to say .  if you move the switch to position four marco will not hear     the voice added .      silver  he slaughtered them .  they didn   t have a chance .      silver made a noncommittal noise .     they outnumbered him ten to one .         they weren   t expecting a kung  damn it .     kin felt the bottled up words rushing to be said .     he enjoyed it .  you saw him  he even killed ones who were running away  he threw     their only crime was that they happened to be in his way  it was completely inhu       she choked on the word .   after a while silver said     quite .      kin thought about the first contact with the kung .  men had already met the shandi  who apart from their duelling had no concept of warfare and viewed mankind   s ragged history with barely concealed horror .  so the first ship to land on kung had no weapons aboard at all .   five deaths served to convince men that  considered on the galactic scale  they were gentle and peace loving .  perhaps it had been worth it .      we all think we understand each other     kin heard silver say .     we eat together  we trade  many of us pride ourselves on having alien friends     but all this is only possible  only possible  kin  because we do not fully comprehend the other .  you   ve studied earth history .  do you think you could understand the workings of the mind of a japanese warrior a thousand years ago .  but he is as a twin to you compared with marco  or with myself .  when we use the word    cosmospolitan    we use it too lightly     it   s flippant  it means we   re galactic tourists who communicate in superficialities .  we don   t comprehend .  different worlds  kin .  different anvils of gravity and radiation and evolution .      if that winged creature is used to reading human minds  no wonder marco   s terrified it .      marco   s voice cut in  spiky with suspicion .      what are you two talking privately about .         female hygiene     said silver crisply .     marco  shouldn   t we land again .  we should interrogate this creature .         i agree .  i will watch for a suitable site .  i am sorry to have interrupted your conversation .     there was a click as he switched out .   there was a noise that might have been a shand chuckling .  then silver said     there is another minor matter  kin .  are ravens a very common bird .         hmm .  i don   t think so .  why .         there has been one in the sky ever since we left eirick .  sometimes it merely tags behind  sometimes it flies a parallel course .         it could be just coincidence     said kin doubtfully .      we   ve been flying at well over a hundred miles an hour at times  kin .         good grief .  you mean it   s keeping up with us .         yes .  no  don   t try and find it .  it   s well beyond human visual range  as it doubtless intends .  it   s only by accident i saw it once or twice  and then i started watching for it .  at the moment i   m thinking in terms of a small flying robot .         there was the raven in the ship     said kin .     it got out of the box  remember .  and before that it had arrived mysteriously at kung top .  but we killed it in vacuum  didn   t we .         i wonder if we did .      they passed over a village where the only movement was in the flames of a burning house  and marco cut in briefly to tell kin to take sphandor   s tether while he went lower to investigate .   the demon hung a few metres away  wings pounding the air heavily .  in the early morning light kin looked at him closely for the first time .  she looked again .  there was no doubt about it .  he was fuzzy around the edges .      i see it too     said silver .     as if it   s slightly out of focus .  how odd .      sphandor regarded them sullenly .      you mean to kill me     he whimpered .      not unless you attempt to do us harm     said kin .      the skinny one  the kali armed  he wishes to kill me .         that   s just his general wish to the universe in general  not specific to you     said kin .     i won   t let him harm you .         i will implore berith to give you gold .  tresolay i shall summon to make your beauty even more        marco was a dot on what  if it had been more than just a muddy open space  would have been called the village square .      the place is empty     came his voice     unless you count corpses .      they tethered sphandor to a post in what had been the village forge .  kin touched his skin gingerly  and under her fingers the demon appeared to be vibrating like a wineglass in a concert hall .  touching what looked like skin felt like fur  sticky with static .   a puzzle .  she dozed off in the shade  watching silver strip panels off the dumbwaiter and take the workshop manual from its drawer .   when she awoke the sun was high and    waiter modules were stacked neatly in the dust .  silver was half visible behind a pile of panels .   through half closed eyelids kin watched sphandor .  he was hopping around anxiously on his tether  sometimes darting forward and passing a tool to the shand .  when silver   s hand came out and groped in the air over a make shift brazier for the soldering iron she   d made out of a piece of scrap copper  sphandor reached into the coals and withdrew the rod by its glowing end  laying the other carefully in silver   s black palm .      he just picked up a piece of red hot iron     said kin     hot end first .      silver looked at her blankly  then looked at sphandor  then at the rod in her hand  then shrugged and turned back to the    waiter   s innards with a preoccupied air .      it is a function of demons that they can withstand heat     came her muffled voice .      how   s the    waiter .         only superficial damage  but you know how it is     one has to remove half the machinery just to reach one wire .  i   ve nearly finished .      kin stood up  stretched  and wandered out into the square .  she remembered something  and looked up at the sky .      there is a raven perched on the big stone building over yonder     said silver behind her .      do you think it   s some sort of spy .         what do you think .         i think it   s some sort of spy .         that   s what i think .      kin turned round .     where   s marco .     she asked .     it   s time we interrogated wrinklebelly here .         i plead .      silver slotted the last module into the dumb waiter and started to clip the panels back before answering .      he said he was going to have a look around .  i told him about the raven .      kin shook her head .     not clever     she said .     now he   ll want to catch it .  sphandor could tell us more .  about matter transmission  for one thing .      silver glanced up sharply  then looked at the demon .  he cringed .  the shand walked over and stared at him  which made him attempt to shuffle behind the pole .  finally she took a magnifier out of the    waiter toolkit and held it against his skin .      commendable reasoning     she said at last .     what gave you the idea  kin .         he shouldn   t be able to fly  even with chest muscles like that .  and at that weight he should have legs like an elephant .  and there   s the fuzziness  of course  and the slight vibration .      silver switched off the magnifier .      i imagine the fuzziness is due to a malfunction in the transmitter     she said .     well  well .  it   s a neat solution to the transmission problem  i   ll give them that .  very neat .  frankly  kin  you can stuff the disc .  it   s just a toy  a nasty toy .  but this is something worth having .         right .  let   s find marco .      they found him inside the stone building that dominated the village .  at one end of it was a square tower  but he was standing like a statue in the gloom of the main hall .  he turned as they came in  and in two of his hands were a pair of long candlesticks .      what   s this place .     asked kin  staring up into the shadowy roof .      a house of religion  i think     said the kung .     i was considering investigating the tower .  there appears to be a stairway inside .     he was unnaturally cheerful  and looked at her in an odd way .      the view from the top should be extensive .  we could plan the rest of the day   s flight without putting a further drain on the belts    batteries .         but the belts are perfectly       kin began  and stopped .  marco was semaphoring wildly with his two free arms .      we must conserve our power .     echoes bounced back from the depths of the building .  he looked at kin and pressed a finger to his lips for silence .      stay here  silver     he said .     i want to show kin this carving .      but when she went to step forward he pressed her back with one hand and walked away alone .  he moved the two candlesticks expertly .  it sounded as though two people were walking across the floor .   he   s going really mad this time  kin thought .  silver was smiling to herself .   marco came back .     now let   s all go up the tower     he said .     this way  folks .     he handed the sticks to kin and pointed to the further end of the hall  then soft footed it towards the open door .  they saw him flatten himself against the wall .      well  let   s go     said kin weakly  and started swinging the sticks .  there was some difficulty in getting silver up the winding staircase at the far end  and kin felt a real fool helping two sticks to climb stairs .      learned something very interesting about the demon  marco     said silver .  then she replied in a remarkable impersonation of a kung     what was that  silver .  well  you know matter transmission has been tried and doesn   t work .  well  it does on the disc .  how do you mean .  kin noticed it .   tell him  kin .      i   d better join in  she decided  otherwise they   ll think i   m nuts     what do i mean  they .      the company put a lot of research into straight matter transmission     she said .     in theory it ought to work  it   s a logical extension of strata machine or dumbwaiter operation .  trouble is  it takes power .  far too much .  and the best anyone managed was a two millisecond displacement  then the subject just snapped back to the here .         aye  i heard about that     said silver in marco   s voice .     the continuum is very anti sneaky stuff like matter transmission .  starhopping it has to put up with because we go through the elsewhere  but straight teleportation is like trying to throw away a ball that   s tied to your hand by elastic .         yes  there seems to be rules that say you stick to your predestined space time point .         what   s that got to do with the demon .         he   s transmitted .  something transmits him out maybe a hundred times a second  just as fast as the continuum snaps him back .  that   s how he can fly .  they just move the focus of the transmitters .  he   s here  he can see and hear and touch  but he   s not here .  i don   t know why he stays tied up     she added as an afterthought .     they could move him outside the ropes .         then the sooner we get back        there was a scream .   when they arrived breathless at the doorway marco was standing with all four hands clasped around a bundle of black feathers .  two small shining eyes watched them intently .      it just sauntered in through the door     said the kung .      what was all the business with the candlesticks .     said kin .  silver snorted .      marco deduced the creature must have phenomenal sound detection apparatus     she said .     it seemed logical that if it heard three of us climbing the tower           it   s far too heavy for a bird     said marco .     it must be a machine .  now we can talk to the disc controllers and explain        the raven turned its head one hundred and eighty degrees .  marco   s mouth closed like a clam .   quoth the raven     you   re the bastard that dumped me in vacuum .  you   re going to find out what happens to people who don   t act respectful to one of the eyes of god .      marco   s mouth opened and shut .      heaven help your hands if you   re still holding me in five seconds     the bird added conversationally .     four  three  two       a thin wisp of smoke escaped from the feathers .      marco .      his hands jerked back .  the raven stayed in mid air  balanced on a thin actinic flame that filled the hall with shadows and set the flagstone below cracking like springtime ice .   then it wasn   t there .  kin had just enough sense to throw herself backwards as pieces of roof rained down .  they looked up at the ragged hole  far above  and heard the cry      you   ll be sorreeee .         talk     suggested marco .      i plead .         who runs the disc .  where are they .  how may we contact them .  we shall require adequate directions and a detailed assessment of probable risks .      kin stepped forward and smiled reassuringly at the tethered giant .     where did you come from  sphandor .     she said .      i have always understood that a dog with stomach gripes paused near a log and the sun hatched me out  lady .  do not let him near me .  i can see his thoughts and           i won   t let him hurt you           oh yes .  just how .     marco began angrily .  two of his hands were heavily bandaged .      there is an island at the hub of the disc     said kin sweetly  ignoring the interruption .     tell me about it .         great lady  great beasts roam there or so it is said .  none of us may go there on pain of     of           of what .         agony  lady .  pain .  the world disappears  and then one is in a new place and there is agony .         but you have attempted to go there .         there is nothing there but black sand  lady  and the bones of ships  and in the centre a dome of copper  and terrible engines .  they cannot be tricked .      kin kept trying for another ten minutes  then gave up .      i believe him     she said  joining the others and dialling for coffee .      he   s manifestly a product of complex technology     said marco .      yah  but he thinks he   s a demon .  what am i supposed to do .  argue .         if i chopped a foot off perhaps he would think differently .     said marco  reaching for a knife .      no     said silver  drumming her fingers on the dumbwaiter   s dome .     no .  i think not .  marco  we must assume that the disc builders tend to think like human beings  and humans set great store by mercy and fair play  at least when it does not conflict with their interests .  let us therefore set the creature free  thus demonstrating our moral superiority .  the action will declare us to be merciful and civilized .  in any case     she added  and they instinctively looked up for ravens as she lowered her voice     i fail to see any further use in him .      kin nodded .  silver walked and pulled at the knots in the cable and let it fall away .  sphandor stood up  looked at them solemnly  and walked out into the light .   he raised a cloud of dust as he took off  jerking upwards like a man heron  and hovered fifteen metres up .      zaigonen tryon  tfgki  berigo hurshim .         so much for gratitude     said silver .      you understand the language .     said kin .      no  but i think i got the drift of that .         asfalago tegeram .  nema .  dwolah narma .  where are you  soignatorie  usore  dilapi dator     noooooooo        for an instant the demon was a black cloud that filled the sky  a fog of flickering  fuzzy images     each one staring in terror .  then he was gone .  there was a thump of inrushing air .   they flew higher and fast over forests flattened by the falling ship .  the smoke column was thinning  but now they were within miles of it the sky was all smoke .   marco aimed directly at it  daring it to contain enemies .  ahead of kin  his suit glittered like a silver spark against the darkness .   once inside  kin was surprised that she could still see .  it might have been better if she could not .  between billows was the landscape of hell .   after five minutes inside the smoke marco spoke .      i don   t understand it     he said .     there   s no radiation .  there shouldn   t be .  but there   s far too much damage .  silver .      below them a drunken forest burned .  before the shand answered the ground below them disappeared abruptly  as if there had been a cliff .      i can see nothing in this gloom     said silver .     can you .      marco could .  kung eyes had better night vision .  he swore  and slowed his suit .  the others did the same  drifting together so that the suits bobbed as in trio in the smoke .  marco was still staring down .      i don   t believe it     he said softly .     let   s go down .         i   m flying blind     complained silver .     you must direct me so that i don   t hit the ground .         you won   t     said marco .   kin let herself drop  tensing herself for the crash until she came out of the smoke into moonlight .   shining upwards .   vertigo gripped like a wrench .  she could take space  because everywhere was down and direction lost its meaning .  skimming over a landscape was fine  it was no different than driving an aircar .   but not this .  not hanging legs down over a hole in the world .   the moon was directly below  hovering near infinity at the bottom of a tunnel that went down and down and down         five miles deep  wouldn   t you agree  silver .     said marco in the distance .     and at least two wide .  are you all right  kin .         hunh .         you   re still descending .      she fumbled dizzily for the suit controls .  on a level with her eyes  a quarter mile away  was the lip of the hole  striated with bands of rock .  lower     she forced her eyes to move slowly .  more bands  then a line of something metallic .   and a pipe  gushing water .  kin started to laugh hysterically .      we   re fine .     she giggled .     we don   t need to go any further  all we have to do is wait for the repairmen .  you know what it   s like with plumbers  when you want one they   re never           cease gibbering .  silver  see to her     snapped marco .  kin saw his hand poised over his chest panel .  then he dropped  fast .  her eyes started to follow him down before silver   s gloved paw jerked her round .  she felt motion  and realized dimly that she was being steered away from the hole .   after a while she heard marco say     there   s a pipe thirty metres across .  guess what .  the water   s pooling about two miles down     on air .  that   s why we   re not in the middle of a descending hurricane  there   s some kind of a gravity base down there .  there   s going to be one hell of a lake there soon .      i   ve gone down forty metres .  it looks like an explosion in a power station .  there   s sheared     cables  i guess  multicored  and what could be waveguide tubes or access tunnels or something .  silver .         i hear you .  i suggest the ship impacted on top of one of the disc environmental machines  which blew up     said the shand .      it looks like it .  there   s a lot of fused stuff and     scrub that .  here   s a tunnel  a real tunnel .  can you hear me .  i   m hovering in front of a semicircular tunnel  it   s even got rails in it .  the whole of the interior of the disc is one big machine .  you should see this hole  it   s big enough for a spaceship .  there   s  uh  eighteen rails across the floor .  access for machinery repairs .  i assume  but it   s half choked with rubble .         the ship impacted five days ago     said silver sombrely .     they have had five days in which to effect repairs .  the disc builders are dead  marco .  there can be no other explanation .         i can see no signs of repair     came the voice from the pit .      quite so .  something has gone wrong somewhere  just as the seas are erratic and the heavenly bodies misbehave .  which way does the tunnel run .  is there a continuation on the further side of the pit .      there was a pause .      yes  i can see the other mouth of the tunnel .  it runs direct from the rim to hub     said marco .     i had considered suggesting we continue our flight along the tunnel but              it would be better to face any dangers in the open sky .  precisely .      kin opened her eyes .  she was hovering over blessed earth     scorched  maybe  baked and half molten  but solid .      thanks     she said .     stupid  wasn   t it .  my forebears used to hang from trees by their knees .         no shame     said silver .     i do not like darkness .  we all have our phobias .  kin .  you look a little pale         kin didn   t try to speak .  she knew she couldn   t .  she managed a strangled grunt  and pointed .   something was rising out of the pit  with difficulty .  that difficulty arose because it was almost too big .  all she could think of was the mt tryggvason memorial .   it was one of the valhallian tourist attractions .  someone had carved the high relief heads of presidents halfdan  thorbjorn  weasel moccasin and teuhtlile out of solid rock a few hundred feet high in the side of the mountain .   that was what was rising out of the pit     a mt tryggvason with one head missing  a three headed thing .  only the head facing them was human .  the others could have been a monstrous toad and some sort of insect  giant faces merging sickeningly into an impossible head  and atop the head were three crowns big enough for houses .  below the heads a cluster of spider legs dangled  each one a hundred metres long .   the effect was slightly marred by the fact that the far side of the pit could be seen through the image .      marco     said silver .      i don   t think there   s any more to be learned down           did anything pass you on the way up .         i don   t understand .         look up  marco .         holy shit .      kin choked .      do not be afraid     said silver reassuringly .      afraid of that .     said kin .     that monstrosity .  i   m just good and angry  silver .  know what that thing is .  a comic scarecrow  an image sent out to scare away anyone who might look into the pit and find out about the disc .      if we get back i won   t care who built the disc  i   ll see that they   re broken .  busted .  bankrupted .  they   ve built a world people sail off the edge of  and get chased by demons and are superstitious because that   s how they survive .  i   m beginning to hate it .      marco rose like a rocket in the centre of the image  became a glitter in the eye of saitan  a spark in the brain of god .      intangible     he reported .     a mere image .      the great human face  kingly and cold  twisted .  the mouth opened and the pit echoed to a great sad sigh .  and a lightning bolt struck out of the smoking sky and melted the dumbwaiter so thoroughly that droplets of hot metal spilled towards the bright obversical sky .   hail drummed off kin   s suit .  they were flying now against a deadline .   in fifty hours  or less  silver would go mad and attempt suicide .  kung and men could go for a long time without food .  shandi could not .   the storm raged all round them  but sank away as marco led them upwards .  they burst out of the clouds into a disc sunset .   it was far behind them  red and angry and barred with cloud .  judging from the sky the whole of the disc was having bad weather  and bad wasn   t really the word .  some of those cloud shapes were mad .   marco broke the silence .     we have a thousand miles to cover     he said .      that gives us an average speed of twenty miles an hour     said kin .     we could easily reach the hub  even with a few rest stops .         so we reach the hub .  do we find a dumbwaiter there .         anyone capable of building the disc could build a dumbwaiter .         why didn   t they repair the hole  then .  eirick  lothar     they are descendants of your disc builders  reverted to savagery .  or the disc builders are dead .         okay  have you got any better ideas .      marco snorted .   silver was trailing half a mile behind them  a dot against the livid sky .  she rumbled politely to show that she was in circuit .      there is a possibility we may find a    waiter     she said     if the disc was built by the company .  don   t groan  kin .  in many ways the idea of the disc would fit in with the policy .      by the way  there is a raven flying half a mile behind me .      kin stared at the rushing clouds below .  policy .  perhaps the disc was policy      the great spindle kings  wheelers  paleotechs  chthones     people of the universe .  the universe was people .   once upon a time astrohistorians had thought in terms of a vast  empty starry stage  a blank canvas waiting for the brush of life .  in fact it was now understood that life of a kind had appeared within three micro seconds of the monobloc   s explosion .  if it hadn   t  the universe would now be randomized matter .  it was life which had directed its growth .  life had once resided in the vast spinning dust clouds that became stars     every star was the skeleton of one of the great dust accreting dinosaurs of the universe   s jurassic .   later lifeforms had been smaller  brighter .  some  like the wheelers  had been evolutionary dead ends .  some  notably the great spindle kings and the shameleons  had been successful in the only way that evolution measured success     they survived longer .  but even star striding races died .  the universe was tombs upon graves upon mausoleums .  the comet that brightened the pagan skies was the abraded corpse of a scientist  three eons ago .   the policy of the company was simple .  it was  make man immortal .   it would take a while  and had only just started .  but if man could be spread thinly on many different planets  so that he became many types of man  perhaps he would survive .  the spindles had died because they were so alike .  now  upon dozens of worlds  men were being changed by different forces  maddened by different moons  bent by different gravities .   since the universe could not be said to have a natural ending  because the universe was not natural but only the sum of the lives that had shaped it  men intended to live for ever .  why not .   preserve meme pools  preserve ideas  that was the secret .  if you had a hundred planets there was room for different sciences  curious beliefs  new techniques  old religions to flourish in quiet corners .  earth had been one united civilization and had nearly perished once because of it .  diversify enough  and somewhere you   ll always find someone capable of catching anything the future throws at you .   people on a disc guarded by demons and ringed with a waterfall  what memes would they contribute to the genetics of civilization .  she tried to explain to marco .      what are memes .     said marco .      memes are     ideas  attitudes  concepts  techniques     said kin .     mental genes .  trouble is  all the memes likely to develop on the disc are host destructive .  anthropocentricity is one .      a pale red moon rose above the curdled clouds .  now they flew a mile apart  flew high and fast to make the hours count .  kin kept an eye on the speck that was silver  and worried .   quite wrong  of course  to project human thought patterns on an alien  but a man in silver   s position would live in hope that sooner or later food would be forthcoming .  men were optimists .   you couldn   t expect a shand to think like a man .  it was so easy to think of your friends as humans in a skin  and for good and noble reasons people were encouraged to think of aliens as funny shaped men .  just because they learned to play poker or read latin didn   t make them human .   in short  kin wondered when silver would attempt suicide .  she signalled marco and told him .      we can do nothing     he said .     i have already decided to eat no food until we reach the hub  as a gesture of solidarity .  we could take disc proteins  if the    waiter   s analysis was right     he added .      will that make her feel better .         it may make us feel better .  however  there is another problem that has recently forced itself on my attention .  i hesitate to mention it           mention it  mention it .         look at the panel on your left wrist .  there   s an orange fluorescent line against a green strip .  see it .      kin squinted down in the flickering light .      i see it .  only it   s an orange dot .         quite  but it should be a line .  we really are running out of gas  kin .      they flew in silence for a while .  then kin asked     how long .         about six hours for you and me .  perhaps an hour less for silver .  that will solve one problem .  she   ll come to earth miles behind us .         except that we will of course stay with her     said kin flatly .  marco appeared not to have heard .      if we still had the    waiter the problem would not have been insurmountable .  the hub is not too far .  we could have terrorized disc people into transporting us .  a hundred suggestions leap to the mind .  it might have been quite enjoyable  and good experience .         experience for what .         hobnobbing with the disc folk on a superior basis .  i had planned  should the hub hold nothing of interest  to set up an empire .  surely the idea had occurred to you .      it had  in passing .  kin thought for a while of genghis marco  marco caesar  prester marco .  he could do it  at that .  a four armed god king .      how long would you say it would take the disc to get onto a space going footing .     he asked .     if that was made a goal  i mean .  we have the knowledge .         no  we don   t .  we think we do  but all we know is how to operate machines .  of course  you could get a spaceship built inside a decade .         that soon .  then we could           no we couldn   t .     kin had been thinking about this  too .     what could be built is a primitive capsule powered by solid fuel rockets with enough oomph to ram the outer dome .  you could launch it by dropping it over the waterfall .         first we   d have to unify the disc     said marco thoughtfully .     not difficult .  give me five hundred norsemen and           there   s silver     said kin .     and  anyway  i have great hopes for the hub .      even so      she had been doing a lot of thinking  before they lost the    waiter .  with the    waiter they might have conquered the disc  filling the void left by the presumably departed disc creators .  without it  the best they could hope for was a comfortable life .  in a strange way it wouldn   t be so bad for the other two .  they would be aliens  marooned on a strange world .  she would be marooned among people .  it was possible that she had more in common with silver and marco than she did with the barbarians down there .  it was a dreadful possibility .      these belts are supposed to be able to fly you half way across a system and land you on a planet     she complained .      they were not expected to carry people thousands of miles against gravity  including many changes of altitude     said marco .     it is most vexing .         vexing .         if you feel so strongly  i suggest you make a complaint to the manufacturers .         how can     was that a joke .     said kin .     good grief .      dawn saw them flying over semi desert and scrub  in a sky free of clouds .  once they passed over a camel train  almost invisible were it not for its skeletal  juddering shadow on the sand .   they had drifted slightly off their course during the night  and as far as marco could estimate were speeding down the tigris euphrates valley .      that puts us in south east turkey     said marco  and added wistfully     that means baghdad .  i should like to have seen baghdad .         why .     said kin .      oh  when i was a kid my foster folks bought me a book of fantasy stories about  well  genies and magic lamps and such .  it made a big impression on me .         don   t suggest landing     said kin .     don   t even think about it .      but they passed over a city of low white houses surrounding palaces and strangely domed buildings .  a tent town lay outside the walls .  the river the city straddled was noticeably a different colour downstream  and low enough between its banks to speak of drought .  now the sun was well up the ground shimmered .   a mile later silver   s belt failed .  there was no question of a crash     instead all forward power ceased as the batteries    waning ergs buoyed her gently to the ground .   the others followed her down into a grove of knotted  sweet smelling trees .  when kin took off her helmet the heat hit her like the breath of hell .  too hot  she decided .  no wonder the fields looked scorched .  from here the river was a blood coloured snake winding weakly between slabs of cracked mud .      well     she said vaguely .  she meant this is it .      i am at a loss     said marco  moving hurriedly into the heady shade under the trees .      you mean you don   t have a plan .         your meaning .         oh  forget it .     kin took a sip of water from the suit   s reservoir .  have to be careful about that  too .   silver sat with her back against a trunk  staring vaguely at the city .  behind her the sun was a copper rivet in a sky like hot iron .   then she commented     an aircraft has just risen .      he was old in looks at least  his face wrinkled like an old apple .  his grey beard was intricately styled .  his eyes seemed to show neither whites nor expression .  certainly he did not seem surprised .   disc builder .  while kin watched him and silver talking  facing each other crosslegged under the trees  she thought hard and fast .  his clothing didn   t look anything but barbarously splendid  but she was no arbiter of disc fashion .  his craft was technologically advanced  and he knew how to use it     at the moment it was folded up inside a pouch on the belt of his travelling companion  a large broad man wearing nothing but a loincloth and a dour expression .  he held a long curved sword  and his eyes never left marco .   kin slid across to the kung .      i wonder where he keeps his antipersonnel blaster .     she asked .     marco  you know you and silver had this idea about how i could survive on the disc by using sex .         you have that advantage  yes .         well  forget it .         your meaning .         just forget it .  our fat friend with the sword is       she stopped  furious to feel herself reddening .     marco  can   t you recall anything else from that storybook .      marco   s face was blank for a while .  then he winced .     ah  yes     he said .     you mean  like  unique .         not too unique for this time and place     said kin  and turned towards silver .  the shand looked up at her .      this could be arabic     she said .     i   ve never heard it spoken .  i   ve tried a bit of latin  which i think he understands but he   s not letting on .  the only thing i   ve established so far is that he wants our suits .      kin and marco exchanged glances .  a look of almost ehftnic guile spread across the kung   s face .      tell him they   re very precious     he said .     tell him we wouldn   t exchange them even for his aircraft .  tell him we need to get to the coast quickly .         he   ll never fall for that     said kin .     anyway  there   s hardly any juice left in the belts .         that   s his worry     said marco .     i have a plan .  but first of all i   d like to see how he operates that flying rug .  tell him it is too hot to negotiate out here     it   s true  anyway .      there followed a long exchange of cracked phrases and words repeated at varying levels of exasperation .  finally the man nodded and stood up  motioning towards the servant with a hand .   the big man stepped forward and reached into his pouch  handing his master the     call it the     hell  thought kin  it is a flying carpet .  only we don   t like to say it because it sounds crazy .   it was about two metres by three  and patterned with an intricate geometrical design in blue  green and red .  spread out on the ground it hugged the bumps and hollows limply .   the man said a word .  some dust was blown up as the carpet straightened  stiffened  and hovered a few inches above the sand  kin thought she could hear a faint hum .   it didn   t rock even when silver stepped aboard .  the man with the sword sat behind them .  the old man said another word .  the ground fell away noiselessly .      one could coat a surface with flexible lifting units     said marco after a while  with a brave little quiver in his voice     but what about power .  how could you get batteries this thin .      similar thoughts had been passing through kin   s mind  since she was staring intently at the carpet between her knees so that her eyes didn   t stray over the edge .  she was aware that marco was sliding gingerly towards her .      you nervous too .     she said .      i am conscious of mere millimetres of unknown and unproven flying machine underneath me     he said .      you weren   t nervous in the lift belts .         but they were under an unconditional hundred year guarantee .  if one belt failed  how long would the manufacturer stay in business .         i do not think one could fall off this if one tried     said silver .  she hit the air beside her with a paw and it made a noise  as though someone had punched a jelly .      safety field     she said .     try it .      kin waved a hand gingerly over the carpet   s edge .  it was like moving through treacle and  as she pushed  like leaning on rock .  ali baba turned round  grinned at her and spoke a sentence .   when the carpet was finally flying level again there was silence .  finally marco said flatly     tell the lunatic if he attempts that again i will kill him .      kin released her numb fingers from their grip on the patterned pile .      be diplomatic     she added .     be tactful .  say that if he does it again i will maim him .      two loops and a triple roll .   on the disc generated gravity  shaped fields and direct vocal control came wrapped up in one neat carpet shaped vehicle .   she wondered how marco intended to steal it .   they skimmed low over the flat roofs of the city .  kin saw people in the narrow crowded streets look up  then turn back and go about their business .  magic carpets  apparently  were familiar objects .   they homed in on a minor palace  a squat white affair with a central dome and two ornate towers .  there was a garden behind decorative trellises     now  that was odd         it must have its own source of water     she said aloud .      why .     said marco .      everything else round here is parched .  that   s the one green spot we   ve seen today .         that would not be surprising  if he is a disc builder     said marco .     a fact which i doubt .         and i also     rumbled silver     yet he handles the carpet well enough and our flying belts evinced only cautious greed  not awe .  i am thinking now in terms of some hermetic order  maybe  handing down disc builder machines and relics with no proper understanding of their internal workings     like a savage may competently drive a groundcar while believing it to be powered by little horses under the engine cowling .      ali baba brought them down perfectly  the carpet drifting slowly across a balcony and through an arch into a high ceilinged room .  it hovered a few inches above the intricately tiled floor  then settled .   he leapt up and clapped his hands .  by the time the others had untwisted their limbs and  in marco   s case  eased the steel grip his hands had been maintaining  a posse of servants had entered the room .  they carried towels  and wide bowls .      that   d better be water     growled marco         cos i   m gonna drink it .      he pushed his head noisily into the bowl in front of him  causing mild consternation among the servants .  silver picked up hers and  after a preliminary sniff  opened her mouth like a funnel and tipped it down .  kin drank her fill in a reasonably ladylike manner  and used the rest to wash the dust off her face .   she took the opportunity to look around .   there was hardly any furniture .  the room was just an ornate box  walls decorated with geometrical and horticultural patterns and several large screens at one end .  by the grounded carpet was a low table  its top apparently one thick slab of crystal .   ali had disappeared  along with the servants .  silver peered around the room .      the water was ice cold     she stated .     there were crystals in it .  show me iced water  and i   ll show you civilization .         anywhere else it would mean a refrigerator     kin admitted     but here  i   d bet they   ve got hot and cold running demons in all rooms .      marco walked over to the carpet and inspected it carefully .  then he stepped on it and said the word .      i imagine it   s slaved to his voice pattern     said silver  without looking round .  marco cursed quietly .   ali baba appeared from behind the screens  followed by two men with swords .  he was carrying a small black box on a red cushion .   he looked sideways at silver and spoke a few words in halting latin .      he is going to  uh  summon that which speaks all tongues     she said .     i think .      while they watched he laid the box on the floor and opened the lid .  the thing he took out puzzled kin .  it looked like a small flat teapot made out of adulterated gold .   he polished it with his sleeve .      will you give me no peace  sorcerer .      it had appeared a few feet away  hazy in a cloud of purple smoke .  it was immediately obvious to kin why marco   s appearance hadn   t bothered the man     if he was used to things that looked like this  he was used to anything .   it was man height  or would have been if it stood erect .  but it was bent almost double  two thick gold scaled arms and oversized hands serving as a second pair of legs .  clusters of tendrils grew out of its neck .  its face was long  vaguely horse like  topped by a pair of pointy ears and tailed by two moustachios that trailed on to the floor .  it wore a small cone shaped hat .      know all that i am azrifel     it began in a sing song voice     djinnee of the desert  terror of thousands  scourge of millions and  i must be frank about it  slave of the lamp .  so what do you want this time  master .      there was a long speech from the sorcerer .  the djinnee turned around until it faced the trio .      my master abu ibn infra presents his compliments and welcomes you to his humble abode and a lot of stuff like that .  if you want to eat  just tell the table .  your wish is its command .  there   s a lot of that sort of thing goes on around here     he added .   kin hunkered down beside the table and looked at it more closely .  it was one block of crystal  but now that she paid close attention there seemed to be something else in there too  something like a moving wisp of faint smoke .   she thought of cucumber and green paprillion salad  and the cinnamon ice cream she used to buy from grnh   s olde drugge store in wonder strands  the one with the recipe that grnh had refused to sell to the dumbwaiter programmers .  there was always a black treale cherry on the top .  the memory of that taste welled up until she drooled .   it grew out of the table .  there was an impression of swirling movement in the crystal and then it was there  smoking with frost .   there was a black treale cherry on the top .  and     kin picked up the carton and stared .   it was in a familiar blue  black and white and showed an anthropomorphic penguin in a chef   s hat .  around the side was  the olde drugge store  corner of skrale and high  upperside  wonderstrands        .  tregin grnh and siblings  reg .  we freeze to please .   marco stared at the carton  then looked down at the teasing shadows in the tabletop .      i don   t know how you managed that     he said carefully     but what i have in mind is the blue plate special they serve in henry horse   s kung food bar in new        he stopped  because it was already there .  there was one bowl  heavy pottery containing something under an orange yellow crust that rumbled with internal eruptions .      it must be telepathy     he said uncertainly .     it   s just a telepathic dumbwaiter .  come on  silver .  i   m hungry .         you   re hungry     said silver .  she drummed heavy fingers on the table edge  then doubtfully      i have in mind a dish of ceremonial truduc .      the shadow swirled  disappeared .  silver   s fingers drummed on .      smoked guaracuc with grintzes .     she suggested .   a vague shape appeared above the crystal  then faded .      dadugs in brine .  chaque sweetbreads .  xiqua .  dried qumqums .      kin sighed  and pushed the ice cream away untasted .      there is a problem .     said azrifel .      the table can   t handle shand proteins     said silver  sitting down heavily and drawing her knees up to her chin .      what is a protein .      abu ibn infra seated himself comfortably by the far side of the table and put out his hand to grasp a crystal glass of pinkish liquid as it materialized beside him .  azrifel stirred  and nodded as the man spoke .      my master wishes to talk about your flying clothes and similar matters .     more consultation .     my master presents his compliments to his fellow collectors and offers  in exchange for all three items  a mirror to see all things be they never so far and two bottomless purses .      kin was aware of the other two looking at her .  she said     leaving aside for a moment his somewhat derisory offer         she had a feeling that a lack of the haggling spirit might be regarded as signs of general weakness        we come from a far off land and do not quite understand the reference to collectors .  collectors of what .      abu ibn infra frowned as he listened to the translation .  he spat out a reply .  kin wouldn   t have thought it possible for anyone to spit several lengthy sentences  but he managed  he managed .      my master is puzzled .  you possess gifts of god but you do not know of the collectors .  he says  how can this be .         listen  demon     said kin .     you know .  you   re a projection  like sphandor .  aren   t you .         i find myself forbidden to answer that question at this moment in time     said azrifel smugly .     you are in the shit  that   s all i know .  if you think you   re coming out of this alive  my reaction is ho ho ho .         i will kill it     said marco  half rising .  the guards behind ibn infra stirred .      sit down     hissed kin .     you  demon  answer the question .  what is a collector .         my master says it is no secret .  he himself was once a humble fisherman until  upon gutting a fish  one day  he discovered inside it a gift of god  to whit  the lamp to which i am shamefully enslaved .  i am azrifel of the ninth dominion of the damned .  i can find anything     even the power to talk to you .  that is my power .      for five years i have laboured mightily for this jumped up pig of a nouveau riche former fisherman  spiriting to this somewhat pretentious palace such gifts of god as are unclaimed by other collectors or in the possession of collectors unfortunate enough to have demons weaker than i .  i have combed the depths of the sea and the bowels of volcanoes  i have           hold it     said kin .     the flying carpet  the table  these damn money purses     they   re gifts of god .         aye .  the carpet i liberated from a merchant in basra  the table i found encrusted with barnacles on the sea floor           but your master doesn   t know how they operate .  i mean  they   re just magical items to him .         aren   t they  then .     said the demon  grinningly .      just as i thought     snapped marco .     he   s just an ignorant man who doesn   t know any more about the nature of the disc than does anyone else in these parts .  i   ll take out these guards  then we   ll grab him and ride the carpet out of here .         wait a minute     said kin sharply .      what for .  he knows nothing except how to operate the toys this creature finds for him .      kin shook her head .     just once  let   s try diplomacy     she said .     demon  tell your master we are not collectors .  we will give him these flying belts for his collection if he transports us on his magic carpet to the circular island that lies off the coast to the south east of here .      she knew she had said something wrong as soon as the words were out of her mouth .  when azrifel   s translation died away abu   s face went white .   marco sighed  and stood up .     okay  so much for diplomacy     he said .  he sprang .  so did azrifel .  there was a grey and yellow blur in mid air and a small thunderclap .  then the demon was back  unruffled .  marco had vanished .      what have you done with him .     said kin .      he has been deposited in a place of safety  unharmed except maybe for a few friction burns .         i see .  and his ransom is our flying belts  right .      abu spoke .  the demon said     no  my master says he knows now that you come from another world .  there was another such traveller  some time since  who           jago jalo .     said kin .  abu glared at her .      crazy fool     hissed silver .      that was his name     agreed the demon .     a madman .  he abused our hospitality .  he stole from our collection .  he sought the forbidden island too .         what happened to him .     said kin .  the demon shrugged .      he escaped from here with a carpet  a bottomless purse and a cloak with unusual powers .  even i have been unable to locate him .  my master feels  however  that all is not lost .         no .         he has three new flying devices  two captive demons and you .      kin sprang round .  more guards had appeared on the balcony  and they were archers .  she considered taking a dive for the open air with the belt on full throttle .  she might get hit .  she doubted whether the disc   s medical facilities were satisfactory .  anyway  that wouldn   t solve silver   s problem .   so she collapsed into tears of inconsolable grief .   she heard a brief conversation between the demon and his master .  then two servant women were summoned to take her away .   she had one glimpse of silver   s impassive face before she was escorted out of the room and into a maze of ornate arches and screens .  a male guard walked behind her with a drawn sword .   the women chattered at her solicitously .  when they reached one arched doorway the guard left them  and took up a post outside the door .  kin was briefly surrounded by a gaggle of small dark eyed women in scanty clothing before the older of her escorts shooed them away .  she felt helpful arms guiding her to a bench .  she sat and stared .   later a middle aged woman brought her some food .  kin looked up at her gratefully .  under the strange make up the woman was watching her with simple minded sympathy .   so kin apologized silently as she hit her  as nicely as possible .  the woman sighed and collapsed  but kin was already on her feet and running .   she sped through several low and airy rooms and had a blurred impression of fountains  singing birds and bored women sitting on large cushions .  kohl eyed  they stared after her and began to scream as kin cannoned into a servant carrying a tray .   a long way behind her a new series of screams suggested that a guard had reluctantly invaded the seraglio .   kin reached a balcony  considered the courtyard below  then scrambled up a decorative trellis that trembled even under her weight .  it took her on to a flat roof and into the full glare of the noon sun .   shouts below meant that a guard had got as far as the balcony .  kin threw herself down  chest heaving  hoping that he would think she had taken the easy way and dropped into the courtyard .  he didn   t .  there was a sudden silence  broken by some heavy breathing .   then wood cracked  and there was the beginnings of a wail that ended with a noise like a falling man hitting hard stone flags .   she jogged across the roof to the nearer of two towers that pierced it .  it wasn   t a wise choice really  but she couldn   t think of anything else .  there was an arch with no door  and a dark spiral stairway as cold as ice after the glare of the sun off the roof .   the stairs ended in a turret room with glassless windows looking out over the city .  kin peered around in the gloom .  it looked as if she was in a storeroom .   there were a few carpets rolled up against the wall  and boxes in untidy heaps beside them .  a tall bronze statue in vaguely middlesea dress was propped against a three legged table with what looked like the wreckage of a drinking party strewn across it .  there were several swords  including one that looked     kin couldn   t believe it  but closer inspection bore out the first impression     one that was half buried in an anvil .   in the middle of the floor was a statue of a horse  cast in some dark metal .  the musculature had been done well  but the pose was uninspiring .  it just stood four square  looking at the floor .      junk     said kin .  she tried to pull an iron bound chest across the stair hole  then gave up and sat on it instead .  there was no sound below .      a person could hold out here for weeks     she thought .     with food and water  that is .     food .  she thought longingly of the magic table  or even of the dumbwaiter .  but she couldn   t have eaten a meal with silver watching her sorrowfully  knowing that inside two days the shand would turn despite herself into a ravening  ravenous animal .      marco .  silver .     she whispered .   at the fifth attempt marco answered .      kin .  where are you .         i   m up in     is there anyone with you .         we   re in a zoo .  you wouldn   t believe it .  you must get us out .         i   m in some sort of museum attic     she said .     i   ll have to wait until it   s dark .  where are you exactly .         i assume we   re somewhere in the palace grounds .  you must work quickly .  silver and i are in the same cage .         what   s she doing now .         moping .         oh oh .         what .      kin sighed .     i   ll do my best     she said .  she padded over to a window and peered out .  someone was shouting in the distance  but the roof lay hot and empty below her .  there was  she noticed  a black speck wheeling in the sky .  one of the eyes of god  whoever he was .   most of the swords she could hardly lift with both hands  so they were out .      let   s face it     she told herself     how are you going to make the big heroic rescue in any case .         on the other hand     she answered     it   ll be expected of you .  the races of the galaxy look towards mankind as the essential lunatic element .      she stepped backwards  and knocked against the table .  the jug on it fell over  and spilled vinegar smelling wine across the table and on to the floor in a thin stream .  kin watched it for a while  then carefully set the jug upright .   it swished .   looking inside  she saw dark liquid rising .  she waited until the jug was brim full of swirling redness then grabbed the handle  sloshed the liquid across the room and brought the base of the jug down hard against the tabletop .   there was a sizzle and a brief smell of ozone .  bits of circuit laminate bounced on the floor .      fine     she said softly     that   s just fine .  so long as it wasn   t the fairies that were doing it .     on the other hand  the company didn   t believe in matter transmission either .  but it might have been  say  a tiny single function dumbwaiter in the base of the jug  sucking up molecules from the ambient air .  she decided she   d believe anything but magic .   someone moved  down at the base of the staircase .   there was nowhere to hide .  correction     the tower room was bursting with hiding places  but none of them promised to be permanent .  kin grabbed a sword from a pile nearby and considered hacking at the first head to appear on the stairs .   no good .  she looked up at a small trapdoor in the ceiling  and decided it would be easier to defend .  if it led on to the roof  perhaps the raven would see her     as if that would do any good .  anyway  she could then slice at fingers .   she walked over to the horse statue and hoisted herself into a stirrup  then stood on tiptoe in the saddle to fumble with the trap door .   the horse whirred .  kin swayed  landed sitting in the saddle but with enough force to knock the breath out of her .  then she couldn   t move her legs .  she looked down in panic .  padded clamps had extruded from the horse   s flanks and were gripping her gently but firmly .   the neck in front of her came up .  the head swivelled     degrees and the horse looked at kin with bright insectile eyes .      your wish is my command     it said inside kin   s head .      hell .         those are not meaningful co ordinates .         are you a robot .      she felt a click and whirr of gears underneath her .      i am the fabulous mechanical horse of ahmed  prince of trebisond .      kin heard scurrying footsteps on the stairs .      get me out of here .     she hissed .      please hold on to the reins .  please lower the head .  in case of malaise of the air  please use the receptacle provided .      there was a thud inside the animal  and the noise of heavy wheels tumbling into motion .  the horse took off .  as they glided smoothly through the window kin flung herself forward to avoid the edge of the wall .  and then the horse was free and moving  legs galloping on the air as it soared into the copper sky .   kin looked at the sword in her hand .  it was night black and unnaturally light  but it would do .  it would be surprising if abu had learned how to use the lift belts yet  so possibly his only other aircraft was the carpet .   if it came to an aerial flight  she   d prefer to be on the horse .      your further wish is my command .         you can start by telling me how you fly     said kin  peering at the gardens below .      abanazzard the magician fabricated me .  i fly by application of the compound upswinging weight engine  which requires the continued intervention of the djinnee zolah at the critical point .         do you know of a zoo in the palace grounds .         yes .         land inside it  then .         to hear is to obey  o mistress .      the horse started to gallop in a descending spiral .  kin was briefly aware of upturned faces as they raced at roof height back towards the palace .  a ragged line of dusty trees flashed past and kin realized they were landing in a wide avenue between rows of low cages  dark and forbidding in the gathering dusk .   her mount touched down neatly  hooves galloping smoothly from empty air to packed earth .  something hurled itself against the bars of the nearest cage  and she got a vague impression of wings and teeth .  plenty of teeth .      marco .     things shrilled and sneezed in the shadows of the cages .      over here .      kin urged the horse forward until she saw marco   s gleaming eyes looking urgently between bars thick enough to have been tree trunks .  perhaps they were .   kin jiggled them until they slid back noisily .  marco came out as though on a spring .      give me the sword     he commanded .  kin had almost handed it over before it occurred to her that she could have refused  and then it was too late .  he snatched it .      is this the best you could do .     he hissed .     it   s blunt as a ball .         big deal .  i could have gone off and left you .      marco tapped the flat of the black sword on one opened palm  and looked at her reflectively .      yes     he said .     you could .  this sword will do .  thank you .  from where did you obtain the flying robot .         well  i went           how do you make it fly .         it just obeys  and     get down .      marco settled himself in the saddle  and ignored her .      do you know the way to the palace  robot quadruped .         yes  o master .         then proceed .      there was a brief dumming of hooves and the horse was a dwindling speck against the sky .  kin watched it disappear and then peered into the back of the cage .      silver .     she said quietly .  a light shape stirred in the gloom .      come on     said kin .     we   d better be going .  how do you feel .      silver sat up .      where is the kung .     she said thickly .      gone to beat up the baddies  the lunatic fool .         then where should we go .     said the shand  lumbering to her feet .      after him  i think .  got any better ideas .         no     said silver .     i imagine everyone will be far too occupied to notice us .      they stepped out into the avenue of bars .      there are unicorns in that one     volunteered silver  pointing .     we saw them being fed .  and mermaids  i think  in a pool .  they were given fish .         abu is a born collector  it seems .      they passed a white dome  temple size .  close up  it was a large white egg  the lower third buried in the sand .  there was a small hole in one end .      laid by a bird .     said silver  indicating it with a thumb .      search me .  i wouldn   t put out crumbs for it .  there   s another one over there .  no        it wasn   t .  it was  however  the derelict shell of the planetary lander from a terminus probe .  a memory arose in kin unbidden  of an ancient copy of a still more ancient publicity film .  it looked smaller in real life .  there were three deep gashes in it  as though some great beast had tried to grab it .   perhaps it had .  if the thing beside it was an egg  something laid it .   the interior was a mess .      jalo landed near the centre of the disc  at least     said silver .  kin looked at the     oh  all right     call them talon marks  they could have been .      i don   t envy him     she said .     our abu is a genuine enthusiast  silver .  he never throws anything away .      there were running feet behind them  and they turned to see two men gaping at them .  one held a pike  and prodded it gingerly towards silver .  it was a mistake .  the shand merely grabbed it behind the point and felled its holder with a vicious downward slash  bringing it back afterwards to knock the other man   s scurrying legs from under him .   then she started running towards the palace  wielding the shattered shaft like a club .   kin trailed after her .  there didn   t seem any alternative .   they found marco by following the screams .   there was a courtyard  and a mob of fighting men  and in the middle a blur behind a fence of swords .  marco was fighting five men at once  and seemed to be winning .   one man  who turned and found himself a few feet from silver  slashed at her with desperate bravery .  she blinked at him sleepily  then brought a fist down with vertebrae crushing speed .   and all the time the sword sang .  kin had heard the phrase used poetically  but this one was singing     a weird electric ululation punctuated by clashes and screams .   marco was holding it at arms    length  almost cringing away from it .  it moved of itself  darting from blade to blade  from blade to body  without appearing to pass through the intervening air .  blue light crackled along its edge .   silver padded up to two men and hit them hard .  of the ones who turned to stare before running away  three keeled over as marco took advantage of their distraction .   alone in the courtyard  except for the dead  marco sagged and dropped the sword .  kin picked it up and looked at its edge .  it should have been bloody .  it wasn   t .  it was merely black  like a hole through the universe into something else .      it   s alive     said marco sullenly .     i know you will scorn  but           what we have here     said kin loudly     is merely a frictionless coated blade with an electronic edge .  the metal blade is merely a conductor .  you must have seen similar things .  carving knives  for example .      there was a pause .  marco nodded .     of course you are right     he said .      then let   s get the hell out of here .      she oriented herself as best she could and made for the nearest flight of steps .      where are you going .     shouted marco .      to find the magician .     before you do  she added to herself .  i don   t want him killed .  he   s the only way out of here .   she trotted through empty passages  heading upwards .  a short flight of stairs looked familiar .  she bounded up them  and there  at the end of a vaulted corridor  was the magician   s chamber .   abu ibn infra sat pensively cross legged on the magic carpet  watching her carefully over the top of thin  steepled fingers .  somewhat nearer the horse faced shape of azrifel crouched  splay toed .   kin glanced around the room .  there was no one else there .  abu ibn infra spoke .      why have your creatures attacked and slaughtered my people .     translated azrifel .      we had expected better treatment     said kin .      why .  you come from the place of thieves and liars with two renegade demons           they   re not demons     she said sharply .     they   re intelligent living creatures .  they just happen to be of different races .  now  about that flying carpet           they are demons .      kin felt a gust of air from the far side of the room  and was in time to see two figures coalesce .   they were kung .  not perhaps perfect copies  and they moved curiously as if whatever had created them had aimed for kung shape without a knowledge of kung anatomy .   abu had summoned demons to deal with her  and somewhere there was something that had observed that the kung shape was good for a fighter      it had added disc touches .  in battle kung usually carried no more than a short sword and a small blast deflector  leaving two arms for freelance throttling .  these carried a weapon in each hand  and each one was different .  one even twirled a morningstar .   it would be like being hit by colliding lawn mowers .   kin stared at the two expressionless faces  dead faces  and stopped herself from turning to run .  she   d be running downstairs  with those behind her .   she raised the sword hopefully .   something squirmed under her hand .  pain exploded up her arm and rattled her teeth .  as the kung things loped towards her the sword crackled .   movement slowed .  through a pink glow kin saw the demons slow as if they   d run into jelly  but there was no sound at all .  hate settled on her dreamily  comfortably  and she watched the sword come up with interest .   there was no shock when it drifted through an axe blade  and went on to shear through an arm     the flesh was grey  boneless and bloodless     and another sword .   she folded away from a snail   s pace spear  and started a long slow leap that let her slice through a neck .   she swung her feet round in time to land lightly  twist  and let the sword sweep like a scythe .   now there was a third enemy  backing away through the red mists .  the sword jerked and kin jumped  feeling her body curve behind the blade like the tail of a comet .  it struck the figure in the chest  and kin left it there .   she drifted on and into the wall  colliding gently with a faint prickling sensation .  then she began a lazy tumble to the floor  several miles away .   it had no right to hit her so hard .   she felt as though one side of her body was one long bruise .  her shoulder muscles were screaming .  her arm suggested that it had been dragged through a sieve .   for a blissful few seconds she was able to view the clamouring sensations objectively  looking into the kaleidoscope of her own head .  then subjectivity set in with a rush .   there was a slithering noise behind her  and a soft thud .  with a certain amount of agony she turned her head to see abu sprawled against the wall  with a long red smear above him .   kin lay cherishing the coolness of the floor .  then she used her left arm  which merely ached horribly  to walk it on its fingers to the magician   s outflung hand .  she uncurled his fingers from the lamp  and dragged it back until it was in front of her eyes .   it didn   t look anything special .  she buffed its surface with a finger .      i am azrifel  slave of the lamp     said the demon in a sing song voice .     your wish is my command .         fetch me a doctor     said kin thickly .  the demon disappeared .  there was a tiny thunderclap .   an agony later he reappeared .  in his arms  kicking faintly and whimpering  was a small white faced man in a black robe .      wass that .     said kin .      johannes angelego of the university of toledo .      kin picked up the lamp and hammered it on the tiles .  azrifel screamed .  the small scholar echoed him  then fainted .      i mean a physician  you horse     muttered kin .     take that man back and bring me a proper doctor .  it   s a box eight foot long  demon  with lights and dials on it .  a doctor .  unnerstan .  hell  even a human doctor would do .      she hit the lamp again .  azrifel shrieked and disappeared .   this time he took longer  when he reappeared he carried a figure riding pickaback and was holding a large equipment box in his arms .  kin looked up hazily at the familiar green allsuit of an intern at the company medical centre .  the man jumped down  landing with all the athletic grace of one with limited access to rejuvenation treatments .   kin recognized jen teremilt  his face wavering slightly as the pain closed in .  good old jen     she   d nearly married him  a hundred and forty years ago .  he   d have reached a high position in the company   s medical history if he hadn   t died while hunting chaque on sister .   his cool fingers reached out for her .   though the carpet could easily carry the three of them     azrifel did not appear to weigh anything     marco insisted on ordering the flying horse to follow them closely .      are we ready .     said marco .   the sun still hadn   t shown above the disc  but there was enough pearly pre dawn light to show kin and silver sitting on the carpet in the middle of the cool roof .   kin   s arm felt numb .  she shivered .      let   s go     she said .  she rubbed the lamp .  azrifel appeared beside her .      well .     he said .     what .         what happened to all that o mistress stuff .     said kin  surprised .   marco snorted impatiently .      all right  don   t get stuffy .  that sort of stuff was all right for him     i gathered you were more democratic .     an etiquette lesson from a hundred and ninety years before jogged kin   s overloaded memory     a gentleman is someone who always says    thank you    to his robot .      this lamp     she said .     suppose i were to give it to you .      the demon blinked  and thought about it .  after a moment a green tongue flicked out across its dry lips .      i would take it and drop it over the edge of the world  o mistress     it said .     then i would have peace .         fly this carpet to the centre of the world and i will give you the lamp     said kin .  azrifel grinned .  kin added     see the kung on the horse .  you will note he has the magic sword .  i will give him the lamp .  should you betray us in any way  no doubt he will damage the lamp in interesting ways        the demon shivered .      point taken     he said  gloomily .     is there no trust in this world .         no     said marco flatly .   the carpet rose and skimmed over the darkened city  marco following closely on the flying horse .   kin watched the houses pass below and thought   something looks into our minds .  the magic table produced food we merely thought of .  when i thought of a doctor  it sent azrifel with the man i had in mind  but it wouldn   t produce an autodoc .  why .   azrifel was still crouched vacantly beside her .  at the front of the carpet silver stared blankly at nothing .      azrifel     said kin .     bring me     oh  bring me a fully equipped matrix drive mftl ship with the latest model dumbwaiter .      over the com circuit she heard marco cackle .   the demon said     no .         is that a refusal .  we have your lamp .      azrifel shook his head .     it is not a refusal     he said .     it is a statement .  oysters cannot fly  i cannot bring you your desire .  now crush the lamp if you must .         no anachronisms     said marco .     is that it .      the demon paused before answering  as though listening to an internal voice .  seen up close  he too was slightly blurred     like a threevee picture in the middle of a bad day for sunspots  kin thought .      no nachronisms     he agreed .      but the man called jalo left the world and appeared two hundred light     many  many miles away .     kin corrected herself .     how .         i do not know .         jalo   s ship is in distant orbit     said marco .     we could adapt the lifesystem  cannibalize bits out of our lander  and go home in that .         it   d take too long .         perhaps not .         what about power .         a thousand of these magic carpets joined edge to edge .         navigation .         dead reckoning .  we   ll be aiming at a fifty light year sphere from a distance of     years .  no trouble .         neat .  and what about silver .      marco said nothing .   when the sun came up  it was tinted with green .   they flew over a sandstorm half a mile high  which blasted through farms and towns like snow from hell .   marco didn   t say much and silver was now saying nothing at all .  she lay curled up on the carpet  looking at the sky .   they thundered over a port called basra  where the timber of broken ships clogged the streets while the mad sea methodically destroyed the town .   silver said     something is shining on the horizon .      kin wondered if she could see a faint gleam on the borders of vision .  ten minutes later she was sure .   silver stirred again .     leave     she ordered .     the kung must come here .  with swords .         marco           i heard .  stop the carpet .  you can take the horse .         but you know what she   s asking .         sure .  if things get too bad  i   ll have to kill her .         how can you be so emotionless about it .         why not .  better a dead sapient than a live animal .  i agree with her .         what   ll happen afterwards .      he pursed his lips .     she   ll reincarnate on the disc  i guess .  better a live human than a dead sha           will you stop talking like that .      the gleam turned out to be a high dome  welded into the rock of a wide island that seemed to be mostly black sand .  kin thought she could make out the remains of a few ships half buried in the sand .   they circled it  a mile out at first  then moving closer in .  kin saw a black shape spiral down out of the sky and perch on the dome .      that does it     she said .     marco  i   m going in .      the kung   s answer was a strangled grunt .  kin spun round in the saddle .   a few metres away silver was rearing up on the carpet  the fur of one arm bright orange where it had caught the thrust of the sword .  her hand was around marco   s waist while he had two hands gripping her throat  and between them the sword screamed as they wrestled .   the carpet drifted on past .  kin got a brief glimpse of silver   s contorted face twisted around a saliva barred mouth .   kin grabbed the lamp .  azrifel appeared  standing on air  and watching the silent fighters with interest .      separate them     kin ordered .      no .      marco somersaulted away from silver  caught her arm in three of his  and threw her over his shoulder .  his leg bones bent like springs .  then silver was over the edge of the carpet .   but not falling .  she hung at an impossible angle in its safety field  snarling and thrashing at the air .      no .         i dare not go closer to the dome .         i have the lamp  demon .         i suggest you do not use it .      kin saw marco lift the sword and hesitate .  silver picked up leverage on sheer fresh air  and hurtled towards him .   shand  kung and carpet disappeared .   kin stared at the empty space .  below  the sea roared .  there was nothing else around but sea  sky and dome  and the horse faced demon hovering over nothing at all .   finally she said     demon  what happens if i drop the lamp in the sea .  the truth  now .         sometimes fish or crabs will brush against it .  their wishes are simple and easily fulfilled .         what happened to the carpet .         it disappeared .     said the demon uncertainly .      i know .  why .         things that approach too close to the centre of the world do so .         you didn   t tell us .         you didn   t ask me .         where do they disappear to .         to .  they just disappear .  that is all i know .         you   ll know more soon     said kin .  she shoved the lamp back into her pocket and urged the horse forward     towards the dome .  azrifel whimpered .   presently kin disappeared .   kin awoke at the heart of a galaxy strained through a ruby .  touch told her that she was lying on a floor like polished metal  and an old but hitherto unnamed sense assured her that she was inside something .  a building .  maybe a cave .   around her a billion pinpoints of red light glowed .  they spread away from her in complicated constellations  climbed the invisible wall tens of metres away and met in the blackness overhead .  sometimes the pattern changed instantly  to be replaced by one equally red and forbidding .  it was a pointillist   s vision of hell .   then kin moved .   stampede .  the lights poured down the walls and clustered around her .  she stood up and stamped a foot experimentally .  experiment was the word  and she clung to it .  be rational .  don   t go mad .   she thought she had been prepared for anything .  robots  lasers  long headed disc builders in silver suits  intelligent slimes     anything .  but not these lights .  it wasn   t as though they lit anything but themselves .      get me out of here     she growled .   flash .  now she was standing in an arched corridor  her nostrils filled with the hot metal  ozone and oil smell of machinery .  the tunnel was brightly lit by a continuous strip overhead .  pipes and cables snaked along the walls  and the floor was a linear maze of rails .  there were distant bangs and thumps  and everywhere there was the hum of hurtling electrons .   kin picked a direction and walked  carefully avoiding anything that looked highly electric .   so  she told herself  this is the works .  i   m down among the cogwheels of the universe .  but it   s all wrong .  the technology looks ancient .  cogwheels is about right .  good grief .   she was halfway past an alcove giving off from the main tunnel .  there was movement in there .  kin started to run for cover  then thought  what the hell .   it was a robot  a big one shaped the best shape for a robot .  square .  one waldo arm was groping in a square hole in the alcove   s metal wall .  a square panel lay on the floor .   the arm clicked back .  it held something small that kin couldn   t quite see properly  which it dropped into a hopper bolted on to the robot   s side .  a drawer slid out just above the hopper  and this time kin got a good view of the objects nestling in its padded interior .  the arm waved uncertainly above them  then selected one gingerly and carried it into the hole .   while the machine was engaged in its mysterious activities kin strolled forward and picked one of the objects out of the rack in the drawer .  it was about the size of an egg .  one end was studded with hundreds of pins  and inside was a filigree of wires  tubes and grids .   kin had seen things like it in a museum .  it was a valve  a sort of neolithic integrated circuit .  only this was a valve such as might be built by someone who had never developed the transistor  so that more and more ingenuity had been devoted to perfecting the existing technology .   it made kin think of ehftnic computers .  the ehfts had never discovered electronics but they needed computers for their complex religio banking organizations .  so an ehftnic computer was a thousand highly trained ehfts  each one handling a small part of the math .  it worked .   but she   d be dipped in dogshit before she   d believe that the disc was built by a thermionic valve technology .   the robot   s arm whirred out of the wall .  the panel was picked up and slotted into place with surprising speed .  almost before kin could react her new friend was rumbling off down the tunnel .  it moved at a fast walking pace .  she followed .   she would survive .  if they were going to kill her  they would have done it already .  she   d live .  provided she didn   t bank on it  she   d live .   once they passed another cuboid robot  wielding some kind of tool over some kind of exposed circuitry .  it could have been a soldering iron .  it could have been a printed circuit .  kin couldn   t stop to check .   then kin   s robot reached a robot shaped slot in the wall .  kin had a brief glimpse of sockets at the back of the slot before the robot reversed in  with all the painstaking care of a fornicating porcupine .  it stopped humming .  patently  the repairman had gone dormant .   kin considered for some time .  the tunnels seemed endless .  she could wander around in them for days .  then she   d die .  but there was an alternative     she went back down the tunnel until she found the soldering robot .  wrenching off one of its arms was difficult  but she managed .  she used it to hit the thing until it stopped humming .  as an encore she tossed the arm at the exposed circuitry  which sparked satisfyingly .   then she waited .   when a small  hemispherical robot repair robot rolled up a few minutes later she overturned it .  it hummed at her reproachfully .   the next one was a pear shaped  multi lensed blob travelling along a rail near the ceiling of the tunnel .  kin tried to bring it down with pieces of robot  but it swung away hastily .   at least she had made her presence felt .  someone must repair the robots that repaired the robot repairing robots .  all it took was time .   hours passed before a tank like machine arrived .  it was dented and lacked panelling  and bore the stumps of various delicate manipulatory appendages .  if this was the ultimate repairer  kin supposed  then sheer time could have caused its battered state .   on the other hand  the fact that marco was sitting on its hull with a robotic arm trailing wires in each hand could have had something to do with it .      perhaps there just aren   t any facilities for dealing with humans who get into the machinery     said kin .   marco grunted  but didn   t look up from his work .  he was doing something neolithic with a length of robot innards  using the small repair hemisphere as a hammer .      there must be     he said .     this world must be studded with hidden air ducts  ventilators  power shafts .  humans poke into everywhere .  anyway  we were brought here  remember .  subsequently to ignore us is impolite .      he stood up .     coming .         where .         anywhere with delicate circuitry .  this     he waved a robot limb     is insulated .  for short circuiting .         and the other thing .     asked kin  her heart sinking .   it was a connected series of arm sections  terminating in a crude but lethal blade .  marco hefted it experimentally .      huh .  it   s a weapon  obviously .         you were maybe expecting to meet some antipersonnel robots .     kin said icily .   marco had the decency not to meet her gaze .      i was thinking of silver     he said wretchedly .     well .  do you imagine she   s found anything to eat yet .  and have you got any better ideas .      he set off along a tributary tunnel  and called back     anyway  it can   t have escaped your notice that these tunnels are lit .  robots don   t need light .      kin shrugged .  perhaps soldering robots needed light .  a little light destruction to attract attention was one thing  however     intelligent action in the circumstances .  but marco looked ready to smash the whole disc .   in the distance she saw him hacking at cables .  this wasn   t action to attract attention     this was marco vs the universe .   what was happening up on the surface .  a plague of flies .  a rain of frogs .  all the seas running dry .  the extinction of the dodo .   now she was running .  marco was a terrible figure wreathed in smoke  hacking at a solid cliff of planet sized circuit .  there was a jerkiness about his movements that told kin all she needed to know .  marco had gone mad .  or at least gone kung .   she stopped when his blade swept a few inches from her throat .      they want to play games  eh .     he croaked .     put us on the spot  watch our reactions  eh .  i   ll show them .      one free hand swept his club into a circuit board  which exploded .      i   ll show them .      kin swayed back  her eyes on the tip of the blade .  then a movement to the right of marco   s private smoke cloud made her look away .  marco saw her expression  and hesitated for a fraction of a second too long .   silver leapt .  marco disappeared as the huge paddle like arms swept round in a bone grinding hug  then appeared again with three arms flailing at the shand   s head .  silver screamed  and one foot came up with claws out to disembowel the enemy .  marco   s bowels had already gone with the rest of him for silver   s eyes .  while the shand staggered across the floor clawing at the demon atop her  kin saw marco   s fourth arm swing up with his pike .   it twirled gracefully  the blade drifting through the hot air like the scythe of death .  then it buried itself in a power cable .   there was a sound like the snapping of locusts .  silver and marco appeared for a moment like a tableau  silver a big fluffy ball as every hair stood out from her body .   kin scrabbled on the floor for marco   s anti disc weapon with its insulated handle .  it took all her strength to knock the vibrating pike out of his hand .  when it came away  the two aliens collapsed .   aliens  she thought .  i called them aliens .  oh  shit .  she knelt down and sought for signs of life .  something vague was happening in silver   s chest  but she didn   t know where even to begin looking for either of marco   s hearts .   the lights overhead dwindled to a sickly orange glow .  there were footsteps behind kin     strange  rattling steps .  she turned  still crouching  to see the tall figure that had appeared behind her .   the most obvious thing was the weapon that was sweeping down towards her .  instinctively she flung up an arm  which was still holding marco   s club .  the scythe hit it hard  and shivered into pieces .   kin started to laugh .  the thing in front of her was a skeleton in a black bathrobe  grinning perplexedly at a wooden handle that now had no blade .  who were they trying to scare .   the scythe handle in death   s white claws flowed .  what it became was at least appropriate to the age of genocide  and kin had time to wonder where they had found the pattern .  there were two rows of oscillating teeth and a brisk little engine .   a power scythe .  kin had used them herself to clear scrub on new worlds .   death advanced .  had he lunged kin wouldn   t have survived  but ancient habits die hard .  he swung  instead .  and kin dived forward .  she heard the power scythe crash down behind her and gyrate across the floor as she stared up into eyeless sockets .  struggling  she brought one knee up     a pointless tactic that merely jarred her kneecap .  death had no balls .   a necklace of bony fingers closed round her throat .  she lashed out with the back of her hand  willing the blow home .  it hit death in the face  and then there was something like an explosion in a domino factory .   kin was standing alone .  there was a black robe on the floor in front of her  and a few pieces of bone scattered around .  they disappeared in a series of small thunderclaps .  a larger one marked the disappearance of marco and silver .   kin disappeared  too .   a minute later a couple of cuboid robots trundled along the tunnel and started to clean up the mess .   now she was in a        no     she said .     no more .  i give in .  do you know how long it was since i last had a drink .      a glass of water appeared hovering in the air in front of her .  kin wasn   t particularly surprised .  she caught it gingerly  and drank it .  when she tried to hang the glass in the air it plummeted down and smashed .   now she was in a     call it a control room .  the disc control room .  this had to be it .   it was surprisingly small .  it could have been the flight deck of a medium large ship  except that a ship would have more screens and switches .  this had one screen and one bank of switches  in front of a deep black chair .  over the chair was what could have been a computer link helmet .      oh no     she said .     not me .  i   m not putting that on .      the screen flickered and a word appeared .   bets .   kin moved forward and got a better view of the chair .  it was a disturbing complicated shape  and looked almost alive .   its occupant was dead .  not offensively dead  because the air in the room was crisp and dry and had expertly mummified him  but undeniably dead .  if he had believed in reincarnation  he   d come back as a corpse .   there was an old wound on one withered arm .  it didn   t look fatal  but there were antique blood stains on the floor .  he could have bled to death but that seemed a derisive death for a disc master .   if he was a disc master .  somehow kin had never brought herself to think of the disc   s overlords as human  but the man in the chair was human enough .  given a heavy shave and a fresh skin he could have called anyone cousin .   the screen in front of the chair blurred  then produced a word .  it hung in front of kin  glowing pitifully .   help  marco crouched in the semi darkness when he next heard the voice .   after a while he surfaced from the mists of rage enough to realize that it was talking to him .  it was familiar .  the ape descended woman .      kin arad .     he croaked .      marco  where   s silver .     the voice insisted .   marco   s eyes felt like fire pits  but the light from the millions of red glows around him suited his vision .  he saw a shape a few metres away  eclipsing a constellation on the floor .      the bear thing is here .  she is breathing .         marco     said the air .     i don   t know how good i am at this thing .  you   ll have to help .  don   t move .      the air stirred in front of the kung  and there was a knife .  three of marco   s hands caught it before it hit the ground .  in the red light  he stared dully at the jewel encrusted handle .      don   t waste time     said the ape voice .     i want you to cut a piece out of silver .  don   t be too enthusiastic .  hide will do  but the flesh would be better .      memories were dripping into marco   s mind .  he looked at the knife  then thought about silver .      not on your life     he said flatly .      do it .  the next knife will arrive at speed if you don   t  and you   d better believe me .      with a roar of rage and frustration marco bounded forward and slashed at silver   s arm .  the big body may have quivered slightly .      that   ll do .  the blood on the knife will do .  let go the knife  marco .  let go of the knife .  let go of the knife .      marco was thirsty .  he hadn   t eaten in memory .  his skin itched in the warm dry air .  he was damned if he   d let go of a weapon .  if he thought about it at all  that was what he thought .      okay .  we   ll do it the hard way .      there was just something about the voice that made marco loose his grip on the handle .  thus it was that  when the knife popped out of existence  it merely stripped the flesh of his palm instead of taking his hand off at the wrist .   methodically he gripped his wrist to stop the blood flow  and let the pain batter outside his brain .  he was still staring at the wound when a rush of air and a thump made him look up .   something long and bloody was lying on the floor beside silver .  and the shand   s arm was moving slowly .  it fumbled around the meat  gripped it  pulled it dreamily to a mouth strung with saliva .   silver ate .      where are we .     said marco at last .   kin   s voice said     i   m not entirely sure .  are you okay .         i should like a drink .  and some food .  you had me slice the shand to get a protein sample .         yes .  don   t move .      something like a squashy bulb of water appeared beside marco  and bounced limply on the floor .  he picked it up and bit into it with shameful haste .      food now     said kin .  another bulb  filled with red sludge  rolled obscenely across the floor .  marco tried it .  it tasted like solid boredom .      it   s the best i can manage     said kin .     about the only damage you did was upset the disc master   s dumbwaiter circuits .  i   ve got robots repairing them  but until then the menu can just about manage to be unexciting .         silver has fared better     said marco indistinctly .      i told you i hadn   t got time for niceties     said kin .     she   s eating shand  cultured from her own cells .  don   t ask me how it was done in seconds  i only gave the order .  it might be an idea not to tell her  though .         yes .  you are in a position of influence .         you could say that .         good .  get me out of here .      there was a pause .  then he heard kin say     i   ve been giving a lot of thought to that .         you   ve been giving a lot of thought to it .         yes .  i   ve been giving a lot of thought to it .  you   re in a sort of hold for study chamber .  there   s no way in or out except by teleportation  and if you knew what i know about that you   d rather stay in there and starve .  i daren   t cut in in case you   re harmed .  so  all things considered         a long shape exploded into being a metre from marco  and landed heavily .  he picked it up and looked at it suspiciously .      it looks like an industrial molecule stripper     he said .      it is .  i suggest you use it with caution .      marco grimaced in the hellish light and pointed the thing .   a section of chamber wall became a fine fog .  he switched off hastily  and looked round for silver .   the shand was kneeling  holding her head .      how do you feel .     said marco  in a concerned tone .  he held the stripper lightly  not quite pointing it at silver .  the shand squinted at him vaguely .      odd things been happening        she began .   marco helped her to her feet  a more or less token gesture since she weighed ten times his weight     and he needed one hand to keep the stripper not quite pointing at her .      right now  can you walk .      she could stagger .  marco peered out of the chamber  into a dimly lit tunnel .  two small cuboid robots were fretting over the still settling dust of the wall .  he glanced back at silver  and opted to point the stripper   s flared nozzle at a questing waldo .      lay off the hardware     said the robot  backing away .      kin arad .     said marco .      marco  that weapon is for your own peace of mind .  but if you use it  i   ll rip your arms off from here .  and i can .      marco considered this for several moments  while silver climbed laboriously out of the chamber .  then he shrugged with all four shoulders  and let the weapon thump on the floor .      monkey logic     he said .     i   ll never understand it .         i thought you thought you were human     said the robot with kin   s voice .      so .  all the thinking in the worlds doesn   t change some things .         cogito ergo kung     said the robot .     follow me  please .      they fell in behind it as it rolled off along the tunnel .   an hour later they were still walking .  they had crossed wide metal chasms on lattice bridges and crouched in alcoves as giant machines thundered down side tunnels .  on one occasion the little cube had beckoned them to follow it on to a lift platform .  at the next level down the lift had stopped again and a dozen humming golden cylinders had drifted on  smelling of ozone .   they followed narrow walkways between topless towering machines  which boomed .     krells     said silver .      huh .      the shand grinned .     didn   t you ever see    forbidden planet    .  human movie .  they remade it five  six times .  i had a walk on part in one  before i went to college .         can   t say i recall anything .             i had to thump doors  mostly  and roar     had to share my dressing room with the robot  too .  he was human .         a human robot .         the rest of the cast were actor robots  you see .  but there was this robot in the plot  and they couldn   t find a robot who could act     robotlike .  they had to hire a human .  there was a very impressive scene inside a big machine built by the krells  i think it was .  just like this .  krells  you understand  being fictional creatures invented for the purposes of the movie        silver broke off when she saw marco   s face .   he sighed .     we have been around humans too long you and i     he said .     we have been tainted by their madnesses .         i thought you were brought up on earth .  are you not legally human .         my race papers are up there in the rest of the ship .  big deal .      silver grunted .     consider yourself a cosmospolitan  then .         what does that really mean  my friend .         it means the voluntary subjugation of one   s racial awareness in the light of the basic unity of sapient kind .      marco growled .     it doesn   t mean that at all .  it means that we learn to speak languages that monkey tongues can handle  and we get along in their world .  ever see a human act like a shand  or a kung .         no     silver conceded .     but  on the other hand  kin arad is free and we were imprisoned .  humans always take the lead .  humans always get what they want .  i like humans .  my race likes humans .  maybe if we didn   t like humans  we   d be dead .  what   s that .      marco followed her gaze .  half a mile away a tower loomed above the city sized machines .  it seemed to be made of giant balls stuck one atop another  and it glowed dull red .  silver pointed out the robots that clustered on the gantries that surrounded it  but marco had to be content with a vague  eye watering impression of something huge and ominous .      a giant coffee percolator .     he hazarded .   silver shouted at the little robot  which had rolled on ahead .  it reversed neatly .   silver indicated the stack of spheres that disappeared into the roof of the cavern .      basically     it said in kin   s voice     it   s a simple device for heating rock to melting point and ejecting it under pressure .         why .     said marco .      volcano     said the robot .      all that     said the kung     to give the disc volcanoes .  madness .      the robot rolled away .      you say that now     it said .     you wait until you see the earthquake machines .      the journey under the disc took two days  as far as marco and silver could calculate .  sometimes they rode  crouching on flat trucks that glided along low tunnels with agonizing slowness  but more often they walked .  climbed .  inched along ledges .  ran like hell across switch yards  where sub disc machines shunted and thundered on errands of their own .   sometimes they came across dumbwaiters  perched incongruously in the whirring underworld .  they had a new look unlike their surroundings  which were worn .  well looked after  carefully maintained  but worn .   marco raised the subject while they were sitting with their backs against a dumbwaiter .      i know     he said .     if the disc people had an industrial revolution and then took a look at the underside of their world  it   d scare the life out of them .      silver chewed on another mouthful of what  marco presumed  was lightly cooked shand .      it seems remarkably remiss of the disc builders to allow this dereliction     she said .     i have noticed quite a number of obviously broken down devices .  surely they could be repaired .         who repairs the machines that do the repairing .     said marco .     a machine like the disc must blow a whole lot of fuses in a hundred years or so .  what do you do when the robot that repairs the machines that make the parts for the factory that builds the robots that service the waldoes that make the fuses crashes its cog .  unless you get periodic servicing from outside  the disc gradually breaks down .         we could ask the robot     said silver .   it was a sick joke .  the robot would answer any direct question about the mechanical scenery     they had been treated to a ten minute lecture on the tide regulation machinery  for example     but ignored all the others .  marco had toyed with the idea of prising its lid off with something  but allowed caution to get the better of him .      the place with the red lights must have been out near the disc rim     said silver .     i have a feeling we   re approaching the hub again .  perhaps we can ask kin .      the robot  which had been sitting silently a few metres away  rolled forward .      we are refreshed .     it asked cheerfully .     we will proceed .      they stood up stiffly .  the cuboid robot led them along a catwalk that opened on to a wide circular gallery  brilliantly lit .  most of the light came from the luminous mist overhead  but an appreciable amount came from the tiny actinic sun .   it floated perhaps a hundred metres over a perfect relief model of the disc surface  several hundred metres across .  except that relief maps didn   t have tiny clouds  trailing minute shadows across the land .  marco had never seen them with active volcanoes  either .   there was no railing to the gallery .  the disc map glittered a metre below it  sunlight glinting off seas that looked disconcertingly real .   marco stared down for a long time .  then he said     i give up .  it   s beautiful .  what   s it for .         one thinks of architect   s models     rumbled silver .     however  let me draw your attention to a flaw .  see over there  just beyond the inland sea .      marco squinted  and gave up .     no     he said .     the disc builders either had damn good eyesight or all this was just for show .      he looked around for the robot .  it wasn   t there .      we wish to view the disc map more closely     silver was saying to the empty air .  something like a flying slab of glass glided around the map from the far side and hovered in front of her .  she stepped aboard gingerly .  under her weight it didn   t even wobble .      i see it     said marco     but i don   t believe it .  how did you do it .         just a knack     said silver .     i think i   m getting to understand the way things work around here .  coming .      the glass carpet responded neatly to silver   s spoken directions .  it skimmed across the map mere centimetres from the clouds .  marco had a strange urge to reach down and stir some into a cyclone .  the map was frighteningly real .  if he leaned over and touched it  would a giant hand appear in the disc sky .   when the shand spoke again he looked down obediently through the glass .   there was scarred land down there  burned and broken .  and in the centre of it was a neat round hole .   later silver found that raising the platform slightly magnified the scene immediately beneath .  there appeared to be no limit to the resolving power .  there were people down there  microscopic figures that were almost immobile .   only almost .  every second the scene flickered  and the figures took up slightly different positions .  marco spent an age entranced at the sight of a homunculus cutting wood .  flick     the axe in the air     flick     biting into the tree     flick     back in the air  and a wedge of raw wood bitten by magic out of the trunk .      it could be done     he said  half to himself .     all you   d have to do is correlate sensory inputs and keep reprojecting them as a hologram .         you   d need many inputs .         billions .  you   d have to plug into the cognitive centre of every living creature .         have you noticed the blank patches .         maybe a bird wasn   t looking in that direction at the time .      silver nodded gravely  and looked around the big map hall .      presumably the map of the disc also includes its own miniature disc map     she said slowly .  she met marco   s gaze with a quiet smile .  then she ordered the platform to go to the map   s hub .  neither doubted that the map hall was at the hub .   they looked down at the dome .  silver tried some commands  which appeared to have no effect .  so she lowered the platform .   staring down between their feet they saw earth and metal melt and drift aside .  disc machinery rose and faded away .  there was something now  the edge of something      there was a little round disc .  at its centre was a grey and white speck  which resolved into two figures .  one was big and furry  the other wiry and thin as a twig .  both were staring intently at something between their feet      flick .  the wiry one was looking up now  at the miniature gallery that encircled the map of the map .  flick .  there was a figure there .  flick .  it raised a hand .  flick .      hi     said kin .   silver was not expert in human expressions  but by the look of her the woman had not been sleeping .  in fact she was swaying slightly .      glad you could make it     she said .     i couldn   t get the computers to teleport you  there   s a thirty per cent chance the power would fail while you were out of phase .  follow me .  there isn   t a lot of time left .         we       began marco .   kin shook her head violently .     no we didn   t     she said .     come on .      the kung started to protest again  and silver gripped him firmly by a couple of arms .  kin was already hurrying down a tunnel leading off the hall .   it emerged in a metal cave half as big again as the one they had just left .  it contained a spacecraft .  at least  that was the first impression      it didn   t have any motors .  apart from strangely large altitude jets in about the right places for altitude jets  the hull seemed to be all cabin  with enough windows to grow grapes .  cuboid robots were still clustered around it .  one of them was spraying paint on the landing gear .  two others were busy on a stubby wing .   kin was already aboard .  snarling  marco bounded up the short ladder and saw her sitting at the horseshoe shaped instrument console .  wires trailed away from it to boxes bolted haphazardly around the interior of the cabin .  in the centre of the floor a regiment of tiny cubes were engaged in feverish activity around a tangle of wires and metal shapes .  one of them butted marco politely on the foot until he moved .      silver  shut that door     said kin .     hurry .  and now pray to any convenient gods .      she turned and addressed the air  in a tone of voice that made it clear it was not the others she was talking to .      we   re ready .      the reply came from everywhere .   we have a bargain .      it   s a bargain     said kin .  there was a pause .  the ship trembled slightly .  marco looked out and saw the cave walls slipping past .      don   t say anything rash     said kin .     don   t even think  if you want to get home .  have a little faith  will you .  please .      sudden sunlight filled the cabin .  looking up  marco and silver saw a square of golden sky appear as sections of the roof slid back .  the ship accelerated upwards on its section of floor .   by their feet a small robot tugged a length of tubing out of the heap in the centre of the cabin .  one of its many arms swung down  hesitated  gripped the tube .  the metal broke where it touched .   silver jerked her head forward sharply as something tickled her ears .  when she looked round cautiously she was eyeball to scanner with a little metal cube which was hanging from the cabin roof by three arms .  it had no face  but managed to look embarrassed .  its fourth arm held a pair of calipers .   marco hissed and struck out at another machine that was trying to climb up his leg .  it landed on its back  scrabbling at the deck with all six arms .   kin laughed hysterically .      don   t be childish     she gasped .     when we flip into interspace you   d like to be in a contour couch  wouldn   t you .  all they want are your measurements .  do it .      marco opened his mouth to protest  and something touched his face .  looking down  he saw a metal tape unrolling on its way to the deck .  he looked up .  a robot was dangling above his head .  he sighed .   the ship rose into daylight .  it emerged in the middle of a black sand beach  with the copper dome of the hub behind it .  the sea moved lazily a few metres away .  there was a shudder as the lift platform locked .   now the cubes were spraying foam over three structures of curved tubing which they had bolted to the floor .  the foam congealed into about the right sized hollows for a shand  a kung and a human .      we   ve got a little time until lift off     said kin  and stood up .     has anybody got any questions .  yeah .  i thought you might .  okay  but get in the couches .         you don   t expect me to get us into interspace from the disc surface .     asked marco .     we wouldn   t have a chance .         you did it from kung     said kin  settling into her couch .      kung hasn   t got a damn great dome over the sky .         no .  i don   t expect to flip yet  anyway .  we need the couches for the primary launch .         but who is going to be at the controls .  i can   t reach them from here .         no one is going to be at the controls .  there aren   t any for the launch .  trust me .         no controls and you want me to trust you .         yes .  i want you to trust me .      marco lay down and reached for the couch straps .  silver was already prone .  they lay in silence for a while .   then kin said     marco  can you see that round screen from your couch .         i see it .         it   s radar .  keep an eye on it .  and now  perhaps i owe you an explanation         help  said the screen .   trying not to think about it  kin lifted the occupant out of the chair  and sat down in front of the pleading letters .  keeping the hovering helmet in the top of her eye  she ran her hand over the arm .   nothing happened  except that the screen now read you are kin arad .      that   s       kin   s voice sounded faint in the closeness of the room .  she cleared her throat .     that is correct     she said .     who are you .      we believe you have referred to us as the disc masters  although we call ourselves the committee .      it   s got a nice democratic ring about it .  let me see you .      is that an express wish .      well  i   ve come a long way to meet you .  this is hardly an intimate conversation  you must admit .     kin looked around  looking for doors  hidden cameras .  the walls were blank .   you misunderstand us  we are machines . computers  jago jalo called us  we fail to understand your surprise .      i   m not surprised     lied kin .   then we suggest you sue your face for slander .      why do you need help .  it   s me that needs help .  what has happened to my friends .      they are safely in protective custody .  they were too violent to be allowed to roam loose  of course .  do you wish them to be freed  and for us to provide you with transport to your home world .  if you so order  it will be done .      i can order you .      you sit in the chair .  there is no other incumbent .  you are the chairman .  therefore you can give the orders .  we implore you to do so .      you can build me a ship .      we built a ship for jago jalo .  we assisted him  despite all that he did .  choice does not exist for machines in matters of this nature .  jalo chose to flee the disc rather than learn more about it .   kin considered this carefully .  when she spoke  she spoke slowly .      you will give me a ship  but if i chose to leave the disc you won   t tell me any more about it .      yes .      but you said i could give the orders .      yes .  however  we believe we will shortly experience a slight malfunction in our auditory circuitry .  it may prevent us from hearing any subsequent orders .   kin smiled .     then there   s no choice  is there .  not against blackmail .  tell me about the disc .         kin     said marco urgently .     there   s something on the screen .         it   s about time     replied kin .     don   t worry .         yeah  i remember .  trust you .  it   s bloody big .   what is it .         it   s our launch vehicle .      kin leaned back in the oh so easy chair and stared at the blank screen for a long time .      you   re wearing out     she said .     that   s why the seas are going mad and the climate   s shifting .  i understand that .  the disc is a machine .  machines have a finite life .  that   s why the company builds planets .      planets have a finite life .      a longer one .  they don   t start to squeak on their bearings after half a million years .      you gloat .      no .  i keep thinking of a few hundred million people on a spaceship the size of a world  and then i think of all the things that can go wrong with a ship .  i don   t gloat  i tremble with fear .  and rage .      she stood up and stomped across the room to ease the cramp in her muscles .  it had been a long session  a subterranean travelogue of disc machinery .  the earthquake machines stuck in her memory .  all that ingenuity  to reproduce what any half sized world did naturally .  and the demons     well  at least she   d put a stop to the demons .   there was a click as marco undid his straps and leapt towards the horseshoe panel .  he peered at the screen  then glared out of the cabin .      where the hell is it .  it   s gone off the screen .  what was it  kin .  the blip was bigger than a        whump .  beyond the windows the seashore exploded into a sandstorm .   marco craned his head and looked up .  darkness filled the cabin as the sun was eclipsed .   whump .   marco looked up at talons dropping out of the sky when the impossible bird stooped .  talons big enough to grip a ship .  he made a small noise in his throat and took a dive in the direction of his couch .   whump .  scrabble .  whump .  whumpwhump .  whumpwhump .   the ship creaked as the claws took it gently .  then it bounded upward in a series of bone shaking jerks .   the dome of the hub swung crazily below  and whirled away .  the disc dropped after it  teetering across the sky until it was a blue and ochre wall .  it paused there  then plunged back under the ship to loom for a moment on the other side .  whump .   kin concentrated on the view above  to take her mind off the lurching  jerking universe .  the talons all but covered the roof port  but she got occasional glimpses of the huge white wings  beating now with the slow rhythm of a tide .   sound filled the cabin .  it began in the painful ultrasonic  swooping down the scale like wet fingers being dragged across the windows of the soul .   high above the disc the roc stood on the air and sang .   there would be no more demons .  she could see why there had been demons  demons were an idea that worked  but there would be no more .   the ones kin had met had been almost human compared with some of the things force bred in the quiet green laboratories under the hub .  they policed the disc  haunted the hidden air vents and access shafts to the machinery  chased the venturesome from the rim .  occasionally they kidnapped a new chairman  for the committee .   the chairmen .  kin stared at the blank screen  then glanced up at the hovering direct link helmet over the chair .  she had no intention of trying it for size  and the computers hadn   t pressed her  but they had shown her how it was used .   the computers ran the disc .  they adjusted its tides  circulated its waters  counted its falling sparrows  toiled and spun for the lilies of its fields .  but the disc   s builders had constructed them as servile mechanisms  lest the disc become too mechanical .  a human had to tell them what to do .   in the seventy thousand years of the disc   s history there had been two hundred and eighty chairmen  thrust in terror under the helmet .  it gave them cold new knowledge .   kin said she didn   t believe it .      you couldn   t take a neolithic farmer and turn him into a planetary engineer     she protested .   we could .  the disc builders constructed us cleverly .      you won   t even tell me about the builders .      the screen went blank .   whump .  kin gripped the edges of the couch .  whump .  the roc didn   t fly  it simply bullied its way through the upper air  shovelling it aside with a sneer .   talking was difficult when g forces slapped and banged with a horrible rhythm .  silver managed it with the least discomfort .      i don   t believe it either     she said .     i can see what a device like the disc would need .     whump .     needs a sapient caretaker .  no machines could handle all the problems that might crop .     whump .     might crop up .  but unless the creature was already a technical sophisticate  he would simply become mad .      kin braced herself for the next wingbeat .  it didn   t come .  beyond the window she could see the roc   s wing outstretched  the tips of the huge feathers vibrating in the slipstream .  the bird was starting its glide .   half the disc was spread before the canted cabin .  kin rolled out of her couch and swayed across the trembling deck until she could grasp a bulkhead .   the world was a bowl of jewels flung across the sky .  ahead  wearing the setting sun like the gemstone on a ring  was the rim ocean .   roc slid on down the sky  staring at the sun with terrible bird eyes .  sometimes she shrugged her shoulders to dislodge the ice  which flashed and tumbled as it began the long fall .   kin knelt on the floating platform and watched the microfigures of silver and marco thread their way through the tunnels .   elsewhere disc machines were lurching into action .  she wondered what would have happened if some medieval farmer was chairman now .  could he have helped the computers start the long repair .   she stood up and ordered the platform to the walkway at the rim of the map hall  and hurried up the worn stairs to the interface room .   hallo  said the screen .      you don   t need me     said kin .     i   ve given you all the instructions you need to repair yourself .  it will take you a long time  but you can do it without affecting the biosp     oh boy  the biohemisphere  i suppose     too much .  but you can   t go on like it     not unless you get fresh materials from outside .      we know .  entropy is against us .      you can   t go on cannibalizing old machines for spare parts .  you may last another hundred years  that   s all .      we know .      do you care about the people on the surface .   they are our children .   kin stared at the glowing letters .  then she said softly     tell me about jago jalo .  he must have seemed a godsend .      yes .  we were already aware that the disc was doomed .  in those days we maintained an arrestor screen against meteorites .  it was comparatively easy to extract the residual velocity from his ship .  we watched him bring his smaller ship within the vault of heaven .  unfortunately we could not contact him .  that should have made us suspicious .      you allowed him to land  though .      unfortunately his ship attracted the attention of a roc during the descent .      a roc .      a large bird .             i don   t believe it     said marco .     i see it  but i don   t believe it .  it   s going to take us home  is that it .      below them land flashed past in a dusty blur .  there was a brief impression of surf and then the roc was arrowing out to sea .      didn   t you see the big egg in that garden where you were caged .     said kin weakly .     didn   t you wonder what laid it .  of course it can   t take us home  it   s just a big bird .  i saw the specifications  back in the hub .         it seems a little stupid to say this in the circumstances     said silver     but such a creature could not exist in flesh and blood .  it would collapse under its own weight .         it doesn   t weigh more than five tonnes     said kin .     it   s one of the disc builders    finest constructions .  it   s alive .  it   s got sinews like line cord and its bones are pneumatic .  just tubes filled with gas under pressure .  the computers showed me .  marvellous  isn   t it .         why is it losing height .  we   ll land in the sea     said marco .      yes     said kin .     i should get back into your couch if i were you .         you mean we are going to land in the sea .      marco looked down at the rushing waves .  they were low enough for every crest to be visible .  then he looked at what  on the disc  had to be called the horizon .  the sun was just a red glow  half hidden by strips of cloud  tipping the wave tops with fire .  marco thought .      oh no     he said .     tell me i   m wrong .  tell me you   re not planning to do what i think you are planning to do            if it helps you any     said kin     jago jalo was insane even by the standards of an insane age .      it became obvious .  we had not considered that any race would send its madmen into space .      in a ship like this  only a madman would go .      he came to the hub with a demounted geological laser  he killed the chairman of the time .      you didn   t try to stop him .      we were not instructed to do so .  besides  the man was obviously from a technological culture .  we had to weigh the future of the disc .  he ordered us to build him a ship .  it was not difficult .  we calculated that if we assisted jago jalo back to his home world it would not be long before we had further visitors .  therefore we sent with him one of our spy birds   the ravens  the eyes of god  our beautifully created birds .      then why didn   t you contact us as soon as we arrived .  hell  i   ve had fleas  i   ve nearly been burned alive  i was shoved in a seraglio        we decided to observe you first .  we could not be sure that jalo was an exception .  and then the four armed creature added weight to our suspicions .   kin watched the letters fade .  she said     you know that we can build worlds .  proper worlds .  planets .  we could build a planet for the disc people .  you know it is a fair copy of my home world .      yes .      do you know why .      yes .      will you tell me .      the screen stayed blank for several seconds .  then it was filled with words  so many that the computers had had to reduce the size of the letters .  kin stood up and read   you wish to know about the disc builders .  you wish to know the reasons behind the construction of the disc .  we can tell you .  but it is our only bargaining counter on behalf of our children .  it is possible that you could leave and return to plunder the disc  as jalo had intended .  we could not stop you .  yet we realize that knowledge is a prize you greatly desire .  we will give you knowledge .  you will build a new world for our people .   kin had already been considering it .  it would mean building a g type star within a few light minutes of the disc  unless there was a suitable one that could be moved         we   d need access to disc technology     she said .     teleportation  the force grow vat theories  the lot .      you would have it  of course .      then you will have your new world .  if the company won   t do it  i could float a company of my own with that bait .  i could go to one of the small operators     yes  i   ll do it .      we have a bargain .      just like that .  you don   t need any     well  i guess i can   t give you any sureties     said kin  surprised .   we have observed you .  we estimate there is a    .    per cent chance that you will honour the bargain .  don the helmet .   kin looked up at the padded metal rim above her head .   we trust you .  trust us .  the helmet will link you to certain circuits designed for this situation .  we can give you not information but knowledge  that you will obtain nowhere else in the universe .      the purpose of life is to find things out     said kin doubtfully .   yes .  who would shun knowledge .   kin sighed  reached up  grasped  pulled .   the robots were busy in the centre of the deck .  one of them rolled towards the horseshoe panel  trailing a cable behind it .  the rest were clustered around an oddly bent piece of mirror bright rod .  when kin looked at it her eyes ached .  it seemed to be twisted in ways that normal matter just couldn   t go  which meant she was looking at the heart of a matrix drive .   she was glad     she   d had a horrible thought about what would happen if one didn   t get built .   the robots had also built a proper pilot   s seat in front of the controls .  marco was sitting in it  swearing .      it   ll be like finding a hole in fog     he said .     i hope your tin friend builds good jets .         the hole will show up on the screen     suggested silver .      yeah .  but we   ll be going at a hell of a lick .  kin  are you sure it   s all worked out .      kin smiled .     right down to the disc   s tumbling speed and the rotation of the vault of heaven .  don   t you believe that machines capable of running the disc for seventy thousand years are capable of              threading a needle ten thousand miles away by dropping the thread over a waterfall .  no .  i want a chance to experiment with the jets .         you   ll have it .      the roc   s wingbeats thundered in the night as it wheeled about and skimmed across the dark water .  it dropped the ship  fought frantically for height again  wingtips brushing the waves .   there was a moment of free fall  then a slap as the ship hit .  it bobbed  and spun slowly .   the roc passed across the stars  wings booming  heading back to its secret valleys .  and kin relaxed .  through the hull of the ship there came a new sound  a soft murmur as of distant engines .  the rimfall .   she waited  with the soft padding of the helmet pressing against her closed eyes .  nothing happened .   then she remembered .  it came as a shock  but that dwindled as she took control over the body .  how could she have forgotten .  then she remembered about that  too .  unless one forgot  how could one learn .   she could feel kin somewhere in her mind  a little flask of tastes and textures  senses and experiences .  around her she could experience the disc  and she knew there was danger there .  it would be too easy to lose herself in the sheer exhilarating enjoyment of it .  she turned her mind back to the computers .   you have done well .   that was my task .   i will allow some recollection to kin arad .  she is me  after all .  she will awake knowing something about us .  and she will understand about the disc .   yes .   she reached into the mind within her and made certain amendments .  then  contented  she let herself forget      kin remembered .  the memories were there  cold  hard  real  like shards of ice in the mind .  she recalled the disc .      the disc     she said  her voice flat in the shock of it     is the boot in the coal measure  the coin in the crystal .  the filling in the tooth of the tricera tops .  the secret mark that reveals the maker .  they couldn   t resist it .  they built a perfect universe to specifications  but they couldn   t resist adding the disc out here  hard to find  but a clue .  how do i know .     she shouted .   the screen stayed blank .      i know it .  they weren   t just the disc builders .  they built the lot     the real earth  kung  all the stars .  they laid down our fossils .  we thought maybe the great spindle kings had done that  but the spindle kings never existed .  they were all part of the false strata of the new universe .  we wondered if we   d evolved with the help of the kings .  we never evolved .  we were created  just like we recreate whales and elephants for our colony worlds .      we   re a colony universe .  the builders just moved in and built it  and because everyone needs a history  they gave us a history .  just as we do with the new worlds .  ancient bones .  fabulous monsters .  great spindle kings  wheelers .  and we never realized it .  we did it ourselves  and we never tumbled to it .      then one of them built the disc .  almost as a joke  maybe .  certainly for no important reason .  an exercise in ingenuity .  it must have been an afterthought  a collection of neat ideas  put together after the main work was done .      seventy thousand years .  that   s the age of the universe     it   s hardly got its paint scratched .  we thought it was four billion years old .  the evidence said that it was  and we believed in the evidence .      she leaned back .  she could still feel the memories there  like old facts forgotten until now .  she probed them gingerly  as a tongue explores a hollow tooth .      old .  intelligent .  divorced from matter .  that   s how i remember the builders .  each one bigger than we can imagine  or maybe smaller  because     because there would be nothing to measure  except the ego .  i said old .  even their age couldn   t be measured  because until they built the universe there was no time .  am i right .      we cannot answer that question briefly .  we know nothing of them other than that which they told us .      what do you know of them  then .      before them  there was only probability .  they imposed a pattern on that probability .      why .      your company builds worlds .  there is no real need .  your natal world is not over populated .  why .      once we were overpopulated .  and we found that the more people there were  the more they were the same .  it was the only way we could survive .  people had always dreamed of a unified world .  we thought it would be a richer one .  it wasn   t .  it meant that the eskimo got educated and learned cost accountancy  but it didn   t mean that the german learned to hunt whales with a spear .  it meant everyone learned how to press buttons  and no one remembered how to dive for pearls .      then the mindquakes got us .  that would have been     yes  a couple of years after the terminus probes .  people just died .  died in their billions  too  their minds just kind of folded in on themselves .      afterwards  we had to start over .  at least we had all the toys of the spindle kings to play with  and we could spread out     we had to spread out  after the quakes .  they made us look hard for mental elbow room  new worlds where we could flee and learn the forgotten ways .  we had built robots to remember some of them for us .      we thought it was natural  a trodden path .  you see  we had the example of the spindle kings .  we thought that any intelligent species filled its home world until the sheer mind pressure started killing them off  and then the survivors embarked on interstellar colonization  whatever way they rationalized it  the real reason would be a fierce desire to escape from other people .  and then  since usable worlds aren   t that common  they   d start to learn planetary engineering .  oh  we had it all carefully calculated .  race after race  fruiting and bursting across the evolving galaxy  creating new worlds before they died and in the process making new seed beds for new races .  i wrote a book about it  called continuous creation  haha .      now you can write the second edition .      it   ll be a bit short  i   m damn sure about that .  what can i say .     the lights in the sky are scenery    .      why not .      you haven   t told me why the     builders built .      the words flashed on to the screen immediately  as if the computers had been preparing them .   humans are inquisitive .  that is a function of their humanity .  the beings that built this universe did so because it was unthinkable that they should not .  creation is not a thing that gods do  it is something that they are .      and afterwards .  what did they do next .      there was white water around the ship .  kin could see a little tree shrouded island beyond one port  a humped black shape in the twilight  and could feel the hull bouncing over the water .   the sky wheeled .  there was no jolt  it was simply that now the floor was just a wall .  foam covered the ports for a moment  and then kin could look     down .   the rimfall hung before them  looking exactly like a luminous white road .  marco in the pilot   s seat was outlined against it  and kin could see that he had instinctively braced himself with his feet scrabbling for a hold .   down  way down  there was a ball of fire in the sky .  the disc was in darkness now  but the little orbiting sun was giving a brief day to the face of the waterfall .  while kin watched  it climbed above her and disappeared as the ship overtook it .   later there was a cloud at the limit of vision .  it stayed there for a while  then raced up the glittering stream at a speed that made kin flinch .  there was the faintest of lurches and a second   s darkness as the ship left the water behind at the molecule sieve  and then there were stars .   there was a long hiss from marco .  it may have been a sigh of relief .   silver said     i would have felt happier if the computers had been able to arrange a more conventional launching  but i must admit that it had style .         from their point of view that was the most efficient way     said kin .  the sky spun again as marco turned the ship so that    down    was where long tradition had always put it  in the region of the feet .   silver unfastened her couch straps  then looked across at kin .     we built the universe  didn   t we     she said .      not us precisely  these lumps of bone and brain  but the thing in us that makes us what we are .  the thing that dreams while the rest of us is asleep .      kin smiled .     the computers wouldn   t tell     she said .     but yes  you   re right .  i think the computers had a certain extra function  they could suppress all the mental static so the     oh hell  why avoid the word .      so that the god inside could surface just for a while and perform .  that   s why practically anyone could be the disc master .  if jago jalo had tried the helmet  he   d be there still .         no one will believe you     said marco  without turning his head .      i   m not sure that would be a tragedy     said kin .     the disc was put there as a hoax  or a hint .  no one has to believe it .  we   ll build a planet for the disc people and transfer them  and that is the thing that needs to be done .      the challenge warmed her .  the building of a new earth  so carefully done that the disc people could be transferred and not know it .  there   d have to be new continents designed  and the disc people would have to be put into a freeze sleep until some of their number had bred enough to populate them .  it could take a thousand years .  there   d be a whole solar system to drag into place  great planets around far stars to be ringed in some vast fields and flipped across light years .   buffaloes to be designed .  life wouldn   t be boring .   would what the computers could tell them pay for it .  it would .   they slept and they ate  while the ship dipped under the monstrous shadow in the sky .  the little toiling sun shed no light on the blackness as it swung across it .   presently the far edge of the rimfall began to grow larger .  marco slid back into his seat and spoke to the ship   s little brain .      okay     he reported     major burn coming up .  this is where we say goodbye  so get into those couches .  the committee are timing this one for us .      it took ten minutes of slight discomfort  listening to the faint roar from the outrigger jets .  kin heard a sigh from marco   s couch as the engines shut off .      that   s it     he said .     now we hit the hole  or we miss the hole .  i never thought i   d have to worry about running into the wall of the universe .      the rimfall raced past a few thousand miles away  phosphorescent in the light of the full moon .  even marco took a deep breath as the ship rose above the edge of the disc and plunged towards the sky .   the disc was a design of white and black  a silver and ebony coin floating under a sky wild with stars .   the stars were getting nearer .  the moon became a pearl hovering over the disc  and the stars were definitely getting nearer .   the hole that jago jalo had cut in the vault of heaven had been big enough for the ring ship to go through  and this one was much smaller .  but it would be approaching it at a low angle .   the computers had told marco that the hole would be wide enough .  they had told kin the same  but had added their estimate of the distance to spare .  kin hadn   t dared pass it on to marco .  the minimum clearance was a little less than a metre .   she found she was staring ahead  searching the sky .  the other two were doing the same .  stars were drifting overhead .  while kin watched  their silent  snowflake movement became a brisk race .   then they were a blur .  there was the briefest impression of something around the ship as a star swelled  blazed and disappeared .  a slight shudder marked the demise of one of the outrigger jets  knocked off against the edge of the sky .   then there were stars again  deceptively similar  and the ship was dropping into the gulf .   she could hear marco breathing noisily .  silver was humming a tune in a rolling baritone .   kin watched the stars she knew were only seventy thousand years old  marginally older than their cousins hanging from the vault of heaven .  stars were just lights in the sky  but bigger skies demanded bigger stars .   kin thought about the second edition .  the ship fell onwards  into the scenery .       the end
