terry pratchett  guards .  guards .       a novel of discworld        dedication      they may be called the palace guard  the city guard  or the patrol .  whatever the name  their purpose in any work of heroic fantasy is identical  it is  round about chapter three  or ten minutes into the film  to rush into the room  attack the hero one at a time  and be slaughtered .  no one ever asks them if they wanted to .      this book is dedicated to those fine men .      and also to mike harrison  mary gentle  neil gaiman and all the others who assisted with and laughed at the idea of l space  too bad we never used schr  dinger   s paperback         this is where the dragons went .   they lie     not dead  not asleep .  not waiting  because waiting implies expectation .  possibly the word we   re looking for here is        dormant .   and although the space they occupy isn   t like normal space  nevertheless they are packed in tightly .  not a cubic inch there but is filled by a claw  a talon  a scale  the tip of a tail  so the effect is like one of those trick drawings and your eyeballs eventually realize that the space between each dragon is  in fact  another dragon .   they could put you in mind of a can of sardines  if you thought sardines were huge and scaly and proud and arrogant .   and presumably  somewhere  there   s the key .       in another space entirely  it was early morning in ankh morpork oldest and greatest and grubbiest of cities .  a thin drizzle dripped from the gray sky and punctuated the river mist that coiled among the streets .  rats of various species went about their nocturnal occasions .  under night   s damp cloak assassins assassinated  thieves thieved  hussies hustled .  and so on .   and drunken captain vimes of the night watch staggered slowly down the street  folded gently into the gutter outside the watch house and lay there while  above him  strange letters made of light sizzled in the damp and changed color     the city wasa  wasa  wasa wossname .  thing .  woman .  thass what it was .  woman .  roaring  ancient  centuries old .  strung you along  let you fall in thingy  love  with her  then kicked you inna  inna  thingy .  thingy  in your mouth .  tongue .  tonsils .  teeth .  that   s what it  she  did .  she wasa   thing  you know  lady dog .  puppy .  hen .  bitch .  and then you hated her and  and just when you thought you   d got her  it  out of your  your  whatever  then she opened her great booming rotten heart to you  caught you off bal  bal  bal  thing .  ance .  yeah .  thassit .  never knew where where you stood .  lay .  only thing you were sure of  you couldn   t let her go .  because  because she was yours  all you had  even in her gutters         damp darkness shrouded the venerable buildings of unseen university  premier college of wizardry .  the only light was a faint octarine flicker from the tiny windows of the new high energy magic building  where keen edged minds were probing the very fabric of the universe  whether it liked it or not .   and there was light  of course  in the library .   the library was the greatest assemblage of magical texts anywhere in the multiverse .  thousands of volumes of occult lore weighted its shelves .   it was said that  since vast amounts of magic can seriously distort the mundane world  the library did not obey the normal rules of space and time .  it was said that it went on forever .  it was said that you could wander for days among the distant shelves  that there were lost tribes of research students somewhere in there  that strange things lurked in forgotten alcoves and were preyed on by other things that were even stranger .    wise students in search of more distant volumes took care to leave chalk marks on the shelves as they roamed deeper into the fusty darkness  and told friends to come looking for them if they weren   t back by supper .   and  because magic can only loosely be bound  the library books themselves were more than mere pulped wood and paper .   raw magic crackled from their spines  earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for that very purpose .  faint traceries of blue fire crawled across the bookcases and there was a sound  a papery whispering  such as might come from a colony of roosting starlings .  in the silence of the night the books talked to one another .   there was also the sound of someone snoring .   the light from the shelves didn   t so much illuminate as highlight the darkness  but by its violet flicker a watcher might just have identified an ancient and battered desk right under the central dome .   the snoring was coming from underneath it  where a piece of tattered blanket barely covered what looked like a heap of sandbags but was in fact an adult male orangutan .   it was the librarian .   not many people these days remarked upon the fact that he was an ape .  the change had been brought about by a magical accident  always a possibility where so many powerful books are kept together  and he was considered to have got off lightly .  after all  he was still basically the same shape .  and he had been allowed to keep his job  which he was rather good at  although    allowed    is not really the right word .  it was the way he could roll his upper lip back to reveal more incredibly yellow teeth than any other mouth the university council had ever seen before that somehow made sure the matter was never really raised .   but now there was another sound  the alien sound of a door creaking open .  footsteps padded across the floor and disappeared among the clustering shelves .  the books rustled indignantly  and some of the larger grimoires rattled their chains .   the librarian slept on  lulled by the whispering of the rain .   in the embrace of his gutter  half a mile away  captain vimes of the night watch opened his mouth and started to sing .       now a black robed figure scurried through the midnight streets  ducking from doorway to doorway  and reached a grim and forbidding portal .  no mere doorway got that grim without effort  one felt .  it looked as though the architect had been called in and given specific instructions .  we want something eldritch in dark oak  he   d been told .  so put an unpleasant gargoyle thing over the archway  give it a slam like the footfall of a giant and make it clear to everyone  in fact  that this isn   t the kind of door that goes    ding dong    when you press the bell .   the figure rapped a complex code on the dark woodwork .  a tiny barred hatch opened and one suspicious eye peered out .         the significant owl hoots in the night        said the visitor  trying to wring the rainwater out of its robe .         yet many gray lords go sadly to the masterless men        intoned a voice on the other side of the grille .         hooray  hooray for the spinster   s sister   s daughter        countered the dripping figure .         to the axeman  all supplicants are the same height .               yet verily  the rose is within the thorn .               the good mother makes bean soup for the errant boy        said the voice behind the door .   there was a pause  broken only by the sound of the rain .  then the visitor said     what .            the good mother makes bean soup for the errant boy .         there was another  longer pause .  then the damp figure said     are you sure the ill built tower doesn   t tremble mightily at a butterfly   s passage .         nope .  bean soup it is .  i   m sorry .      the rain hissed down relentlessly in the embarrassed silence .      what about the cag  d whale .     said the soaking visitor  trying to squeeze into what little shelter the dread portal offered .      what about it .         it should know nothing of the mighty deeps  if you must know .         oh  the cag  d whale .  you want the elucidated brethren of the ebon night .  three doors down .         who   re you  then .         we   re the illuminated and ancient brethren of ee .         i thought you met over in treacle street     said the damp man  after a while .      yeah  well .  you know how it is .  the fretwork club have the room tuesdays .  there was a bit of a mix up .         oh .  well  thanks anyway .         my pleasure .     the little door slammed shut .   the robed figure glared at it for a moment  and then splashed further down the street .  there was indeed another portal there .  the builder hadn   t bothered to change the design much .   he knocked .  the little barred hatch shot back .      yes .         look     the significant owl hoots in the night     all right .            yet many gray lords go sadly to the masterless men .               hooray  hooray for the spinster   s sister   s daughter     okay .            to the axeman  all supplicants are the same height .               yet verily  the rose is within the thorn .     it   s pissing down out here .  you do know that  don   t you .         yes     said the voice  in the tones of one who indeed does know it  and is not the one standing in it .   the visitor sighed .         the cag  d whale knows nothing of the mighty deeps        he said .     if it makes you any happier .            the ill built tower trembles mightily at a butterfly   s passage .         the supplicant grabbed the bars of the window  pulled himself up to it  and hissed     now let us in  i   m soaked .      there was another damp pause .      these deeps   did you say mighty or nightly .         mighty  i said .  mighty deeps .  on account of being  you know  deep .  it   s me  brother fingers .         it sounded like nightly to me     said the invisible doorkeeper cautiously .      look  do you want the bloody book or not .  i don   t have to do this .  i could be at home in bed .         you sure it was mighty .         listen  i know how deep the bloody deeps are all right     said brother fingers urgently .     i knew how mighty they were when you were a perishing neophyte .  now will you open this door .         well   all right .      there was the sound of bolts sliding back .  then the voice said     would you mind giving it a push .  the door of knowledge through which the untutored may not pass sticks something wicked in the damp .      brother fingers put his shoulder to it  forced his way through  gave brother doorkeeper a dirty look  and hurried within .   the others were waiting for him in the inner sanctum  standing around with the sheepish air of people not normally accustomed to wearing sinister hooded black robes .  the supreme grand master nodded at him .      brother fingers  isn   t it .         yes  supreme grand master .         do you have that which you were sent to get .      brother fingers pulled a package from under his robe .      just where i said it would be     he said .     no problem .         well done  brother fingers .         thank you  supreme grand master .      the supreme grand master rapped his gavel for attention .  the room shuffled into some sort of circle .      i call the unique and supreme lodge of the elucidated brethren to order     he intoned .     is the door of knowledge sealed fast against heretics and knowlessmen .         stuck solid     said brother doorkeeper .     it   s the damp .  i   ll bring my plane in next week  soon have it           all right  all right     said the supreme grand master testily .     just a yes would have done .  is the triple circle well and truly traced .  art all here who art here .  and it be well for an knowlessman that he should not be here  for he would be taken from this place and his gaskin slit  his moules shown to the four winds  his welchet torn asunder with many hooks and his figgin placed upon a spike yes what is it .         sorry  did you say elucidated brethren .      the supreme grand master glared at the solitary figure with its hand up .      yea  the elucidated brethren  guardian of the sacred knowledge since a time no man may wot of           last february     said brother doorkeeper helpfully .  the supreme grand master felt that brother doorkeeper had never really got the hang of things .      sorry .  sorry .  sorry     said the worried figure .     wrong society  i   m afraid .  must have taken a wrong turning .  i   ll just be going  if you   ll excuse me           and his figgin placed upon a spike     repeated the supreme grand master pointedly  against a background of damp wooden noises as brother doorkeeper tried to get the dread portal open .     are we quite finished .  any more knowlessmen happened to drop in on their way somewhere else .     he added with bitter sarcasm .     right .  fine .  so glad .  i suppose it   s too much to ask if the four watchtowers are secured .  oh  good .  and the trouser of sanctity  has anyone bothered to shrive it .  oh  you did .  properly .  i   ll check  you know   all right .  and have the windows been fastened with the red cords of intellect  in accordance with ancient prescription .  good .  now perhaps we can get on with it .      with the slightly miffed air of one who has run their finger along a daughter in law   s top shelf and found against all expectation that it is sparkling clean  the grand master got on with it .   what a shower  he told himself .  a bunch of incompetents no other secret society would touch with a ten foot sceptre of authority .  the sort to dislocate their fingers with even the simplest secret handshake .   but incompetents with possibilities  nevertheless .  let the other societies take the skilled  the hopefuls  the ambitious  the self confident .  he   d take the whining resentful ones  the ones with a bellyful of spite and bile  the ones who knew they could make it big if only they   d been given the chance .  give him the ones in which the floods of venom and vindictiveness were dammed up behind thin walls of ineptitude and low grade paranoia .   and stupidity  too .  they   ve all sworn the oath  he thought  but not a man jack of    em has even asked what a figgin is .      brethren     he said .     tonight we have matters of profound importance to discuss .  the good governance  nay  the very future of ankh morpork lies in our hands .      they leaned closer .  the supreme grand master felt the beginnings of the old thrill of power .  they were hanging on his words .  this was a feeling worth dressing up in bloody silly robes for .      do we not well know that the city is in thrall to corrupt men  who wax fat on their ill gotten gains  while better men are held back and forced into virtual servitude .         we certainly do .     said brother doorkeeper vehemently  when they   d had time to translate this mentally .     only last week  down at the bakers    guild  i tried to point out to master critchley that        it wasn   t eye contact  because the supreme grand master had made sure the brethren   s hoods shrouded their faces in mystic darkness  but nevertheless he managed to silence brother doorkeeper by dint of sheer outraged silence .      yet it was not always thus     the supreme grand master continued .     there was once a golden age  when those worthy of command and respect were justly rewarded .  an age when ankh morpork wasn   t simply a big city but a great one .  an age of chivalry .  an age when   yes  brother watchtower .      a bulky robed figure lowered its hand .     are you talking about when we had kings .         well done  brother     said the supreme grand master  slightly annoyed at this unusual evidence of intelligence .     and           but that was all sorted out hundreds of years ago     said brother watchtower .     wasn   t there this great battle  or something .  and since then we   ve just had the ruling lords  like the patrician .         yes  very good  brother watchtower .         there aren   t any more kings  is the point i   m trying to make     said brother watchtower helpfully .      as brother watchtower says  the line of           it was you talking about chivalry that give me the clue     said brother watchtower .      quite so  and           you get that with kings  chivalry     said brother watchtower happily .     and knights .  and they used to have these           however     said the supreme grand master sharply     it may well be that the line of the kings of ankh is not as defunct as hitherto imagined  and that progeny of the line exists even now .  thus my researches among the ancient scrolls do indicate .      he stood back expectantly .  there didn   t seem to be the effect he   d expected  however .  probably they can manage    defunct     he thought  but i ought to have drawn the line at    progeny .      brother watchtower had his hand up again .      yes .         you saying there   s some sort of heir to the throne hanging around somewhere .     said brother watchtower .      this may be the case  yes .         yeah .  they do that  you know     said brother watchtower knowledgeably .     happens all the time .  you read about it .  skions  they   re called .  they go lurking around in the distant wildernesses for ages  handing down the secret sword and birthmark and so forth from generation to generation .  then just when the old kingdom needs them  they turn up and turf out any usurpers that happen to be around .  and then there   s general rejoicing .      the supreme grand master felt his own mouth drop open .  he hadn   t expected it to be as easy as this .      yes  all right     said a figure the supreme grand master knew to be brother plasterer .     but so what .  let   s say a skion turns up  walks up to the patrician  says    what ho  i   m king  here   s the birthmark as per spec  now bugger off .     what   s he got then .  life expectancy of maybe two minutes  that   s what .         you don   t listen     said brother watchtower .     the thing is  the skion has to arrive when the kingdom is threatened  doesn   t he .  then everyone can see  right .  then he gets carried off to the palace  cures a few people  announces a half holiday  hands around a bit of treasure  and bob   s your uncle .         he has to marry a princess  too     said brother doorkeeper .     on account of him being a swineherd .      they looked at him .      who said anything about him being a swineherd .     said brother watchtower .     i never said he was a swineherd .  what   s this about swineherds .         he   s got a point  though     said brother plasterer .     he   s generally a swineherd or a forester or similar  your basic skion .  it   s to do with being in wossname .  cognito .  they   ve got to appear to be of  you know  humble origins .         nothing special about humble origins     said a very small brother  who seemed to consist entirely of a little perambulatory black robe with halitosis .     i   ve got lots of humble origins .  in my family we thought swineherding was a posh job .         but your family doesn   t have the blood of kings  brother dunnykin     said brother plasterer .      we might of     said brother dunnykin sulkily .      right  then     said brother watchtower grudgingly .     fair enough .  but at the essential moment  see  your genuine kings throw back their cloak and say    lo .     and their essential kingnessness shines through .         how  exactly .     said brother doorkeeper .         might of got the blood of kings     muttered brother dunnykin .     got no right saying i might not have got the blood of           look  it just does  okay .  you just know it when you see it .         but before that they   ve got to save the kingdom     said brother plasterer .      oh  yes     said brother watchtower heavily .     that   s the main thing  is that .         what from  then .            got as much right as anyone to might have the blood of kings           the patrician .     said brother doorkeeper .   brother watchtower  as the sudden authority on the ways of royalty  shook his head .      i dunno that the patrician is a threat  exactly     he said .     he   s not your actual tyrant  as such .  not as bad as some we   ve had .  i mean  he doesn   t actually oppress .         i get oppressed all the time     said brother doorkeeper .     master critchley  where i work  he oppresses me morning  noon and night  shouting at me and everything .  and the woman in the vegetable shop  she oppresses me all the time .         that   s right     said brother plasterer .     my landlord oppresses me something wicked .  banging on the door and going on and on about all the rent i allegedly owe  which is a total lie .  and the people next door oppress me all night long .  i tell them  i work all day  a man   s got to have some time to learn to play the tuba .  that   s oppression  that is .  if i   m not under the heel of the oppressor  i don   t know who is .         put like that       said brother watchtower slowly      i reckon my brother in law is oppressing me all the time with having this new horse and buggy he   s been and bought .  i haven   t got one .  i mean  where   s the justice in that .  i bet a king wouldn   t let that sort of oppression go on  people   s wives oppressing    em with why haven   t they got a new coach like our rodney and that .      the supreme grand master listened to this with a slightly lightheaded feeling .  it was as if he   d known that there were such things as avalanches  but had never dreamed when he dropped the little snowball on top of the mountain that it could lead to such astonishing results .  he was hardly having to egg them on at all .      i bet a king   d have something to say about landlords     said brother plasterer .      and he   d outlaw people with showy coaches     said brother watchtower .     probably bought with stolen money  too  i reckon .         i think     said the supreme grand master  tweaking things a little     that a wise king would only  as it were  outlaw showy coaches for the undeserving .      there was a thoughtful pause in the conversation as the assembled brethren mentally divided the universe into the deserving and the undeserving  and put themselves on the appropriate side .      it   d be only fair     said brother watchtower slowly .     but brother plasterer was right  really .  i can   t see a skion manifesting his destiny just because brother doorkeeper thinks the woman in the vegetable shop keeps giving him funny looks .  no offense .         and bloody short weight     said brother doorkeeper .     and she           yes  yes  yes     said the supreme grand master .     truly the right thinking folk of ankh morpork are beneath the heel of the oppressors .  however  a king generally reveals himself in rather more dramatic circumstances .  like a war  for example .      things were going well .  surely  for all their self centered stupidity  one of them would be bright enough to make the suggestion .      there used to be some old prophecy or something     said brother plasterer .     my grandad told me .     his eyes glazed with the effort of dramatic recall .        yea  the king will come bringing law and justice  and know nothing but the truth  and protect and serve the people with his sword .     you don   t all have to look at me like that  i didn   t make it up .         oh  we all know that one .  and a fat lot of good that   d be     said brother watchtower .     i mean  what does he do  ride in with law and truth and so on like the four horse men of the apocralypse .  hallo everyone     he squeaked     i   m the king  and that   s truth over there  watering his horse .  not very practical  is it .  nah .  you can   t trust old legends .         why not .     said brother dunnykin  in a peeved voice .         cos they   re legendary .  that   s how you can tell     said brother watchtower .      sleeping princesses is a good one     said brother plasterer .     only a king can wake    em up .         don   t be daft     said brother watchtower severely .     we haven   t got a king  so we can   t have princesses .  stands to reason .         of course  in the old days it was easy     said brother doorkeeper happily .      why .         he just had to kill a dragon .      the supreme grand master clapped his hands together and offered a silent prayer to any god who happened to be listening .  he   d been right about these people .  sooner or later their rambling little minds took them where you wanted them to go .      what an interesting idea     he trilled .      wouldn   t work     said brother watchtower dourly .     there ain   t no big dragons now .         there could be .      the supreme grand master cracked his knuckles .      come again .     said brother watchtower .      i said there could be .      there was a nervous laugh from the depths of brother watchtower   s cowl .      what  the real thing .  great big scales and wings .         yes .         breath like a blast furnace .         yes .         them big claw things on its feet .         talons .  oh  yes .  as many as you want .         what do you mean  as many as i want .         i would hope it   s self explanatory  brother watchtower .  if you want dragons  you can have dragons .  you can bring a dragon here .  now .  into the city .         me .         all of you .  i mean us     said the supreme grand master .   brother watchtower hesitated .     well  i don   t know if that   s a very good           and it would obey your every command .      that stopped them .  that pulled them up .  that dropped in front of their weaselly little minds like a lump of meat in a dog pound .      can you just repeat that .     said brother plasterer slowly .      you can control it .  you can make it do whatever you want .         what .  a real dragon .      the supreme grand master   s eyes rolled in the privacy of his hood .      yes  a real one .  not a little pet swamp dragon .  the genuine article .         but i thought they were  you know   miffs .      the supreme grand master leaned forward .      they were myths and they were real     he said loudly .     both a wave and a particle .         you   ve lost me there     said brother plasterer .      i will demonstrate  then .  the book please  brother fingers .  thank you .  brethren  i must tell you that when i was undergoing my tuition by the secret masters           the what  supreme grand master .     said brother plasterer .      why don   t you listen .  you never listen .  he said the secret masters .     said brother watchtower .     you know  the venerable sages what live on some mountain and secretly run everything and taught him all this lore and that  and can walk on fires and that .  he told us last week .  he   s going to teach us  aren   t you  supreme grand master     he finished obsequiously .      oh  the secret masters     said brother plasterer .     sorry .  it   s these mystic hoods .  sorry .  secret .  i remember .      but when i rule the city  the supreme grand master said to himself  there is going to be none of this .  i shall form a new secret society of keen minded and intelligent men  although not too intelligent of course  not too intelligent .  and we will overthrow the cold tyrant and we will usher in a new age of enlightenment and fraternity and humanism and ankh morpork will become a utopia and people like brother plasterer will be roasted over slow fires if i have any say in the matter  which i will .  and his figgin .       when i was  as i said  undergoing my tuition by the secret masters       he continued .      that was where they told you you had to walk on rice paper  wasn   t it     said brother watchtower conversationally .     i always thought that was a good bit .  i   ve been saving it off the bottom of my macaroons ever since .  amazing  really .  i can walk on it no trouble .  shows what being in a proper secret society does for you  does that .      when he is on the griddle  the supreme grand master thought  brother plasterer will not be lonely .      your footfalls on the road of enlightenment are an example to us all  brother watchtower     he said .     if i may continue  however   among the many secrets              from the heart of being       said brother watchtower approvingly .         from the heart  as brother watchtower says  of being  was the current location of the noble dragons .  the belief that they died out is quite wrong .  they simply found a new evolutionary niche .  and they can be summoned from it .  this book       he flourished it      gives specific instructions .         it   s just in a book .     said brother plasterer .      no ordinary book .  this is the only copy .  it has taken me years to track it down     said the supreme grand master .     it   s in the handwriting of tubal de malachite  a great student of dragon lore .  his actual handwriting .  he summoned dragons of all sizes .  and so can you .      there was another long  awkward silence .      um     said brother doorkeeper .      sounds a bit like  you know   magic to me     said brother watchtower  in the nervous tone of the man who has spotted which cup the pea is hidden under but doesn   t like to say .     i mean  not wishing to question your supreme wisdomship and that  but   well   you know   magic        his voice trailed off .      yeah     said brother plasterer uncomfortably .      it   s  er  the wizards  see     said brother fingers .     you prob   ly dint know this  when you was banged up with them venerable herberts on their mountain  but the wizards around here come down on you like a ton of bricks if they catches you doin    anything like that .         demarcation  they call it     said brother plasterer .     like  i don   t go around fiddling with the mystic interleaved wossnames of causality  and they don   t do any plastering .         i fail to see the problem     said the supreme grand master .  in fact  he saw it all too clearly .  this was the last hurdle .  help their tiny little minds over this  and he held the world in the palm of his hand .  their stupefyingly unintelligent self interest hadn   t let him down so far  surely it couldn   t fail him now     the brethren shuffled uneasily .  then brother dunnykin spoke .      huh .  wizards .  what do they know about a day   s work .      the supreme grand master breathed deeply .  ah     the air of mean minded resentfulness thickened noticeably .      nothing  and that   s a fact     said brother fingers .     goin    around with their noses in the air  too good for the likes a   us .  i used to see    em when i worked up the university .  backsides a mile wide  i   m telling you .  catch    em doing a job of honest toil .         like thieving  you mean .     said brother watchtower  who had never liked brother fingers much .      o   course  they tell you     brother fingers went on  pointedly ignoring the comment     that you shouldn   t go around doin    magic on account of only them knowin    about not disturbin    the universal harmony and whatnot .  load of rubbish  in my opinion .         we ell     said brother plasterer     i dunno  really .  i mean  you get the mix wrong  you just got a lot of damp plaster around your ankles .  but you get a bit of magic wrong  and they say ghastly things comes out the woodwork and stitches you right up .         yeah  but it   s the wizards that say that     said brother watchtower thoughtfully .     never could stand them myself  to tell you the truth .  could be they   re onto a good thing and don   t want the rest of us to find out .  it   s only waving your arms and chanting  when all   s said and done .      the brethren considered this .  it sounded plausible .  if they were onto a good thing  they certainly wouldn   t want anyone else muscling in .   the supreme grand master decided that the time was ripe .      then we are agreed  brethren .  you are prepared to practice magic .         oh  practice     said brother plasterer  relieved .     i don   t mind practicing .  so long as we don   t have to do it for real        the supreme grand master thumped the book .      i mean carry out real spells .  put the city back on the right lines .  summon a dragon .     he shouted .   they took a step back .  then brother doorkeeper said     and then  if we get this dragon  the rightful king   ll turn up  just like that .         yes .     said the supreme grand master .      i can see that     said brother watchtower supportively .     stands to reason .  because of destiny and the gnomic workings of fate .      there was a moment   s hesitation  and then a general nodding of cowls .  only brother plasterer looked vaguely unhappy .      we ell     he said .     it won   t get out of hand  will it .         i assure you  brother plasterer  that you can give it up any time you like     said the supreme grand master smoothly .      well   all right     said the reluctant brother .     just for a bit  then .  could we get it to stay here long enough to burn down  for example  any oppressive vegetable shops .      ah     he   d won .  there   d be dragons again .  and a king again .  not like the old kings .  a king who would do what he was told .      that     said the supreme grand master     depends on how much help you can be .  we shall need  initially  any items of magic you can bring        it might not be a good idea to let them see that the last half of de malachite   s book was a charred lump .  the man was clearly not up to it .   he could do a lot better .  and absolutely no one would be able to stop him .   thunder rolled         it is said that the gods play games with the lives of men .  but what games  and why  and the identities of the actual pawns  and what the game is  and what the rules are   who knows .   best not to speculate .   thunder rolled     it rolled a six .       now pull back briefly from the dripping streets of ankh morpork pan across the morning mists of the disc  and focus in again on a young man heading for the city with all the openness  sincerity and innocence of purpose of an iceberg drifting into a major shipping lane .   the young man is called carrot .  this is not because of his hair  which his father has always clipped short for reasons of hygiene .  it is because of his shape .   it is the kind of tapering shape a boy gets through clean living  healthy eating  and good mountain air in huge lungfuls .  when he flexes his shoulder muscles  other muscles have to move out of the way first .   he is also bearing a sword presented to him in mysterious circumstances .  very mysterious circumstances .  surprisingly  therefore  there is something very unexpected about this sword .  it isn   t magical .  it hasn   t got a name .  when you wield it you don   t get a feeling of power  you just get blisters  you could believe it was a sword that had been used so much that it had ceased to be anything other than a quintessential sword  a long piece of metal with very sharp edges .  and it hasn   t got destiny written all over it .   it   s practically unique  in fact .       thunder rolled .   the gutters of the city gurgled softly as the detritus of the night was carried along  in some cases protesting feebly .   when it came to the recumbent figure of captain vimes  the water diverted and flowed around him in two streams .  vimes opened his eyes .  there was a moment of empty peace before memory hit him like a shovel .   it had been a bad day for the watch .  there had been the funeral of herbert gaskin  for one thing .  poor old gaskin .  he had broken one of the fundamental rules of being a guard .  it wasn   t the sort of rule that someone like gaskin could break twice .  and so he   d been lowered into the sodden ground with the rain drumming on his coffin and no one present to mourn him but the three surviving members of the night watch  the most despised group of men in the entire city .  sergeant colon had been in tears .  poor old gaskin .   poor old vimes  vimes thought .   poor old vimes  here in gutter .  but that   s where he started .  poor old vimes  with the water swirling in under breastplate .  poor old vimes  watching rest of gutter   s contents ooze by .  prob   ly even poor old gaskin has got better view now  he thought .   lessee   he   d gone off after the funeral and got drunk .  no  not drunk  another word  ended with    er .     drunker  that was it .  because world all twisted up and wrong  like distorted glass  only came back into focus if you looked at it through bottom of bottle .   something else now  what was it .   oh  yes .  night time .  time for duty .  not for gaskin  though .  have to get new fellow .  new fellow coming anyway  wasn   t that it .  some stick from the hicks .  written letter .  some tick from the shicks     vimes gave up  and slumped back .  the gutter continued to swirl .   overhead  the lighted letters fizzed and flickered in the rain .       it wasn   t only the fresh mountain air that had given carrot his huge physique .  being brought up in a gold mine run by dwarfs and working a twelve hour day hauling wagons to the surface must have helped .   he walked with a stoop .  what will do that is being brought up in a gold mine run by dwarfs who thought that five feet was a good height for a ceiling .   he   d always known he was different .  more bruised for one thing .  and then one day his father had come up to him or  rather  come up to his waist  and told him that he was not  in fact  as he had always believed  a dwarf .   it   s a terrible thing to be nearly sixteen and the wrong species .      we didn   t like to say so before  son     said his father .     we thought you   d grow out of it  see .         grow out of what .     said carrot .      growing .  but now your mother thinks  that is  we both think  it   s time you went out among your own kind .  i mean  it   s not fair  keeping you cooped up here without company of your own height .     his father twiddled a loose rivet on his helmet  a sure sign that he was worried .     er     he added .      but you   re my kind .     said carrot desperately .      in a manner of speaking  yes     said his father .     in another manner of speaking  which is a rather more precise and accurate manner of speaking  no .  it   s all this genetics business  you see .  so it might be a very good idea if you were to go out and see something of the world .         what  for good .         oh  no .  no .  of course not .  come back and visit whenever you like .  but  well  a lad your age  stuck down here   it   s not right .  you know .  i mean .  not a child anymore .  having to shuffle around on your knees most of the time  and everything .  it   s not right .         what is my own kind  then .     said carrot  bewildered .   the old dwarf took a deep breath .     you   re human     he said .      what  like mr .  varneshi .     mr .  varneshi drove an ox cart up the mountain trails once a week  to trade things for gold .     one of the big people .         you   re six foot six  lad .  he   s only five foot .     the dwarf twiddled the loose rivet again .     you see how it is .         yes  but   but maybe i   m just tall for my height     said carrot desperately .     after all  if you can have short humans  can   t you have tall dwarfs .      his father patted him companionably on the back of the knees .      you   ve got to face facts  boy .  you   d be much more at home up on the surface .  it   s in your blood .  the roof isn   t so low  either .     you can   t keep knocking yourself out on the sky  he told himself .      hold on     said carrot  his honest brow wrinkling with the effort of calculation .     you   re a dwarf  right .  and mam   s a dwarf .  so i should be a dwarf  too .  fact of life .      the dwarf sighed .  he   d hoped to creep up on this  over a period of months maybe  sort of break it to him gently  but there wasn   t any time anymore .      sit down  lad     he said .  carrot sat .      the thing is     he said wretchedly  when the boy   s big honest face was a little nearer his own     we found you in the woods one day .  toddling about near one of the tracks   um .     the loose rivet squeaked .  the king plunged on .      thing is  you see   there were these carts .  on fire  as you might say .  and dead people .  um  yes .  extremely dead people .  because of bandits .  it was a bad winter that winter  there were all sorts coming into the hills   so we took you in  of course  and then  well  it was a long winter  like i said  and your mam got used to you  and  well  we never got around to asking varneshi to make enquiries .  that   s the long and the short of it .      carrot took this fairly calmly  mostly because he didn   t understand nearly all of it .  besides  as far as he was aware  being found toddling in the woods was the normal method of childbirth .  a dwarf is not considered old enough to have the technical processes explained to him  until he has reached puberty .       all right  dad     he said  and leaned down so as to be level with the dwarf   s ear .     but you know  me and   you know minty rocksmacker .  she   s really beautiful  dad  got a beard as soft as a  a  a very soft thing   we   ve got an understanding  and           yes     said the dwarf  coldly .     i know .  her father   s had a word with me .     so did her mother with your mother  he added silently  and then she had a word with me .  lots of words .   it   s not that they don   t like you  you   re a steady lad and a fine worker  you   d make a good son in law .  four good sons in law .  that   s the trouble .  and she   s only sixty  anyway .  it   s not proper .  it   s not right .   he   d heard about children being reared by wolves .  he wondered whether the leader of the pack ever had to sort out something tricky like this .  perhaps he   d have to take him into a quiet clearing somewhere and say  look  son  you might have wondered why you   re not as hairy as everyone else     he   d discussed it with varneshi .  a good solid man  varneshi .  of course  he   d known the man   s father .  and his grandfather  now he came to think about it .  humans didn   t seem to last long  it was probably all the effort of pumping blood up that high .      got a problem there  king .   right enough     the old man had said  as they shared a nip of spirits on a bench outside shaft    .      he   s a good lad  mind you     said the king .     sound character .  honest .  not exactly brilliant  but you tell him to do something  he don   t rest until he   s done it .  obedient .         you could chop his legs off     said varneshi .      it   s not his legs that   s going to be the problem     said the king darkly .      ah .  yes .  well  in that case you could           no .         no     agreed varneshi  thoughtfully .     hmm .  well  then what you should do is  you should send him away for a bit .  let him mix a bit with humans .     he sat back .     what you   ve got here  king  is a duck     he added  in knowledgeable tones .      i don   t think i should tell him that .  he   s refusing to believe he   s a human as it is .         what i mean is  a duck brought up among chickens .  well known farmyard phenomenon .  finds it can   t bloody well peck and doesn   t know what swimming is .     the king listened politely .  dwarfs don   t go in much for agriculture .     but you send him off to see a lot of other ducks  let him get his feet wet  and he won   t go running around after bantams anymore .  and bob   s your uncle .      varneshi sat back and looked rather pleased with himself .   when you spend a large part of your life underground  you develop a very literal mind .  dwarfs have no use for metaphor and simile .  rocks are hard  the darkness is dark .  start messing around with descriptions like that and you   re in big trouble  is their motto .  but after two hundred years of talking to humans the king had  as it were  developed a painstaking mental toolkit which was nearly adequate for the job of understanding them .      surely bjorn stronginthearm is my uncle     he pointed out  slowly .      same thing .      there was a pause while the king subjected this to careful analysis .      you   re saying     he said  weighing each word     that we should send carrot away to be a duck among humans because bjorn stronginthearm is my uncle .         he   s a fine lad .  plenty of openings for a big strong lad like him     said varneshi .      i have heard that dwarfs go off to work in the big city     said the king uncertainly .     and they send back money to their families  which is very commendable and proper .         there you are then .  get him a job in  in       varneshi sought for inspiration      in the watch  or something .  my great grandfather was in the watch  you know .  fine job for a big lad  my grandad said .         what is a watch .     said the king .      oh     said varneshi  with the vagueness of someone whose family for the last three generations hadn   t traveled more than twenty miles     they goes about making sure people keep the laws and do what they   re told .         that is a very proper concern     said the king who  since he was usually the one doing the telling  had very solid views about people doing what they were told .      of course  they don   t take just anyone     said varneshi  dredging the depths of his recollection .      i should think not  for such an important task .  i shall write to their king .         i don   t think they have a king there     said varneshi .     just some man who tells them what to do .      the king of the dwarfs took this calmly .  this seemed to be about ninety seven percent of the definition of kingship  as far as he was concerned .   carrot took the news without fuss  just as he took instructions about re opening shaft    or cutting timber for shoring props .  all dwarfs are by nature dutiful  serious  literate  obedient and thoughtful people whose only minor failing is a tendency  after one drink  to rush at enemies screaming    arrrrrrgh .     and axing their legs off at the knee .  carrot saw no reason to be any different .  he would go to this city   whatever that was   and have a man made of him .   they took only the finest  varneshi had said .  a watchman had to be a skilled fighter and clean in thought  word and deed .  from the depths of his ancestral anecdotage the old man had dragged tales of moonlight chases across rooftops  and tremendous battles with miscreants which  of course  his great grandad had won despite being heavily outnumbered .   carrot had to admit it sounded better than mining .   after some thought  the king wrote to the ruler of ankh morpork  respectfully asking if carrot could be considered for a place among the city   s finest .   letters rarely got written in that mine .  work stopped and the whole clan had sat around in respectful silence as his pen scrittered across the parchment .  his aunt had been sent up to varneshi   s to beg his pardon but could he see his way clear to sparing a smidgen of wax .  his sister had been sent down to the village to ask mistress garlick the witch how you stopped spelling recommendation .   months had gone by .   and then there   d been the reply .  it was fairly grubby  since mail in the ramtops was generally handed to whoever was going in more or less the right direction  and it was also fairly short .  it said  baldly  that his application was accepted  and would he present himself for duty immediately .      just like that .     he said .     i thought there   d be tests and things .  to see if i was suitable .         you   re my son     said the king .     i told them that  see .  stands to reason you   ll be suitable .  probably officer material .      he   d pulled a sack from under his chair  rummaged around in it and presented carrot with a length of metal  more a sword than a saw but only just .      this might rightly belong to you     he said .     when we found the   carts  this was the only thing left .  the bandits  you see .  just between you and me       he beckoned carrot closer      we had a witch look at it .  in case it was magic .  but it isn   t .  quite the most unmagical sword she   d ever seen  she said .  they normally have a bit  see  on account of it   s like magnetism  i suppose .  got quite a nice balance  though .      he handed it over .   he rummaged around some more .     and then there   s this .     he held up a shirt .     it   ll protect you .      carrot fingered it carefully .  it was made from the wool of ramtop sheep  which had all the warmth and softness of hog bristles .  it was one of the legendary woolly dwarf vests  the kind of vest that needs hinges .      protect me from what .     he said .      colds  and so on     said the king .     your mother says you   ve got to wear it .  and  er   that reminds me .  mr .  varneshi says he   d like you to drop in on the way down the mountain .  he   s got something for you .      his father and mother had waved him out of sight .  minty didn   t .  funny  that .  she seemed to have been avoiding him lately .   he   d taken the sword  slung on his back  sandwiches and clean underwear in his pack  and the world  more or less  at his feet .  in his pocket was the famous letter from the patrician  the man who ruled the great fine city of ankh morpork .   at least  that   s how his mother had referred to it .  it certainly had an important looking crest at the top  but the signature was something like    lupin squiggle  sec   y  pp .      still  if it wasn   t actually signed by the patrician then it had certainly been written by someone who worked for him .  or in the same building .  probably the patrician had at least known about the letter .  in general terms .  not this letter  perhaps  but probably he knew about the existence of letters in general .   carrot walked steadfastly down the mountain paths  disturbing clouds of bumblebees .  after a while he unsheathed the sword and made experimental stabs at felonious tree stumps and unlawful assemblies of stinging nettles .   varneshi was sitting outside his hut  threading dried mushrooms on a string .      hallo  carrot     he said  leading the way inside .     looking forward to the city .      carrot gave this due consideration .      no     he said .      having second thoughts  are you .         no .  i was just walking along     said carrot honestly .     i wasn   t thinking about anything much .         your dad give you the sword  did he .     said varneshi  rummaging on a fetid shelf .      yes .  and a woolly vest to protect me against chills .         ah .  yes  it can be very damp down there  so i   ve heard .  protection .  very important .     he turned around and added  dramatically     this belonged to my great grandfather .      it was a strange  vaguely hemispherical device surrounded by straps .      it   s some sort of sling .     said carrot  after examining it in polite silence .   varneshi told him what it was .      codpiece like in fish .     said carrot  mystified .      no .  it   s for the fighting     mumbled varneshi .     you should wear it all the time .  protects your vitals  like .      carrot tried it on .      it   s a bit small  mr .  varneshi .         that   s because you don   t wear it on your head  you see .      varneshi explained some more  to carrot   s mounting bewilderment and  subsequently  horror .     my great grandad used to say     varneshi finished     that but for this i wouldn   t be here today .         what did he mean by that .      varneshi   s mouth opened and shut a few times .     i   ve no idea     he said  spinelessly .   anyway  the shameful thing was now at the very bottom of carrot   s pack .  dwarfs didn   t have much truck with things like that .  the ghastly preventative represented a glimpse into a world as alien as the backside of the moon .   there had been another gift from mr .  varneshi .  it was a small but very thick book  bound in a leather that had become like wood over the years .   it was called  the laws and ordinances of the cities of ankh and morpork .      this belonged to my great grandad as well     he said .     this is what the watch has to know .  you have to know all the laws     he said virtuously     to be a good officer .      perhaps varneshi should have recalled that  in the whole of carrot   s life  no one had ever really lied to him or given him an instruction that he wasn   t meant to take quite literally .  carrot solemnly took the book .  it would never have occurred to him  if he was going to be an officer of the watch  to be less than a good one .   it was a five hundred mile journey and  surprisingly  quite uneventful .  people who are rather more than six feet tall and nearly as broad across the shoulders often have uneventful journeys .  people jump out at them from behind rocks then say things like     oh .  sorry .  i thought you were someone else .      he   d spent most of the journey reading .   and now ankh morpork was before him .   it was a little disappointing .  he   d expected high white towers rearing over the landscape  and flags .  ankh morpork didn   t rear .  rather  it sort of skulked  clinging to the soil as if afraid someone might steal it .  there were no flags .   there was a guard on the gate .  at least  he was wearing chain mail and the thing he was propped up against was a spear .  he had to be a guard .   carrot saluted him and presented the letter .  the man looked at it for some time .      mm .     he said  eventually .      i think i   ve got to see lupin squiggle sec   y pp     said carrot .      what   s the pp for .     said the guard suspiciously .      could it be pretty promptly .     said carrot  who had wondered about this himself .      well  i don   t know about any sec   y     said the guard .     you want captain vimes of the night watch .         and where is he based .     said carrot  politely .      at this time of day i   d try the bunch of grapes in easy street     said the guard .  he looked carrot up and down .     joining the watch  are you .         i hope to prove worthy  yes     said carrot .   the guard gave him what could loosely be called an old fashioned look .  it was practically neolithic .      what was it you done .     he said .      i   m sorry .     said carrot .      you must of done something     said the guard .      my father wrote a letter     said carrot proudly .     i   ve been volunteered .         bloody hellfire     said the guard .       now it was night again  and beyond the dread portal      are the wheels of torment duly spun .     said the supreme grand master .   the elucidated brethren shuffled around their circle .      brother watchtower .     said the supreme grand master .      not my job to spin the wheels of torment     muttered brother watchtower .        s brother plasterer   s job  spinning the wheels of torment           no it bloody well isn   t  it   s my job to oil the axles of the universal lemon     said brother plasterer hotly .     you always say it   s my job        the supreme grand master sighed in the depths of his cowl as yet another row began .  from this dross he was going to forge an age of rationality .      just shut up  will you .     he snapped .     we don   t really need the wheels of torment tonight .  stop it  the pair of you .  now  brethren   you have all brought the items as instructed .      there was a general murmuring .      place them in the circle of conjuration     said the supreme grand master .   it was a sorry collection .  bring magical things  he   d said .  only brother fingers had produced anything worthwhile .  it looked like some sort of altar ornament  best not to ask from where .  the supreme grand master stepped forward and prodded one of the other things with his toe .      what     he said     is this .            s a amulet     muttered brother dunnykin .        s very powerful .  bought it off a man .  guaranteed .  protects you against crocodile bites .         are you sure you can spare it .     said the supreme grand master .  there was a dutiful titter from the rest of the brethren .      less of that  brothers     said the grand master  spinning around .     bring magical things  i said .  not cheap jewelry and rubbish .  good grief  this city is lousy with magic .     he reached down .     what are these things  for heaven   s sake .         they   re stones     said brother plasterer uncertainly .      i can see that .  why   re they magical .      brother plasterer began to tremble .     they   ve got holes in them  supreme grand master .  everyone knows that stones with holes in them are magical .      the supreme grand master walked back to his place on the circle .  he threw his arms up .      right  fine  okay     he said wearily .     if that   s how we   re going to do it  that   s how we   re going to do it .  if we get a dragon six inches long we   ll all know the reason why .  won   t we  brother plasterer .  brother plasterer .  sorry .  i didn   t hear what you said .  brother plasterer .         i said yes  supreme grand master     whispered brother plasterer .      very well .  so long as that   s quite understood .     the supreme grand master turned and picked up the book .      and now     he said     if we are all quite ready           um .     brother watchtower meekly raised his hand .      ready for what  supreme grand master .     he said .      for the summoning  of course .  good grief  i should have thought           but you haven   t told us what we   re supposed to do  supreme grand master     whined brother watchtower .   the grand master hesitated .  this was quite true  but he wasn   t going to admit it .      well  of course     he said .     it   s obvious .  you have to focus your concentration .  think hard about dragons     he translated .     all of you .         that   s all  is it .     said brother doorkeeper .      yes .         don   t we have to chant a mystic prune or something .      the supreme grand master stared at him .  brother doorkeeper managed to look as defiant in the face of oppression as an anonymous shadow in a black cowl could look .  he hadn   t joined a secret society not to chant mystic runes .  he   d been looking forward to it .      you can if you like     said the supreme grand master .     now  i want you   yes  what is it  brother dunnykin .      the little brother lowered his hand .     don   t know any mystic prunes  grand master .  not to what you might call chant           hum .      he opened the book .   he   d been rather surprised to find  after pages and pages of pious ramblings  that the actual summoning itself was one short sentence .  not a chant  not a brief piece of poetry  but a mere assemblage of meaningless syllables .  de malachite said they caused interference patterns in the waves of reality  but the daft old fool was probably making it up as he went along .  that was the trouble with wizards  they had to make everything look difficult .  all you really needed was willpower .  and the brethren had a lot of that .  small minded and vitriolic willpower  yes  lousy with malignity maybe  but still powerful enough in its way     they   d try nothing fancy this time round .  somewhere inconspicuous     around him the brethren were chanting what each man considered  according to his lights  to be something mystical .  the general effect was actually quite good  if you didn   t listen to the words .   the words .  oh  yes     he looked down  and spoke them aloud .   nothing happened .   he blinked .   when he opened his eyes again he was in a dark alley  his stomach was full of fire  and he was very angry .       it was about to be the worst night of his life for zebbo mooty  thief third class  and it wouldn   t have made him any happier to know that it was also going to be the last one .  the rain was keeping people indoors  and he was way behind on his quota .  he was  therefore  a little less cautious than he might otherwise have been .   in the night time streets of ankh morpork caution is an absolute .  there is no such thing as moderately cautious .  you are either very cautious  or you are dead .  you might be walking around and breathing  but you   re dead  just the same .   he heard the muffled sounds coming from the nearby alley  slid his leather bound cosh from his sleeve  waited until the victim was almost turning the corner  sprang out  said    oh  shi       and died .   it was a most unusual death .  no one else had died like that for hundreds of years .   the stone wall behind him glowed cherry red with heat  which gradually faded into darkness .   he was the first to see the ankh morpork dragon .  he derived little comfort from knowing this  however  because he was dead .         t     he said  and his disembodied self looked down at the small heap of charcoal which  he knew with an unfamiliar sort of certainty  was what he had just been disembodied from .  it was a strange sensation  seeing your own mortal remains .  he didn   t find it as horrifying as he would have imagined if you   d asked him  say  ten minutes ago .  finding that you are dead is mitigated by also finding that there really is a you who can find you dead .   the alley opposite was empty again .      that was really strange     said mooty .   extremely unusual  certainly .      did you see that .  what was it .     mooty looked up at the dark figure emerging from the shadows .     who   re you  anyway .     he added suspiciously .   guess  said the voice .   mooty peered at the hooded figure .      cor .     he said .     i thought you dint turn up for the likes o    me .      i turn up for everyone .      i mean in   person  sort of thing .      sometimes .  on special occasions .      yeah  well     said mooty     this is one of them  all right .  i mean  it looked like a bloody dragon .  what   s a man to do .  you don   t expect to find a dragon around the corner .      and now  if you would care to step this way   said death  laying a skeletal hand on mooty   s shoulder .     do you know  a fortune teller once told me i   d die in my bed  surrounded by grieving great grandchildren     said mooty  following the stately figure .     what do you think of that  eh .      i think she was wrong .      a bloody dragon     said mooty .     fire breathing  too .  did i suffer much .      no .  it was practically instantaneous .      that   s good .  i wouldn   t like to think i   d suffered much .     mooty looked around him .     what happens now .     he said .   behind them  the rain washed the little heap of black ash into the mud .       the supreme grand master opened his eyes .  he was lying on his back .  brother dunnykin was preparing to give him the kiss of life .  the mere thought was enough to jerk anyone from the borders of consciousness .   he sat up  trying to shed the feeling that he weighed several tons and was covered in scales .      we did it     he whispered .     the dragon .  it came .  i felt it .      the brethren glanced at one another .      we never saw nothing     said brother plasterer .      i might of seen something     said brother watchtower loyally .      no  not here     snapped the supreme grand master .     you hardly want it to materialize here  do you .  it was out there  in the city .  just for a few seconds        he pointed .     look .      the brethren turned around guiltily  expecting at any moment the hot flame of retribution .   in the center of the circle the magic items were gently crumbling to dust .  even as they watched  brother dunnykin   s amulet collapsed .      sucked dry     whispered brother fingers .     i   ll be damned .         three dollars that amulet cost me     muttered brother dunnykin .      but it proves it works     said the supreme grand master .     don   t you see  you fools .  it works .  we can summon dragons .         could be a bit expensive in magical items     said brother fingers doubtfully .         three dollars  it was .  no rubbish           power     growled the supreme grand master     does not come cheap .         very true     nodded brother watchtower .     not cheap .  very true .     he looked at the little heap of exhausted magic again .     cor     he said .     we did it  though  dint we .  we only went and bloody well did some magic  right .         see .     said brother fingers .     i tole you there was nothin    to it .         you all did exceptionally well     said the supreme grand master encouragingly .         should   ve been six dollars  but he said he   d cut his own throat and sell it me for three dollars           yeah     said brother watchtower .     we got the hang of it all right .  dint hurt a bit .  we done real magic .  and dint get et by tooth fairies from out of the woodwork either  brother plasterer  i couldn   t help noticing .      the other brethren nodded .  real magic .  nothing to it .  everyone had just better watch out .      hang on  though     said brother plasterer .     where   s this dragon gone .  i mean  did we really summon it or not .         fancy you asking a silly question like that     said brother watchtower doubtfully .   the supreme grand master brushed the dust off his mystic robe .      we summoned it     he said     and it came .  but only as long as the magic lasted .  then it went back .  if we want it to stay longer  we need more magic .  understand .  and that is what we must get .            three dollars i shan   t see again in a hurry           shut up .          dearest father  wrote carrot  well  here i am in ankh morpork .  it is not like at home .  i think it must have changed a bit since mr .  varneshi   s great grandfather was here .  i don   t think people here know right from wrong .   i found captain vimes in a common ale house .  i remembered what you said about a good dwarf not going into such places  but since he did not come out  i went in .  he was lying with his head on the table .  when i spoke to him  he said  pull the other one  kid  it has got bells on .  i believe he was the worse for drink .  he told me to find a place to stay and report to sgt .  colon at the watch house tonight .  he said  anyone wanting to join the guard needed their head examined .   mr .  varneshi did not mention this .  perhaps it is done for reasons of hygiene .   i went for a walk .  there are many people here .  i found a place  it is called the shades .  then i saw some men trying to rob a young lady .  i set about them .  they did not know how to fight properly and one of them tried to kick me in the vitals  but i was wearing the protective as instructed and he hurt himself .  then the lady came up to me and said  was i interested in bed .  i said yes .  she took me to where she lived  a boarding house  i think it is called .  it is run by a mrs .  palm .  the lady whose purse it was  she is called reet  said  you should of seen him  there were   of them  it was amazing .  mrs .  palm said  it is on the house .  she said  what a big protective .  so i went upstairs and fell asleep  although it is a very noisy place .  reet woke me up once or twice to say  do you want anything  but they had no apples .  so i have fallen on my feet  as they say here but  i don   t see how that is possible because  if you fall you fall off your feet  it is common sense .   there is certainly a lot to do .  when i went to see the sgt .  i saw a place called  the thieves    guild .  .  i asked mrs .  palm and she said  of course .  she said the leaders of the thieves in the city meet there .  i went to the watch house and met sgt .  colon  a very fat man  and when i told him about the thieves    guild he said  don   t be a idiot .  i do not think he is serious .  he says  don   t you worry about thieves    guilds  this is all what you have to do  you walk along the streets at night  shouting  it   s twelve o   clock and all   s well .  i said  what if it is not all well  and he said  you bloody well find another street .   this is not leadership .   i have been given some chain mail .  it is rusty and not well made .   they give you money for being a guard .  it is     dollars a month .  when i get it i will send you it .   i hope you are all well and that shaft    is now open .  this afternoon i will go and look at the thieves    guild .  it is disgraceful .  if i do something about it  it will be a feather in my cap .  i am getting the hang of how they talk here already .  your loving son  carrot .   ps .  please give all my love to minty .  i really miss her .       lord vetinari  the patrician of ankh morpork put his hand over his eyes .      he did what .         i was marched through the streets     said urdo van pew  currently president of the guild of thieves  burglars and allied trades .     in broad daylight .  with my hands tied together .     he took a few steps toward the patrician   s severe chair of office  waving a finger .      you know very well that we have kept within the budget     he said .     to be humiliated like that .  like a common criminal .  there had better be a full apology     he said     or you will have another strike on your hands .  we will be driven to it  despite our natural civic responsibilities     he added .   it was the finger .  the finger was a mistake .  the patrician was staring coldly at the finger .  van pew followed his gaze  and quickly lowered the digit .  the patrician was not a man you shook a finger at unless you wanted to end up being able to count only to nine .      and you say this was one person .     said lord vetinari .      yes .  that is       van pew hesitated .   it did sound weird  now he came to tell someone .      but there are hundreds of you in there     said the patrician calmly .     thick as  you should excuse the expression  thieves .      van pew opened and shut his mouth a few times .  the honest answer would have been  yes  and if anyone had come sidling in and skulking around the corridors it would have been the worse for them .  it was the way he strode in as if he owned the place that fooled everyone .  that and the fact that he kept hitting people and telling them to mend their ways .   the patrician nodded .      i shall deal with the matter momentarily     he said .  it was a good word .  it always made people hesitate .  they were never quite sure whether he meant he   d deal with it now  or just deal with it briefly .  and no one ever dared ask .   van pew backed down .      a full apology  mark you .  i have a position to maintain     he added .      thank you .  do not let me detain you     said the patrician  once again giving the language his own individual spin .      right .  good .  thank you .  very well     said the thief .      after all  you have such a lot of work to do     lord vetinari went on .      well  of course this is the case .     the thief hesitated .  the patrician   s last remark had barbs on it .  you found yourself waiting for him to strike .      er     he said  hoping for a clue .      with so much business being conducted  that is .      panic took over the thief   s features .  randomized guilt flooded his mind .  it wasn   t a case of what had he done  it was a question of what the patrician had found out about .  the man had eyes everywhere  none of them so terrifying as the icy blue ones just above his nose .      i  er  don   t quite follow       he began .      curious choice of targets .     the patrician picked up a sheet of paper .     for example  a crystal ball belonging to a fortune teller in sheer street .  a small ornament from the temple of offler the crocodile god .  and so on .  gewgaws .         i am afraid i really don   t know       said the head thief .  the patrician leaned forward .      no unlicensed thieving  surely .     he said .       i shall look into it directly .     stuttered the head thief .     depend upon it .      the patrician gave him a sweet smile .     i   m sure i can     he said .     thank you for coming to see me .  don   t hesitate to leave .      the thief shuffled out .  it was always like this with the patrician  he reflected bitterly .  you came to him with a perfectly reasonable complaint .  next thing you knew  you were shuffling out backward  bowing and scraping  relieved simply to be getting away .  you had to hand it to the patrician  he admitted grudgingly .  if you didn   t  he sent men to come and take it away .   when he   d gone lord vetinari rang the little bronze bell that summoned his secretary .  the man   s name  despite his handwriting  was lupine wonse .  he appeared  pen poised .   you could say this about lupine wonse .  he was neat .  he always gave the impression of just being completed .  even his hair was so smoothed down and oiled it looked as though it had been painted on .      the watch appears to be having some difficulty with the thieves    guild     said the patrician .     van pew has been in here claiming that a member of the watch arrested him .         what for  sir .         being a thief  apparently .         a member of the watch .     said the secretary .      i know .  but just sort it out  will you .      the patrician smiled to himself .   it was always hard to fathom lord vetinari   s idiosyncratic sense of humor  but a vision of the red faced  irate head thief kept coming back to him .   one of the patrician   s greatest contributions to the reliable operation of ankh morpork had been  very early in his administration  the legalizing of the ancient guild of thieves .  crime was always with us  he reasoned  and therefore  if you were going to have crime  it at least should be organized crime .   and so the guild had been encouraged to come out of the shadows and build a big guildhouse  take their place at civic banquets  and set up their training college with day release courses and city and guilds certificates and everything .  in exchange for the winding down of the watch  they agreed  while trying to keep their faces straight  to keep crime levels to a level to be determined annually .  that way  everyone could plan ahead  said lord vetinari  and part of the uncertainty had been removed from the chaos that is life .   and then  a little while later  the patrician summoned the leading thieves again and said  oh  by the way  there was something else .  what was it  now .  oh  yes     i know who you are  he said .  i know where you live .  i know what kind of horse you ride .  i know where your wife has her hair done .  i know where your lovely children  how old are they now  my  doesn   t time fly  i know where they play .  so you won   t forget about what we agreed  will you .  and he smiled .   so did they  after a fashion .   and in fact it had turned out very satisfactorily from everyone   s point of view .  it took the head thieves a very little time to grow paunches and start having coats of arms made and meet in a proper building rather than smoky dens  which no one had liked much .  a complicated arrangement of receipts and vouchers saw to it that  while everyone was eligible for the attentions of the guild  no one had too much  and this was very acceptable   at least to those citizens who were rich enough to afford the quite reasonable premiums the guild charged for an uninterrupted life .  there was a strange foreign word for this  inn sewer ants .  no one knew exactly what it had originally meant  but ankh morpork had made it its own .   the watch hadn   t liked it  but the plain fact was that the thieves were far better at controlling crime than the watch had ever been .  after all  the watch had to work twice as hard to cut crime just a little  whereas all the guild had to do was to work less .   and so the city prospered  while the watch had dwindled away  like a useless appendix  into a handful of unemployables who no one in their right mind could ever take seriously .   the last thing anyone wanted them to do was get it into their heads to fight crime .  but seeing the head thief discommoded was always worth the trouble  the patrician felt .       captain vimes knocked very hesitantly at the door  because each tap echoed around his skull .      enter .      vimes removed his helmet  tucked it under his arm and pushed the door open .  its creak was a blunt saw across the front of his brain .   he always felt uneasy in the presence of lupine wonse .  come to that  he felt uneasy in the presence of lord vetinari   but that was different  that was down to breeding .  and ordinary fear  of course .  whereas he   d known wonse since their childhood in the shades .  the boy had shown promise even then .  he was never a gang leader .  never a gang leader .  hadn   t got the strength or stamina for that .  and  after all  what was the point in being the gang leader .  behind every gang leader were a couple of lieutenants bucking for promotion .  being a gang leader is not a job with long term prospects .  but in every gang there is a pale youth who   s allowed to stay because he   s the one who comes up with all the clever ideas  usually to do with old women and unlocked shops  this was wonse   s natural place in the order of things .   vimes had been one of the middle rankers  the falsetto equivalent of a yes man .  he remembered wonse as a skinny little kid  always tagging along behind in hand me down pants with the kind of odd skipping run he   d invented to keep up with the bigger boys  and forever coming up with fresh ideas to stop them idly ganging up on him  which was the usual recreation if nothing more interesting presented itself .  it was superb training for the rigors of adulthood  and wonse became good at it .   yes  they   d both started in the gutter .  but wonse had worked his way up whereas  as he himself would be the first to admit  vimes had merely worked his way along .  every time he seemed to be getting anywhere he spoke his mind  or said the wrong thing .  usually both at once .   that was what made him uncomfortable around wonse .  it was the ticking of the bright clockwork of ambition .   vimes had never mastered ambition .  it was something that happened to other people .      ah  vimes .         sir     said vimes woodenly .  he didn   t try to salute in case he fell over .  he wished he   d had time to drink dinner .   wonse rummaged in the papers of his desk .      strange things afoot  vimes .  serious complaint about you  i   m afraid     he said .  wonse didn   t wear glasses .  if he had worn glasses  he   d have peered at vimes over the top of them .      sir .         one of your night watch men .  seems he arrested the head of the thieves    guild .      vimes swayed a little and tried hard to focus .  he wasn   t ready for this sort of thing .      sorry  sir     he said .     seem to have lost you there .         i said  vimes  that one of your men arrested the head of the thieves    guild .         one of my men .         yes .      vimes   s scattered brain cells tried valiantly to regroup .     a member of the watch .     he said .   wonse grinned mirthlessly .     tied him up and left him in front of the palace .  there   s a bit of a stink about it  i   m afraid .  there was a note   ah   here it is      this man is charged with  conspiracy to commit crime  under section     iii  of the general felonies act        by me  carrot ironfoundersson .         vimes squinted at him .      fourteen eye eye eye .         apparently     said wonse .      what does that mean .         i really haven   t the faintest notion     said wonse dryly .     and what about the name   carrot .         but we don   t do things like that .     said vimes .     you can   t go around arresting the thieves    guild .  i mean  we   d be at it all day .         apparently this carrot thinks otherwise .      the captain shook his head  and winced .     carrot .  doesn   t ring a bell .     the tone of blurred conviction was enough even for wonse  who was momentarily taken aback .      he was quite       the secretary hesitated .     carrot  carrot     he said .     i   ve heard the name before .  seen it written down .     his face went blank .     the volunteer  that was it .  remember me showing you .      vimes stared at him .     wasn   t there a letter from  i don   t know  some dwarf    .         all about serving the community and keeping the streets safe  that   s right .  begging that his son would be found suitable for a humble position in the watch .     the secretary was rummaging among his files .      what   d he done .     said vimes .      nothing .  that was it .  not a blessed thing .      vimes   s brow creased as his thoughts shaped themselves around a new concept .      a volunteer .     he said .      yes .         he didn   t have to join .         he wanted to join .  and you said it must be a joke  and i said we ought to try and get more ethnic minorities into the watch .  you remember .      vimes tried to .  it wasn   t easy .  he was vaguely aware that he drank to forget .  what made it rather pointless was that he couldn   t remember what it was he was forgetting anymore .  in the end he just drank to forget about drinking .   a trawl of the chaotic assortment of recollections that he didn   t even try to dignify anymore by the name of memory produced no clue .      do i .     he said helplessly .   wonse folded his hands on the desk and leaned forward .      now look  captain     he said .     lordship wants an explanation .  i don   t want to have to tell him the captain of the night watch hasn   t the faintest idea what goes on among the men under  if i may use the term loosely  his command .  that sort of thing only leads to trouble  questions asked  that sort of thing .  we don   t want that  do we .  do we .         no  sir     vimes muttered .  a vague recollection of someone earnestly talking to him in the bunch of grapes was bobbing guiltily at the back of his mind .  surely that hadn   t been a dwarf .  not unless the qualification had been radically altered  at any rate .      of course we don   t     said wonse .     for old times    sake .  and so on .  so i   ll think of something to tell him and you  captain  will make a point of finding out what   s going on and putting a stop to it .  give this dwarf a short lesson in what it means to be a guard  all right .         haha     said vimes dutifully .      i   m sorry .     said wonse .      oh .  thought you made an ethnic joke  there .  sir .         look  vimes  i   m being very understanding .  in the circumstances .  now  i want you to get out there and sort this out .  do you understand .      vimes saluted .  the black depression that always lurked ready to take advantage of his sobriety moved in on his tongue .      right you are  mr .  secretary     he said .     i   ll see to it that he learns that arresting thieves is against the law .      he wished he hadn   t said that .  if he didn   t say things like that he   d have been better off now  captain of the palace guard  a big man .  giving him the watch had been the patrician   s little joke .  but wonse was already reading a new document on his desk .  if he noticed the sarcasm  he didn   t show it .      very good     he said .       dearest mother  carrot wrote  it has been a much better day .  i went into the thieves    guild and arrested the chief miscreant and dragged him to the patrician   s palace .  no more trouble from him  i fancy .  and mrs .  palm says i can stay in the attic because  it is always useful to have a man around the place .  this was because  in the night  there were men the worse for drink making a fuss in one of the girl   s rooms  and i had to speak to them and they showed fight and one of them tried to hurt me with his knee but i had the protective and mrs .  palm says he has broken his patella but i needn   t pay for a new one .   i do not understand some of the watch duties .  i have a partner  his name is nobby .  he says i am too keen .  he says i have got a lot to learn .  i think this is true  because  i have only got up to page     in  the laws and ordinances of the cities of ankh and morpork .  love to all  your son  carrot .   ps .  love to minty .       it wasn   t just the loneliness  it was the back to front way of living .  that was it  thought vimes .   the night watch got up when the rest of the world was going to bed  and went to bed when dawn drifted over the landscape .  you spent your whole time in the damp  dark streets  in a world of shadows .  the night watch attracted the kind of people who for one reason or another were inclined to that kind of life .   he reached the watch house .  it was an ancient and surprisingly large building  wedged between a tannery and a tailor who made suspicious leather goods .  it must have been quite imposing once  but quite a lot of it was now uninhabitable and patrolled only by owls and rats .  over the door a motto in the ancient tongue of the city was now almost eroded by time and grime and lichen  but could just be made out   fabricati diem  pvnc  it translated   according to sergeant colon  who had served in foreign parts and considered himself an expert on languages   as    to protect and to serve .      yes .  being a guard must have meant something  once .   sergeant colon  he thought  as he stumbled into the musty gloom .  now there was a man who liked the dark .  sergeant colon owed thirty years of happy marriage to the fact that mrs .  colon worked all day and sergeant colon worked all night .  they communicated by means of notes .  he got her tea ready before he left at night  she left his breakfast nice and hot in the oven in the mornings .  they had three grown up children  all born  vimes had assumed  as a result of extremely persuasive handwriting .   and corporal nobbs   well  anyone like nobby had unlimited reasons for not wishing to be seen by other people .  you didn   t have to think hard about that .  the only reason you couldn   t say that nobby was close to the animal kingdom was that the animal kingdom would get up and walk away .   and then  of course  there was himself .  just a skinny  un shaven collection of bad habits marinated in alcohol .  and that was the night watch .  just the three of them .  once there had been dozens  hundreds .  and now   just three .   vimes fumbled his way up the stairs  groped his way into his office  slumped into the primeval leather chair with its prolapsed stuffing  scrabbled at the bottom drawer  grabbed bottle  bit cork  tugged  spat out cork  drank .  began his day .   the world swam into focus .   life is just chemicals .  a drop here  a drip there  everything   s changed .  a mere dribble of fermented juices and suddenly you   re going to live another few hours .   once  in the days when this had been a respectable district  some hopeful owner of the tavern next door had paid a wizard a considerable sum of money for an illuminated sign  every letter a different color .  now it worked erratically and sometimes short circuited in the damp .  at the moment the e was a garish pink and flashed on and off at random .   vimes had grown accustomed to it .  it seemed like part of life .   he stared at the flickering play of light on the crumbling plaster for a while  and then raised one sandalled foot and thumped heavily on the floorboards  twice .   after a few minutes a distant wheezing indicated that sergeant colon was climbing the stairs .   vimes counted silently .  colon always paused for six seconds at the top of the flight to get some of his breath back .   on the seventh second the door opened .  the sergeant   s face appeared around it like a harvest moon .   you could describe sergeant colon like this  he was the sort of man who  if he took up a military career  would automatically gravitate to the post of sergeant .  you couldn   t imagine him ever being a corporal .  or  for that matter  a captain .  if he didn   t take up a military career  then he looked cut out for something like  perhaps  a sausage butcher  some job where a big red face and a tendency to sweat even in frosty weather were practically part of the specification .   he saluted and  with considerable care  placed a scruffy piece of paper on vimes   s desk and smoothed it out .      evenin     captain     he said .     yesterday   s incident reports  and that .  also  you owe fourpence to the tea club .         what   s this about a dwarf  sergeant .     said vimes abruptly .   colon   s brow wrinkled .     what dwarf .         the one who   s just joined the watch .  name of       vimes hesitated      carrot  or something .         him .     colon   s mouth dropped open .     he   s a dwarf .  i always said you couldn   t trust them little buggers .  he fooled me all right  captain  the little sod must of lied about his height .     colon was a sizeist  at least when it came to people smaller than himself .      do you know he arrested the president of the thieves    guild this morning .         what for .         for being president of the thieves    guild  it seems .      the sergeant looked puzzled .     where   s the crime in that .         i think perhaps i had better have a word with this carrot     said vimes .      didn   t you see him  sir .     said colon .     he said he   d reported to you  sir .         i  uh  must have been busy at the time .  lot on my mind     said vimes .      yes  sir     said colon  politely .  vimes had just enough self respect left to look away and shuffle the strata of paperwork on his desk .      we   ve got to get him off the streets as soon as possible     he muttered .     next thing you know he   ll be bringing in the chief of the assassins    guild for bloody well killing people .  where is he .         i sent him out with corporal nobbs  captain .  i said he   d show him the ropes  sort of thing .         you sent a raw recruit out with nobby .     said vimes wearily .   colon stuttered .     well  sir  experienced man  i thought  corporal nobbs could teach him a lot           let   s just hope he   s a slow learner     said vimes  ramming his brown iron helmet on his head .     come on .      when they stepped out of the watch house there was a ladder against the tavern wall .  a bulky man at the top of it swore under his breath as he wrestled with the illuminated sign .      it   s the e that doesn   t work properly     vimes called up .      what .         the e .  and the t sizzles when it rains .  it   s about time it was fixed .         fixed .  oh .  yes .  fixed .  that   s what i   m doing all right .  fixing .      the watch men splashed off through the puddles .  brother watchtower shook his head slowly  and turned his attention once again to his screwdriver .       men like corporal nobbs can be found in every armed force .  although their grasp of the minutiae of the regulations is usually encyclopedic  they take good care never to be promoted beyond  perhaps  corporal .  he tended to speak out of the corner of his mouth .  he smoked incessantly but the weird thing  carrot noticed  was that any cigarette smoked by nobby became a dog end almost instantly but remained a dog end indefinitely or until lodged behind his ear  which was a sort of nicotine elephant   s graveyard .  on the rare occasions he took one out of his mouth he held it cupped in his hand .   he was a small  bandy legged man  with a certain resemblance to a chimpanzee who never got invited to tea parties .   his age was indeterminate .  but in cynicism and general world weariness  which is a sort of carbon dating of the personality  he was about seven thousand years old .      a cushy number  this route     he said  as they strolled along a damp street in the merchants    quarter .  he tried a doorhandle .  it was locked .     you stick with me     he added     and i   ll see you   re all right .  now  you try the handles on the other side of the street .         ah .  i understand  corporal nobbs .  we   ve got to see if anyone   s left their store unlocked     said carrot .      you catch on fast  son .         i hope i can apprehend a miscreant in the act     said carrot zealously .      er  yeah     said nobby  uncertainly .      but if we find a door unlocked i suppose we must summon the owner     carrot went on .     and one of us would have to stay to guard things  right .         yeah .     nobby brightened .     i   ll do that     he said .     don   t you worry about it .  then you could go and find the victim .  owner  i mean .      he tried another doorknob .  it turned under his grip .      back in the mountains     said carrot     if a thief was caught  he was hung up by the        he paused  idly rattling a doorknob .   nobby froze .      by the what .     he said  in horrified fascination .      can   t remember now     said carrot .     my mother said it was too good for them  anyway .  stealing is wrong .      nobby had survived any number of famous massacres by not being there .  he let go of the doorknob  and gave it a friendly pat .      got it .     said carrot .  nobby jumped .      got what .     he shouted .      i remember what we hang them up by     said carrot .      oh     said nobby weakly .     where .         we hang them up by the town hall     said carrot .     sometimes for days .  they don   t do it again  i can tell you .  and bjorn stronginthearm   s your uncle .      nobby leaned his pike against the wall and fumbled a fag end from the recesses of his ear .  one or two things  he decided  needed to be sorted out .      why did you have to become a guard  lad .     he said .      everyone keeps on asking me that     said carrot .     i didn   t have to .  i wanted to .  it will make a man of me .      nobby never looked anyone directly in the eye .  he stared at carrot   s right ear in amazement .      you mean you ain   t running away from anything .     he said .      what would i want to run away from anything for .      nobby floundered a bit .     ah .  there   s always something .  maybe   maybe you was wrongly accused of something .  like  maybe     he grinned     maybe the stores was mysteriously short on certain items and you was unjustly blamed .  or certain items was found in your kit and you never knew how they got there .  that sort of thing .  you can tell old nobby .  or     he nudged carrot     p   raps it was something else  eh .  shershay la fem  eh .  got a girl into trouble .         i       carrot began  and then remembered that  yes  one should tell the truth  even to odd people like nobby who didn   t seem to know what it was .  and the truth was that he was always getting minty in trouble  although exactly how and why was a bit of a mystery .  just about every time he left after paying calls on her at the rocksmacker cave  he could hear her father and mother shouting at her .  they were always very polite to him  but somehow merely being seen with him was enough to get minty into trouble .      yes     he said .      ah .  often the case     said nobby wisely .      all the time     said carrot .     just about every night  really .         blimey     said nobby  impressed .  he looked down at the protective .     is that why they make you wear that  then .         what do you mean .         well  don   t worry about it     said nobby .     everyone   s got their little secret .  or big secret  as it might be .  even the captain .  he   s only with us because he was brung low by a woman .  that   s what the sergeant says .  brung low .         goodness     said carrot .  it sounded painful .      but i reckon it   s    cos he speaks his mind .  spoke it once too often to the patrician  i heard .  said the thieves    guild was nothing but a pack of thieves  or something .  that   s why he   s with us .  dunno  really .     he looked speculatively at the pavement and then said     so where   re you staying  lad .         there   s a lady called mrs .  palm       carrot began .   nobby choked on some smoke that went the wrong way .      in the shades .     he wheezed .     you   re staying there .         oh  yes .         every night .         well  every day  really .  yes .         and you   ve come here to have a man made of you .         yes .         i don   t think i should like to live where you come from     said nobby .      look     said carrot  thoroughly lost     i came because mr .  varneshi said it was the finest job in the world  upholding the law and everything .  that   s right  isn   t it .         well  er     said nobby .     as to that   i mean  upholding the law   i mean  once  yes  before we had all the guilds and stuff   the law  sort of thing  ain   t really  i mean  these days  everything   s more   oh  i dunno .  basically you just ring your bell and keep your head down .      nobby sighed .  then he grunted  snatched his hourglass from his belt  and peered in at the rapidly draining sand grains .  he put it back  pulled the leather muffler off his bell   s clapper  and shook it once or twice  not very loudly .      twelve of the clock     he muttered     and all   s well .         and that   s it  is it .     said carrot  as the tiny echoes died away .      more or less .  more or less .     nobby took a quick drag on his dog end .      just that .  no moonlight chases across rooftops .  no swinging on chandeliers .  nothing like that .     said carrot .      shouldn   t think so     said nobby fervently .     i never done anything like that .  no one ever said anything to me about that .     he snatched a puff on the cigarette .     a man could catch his death of cold  chasing around on rooftops .  i reckon i   ll stick to the bell  if it   s all the same to you .         can i have a go .     said carrot .   nobby was feeling unbalanced .  it can be the only reason why he made the mistake of wordlessly handing carrot the bell .   carrot examined it for a few seconds .  then he waved it vigorously over his head .      twelve o   clock .     he bellowed .     and all   s weeeeelllll .      the echoes bounced back and forth across the street and finally were overwhelmed by a horrible  thick silence .  several dogs barked somewhere in the night .  a baby started crying .      ssshh .     hissed nobby .      well  it is all well  isn   t it .     said carrot .      it won   t be if you keep on ringing that bloody bell .  give it here .         i don   t understand .     said carrot .     look  i   ve got this book mr .  varneshi gave me       he fumbled for the laws and ordinances .   nobby glanced at them  and shrugged .     never heard of    em     he said .     now just shut up your row .  you don   t want to go making a din like that .  you could attract all sorts .  come on  this way .      he grabbed carrot   s arm and bustled him along the street .      what sorts .     protested carrot as he was pushed determinedly forward .      bad sorts     muttered nobby .      but we   re the watch .         damn right .  and we don   t want to go tangling with people like that .  remember what happened to gaskin .         i don   t remember what happened to gaskin .     said carrot  totally bewildered .     who   s gaskin .         before your time     mumbled nobby .  he deflated a bit .     poor bugger .  could of happened to any of us .     he looked up and glared at carrot .     now stop all this  you hear .  it   s getting on my nerves .  moonlight bloody chases  my bum .      he stalked along the street .  nobby   s normal method of locomotion was a kind of sidle  and the combination of stalking and sidling at the same time created a strange effect  like a crab limping .      but  but     said carrot     in this book it says           i don   t want to know from no book     growled nobby .   carrot looked utterly crestfallen .      but it   s the law       he began .   he was nearly terminally interrupted by an axe that whirred out of a low doorway beside him and bounced off the opposite wall .  it was followed by sounds of splintering timber and breaking glass .      hey  nobby .     said carrot urgently .     there   s a fight going on .      nobby glanced at the doorway .     o   course there is     he said .     it   s a dwarf bar .  worst kind .  you keep out of there  kid .  them little buggers like to trip you up and then kick twelve kinds of shit out of you .  you come along o   nobby and he   ll        he grabbed carrot   s treetrunk arm .  it was like trying to tow a building .   carrot had gone pale .      dwarfs drinking .  and fighting .     he said .      you bet     said nobby .     all the time .  and they use the kind of language i wouldn   t even use to my own dear mother .  you don   t want to mix it with them  they   re a poisonous bunch of   don   t go in there .          no one knows why dwarfs  who at home in the mountains lead quiet  orderly lives  forget it all when they move to the big city .  something comes over even the most blameless iron ore miner and prompts him to wear chain mail all the time  carry an ax  change his name to something like grabthroat shinkicker and drink himself into surly oblivion .   it   s probably because they do live such quiet and orderly lives back home .  after all  probably the first thing a young dwarf wants to do when he hits the big city after seventy years of working for his father at the bottom of a pit is have a big drink and then hit someone .   the fight was one of those enjoyable dwarfish fights with about a hundred participants and one hundred and fifty alliances .  the screams  oaths and the ringing of axes on iron helmets mingled with the sounds of a drunken group by the fireplace who   another dwarfish custom   were singing about gold .   nobby bumped into the back of carrot  who was watching the scene with horror .      look  it   s like this every night in here     said nobby .     don   t interfere  that   s what the sergeant says .  it   s their ethnic folkways  or somethin    .  you don   t go messin    with ethnic folkways .         but  but     carrot stuttered     these are my people .  sort of .  it   s shameful  acting like this .  what must everyone think .         we think they   re mean little buggers     said nobby .     now  come on .      but carrot had waded into the scuffling mass .  he cupped his hands around his mouth and bellowed something in a language nobby didn   t understand .  practically any language including his native one would have fitted that description  but in this case it was dwarfish .      gr   duzk .  gr   duzk .  aak   zt ezem ke bur   k tze tzim .       the fighting stopped .  a hundred bearded faces glared up at carrot   s stooped figure  their annoyance mingled with surprise .   a battered tankard bounced off his breastplate .  carrot reached down and picked up a struggling figure  without apparent effort .      j   uk  ydtruz t   rud eztuza  hudr   zd dezek drez   huk  huzu kruk   t b   tduz g   ke   k me   ek b   tduz t    be   tk kce   drutk ke   hkt   d .  aadb   thuk .       no dwarf had ever heard so many old tongue words from the mouth of anyone over four feet high .  they were astonished .   carrot lowered the offending dwarf to the floor .  there were tears in his eyes .      you   re dwarfs .     he said .     dwarfs shouldn   t be acting like this .  look at you all .  aren   t you ashamed .      one hundred bone hard jaws dropped .      i mean  look at you .     carrot shook his head .     can you imagine what your poor  white bearded old mother  slaving away back in her little hole  wondering how her son is getting on tonight  can you imagine what she   d think if she saw you now .  your own dear mothers  who first showed you how to use a pickax        nobby  standing by the doorway in terror and amazement  was aware of a growing chorus of nose blowings and muffled sobs as carrot went on        she   s probably thinking  i expect he   s having a quiet game of dominoes or something        a nearby dwarf  wearing a helmet encrusted with six inch spikes  started to cry gently into his beer .      and i bet it   s a long time since any of you wrote her a letter  too  and you promised to write every week        nobby absent mindedly took out a grubby handkerchief and passed it to a dwarf who was leaning against the wall  shaking with grief .      now  then     said carrot kindly .     i don   t want to be hard on anyone  but i shall be coming past here every night from now on and i shall expect to see proper standards of dwarf behavior .  i know what it   s like when you   re far from home  but there   s no excuse for this sort of thing .     he touched his helmet .     g   hruk  t   uk .       he gave them all a bright smile and half walked  half crouched out of the bar .  as he emerged into the street nobby tapped him on the arm .      don   t you ever do anything like that to me again     he fumed .     you   re in the city watch .  don   t give me anymore of this law business .         but it is very important     said carrot seriously  trotting after nobby as he sidled into a narrower street .      not as important as stayin    in one piece     said nobby .     dwarf bars .  if you   ve got any sense  my lad  you   ll come in here .  and shut up .      carrot stared up at the building they had reached .  it was set back a little from the mud of the street .  the sounds of considerable drinking were coming from inside .  a battered sign hung over the door .  it showed a drum .      a tavern  is it .     said carrot  thoughtfully .     open at this hour .         don   t see why not     said nobby  pushing open the door .     damn useful idea .  the mended drum .         and more drinking .     carrot thumbed hastily through the book .      i hope so     said nobby .  he nodded to the troll which was employed by the drum as a splatter .      evenin     detritus .  just showing the new lad the ropes .      the troll grunted  and waved a crusted arm .   the inside of the mended drum is now legendary as the most famous disreputable tavern on the discworld  and such a feature of the city that  after recent unavoidable redecorations  the new owner spent days recreating the original patina of dirt  soot and less identifiable substances on the walls and imported a ton of pre rotted rushes for the floor .  the drinkers were the usual bunch of heroes  cut throats  mercenaries  desperadoes and villains  and only microscopic analysis could have told which was which .  thick coils of smoke hung in the air  perhaps to avoid touching the walls .   the conversation dipped fractionally as the two guards wandered in  and then rose to its former level .  a couple of cronies waved to nobby .   he realized that carrot was busy .      what you doin    .     he said .     and no talkin    about mothers  right .         i   m taking notes     said carrot  grimly .     i   ve got a notebook .         that   s the ticket     said nobby .     you   ll like this place .  i comes here every night for my supper .         how do you spell    contravention    .     said carrot  turning over a page .      i don   t     said nobby  pushing through the crowds .  a rare impulse to generosity lodged in his mind .     what d   you want to drink .         i don   t think that would be very appropriate     said carrot .     anyway  strong drink is a mocker .      he was aware of a penetrating stare in the back of his neck  and turned and looked into the big  bland and gentle face of an orangutan .   it was seated at the bar with a pint mug and a bowl of peanuts in front of it .  it tilted its glass amicably toward carrot and then drank deeply and noisily by apparently forming its lower lip into a sort of prehensile funnel and making a noise like a canal being drained .   carrot nudged nobby .      there   s a monk       he began .      don   t say it .     said nobby urgently .     don   t say the word .  it   s the librarian .  works up at the university .  always comes down here for a nightcap of an evening .         and people don   t object .         why should they .     said nobby .     he always stands his round  just like everyone else .      carrot turned and looked at the ape again .  a number of questions pressed for attention  such as  where does it keep its money .  the librarian caught his gaze  misinterpreted it  and gently pushed the bowl of peanuts toward him .   carrot pulled himself to his full impressive height and consulted his notebook .  the afternoon spent reading the laws and ordinances had been well spent .      who is the owner  proprietor  lessee  or landlord of these premises .     he said to nobby .      wassat .     said the small guard .     landlord .  well  i suppose charley here is in charge tonight .  why .     he indicated a large  heavy set man whose face was a net of scars  its owner paused in the act of spreading the dirt more evenly around some glasses by means of a damp cloth  and gave carrot a conspiratorial wink .      charley  this is carrot     said nobby .     he   s stopping along of rosie palm   s .         what  every night .     said charley .   carrot cleared his throat .      if you are in charge     he intoned     then it is my duty to inform you that you are under arrest .         a rest of what  friend .     said charley  still polishing .      under arrest     said carrot     with a view to the presentation of charges to whit    i  that on or about   th grune  at a place called the mended drum  filigree street  you did a  serve or b  did cause to serve alcoholic beverages after the hours of     twelve  midnight  contrary to the provisions of the public ale houses  opening  act of       and    ii  on or about   th grune  at a place called the mended drum  filigree street  you did serve or did cause to serve alcoholic beverages in containers other than of a size and capacity laid down by aforesaid act  and    i  that on or about   th grune  at a place called the mended drum  filigree street  you did allow customers to carry unsheathed edge weapons of a length greater than    seven  inches  contrary to section three of said act and    ii  that on or about   th grune  at a place called the mended drum  filigree street  you did serve alcoholic beverages in premises apparently unlicensed for the sale and or consumption of said beverages  contrary to section three of the aforesaid act .      there was dead silence as carrot turned over another page  and went on     it is also my duty to inform you that it is my intention to lay evidence before the justices with a view to the consideration of charges under the public fore gatherings  gambling  act        the licensed premises  hygiene  acts of                         er  and      through       and also       he glanced sideways at the librarian  who knew trouble when he heard it coming and was hurriedly trying to finish his drink      the domestic and domesticated animals  care and protection  act       .      the silence that followed held a rare quality of breathless anticipation as the assembled company waited to see what would happen next .   charley carefully put down the glass  whose smears had been buffed up to a brilliant shine  and looked down at nobby .   nobby was endeavoring to pretend that he was totally alone and had no connection whatsoever with anyone who might be standing next to him and coincidentally wearing an identical uniform .      what   d he mean  justices .     he said to nobby .     there ain   t no justices .      nobby gave a terrified shrug .      new  is he .     said charley .      make it easy on yourself     said carrot .      this is nothing personal  you understand     said charley to nobby .     it   s just a wossname .  had a wizard in here the other night talking about it .  sort of bendy educational thing  you know .     he appeared to think for a moment .     learning curve .  that was it .  it   s a learning curve .  detritus  get your big stony arse over here a moment .      generally  about this time in the mended drum  someone throws a glass .  and  in fact  this now happened .       captain vimes ran up short street   the longest in the city  which shows the famous morpork subtle sense of humor in a nutshell   with sergeant colon stumbling along behind  protesting .   nobby was outside the drum  hopping from one foot to another .  in times of danger he had a way of propelling himself from place to place without apparently moving through the intervening space which could put any ordinary matter transporter to shame .         e   s fighting in there .     he stuttered  grabbing the captain   s arm .      all by himself .     said the captain .      no  with everyone .     shouted nobby  hopping from one foot to the other .      oh .      conscience said  there   s three of you .  he   s wearing the same uniform .  he   s one of your men .  remember poor old gaskin .   another part of his brain  the hated  despicable part which had nevertheless enabled him to survive in the guards these past ten years  said  it   s rude to butt in .  we   ll wait until he   s finished  and then ask him if he wants any assistance .  besides  it isn   t watch policy to interfere in fights .  it   s a lot simpler to go in afterward and arrest anyone recumbent .   there was a crash as a nearby window burst outward and deposited a stunned fighter on the opposite side of the street .      i think     said the captain carefully     that we   d better take prompt action .         that   s right     said sgt .  colon     a man could get hurt standing here .      they sidled cautiously a little way down the street  where the sound of splintering wood and breaking glass wasn   t so overpowering  and carefully avoided one another   s eyes .  there was the occasional scream from within the tavern  and every now and again a mysterious ringing noise  as though someone was hitting a gong with their knee .   they stood in a little pool of embarrassed silence .      you had your holidays this year  sergeant .     said captain vimes eventually  rocking back and forth on his heels .      yessir .  sent the wife to quirm last month  sir  to see her aunt .         very nice at this time of year  i   m told .         yessir .         all the geraniums and whatnot .      a figure tumbled out of an upper window and crumpled on the cobbles .      that   s where they   ve got the floral sundial  isn   t it .     said the captain desperately .      yessir .  very nice  sir .  all done with little flowers  sir .      there was a sound like something hitting something else repeatedly with something heavy and wooden .  vimes winced .      i don   t think he   d of been happy in the watch  sir     said the sergeant  in a kindly voice .   the door of the mended drum had been torn off during riots so often that specially tempered hinges had recently been installed  and the fact that the next tremendous crash tore the whole door and doorframe out of the wall only showed that quite a lot of money had been wasted .  a figure in the midst of the wreckage tried to raise itself on its elbows  groaned  and slumped back .      well  it would seem that it   s all       the captain began  and nobby said     it   s that bloody troll .         what .     said vimes .      it   s the troll .  the one they have on the door .      they advanced with extreme caution .   it was  indeed  detritus the splatter .   it is very difficult to hurt a creature that is  to all intents and purposes  a mobile stone .  someone seemed to have managed it  though .  the fallen figure was groaning like a couple of bricks being crushed together .      that   s a turnup for the books     said the sergeant vaguely .  all three of them turned and peered at the brightly lit rectangle where the doorway had been .  things had definitely quietened down a bit in there .      you don   t think     said the sergeant     that he   s winning  do you .      the captain thrust out his jaw .     we owe it to our colleague and fellow officer     he said     to find out .      there was a whimper from behind them .  they turned and saw nobby hopping on one leg and clutching a foot .      what   s up with you  man .     said vimes .   nobby made agonized noises .   sergeant colon began to understand .  although cautious obsequiousness was the general tenor of watch behavior  there wasn   t one member of the entire squad who hadn   t  at some time  been at the wrong end of detritus   s fists .  nobby had merely tried to play catch up in the very best traditions of policemen everywhere .      he went and kicked him inna rocks  sir     he said .      disgraceful     said the captain vaguely .  he hesitated .     do trolls have rocks .     he said .      take it from me  sir .         good grief     vimes said .     dame nature moves in strange ways  doesn   t she .         right you are  sir     said the sergeant obediently .      and now     said the captain  drawing his sword     forward .         yessir .         this means you too  sergeant     the captain added .      yessir .          it was possibly the most circumspect advance in the history of military maneuvers  right down at the bottom end of the scale that things like the charge of the light brigade are at the top of .   they peered cautiously around the ravished doorway .   there were a number of people sprawled across the tables  or what remained of the tables .  those who were still conscious looked unhappy about it .   carrot stood in the middle of the floor .  his rusty chain mail was torn  his helmet was missing  he was swaying a little from side to side and one eye was already starting to swell  but he recognized the captain  dropped the feebly protesting customer he was holding  and threw a salute .      beg to report thirty one offenses of making an affray  sir  and fifty six cases of riotous behavior  forty one offenses of obstructing an officer of the watch in the execution of his duty  thirteen offenses of assault with a deadly weapon  six cases of malicious lingering  and   and   corporal nobby hasn   t even shown me one rope yet        he fell backward  breaking a table .   captain vimes coughed .  he wasn   t at all sure what you were supposed to do next .  as far as he knew  the watch had never been in this position before .      i think you should get him a drink  sergeant     he said .      yessir .         and get me one  too .         yessir .         have one yourself  why don   t you .         yessir .         and you  corporal  will you please   what are you doing .         searchingthebodiesir     said nobby quickly  straightening up .     for incriminating evidence  and that .         in their money pouches .      nobby thrust his hands behind his back .     you never know  sir     he said .   the sergeant had located a miraculously unbroken bottle of spirits in the wreckage and forced a lot of its contents between carrot   s lips .      what we going to do with all this lot  captain .     he said over his shoulder .      i haven   t the faintest idea     said vimes  sitting down .  the watch jail was just about big enough for six very small people  which were usually the only sort to be put in it .  whereas these     he looked around him desperately .  there was nork the impaler  lying under a table and making bubbling noises .  there was big henri .  there was grabber simmons  one of the most feared barroom fighters in the city .  all in all  there were a lot of people it wouldn   t pay to be near when they woke up .      we could cut their froats  sir     said nobby  veteran of a score of residual battlefields .  he had found an unconscious fighter who was about the right size and was speculatively removing his boots  which looked quite new and about the right size .      that would be entirely wrong     said vimes .  he wasn   t sure how you actually went about cutting a throat .  it had never hitherto been an option .      no     he said     i think perhaps we   ll let them off with a caution .      there was a groan from under the bench .      besides     he went on quickly     we should get our fallen comrade to a place of safety as soon as possible .         good point     said the sergeant .  he took a swig of the spirits  for the sake of his nerves .   the two of them managed to sling carrot between them and guide his wobbling legs up the steps .  vimes  collapsing under the weight  looked around for nobby .      corporal nobbs     he rasped     why are you kicking people when they   re down .         safest way  sir     said nobby .   nobby had long ago been told about fighting fair and not striking a fallen opponent  and had then given some creative thought to how these rules applied to someone four feet tall with the muscle tone of an elastic band .      well  stop it .  i want you to caution the felons     said the captain .      how  sir .         well  you       captain vimes stopped .  he was blowed if he knew .  he   d never done it .      just do it     he snapped .     surely i don   t have to tell you everything .      nobby was left alone at the top of the stairs .  a general muttering and groaning from the floor indicated that people were waking up .  nobby thought quickly .  he shook an admonitory cheese straw of a finger .      let that be a lesson to you     he said .     don   t do it again .      and ran for it .   up in the darkness of the rafters the librarian scratched himself reflectively .  life was certainly full of surprises .  he was going to watch developments with interest .  he shelled a thoughtful peanut with his feet  and swung away into the darkness .   the supreme grand master raised his hands .      are the thuribles of destiny ritually chastised  that evil and loose thinking may be banished from this sanctified circle .         yep .          the supreme grand master lowered his hands .      yep .     he said .      yep     said brother dunnykin happily .     done it myself .         you are supposed to say    yea  o supreme one        said the supreme grand master .     honestly  i   ve told you enough times  if you   re not all going to enter into the spirit of the thing           yes  you listen to what the supreme grand master tells you     said brother watchtower  glaring at the errant brother .      i spent hours chastising them thuribles     muttered brother dunnykin .      carry on  o supreme grand master     said brother watchtower .      very well  then     said the grand master .     tonight we   ll try another experimental summoning .  i trust you have obtained suitable raw material  brothers .            scrubbed and scrubbed  not that you get any thanks           all sorted out  supreme grand master     said brother watchtower .   it was  the grand master conceded  a slightly better collection .  the brothers had certainly been busy .  pride of place was given to an illuminated tavern sign whose removal  the grand master thought  should have merited some sort of civic award .  at the moment the e was a ghastly pink and flashed on and off at random .      i got that     said brother watchtower proudly .     they thought i was mending it or something  but i took my screwdriver and i           yes  well done     said the supreme grand master .     shows initiative .         thank you  supreme grand master     beamed brother watchtower .         knuckles rubbed raw  all red and cracked .  never even got my three dollars back  either  no one as much as says           and now     said the supreme grand master  taking up the book     we will begin to commence .  shut up  brother dunnykin .          every town in the multiverse has a part that is something like ankh morpork   s shades .  it   s usually the oldest part  its lanes faithfully following the original tracks of medieval cows going down to the river  and they have names like the shambles  the rookery  sniggs alley     most of ankh morpork is like that in any case .  but the shades was even more so  a sort of black hole of bred in the brickwork lawlessness .  put it like this  even the criminals were afraid to walk the streets .  the watch didn   t set foot in it .   they were accidentally setting foot in it now .  not very reliably .  it had been a trying night  and they had been steadying their nerves .  they were now so steady that all four were relying on the other three to keep them upright and steer .   captain vimes passed the bottle back to the sergeant .      shame on  on  on     he thought for a bit     you     he said .     drun    in fron    of a super  super  superererer ofisiler .      the sergeant tried to speak  but could only come out with a series of esses .      put yoursel    onna charge     said captain vimes  rebounding off a wall .  he glared at the brickwork .     this wall assaulted me     he declared .     hah .  think you   re tough  eh .  well     m a ofisler of  of  of the law  i   ll have you know  and we don    take any  any  any .      he blinked slowly  once or twice .      what   s it we don    take any of  sar   nt .     he said .      chances  sir .     said colon .      no  no  no .  s   other stuff .  never mind .  anyway  we don    take any of  of  of it from anyone .     vague visions were trotting through his mind  of a room full of criminal types  people that had jeered at him  people whose very existence had offended and taunted him for years  lying around and groaning .  he was a little unclear how it had happened  but some almost forgotten part of him  some much younger vimes with a bright shining breastplate and big hopes  a vimes he thought the alcohol had long ago drowned  was suddenly restless .      shallie  shallie  shallie tell you something  sarn   t .     he said .      sir .     the four of them bounced gently off another wall and began another slow crabwise waltz across the alley .      this city .  this city .  this city  sarn   t .  this city is a  is a  is a woman  sarn   t .  so t   is .  a woman  sarn   t .  ancient raddled old beauty  sarn   t .  butifyoufallinlovewithher  then  then  then shekicksyouinnateeth              s woman .     said colon .   he screwed up his sweating face with the effort of thought .         s eight miles wide  sir .     s gotta river in it .  lots of  of houses and stuff  sir     he reasoned .      ah .  ah .  ah .     vimes waggled an unsteady finger at him .     never  never  never said it wasa small woman  did i .  be fair .     he waved the bottle .  another random thought exploded in the froth of his mind .      we showed    em  anyway     he said excitedly  as the four of them began an oblique shuffle back to the opposite wall .     showed them  dint we .  taught thema forget they won   t lesson inna hurry  eh .         s   right     said the sergeant  but not very enthusiastically .  he was still wondering about his superior officer   s sex life .   but vimes was in the kind of mood that didn   t need encouragement .      hah .     he shouted  at the dark alleyways .     don    like it  eh .  taste of your  your  your own medicine thingy .  well  now you can bootle in your trems .     he threw the empty bottle into the air .      two o   clock .     he yelled .     and all   s weeeellll .      which was astonishing news to the various shadowy figures who had been silently shadowing the four of them for some time .  only sheer puzzlement had prevented them making their attentions sharp and plain .  these people are clearly guards  they were thinking  they   ve got the right helmets and everything  and yet here they are in the shades .  so they were being watched with the fascination that a pack of wolves might focus on a handful of sheep who had not only trotted into the clearing  but were making playful butts and baa ing noises  the outcome was  of course  going to be mutton but in the meantime inquisitiveness gave a stay of execution .   carrot raised his muzzy head .      where   re we .     he groaned .      on our way home     said the sergeant .  he looked up at the pitted  worm eaten and knife scored sign above them .     we   re jus    goin    down  goin    down  goin    down       he squinted      sweetheart lane .         sweetheart lane s   not on the way home     slurred nobby .     we wouldn   t wanta go down sweetheart lane  it   s in the shades .  catch us goin    down sweetheart lane        there was a crowded moment in which realization did the icy work of a good night   s sleep and several pints of black coffee .  the three of them  by unspoken agreement  clustered up toward carrot .      what we gonna do  captain .     said colon .      er .  we could call for help     said the captain uncertainly .      what  here .         you   ve got a point .         i reckon we must of turned left out of silver street instead of right     quavered nobby .      well  that   s one mistake we won   t make again in a hurry     said the captain .  then he wished he hadn   t .   they could hear footsteps .  somewhere off to their left  there was a snigger .      we must form a square     said the captain .  they all tried to form a point .      hey .  what was that .     said sergeant colon .      what .         there it was again .  sort of a leathery sound .      captain vimes tried not to think about hoods and garrotting .   there were  he knew  many gods .  there was a god for every trade .  there was a beggars    god  a whores    goddess  a thieves    god  probably even an assassins    god .   he wondered whether there was  somewhere in that vast pantheon  a god who would look kindly on hard pressed and fairly innocent law enforcement officers who were quite definitely about to die .   there probably wasn   t  he thought bitterly .  something like that wasn   t stylish enough for gods .  catch any god worrying about any poor sod trying to do his best for a handful of dollars a month .  not them .  gods went overboard for smart bastards whose idea of a day   s work was prising the ruby eye of the earwig king out of its socket  not for some unimaginative sap who just pounded the pavement every night        more sort of slithery     said the sergeant  who liked to get things right .   and then there was a sound        perhaps a volcanic sound  or the sound of a boiling geyser  but at any rate a long  dry roar of a sound  like the bellows in the forges of the titans        but it was not so bad as the light  which was blue white and the sort of light to print the pattern of your eyeballs    blood vessels on the back of the inside of your skull .   they both went on for hundreds of years and then  instantly  stopped .   the dark aftermath was filled with purple images and  once the ears regained an ability to hear  a faint  clinkery sound .   the guards remained perfectly still for some time .      well  well     said the captain weakly .   after a further pause he said  very clearly  every consonant slotting perfectly into place     sergeant  take some men and investigate that  will you .         investigate what  sir .     said colon  but it had already dawned on the captain that if the sergeant took some men it would leave him  captain vimes  all alone .      no  i   ve a better idea .  we   ll all go     he said firmly .  they all went .   now that their eyes were used to the darkness they could see an indistinct red glow ahead of them .   it turned out to be a wall  cooling rapidly .  bits of calcined brickwork were falling off as they contracted  making little pinging noises .   that wasn   t the worst bit .  the worst bit was what was on the wall .   they stared at it .   they stared at it for a long time .   it was only an hour or two till dawn  and no one even suggested trying to find their way back in the dark .  they waited by the wall .  at least it was warm .   they tried not to look at it .   eventually colon stretched uneasily and said     chin up  captain .  it could have been worse .      vimes finished the bottle .  it didn   t have any effect .  there were some types of sobriety that you just couldn   t budge .      yes     he said .     it could have been us .          the supreme grand master opened his eyes .      once again     he said     we have achieved success .      the brethren burst into a ragged cheer .  the brothers watchtower and fingers linked arms and danced an enthusiastic jig in their magic circle .   the supreme grand master took a deep breath .   first the carrot  he thought  and now the stick .  he liked the stick .      silence .     he screamed .      brother fingers  brother watchtower  cease this shameful display .     he screeched .     the rest of you  be silent .      they quietened down  like rowdy children who have just seen the teacher come into the room .  then they quietened down a lot more  like children who have just seen the teacher   s expression .   the supreme grand master let this sink in  and then stalked along their ragged ranks .      i suppose     he said     that we think we   ve done some magic  do we .  hmm .  brother watchtower .      brother watchtower swallowed .     well  er  you said we were  er  i mean           you haven   t done anything yet .         well  er  no  er       brother watchtower trembled .      do real wizards leap about after a tiny spell and start chanting    here we go  here we go  here we go     brother watchtower .  hmm .         well  we were sort of        the supreme grand master spun on his heel .      and do they keep looking apprehensively at the woodwork  brother plasterer .      brother plasterer hung his head .  he hadn   t realized anyone had noticed .   when the tension was twanging satisfactorily  like a bowstring  the supreme grand master stood back .      why do i bother .     he said  shaking his head .     i could have chosen anyone .  i could have picked the best .  but i   ve got a bunch of children .         er  honest     said brother watchtower     we was making an effort  i mean  we was really concentrating .  weren   t we  lads .         yes     they chorused .  the supreme grand master glared at them .      there   s no room in this brotherhood for brothers who are not behind us all the way     he warned .   with almost visible relief the brethren  like panicked sheep who see that a hurdle has been opened in the fold  galloped toward the opening .      no worries about that  your supremity     said brother watchtower fervently .      commitment must be our watchword .     said the supreme grand master .      watchword .  yeah     said brother watchtower .  he nudged brother plasterer  whose eyes had strayed to the skirting board again .      wha .  oh .  yeah .  watchword .  yeah     said brother plasterer .      and trust and fraternity     said the supreme grand master .      yeah .  and them  too     said brother fingers .      so     said the supreme grand master     if there be any one here not anxious  yea  eager to continue in this great work  let him step forward now .      no one moved .   they   re hooked .  ye gods  i   m good at this  thought the supreme grand master .  i can play on their horrible little minds like a xylophone .  it   s amazing  the sheer power of mundanity .  who   d have thought that weakness could be a greater force than strength .  but you have to know how to direct it .  and i do .      very well  then     he said .     and now  we will repeat the oath .      he led their stumbling  terrified voices through it  noting with approval the strangled way they said    figgin    .     and he kept one eye on brother fingers  too .   he   s slightly brighter than the others  he thought .  slightly less gullible  at least .  better make sure i   m always the last to leave .  don   t want any clever ideas about following me home .       you need a special kind of mind to rule a city like ankh morpork  and lord vetinari had it .  but then  he was a special kind of person .   he baffled and infuriated the lesser merchant princes  to the extent that they had long ago given up trying to assassinate him and now merely jockeyed for position among themselves .  anyway  any assassin who tried to attack the patrician would be hard put to it to find enough flesh to insert the dagger .   while other lords dined on larks stuffed with peacocks    tongues  lord vetinari considered that a glass of boiled water and half a slice of dry bread was an elegant sufficiency .   it was exasperating .  he appeared to have no vice that anyone could discover .  you   d have thought  with that pale  equine face  that he   d incline toward stuff with whips  needles  and young women in dungeons .  the other lords could have accepted that .  nothing wrong with whips and needles  in moderation .  but the patrician apparently spent his evenings studying reports and  on special occasions  if he could stand the excitement  playing chess .   he wore black a lot .  it wasn   t particularly impressive black  such as the best assassins wore  but the sober  slightly shabby black of a man who doesn   t want to waste time in the mornings wondering what to wear .  and you had to get up very early in the morning to get the better of the patrician  in fact  it was wiser not to go to bed at all .   but he was popular  in a way .  under his hand  for the first time in a thousand years  ankh morpork operated .  it might not be fair or just or particularly democratic  but it worked .  he tended it as one tends a topiary bush  encouraging a growth here  pruning an errant twig there .  it was said that he would tolerate absolutely anything apart from anything that threatened the city    and here it was     he stared at the stricken wall for a long time  while the rain dripped off his chin and soaked his clothes .  behind him  wonse hovered nervously .   then one long  thin  blue veined hand reached out and the fingertips traced the shadows .   well  not so much shadows  more a series of silhouettes .  the outline was very distinct .  inside  there was the familiar pattern of brickwork .  outside  though  something had fused the wall in a rather nice ceramic substance  giving the ancient flettons a melted  mirror like finish .   the shapes outlined in brickwork showed a tableau of six men frozen in an attitude of surprise .  various upraised hands had quite clearly been holding knives and cutlasses .   the patrician looked down silently on the pile of ash at his feet .  a few streaks of molten metal might once have been the very same weapons that were now so decisively etched into the wall .      hmm     he said .   captain vimes respectfully led him across the lane and into fast luck alley  where he pointed out exhibit a  to whit        footprints     he said .     which is stretching it a bit  sir .  they   re more what you   d call claws .  one might go so far as to say talons .      the patrician stared at the prints in the mud .  his expression was quite unreadable .      i see     he said eventually .     and do you have an opinion about all this  captain .      the captain did .  in the hours until dawn he   d had all sorts of opinions  starting with a conviction that it had been a big mistake to be born .   and then the gray light had filtered even into the shades  and he was still alive and uncooked  and had looked around him with an expression of idiot relief and seen  not a yard away  these footprints .  that had not been a good moment to be sober .      well  sir     he said     i know that dragons have been extinct for thousands of years  sir           yes .     the patrician   s eyes narrowed .   vimes plunged on .     but  sir  the thing is  do they know .  sergeant colon said he heard a leathery sound just before  just before  just before the  er   offense .         so you think an extinct  and indeed a possibly entirely mythical  dragon flew into the city  landed in this narrow alley  incinerated a group of criminals  and then flew away .     said the patrician .     one might say  it was a very public spirited creature .         well  when you put it like that           if i recall  the dragons of legend were solitary and rural creatures who shunned people and dwelt in forsaken  out of the way places     said the patrician .     they were hardly urban creatures .         no  sir     said the captain  repressing a comment that if you wanted to find a really forsaken  out of the way place then the shades would fit the bill pretty well .      besides     said lord vetinari     one would imagine that someone would have noticed  wouldn   t you agree .      the captain nodded at the wall and its dreadful frieze .     apart from them  you mean  sir .         in my opinion     said lord vetinari     it   s some kind of warfare .  possibly a rival gang has hired a wizard .  a little local difficulty .         could be linked to all this strange thieving  sir     volunteered wonse .      but there   s the footprints  sir     said vimes doggedly .      we   re close to the river     said the patrician .     possibly it was  perhaps  a wading bird of some sort .  a mere coincidence     he added     but i should cover them over  if i were you .  we don   t want people getting the wrong idea and jumping to silly conclusions  do we .     he added sharply .   vimes gave in .      as you wish  sir     he said  looking at his sandals .   the patrician patted him on the shoulder .      never mind     he said .     carry on .  good show of initiative  that man .  patrolling in the shades  too .  well done .      he turned  and almost walked into the wall of chain mail that was carrot .   to his horror  captain vimes saw his newest recruit point politely to the patrician   s coach .  around it  fully armed and wary  were six members of the palace guard  who straightened up and took a wary interest .  vimes disliked them intensely .  they had plumes on their helmets .  he hated plumes on a guard .   he heard carrot say     excuse me  sir  is this your coach  sir .     and the patrician looked him blankly up and down and said     it is .  who are you  young man .      carrot saluted .     lance constable carrot  sir .         carrot  carrot .  that name rings a bell .      lupine wonse  who had been hovering behind him  whispered in the patrician   s ear .  his face brightened .     ah  the young thief taker .  a little error there  i think  but commendable .  no person is above the law  eh .         no  sir     said carrot .      commendable  commendable     said the patrician .     and now  gentlemen           about your coach  sir     said carrot doggedly     i couldn   t help noticing that the front offside wheel  contrary to the        he   s going to arrest the patrician  vimes told himself  the thought trickling through his brain like an icy rivulet .  he   s actually going to arrest the patrician .  the supreme ruler .  he   s going to arrest him .  this is what he   s actually going to do .  the boy doesn   t know the meaning of the word    fear .     oh  wouldn   t it be a good idea if he knew the meaning of the word    survival        and i can   t get my jaw muscles to move .   we   re all dead .  or worse  we   re all detained at the patrician   s pleasure .  and as we all know  he   s seldom that pleased .   it was at this precise moment that sergeant colon earned himself a metaphorical medal .      lance constable carrot .     he shouted .     attention .  lance constable carrot  abou uta turna .  lance constable carrot  quiuck marcha .      carrot brought himself to attention like a barn being raised and stared straight ahead with a ferocious expression of acute obedience .      well done  that man     said the patrician thoughtfully  as carrot strode stiffly away .     carry on  captain .  and do come down heavily on any silly rumors about dragons  right .         yes  sir     said captain vimes .      good man .      the coach rattled off  the bodyguard running alongside .   behind him  captain vimes was only vaguely aware of the sergeant yelling at the retreating carrot to stop .   he was thinking .   he looked at the prints in the mud .  he used his regulation pike  which he knew was exactly seven feet long  to measure their size and the distance between them .  he whistled under his breath .  then  with considerable caution  he followed the alley around the corner  it led to a small  padlocked and dirt encrusted door in the back of a timber warehouse .   there was something very wrong  he thought .   the prints come out of the alley  but they don   t go in .  and we don   t often get any wading birds in the ankh  mainly because the pollution would eat their legs away and anyway  it   s easier for them to walk on the surface .   he looked up .  a myriad washing lines criss crossed the narrow rectangle of the sky as efficiently as a net .   so  he thought  something big and fiery came out of this alley but didn   t come into it .   and the patrician is very worried about it .   i   ve been told to forget about it .   he noticed something else at the side of the alley  and bent down and picked up a fresh  empty peanut shell .   he tossed it from hand to hand  staring at nothing .   right now  he needed a drink .  but perhaps it ought to wait .       the librarian knuckled his way urgently along the dark aisles between the slumbering bookshelves .   the rooftops of the city belonged to him .  oh  assassins and thieves might make use of them  but he   d long ago found the forest of chimneys  buttresses  gargoyles and weathervanes a convenient and somehow comforting alternative to the streets .   at least  up until now .   it had seemed amusing and instructive to follow the watch into the shades  an urban jungle which held no fears for a     lb .  ape .  but now the nightmare he had seen while brachiating across a dark alley would  if he had been human  have made him doubt the evidence of his own eyes .   as an ape  he had no doubts whatsoever about his eyes and believed them all the time .   right now he wanted to concentrate them urgently on a book that might hold a clue .  it was in a section no one bothered with much these days  the books in there were not really magical .  dust lay accusingly on the floor .   dust with footprints in it .      oook .     said the librarian  in the warm gloom .   he proceeded cautiously now  realizing with a sense of inevitability that the footprints seemed to have the same destination in mind as he did .   he turned a corner and there it was .   the section .   the bookcase .   the shelf .   the gap .   there are many horrible sights in the multiverse .  somehow  though  to a soul attuned to the subtle rhythms of a library  there are few worse sights than a hole where a book ought to be .   someone had stolen a book .       in the privacy of the oblong office  his personal sanctum  the patrician paced up and down .  he was dictating a stream of instructions .      and send some men to paint that wall     he finished .   lupine wonse raised an eyebrow .      is that wise  sir .     he said .      you don   t think a frieze of ghastly shadows will cause comment and speculation .     said the patrician sourly .      not as much as fresh paint in the shades     said wonse evenly .   the patrician hesitated a moment .     good point     he snapped .     have some men demolish it .      he reached the end of the room  spun on his heel  and stalked up it again .  dragons .  as if there were not enough important  enough real things to take up his time .      do you believe in dragons .     he said .   wonse shook his head .     they   re impossible  sir .         so i   ve heard     said lord vetinari .  he reached the opposite wall  turned .      would you like me to investigate further .     said wonse .      yes .  do so .         and i shall ensure the watch take great care     said wonse .   the patrician stopped his pacing .     the watch .  the watch .  my dear chap  the watch are a bunch of incompetents commanded by a drunkard .  it   s taken me years to achieve it .  the last thing we need to concern ourselves with is the watch .      he thought for a moment .     ever seen a dragon  wonse .  one of the big ones  i mean .  oh  they   re impossible .  you said .         they   re just legend  really .  superstition     said wonse .      hmm     said the patrician .     and the thing about legends  of course  is that they are legendary .         exactly  sir .         even so       the patrician paused  and stared at wonse for some time .     oh  well     he said .     sort it out .  i   m not having any of this dragon business .  it   s the type of thing that makes people restless .  put a stop to it .      when he was alone he stood and looked out gloomily over the twin city .  it was drizzling again .   ankh morpork .  brawling city of a hundred thousand souls .  and  as the patrician privately observed  ten times that number of actual people .  the fresh rain glistened on the panorama of towers and rooftops  all unaware of the teeming  rancorous world it was dropping into .  luckier rain fell on upland sheep  or whispered gently over forests  or pattered somewhat incestuously into the sea .  rain that fell on ankh morpork though  was rain that was in trouble .  they did terrible things to water  in ankh morpork .  being drunk was only the start of its problems .   the patrician liked to feel that he was looking out over a city that worked .  not a beautiful city  or a renowned city  or a well drained city  and certainly not an architecturally favored city  even its most enthusiastic citizens would agree that  from a high point of vantage  ankh morpork looked as though someone had tried to achieve in stone and wood an effect normally associated with the pavements outside all night takeaways .   but it worked .  it spun along cheerfully like a gyroscope on the lip of a catastrophe curve .  and this  the patrician firmly believed  was because no one group was ever powerful enough to push it over .  merchants  thieves  assassins  wizards   all competed energetically in the race without really realizing that it needn   t be a race at all  and certainly not trusting one another enough to stop and wonder who had marked out the course and was holding the starting flag .   the patrician disliked the word    dictator .     it affronted him .  he never told anyone what to do .  he didn   t have to  that was the wonderful part .  a large part of his life consisted of arranging matters so that this state of affairs continued .   of course  there were various groups seeking his overthrow  and this was right and proper and the sign of a vigorous and healthy society .  no one could call him unreasonable about the matter .  why  hadn   t he founded most of them himself .  and what was so beautiful was the way in which they spent nearly all their time bickering with one another .   human nature  the patrician always said  was a marvelous thing .  once you understood where its levers were .   he had an unpleasant premonition about this dragon business .  if ever there was a creature that didn   t have any obvious levers  it was a dragon .  it would have to be sorted out .   the patrician didn   t believe in unnecessary cruelty .   he did not believe in pointless revenge .  but he was a great believer in the need for things to be sorted out .       funnily enough  captain vimes was thinking the same thing .  he found he didn   t like the idea of citizens  even of the shades  being turned into a mere ceramic tint .   and it had been done in front of the watch  more or less .  as if the watch didn   t matter  as if the watch was just an irrelevant detail .  that was what rankled .   of course  it was true .  that only made it worse .   what was making him even angrier was that he had disobeyed orders .  he had scuffed up the tracks  certainly .  but in the bottom drawer of his ancient desk  hidden under a pile of empty bottles  was a plaster cast .  he could feel it staring at him through three layers of wood .   he couldn   t imagine what had got into him .  and now he was going even further out onto the limb .   he reviewed his  for want of a better word  troops .  he   d asked the senior pair to turn up in plain clothes .  this meant that sergeant colon  who   d worn uniform all his life  was looking red faced and uncomfortable in the suit he wore for funerals .  whereas nobby        i wonder if i made the word    plain    clear enough .     said captain vimes .      it   s what i wear outside work  guv     said nobby reproachfully .      sir     corrected sergeant colon .      my voice is in plain clothes too     said nobby .     initiative  that is .      vimes walked slowly around the corporal .      and your plain clothes do not cause old women to faint and small boys to run after you in the street .     he said .   nobby shifted uneasily .  he wasn   t at home with irony .      no  sir  guv     he said .     it   s all the go  this style .      this was broadly true .  there was a current fad in ankh for big  feathered hats  ruffs  slashed doublets with gold frogging  flared pantaloons and boots with ornamental spurs .  the trouble was  vimes reflected  that most of the fashion conscious had more body to go between these component bits  whereas all that could be said of corporal nobbs was that he was in there somewhere .   it might be advantageous .  after all  absolutely no one would ever believe  when they saw him coming down the street  that here was a member of the watch trying to look inconspicuous .   it occurred to vimes that he knew absolutely nothing about nobbs outside working hours .  he couldn   t even remember where the man lived .  all these years he   d known the man and he   d never realized that  in his secret private life  corporal nobbs was a bit of a peacock .  a very short peacock  it was true  a peacock that had been hit repeatedly with something heavy  perhaps  but a peacock nonetheless .  it just went to show  you never could tell .   he brought his attention back to the business in hand .      i want you two     he said to nobbs and colon     to mingle unobtrusively  or obtrusively in your case  corporal nobbs  with people tonight and  er  see if you can detect anything unusual .         unusual like what .     said the sergeant .   vimes hesitated .  he wasn   t exactly sure himself .     anything     he said     pertinent .         ah .     the sergeant nodded wisely .     pertinent .  right .      there was an awkward silence .      maybe people have seen weird things     said captain vimes .     or perhaps there have been unexplained fires .  or footprints .  you know     he finished  desperately     signs of dragons .         you mean  like  piles of gold what have been slept on     said the sergeant .      and virgins being chained to rocks     said nobbs  knowingly .      i can see you   re experts     sighed vimes .     just do the best you can .         this mingling     said sergeant colon delicately     it would involve going into taverns and drinking and similar  would it .         to a certain extent     said vimes .      ah     said the sergeant  happily .      in moderation .         right you are  sir .         and at your own expense .         oh .         but before you go     said the captain     do either of you know anyone who might know anything about dragons .  apart from sleeping on gold and the bit with the young women  i mean .         wizards would     volunteered nobby .      apart from wizards     said vimes firmly .  you couldn   t trust wizards .  every guard knew you couldn   t trust wizards .  they were even worse than civilians .   colon thought about it .     there   s always lady ramkin     he said .     lives in scoone avenue .  breeds swamp dragons .  you know  the little buggers people keep as pets .         oh  her     said vimes gloomily .     i think i   ve seen her around .  the one with the    whinny if you love dragons    sticker on the back of her carriage .         that   s her .  she   s mental     said sergeant colon .     what do you want me to do  sir .     said carrot .      er .  you have the most important job     said vimes hurriedly .     i want you to stay here and watch the office .      carrot   s face broadened in a slow  unbelieving grin .      you mean i   m left in charge  sir .     he said .      in a manner of speaking     said vimes .     but you   re not allowed to arrest anyone  understand .     he added quickly .      not even if they   re breaking the law  sir .         not even then .  just make a note of it .         i   ll read my book  then     said carrot .     and polish my helmet .         good boy     said the captain .  it should be safe enough  he thought .  no one ever comes in here  not even to report a lost dog .  no one ever thinks about the watch .  you   d have to be really out of touch to go to the watch for help  he thought bitterly .       scoone avenue was a wide  tree lined  and incredibly select part of ankh  high enough above the river to be away from its all pervading smell .  people in scoone avenue had old money  which was supposed to be much better than new money  although captain vimes had never had enough of either to spot the difference .  people in scoone avenue had their own personal bodyguards .  people in scoone avenue were said to be so aloof they wouldn   t even talk to the gods .  this was a slight slander .  they would talk to gods  if they were well bred gods of decent family .   lady ramkin   s house was not hard to find .  it commanded an outcrop that gave it a magnificent view of the city  if that was your idea of a good time .  there were stone dragons on the gatepost  and the gardens had an unkempt overgrown look .  statues of ramkins long gone loomed up out of the greenery .  most of them had swords and were covered in ivy up to the neck .   vimes sensed that this was not because the garden   s owner was too poor to do anything about it  but rather that the garden   s owner thought there were much more important things than ancestors  which was a pretty unusual point of view for an aristocrat .   they also apparently thought that there were more important things than property repair .  when he rang the bell of the rather pleasant old house itself  in the middle of a flourishing rhododendron forest  several bits of the plaster facade fell off .   that seemed to be the only effect  except that something around the back of the house started to howl  some things .   it started to rain again .  after a while vimes felt the dignity of his position and cautiously edged around the building  keeping well back in case anything else collapsed .   he reached a heavy wooden gate in a heavy wooden wall .  in contrast with the general decrepitude of the rest of the place  it seemed comparatively new and very solid .       he knocked .  this caused another fusillade of strange whistling noises .   the door opened .  something dreadful loomed over him .      ah  good man .  do you know anything about mating .     it boomed .       it was quiet and warm in the watch house .  carrot listened to the hissing of sand in the hourglass and concentrated on buffing up his breastplate .  centuries of tarnish had given up under his cheerful onslaught .  it gleamed .   you knew where you were with a shiny breastplate .  the strangeness of the city  where they had all these laws and concentrated on ignoring them  was too much for him .  but a shiny breastplate was a breastplate well shined .   the door opened .  he peered across the top of the ancient desk .  there was no one there .   he tried a few more industrious rubs .   there was the vague sound of someone who had got fed up with waiting .  two purple fingernailed hands grasped the edge of the desk  and the librarian   s face rose slowly into view like an early morning coconut .      oook     he said .   carrot stared .  it had been explained to him carefully that  contrary to appearances  laws governing the animal kingdom did not apply to the librarian .  on the other hand  the librarian himself was never very interested in obeying the laws governing the human kingdom  either .  he was one of those little anomalies you have to build around .      hallo     said carrot uncertainly .      don   t call him    boy    or pat him  that always gets him annoyed .          oook .      the librarian prodded the desk with a long  many jointed finger .      what .         oook .         sorry .      the librarian rolled his eyes .  it was strange  he felt  that so called intelligent dogs  horses and dolphins never had any difficulty indicating to humans the vital news of the moment  e . g .   that the three children were lost in the cave  or the train was about to take the line leading to the bridge that had been washed away or similar  while he  only a handful of chromosomes away from wearing a vest  found it difficult to persuade the average human to come in out of the rain .  you just couldn   t talk to some people .      oook .     he said  and beckoned .      i can   t leave the office     said carrot .     i   ve had orders .      the librarian   s upper lip rolled back like a blind .      is that a smile .     said carrot .  the librarian shook his head .      someone hasn   t committed a crime  have they .     said carrot .      oook .         a bad crime .         oook .         like murder .         eeek .         worse than murder .         eeek .     the librarian knuckled over to the door and bounced up and down urgently .   carrot gulped .  orders were orders  yes  but this was something else .  the people in this city were capable of anything .   he buckled on his breastplate  screwed his sparkling helmet onto his head  and strode toward the door .   then he remembered his responsibilities .  he went back to the desk  found a scrap of paper  and painstakingly wrote  out fighting crime .  pleass call again later .  thankyou .   and then he went out onto the streets  untarnished and unafraid .       the supreme grand master raised his arms .      brethren     he said     let us begin          it was so easy .  all you had to do was channel that great septic reservoir of jealousy and cringing resentment that the brothers had in such abundance  harness their dreadful mundane unpleasantness which had a force greater in its way than roaring evil  and then open your own mind        into the place where the dragons went .       vimes found himself grabbed by the arm and pulled inside .  the heavy door shut behind him with a definite click .      it   s lord mountjoy gayscale talonthrust iii of ankh     said the apparition  which was dressed in huge and fearsomely padded armor .     you know  i really don   t think he can cut the mustard .         he can   t .     said vimes  backing away .      it really needs two of you .         it does  doesn   t it     whispered vimes  his shoulder blades trying to carve their way out through the fence .      could you oblige .     boomed the thing .      what .         oh  don   t be squeamish  man .  you just have to help him up into the air .  it   s me who has the tricky part .  i know it   s cruel  but if he can   t manage it tonight then he   s for the choppy chop .  survival of the fittest and all that  don   t you know .      captain vimes managed to get a grip on himself .  he was clearly in the presence of some sex crazed would be murderess  insofar as any gender could be determined under the strange lumpy garments .  if it wasn   t female  then references to    it   s me who has the tricky part    gave rise to mental images that would haunt him for some time to come .  he knew the rich did things differently  but this was going too far .      madam     he said coldly     i am an officer of the watch and i must warn you that the course of action you are suggesting breaks the laws of the city       and also of several of the more strait laced gods  he added silently      and i must advise you that his lordship should be released unharmed immediately        the figure stared at him in astonishment .      why .     it said .     it   s my bloody dragon .             have another drink  not corporal nobby .     said sergeant colon unsteadily .      i do not mind if i do  not sgt .  colon     said nobby .   they were taking inconspicuosity seriously .  that ruled out most of the taverns on the morpork side of the river  where they were very well known .  now they were in a rather elegant one in downtown ankh  where they were being as unobtrusive as they knew how .  the other drinkers thought they were some kind of cabaret .      i was thinking     said sgt .  colon .      what .         if we bought a bottle or two  we could go home and then we   d be really inconspicuous .      nobby gave this some thought .      but he said we   ve got to keep our ears open     he said .     we   re supposed to  what he said  detect anything .         we can do that at my house     said sgt .  colon .     we could listen all night  really hard .         tha   s a good point     said nobby .  in fact  it sounded better and better the more he thought about it .      but first     he announced     i got to pay a visit .         me too     said the sergeant .     this detecting business gets to you after a while  doesn   t it .      they stumbled out into the alley behind the tavern .  there was a full moon up  but a few rags of scruffy cloud were drifting across it .  the pair inconspicuously bumped into one another in the darkness .        is that you  detector sergeant colon .     said nobby .      tha   s right .  now  can you detect the door to the privy  detector corporal nobbs .  we   re looking for a short  dark door of mean appearance  ahahaha .      there were a couple of clanks and a muffled swear word from nobby as he staggered across the alley  followed by a yowl when one of ankh morpork   s enormous population of feral cats fled between his legs .      who loves you  pussycat .     said nobby under his breath .      needs must  then     said sgt .  colon  and faced a handy corner .   his private musings were interrupted by a grunt from the corporal .      you there  sgt .  .         detector sergeant to you  nobby     said sgt .  colon pleasantly .   nobby   s tone was urgent and suddenly very sober .     don   t piss about  sergeant  i just saw a dragon fly over .         i   ve seen a horsefly     said sgt .  colon  hiccuping gently .     and i   ve seen a housefly .  i   ve even seen a greenfly .  but i ain   t never seen a dragon fly .         of course you have  you pillock     said nobby urgently .     look  i   m not messing about .  he had wings on him like  like  like great big wings .      sergeant colon turned majestically .  the corporal   s face had gone so white that it showed up in the darkness .      honest  sergeant .      sgt .  colon turned his eyes to the damp sky and the rain washed moon .      all right     he said     show me .      there was a slithering noise behind him  and a couple of roof tiles smashed onto the street .     he turned .  and there  on the roof  was the dragon .      there   s a dragon on the roof .     he warbled .     nobby  it   s a dragon on the roof .  what shall i do  nobby .  there   s a dragon on the roof .  it   s looking right at me  nobby .         for a start  you could do your trousers up     said nobby  from behind the nearest wall .       even shorn of her layers of protective clothing  lady sybil ramkin was still toweringly big .  vimes knew that the barbarian hublander folk had legends about great chain mailed  armor bra   d  carthorse riding maidens who swooped down on battlefields and carried off dead warriors on their cropper to a glorious roistering afterlife  while singing in a pleasing mezzo soprano .  lady ramkin could have been one of them .  she could have led them .  she could have carried off a battalion .  when she spoke  every word was like a hearty slap on the back and clanged with the aristocratic self assurance of the totally well bred .  the vowel sounds alone would have cut teak .   vimes   s ragged forebears were used to voices like that  usually from heavily armored people on the back of a war charger telling them why it would be a jolly good idea  don   tcherknow  to charge the enemy and hit them for six .  his legs wanted to stand to attention .   prehistoric men would have worshipped her  and in fact had amazingly managed to carve lifelike statues of her thousands of years ago .  she had a mass of chestnut hair  a wig  vimes learned later .  no one who had much to do with dragons kept their own hair for long .   she also had a dragon on her shoulder .  it had been introduced as talonthrust vincent wonderkind of quirm  referred to as vinny  and seemed to be making a large contribution to the unusual chemical smell that pervaded the house .  this smell permeated everything .  even the generous slice of cake she offered him tasted of it .      the  er  shoulder   it looks   very nice     he said  desperate to make conversation .      rubbish     said her ladyship .     i   m just training him up because shoulder sitters fetch twice the price .      vimes murmured that he had occasionally seen society ladies with small  colorful dragons on their shoulders  and thought it looked very  er  nice .      oh  it sounds nice     she said .     i   ll grant you .  then they realize it means sootburns  frizzled hair and crap all down their back .  those talons dig in  too .  and then they think the thing   s getting too big and smelly and next thing you know it   s either down to the morpork sunshine sanctuary for lost dragons or the old heave ho into the river with a rope around your neck  poor little buggers .     she sat down  arranging a skirt that could have made sails for a small fleet .     now then .  captain vimes  was it .      vimes was at a loss .  ramkins long dead stared down at him from ornate frames high on the shadowy walls .  between  around and under the portraits were the weapons they   d presumably used  and had used well and often by the look of them .  suits of armor stood in dented ranks along the walls .  quite a number  he couldn   t help noticing  had large holes in them .  the ceiling was a faded riot of moth eaten banners .  you did not need forensic examination to understand that lady ramkin   s ancestors had never shirked a fight .   it was amazing that she was capable of doing something so unwarlike as having a cup of tea .      my forebears     she said  following his hypnotized gaze .     you know  not one ramkin in the last thousand years has died in his bed .           yes  ma   am .         source of family pride  that .         yes  ma   am .         quite a few of them have died in other people   s  of course .      captain vimes   s teacup rattled in its saucer .     yes  ma   am     he said .      captain is such a dashing title  i   ve always thought .     she gave him a bright  brittle smile .     i mean  colonels and so on are always so stuffy  majors are pompous  but one always feels somehow that there is something delightfully dangerous about a captain .  what was it you had to show me .      vimes gripped his parcel like a chastity belt .      i wondered     he faltered     how big swamp   er       he stopped .  something dreadful was happening to his lower regions .   lady ramkin followed his gaze .     oh  take no notice of him     she said cheerfully .     hit him with a cushion if he   s a bother .      a small elderly dragon had crawled out from under his chair and placed its jowly muzzle in vimes   s lap .  it stared up at him soulfully with big brown eyes and gently dribbled something quite corrosive  by the feel of it  over his knees .  and it stank like the ring around an acid bath .      that   s dewdrop mabelline talonthrust the first     said her ladyship .     champion and sire of champions .  no fire left now  poor soppy old thing .  he likes his belly rubbed .      vimes made surreptitiously vicious jerking motions to dislodge the old dragon .  it blinked mournfully at him with rheumy eyes and rolled back the corner of its mouth  exposing a picket fence of soot blackened teeth .      just push him off if he   s a nuisance     said lady ramkin cheerfully .     now then  what was it you were asking .           i was wondering how big swamp dragons grow .     said vimes  trying to shift position .  there was a faint growling noise .      you came all the way up here to ask me that .  well   i seem to recall gayheart talonthrust of ankh stood fourteen thumbs high  toe to matlock     mused lady ramkin .      er           about three foot six inches     she added kindly .      no bigger than that .     said vimes hopefully .  in his lap the old dragon began to snore gently .      golly  no .  he was a bit of a freak  actually .  mostly they don   t get much bigger than eight thumbs .      captain vimes   s lips moved in hurried calculation .     two feet .     he ventured .      well done .  that   s the cobbs  of course .  the hens are a bit smaller .      captain vimes wasn   t going to give in .     a cobb would be a male dragon .     he said .      only after the age of two years     said lady ramkin triumphantly .     up to the age of eight months he   s a pewmet  then he   s a cock until fourteen months  and then he   s a snood        captain vimes sat entranced  eating the horrible cake  britches gradually dissolving  as the stream of information flooded over him  how the males fought with flame but in the laying season only the hens  breathed fire  from the combustion of complex intestinal gases  to incubate the eggs which needed such a fierce temperature  while the males gathered firewood  a group of swamp dragons was a slump or an embarrassment  a female was capable of laying up to three clutches of four eggs every year  most of which were trodden on by absent minded males  and that dragons of both sexes were vaguely uninterested in one another  and indeed everything except firewood  except for about once every two months when they became as single minded as a buzzsaw .   he was helpless to prevent himself being taken out to the kennels at the back  outfitted from neck to ankle in leather armor faced with steel plates  and ushered into the long low building where the whistling had come from .   the temperature was terrible  but not as bad as the cocktail of smells .  he staggered aimlessly from one metal lined pen to another  while pear shaped  squeaking little horrors with red eyes were introduced as    moonpenny duchess marchpaine  who   s gravid at the moment    and    moonmist talonthrust ii  who was best of breed at pseudopolis last year .     jets of pale green flame played across his knees .   many of the stalls had rosettes and certificates pinned over them .      and this one  i   m afraid  is goodboy bindle featherstone of quirm     said lady ramkin relentlessly .   vimes stared groggily over the charred barrier at the small creature curled up in the middle of the floor .  it bore about the same resemblance to the rest of them as nobby did to the average human being .  something in its ancestry had given it a pair of eyebrows that were about the same size as its stubby wings  which could never have supported it in the air .  its head was the wrong shape  like an anteater .  it had nostrils like jet intakes .  if it ever managed to get airborne the things would have the drag of twin parachutes .   it was also turning on captain vimes the most silently intelligent look he   d ever had from any animal  including corporal nobbs .      it happens     said lady ramkin sadly .     it   s all down to genes  you know .         it is .     said vimes .  somehow  the creature seemed to be concentrating all the power its siblings wasted in flame and noise into a stare like a thermic lance .  he couldn   t help remembering how much he   d wanted a puppy when he was a little boy .  mind you  they   d been starving   anything with meat on it would have done .   he heard the dragon lady say     one tries to breed for a good flame  depth of scale  correct color and so on .  one just has to put up with the occasional total whittle .      the little dragon turned on vimes a gaze that would be guaranteed to win it the award for dragon the judges would most like to take home and use as a portable gas lighter .   total whittle  vimes thought .  he wasn   t sure of the precise meaning of the word  but he could hazard a shrewd guess .  it sounded like whatever it was you had left when you had extracted everything of any value whatsoever .  like the watch  he thought .  total whittles  every one of them .  and just like him .  it was the saga of his life .      that   s nature for you     said her ladyship .     of course i wouldn   t dream of breeding from him  but he wouldn   t be able to anyway .         why not .     said vimes .      because dragons have to mate in the air and he   ll never be able to fly with those wings  i   m afraid .  i   ll be sorry to lose the bloodline  naturally .  his sire was brenda rodley   s treebite brightscale .  do you know brenda .         er  no     said vimes .  lady ramkin was one of those people who assumed that everyone else knew everyone one knew .      charming gel .  anyway  his brothers and sisters are shaping up very well .      poor little bastard  thought vimes .  that   s nature for you in a nutshell .  always dealing off the bottom of the pack .   no wonder they call her a mother          you said you had something to show me     lady ramkin prompted .   vimes wordlessly handed her the parcel .  she slipped off her heavy mittens and unwrapped it .      plaster cast of a footprint     she said  baldly .     well .         does it remind you of anything .     said vimes .      could be a wading bird .         oh .     vimes was crestfallen .   lady ramkin laughed .     or a really big dragon .  got it out of a museum  did you .         no .  i got it off the street this morning .         ha .  someone   s been playing tricks on you  old chap .         er .  there was  er  circumstantial evidence .      he told her .  she stared at him .      draco nobilis     she said hoarsely .      pardon .     said vimes .      draco nobilis .  the noble dragon .  as opposed to these fellows       she waved a hand in the direction of the massed ranks of whistling lizards      draco vulgaris  the lot of them .  but the big ones are all gone  you know .  this really is a nonsense .  no two ways about it .  all gone .  beautiful things  they were .  weighed tons .  biggest things ever to fly .  no one knows how they did it .      and then they realized .   it was suddenly very quiet .   all along the rows of kennels  the dragons were silent  bright eyed and watchful .  they were staring at the roof .       carrot looked around him .  shelves stretched away in every direction .  on those shelves  books .  he made a calculated guess .      this is the library  isn   t it .     he said .   the librarian maintained his gentle but firm grip on the boy   s hand and led him along the maze of aisles .        is there a body .     said carrot .  there   d have to be .  worse than murder .  a body in a library .  it could lead to anything .   the ape eventually padded to a halt in front of a shelf no different than  it seemed  a hundred others .  some of the books were chained up .  there was a gap .  the librarian pointed to it .      oook .         well  what about it .  a hole where a book should be .         oook .         a book has been taken .  a book has been taken .  you summoned the watch     carrot drew himself up proudly     because someone   s taken a book .  you think that   s worse than murder .      the librarian gave him the kind of look other people would reserve for people who said things like    what   s so bad about genocide .         this is practically a criminal offense  wasting watch time     said carrot .     why don   t you just tell the head wizards  or whoever they are .         oook .     the librarian indicated with some surprisingly economical gestures that most wizards would not find their own bottoms with both hands .      well  i don   t see what we can do about it     said carrot .     what   s the book called .      the librarian scratched his head .  this one was going to be tricky .  he faced carrot  put his leather glove hands together  then folded them open .      i know it   s a book .  what   s its name .      the librarian sighed  and held up a hand .      four words .     said carrot .     first word .     the ape pinched two wrinkled fingers together .     small word .  a .  the .  fo           oook .         the .  the .  second word   third word .  small word .  the .  a .  to .  of .  fro   of .  of .  the something of something .  second word .  what .  oh .  first syllable .  fingers .  touching your fingers .  thumbs .      the orangutan growled and tugged theatrically at one large hairy ear .      oh  sounds like .  fingers .  hand .  adding up .  sums .  cut off .  smaller word   sum .  sum .  second syllable .  small .  very small syllable .  a .  in .  un .  on .  on .  sum .  on .  sum on .  summon .  summon er .  summon ing .  summoning .  summoning .  the summoning of something .  this is fun  isn   t it .  fourth word .  whole word        he peered intently as the librarian gyrated mysteriously .      big thing .  huge big thing .  flapping .  great big flapping leaping thing .  teeth .  huffing .  blowing .  great big huge blowing flapping thing .     sweat broke out on carrot   s forehead as he tried obediently to understand .     sucking fingers .  sucking fingers thing .  burnt .  hot .  great big hot blowing flapping thing        the librarian rolled his eyes .  homo sapiens .  you could keep it .       the great dragon danced and spun and trod the air over the city .  its color was moonlight  gleaming off its scales .  sometimes it would twist and glide with deceptive speed over the rooftops for the sheer joy of existing .   and it was all wrong  vimes thought .  part of him was marveling at the sheer beauty of the sight  but an insistent  weaselly little group of brain cells from the wrong side of the synapses was scrawling its graffiti on the walls of wonderment .   it   s a bloody great lizard  they jeered .  must weigh tons .  nothing that big can fly  not even on beautiful wings .  and what is a flying lizard doing with great big scales on its back .     five hundred feet above him a lance of blue white flame roared into the sky .   it can   t do something like that .  it   d burn its own lips off .   beside him lady ramkin stood with her mouth open .  behind her  the little caged dragons yammered and howled .   the great beast turned in the air and swooped over the rooftops .  the flame darted out again .  below it  yellow flames sprang up .  it was done so quietly and stylishly that it took vimes several seconds to realize that several buildings had in fact been set on fire .      golly .     said lady ramkin .     look .  it   s using the thermals .  that   s what the fire is for .     she turned to vimes  her eyes hopelessly aglow .     do you realize we   re very probably seeing something that no one has seen for centuries .         yes  it   s a bloody flying alligator setting fire to my city .     shouted vimes .   she wasn   t listening to him .     there must be a breeding colony somewhere     she said .     after all this time .  where do you think it lives .      vimes didn   t know .  but he swore to himself that he would find out  and ask it some very serious questions .      one egg     breathed the breeder .     just let me get my hands on one egg        vimes stared at her in genuine astonishment .  it dawned on him that he was very probably a flawed character .   below them  another building exploded into flame .      how far exactly     he said  speaking very slowly and carefully  as to a child     did these things fly .         they   re very territorial animals     murmured her ladyship .     according to legend  they        vimes realized he was in for another dose of dragon lore .     just give me the facts  m   lady     he said impatiently .      not very far  really     she said  slightly taken aback .        thank you very much  ma   am  you   ve been very helpful     muttered vimes  and broke into a run .   somewhere in the city .  there was nothing outside for miles except low fields and swamp .  it had to be living somewhere in the city .   his sandals flapped on the cobbles as he hurtled down the streets .  somewhere in the city .  which was totally ridiculous  of course .  totally ridiculous and impossible .   he didn   t deserve this .  of all the cities in all the world it could have flown into  he thought  it   s flown into mine         by the time he reached the river the dragon had vanished .  but a pall of smoke was hanging over the streets and several human bucket chains had been formed to pass lumps of the river to the stricken buildings .   the job was considerably hampered by the droves of people streaming out of the streets  carrying their possessions .  most of the city was wood and thatch  and they weren   t taking any chances .   in fact the danger was surprisingly small .  mysteriously small  when you came to think about it .   vimes had surreptitiously taken to carrying a notebook these days  and he had noted the damage as if the mere act of writing it down somehow made the world a more understandable place .   itym  ae coache house  belonging to an inoffensive businessman  who   d seen his new carriage go up in flames  .     itym  ae smalle vegettable shope  with pin point accuracy  .   vimes wondered about that .  he   d bought some apples in there once  and there didn   t appear to be anything about it that a dragon could possibly take offense at .   still  very considerate of the dragon  he thought as he made his way to the watch house .  when you think of all the timber yards  hayricks  thatched roofs and oil stores it could have hit by chance  it   s managed to really frighten everyone without actually harming the city .   rays of early morning sunlight were piercing the drifts of smoke as he pushed open the door .  this was home .  not the bare little room over the candlemaker   s shop in wixon   s alley  where he slept  but this nasty brown room that smelled of unswept chimneys  sgt .  colon   s pipe  nobby   s mysterious personal problem and  latterly  carrot   s armor polish .  it was almost like home .   no one else was there .  he wasn   t entirely surprised .  he clumped up to his office and leaned back in his chair  whose cushion would have been thrown out of its basket in disgust by an incontinent dog  pulled his helmet over his eyes  and tried to think .   no good rushing about .  the dragon had vanished in all the smoke and confusion  as suddenly as it had come .  time for rushing about soon enough .  the important thing was working out where to rush to     he   d been right .  wading bird .  but where did you start looking for a bloody great dragon in a city of a million people .   he was aware that his right hand  entirely unbidden  had pulled open the bottom drawer  and three of his fingers  acting on sealed orders from his hindbrain  had lifted out a bottle .  it was one of those bottles that emptied themselves .  reason told him that sometimes he must occasionally start one  break the seal  see amber liquid glistening all the way up to the neck .  it was just that he couldn   t remember the sensation .  it was as if the bottles arrived two thirds empty     he stared at the label .  it seemed to be jimkin bearhugger   s old selected dragon   s blood whiskey .  cheap and powerful  you could light fires with it  you could clean spoons .  you didn   t have to drink much of it to be drunk  which was just as well .   it was nobby who shook him awake with the news that there was a dragon in the city  and also that sgt .  colon had had a nasty turn .  vimes sat and blinked owlishly while the words washed around him .  apparently having a fire breathing lizard focusing interestedly on one   s nether regions from a distance of a few feet can upset the strongest constitution .  an experience like that could leave a lasting mark on a person .   vimes was still digesting this when carrot turned up with the librarian swinging along behind him .      did you see it .  did you see it .     he said .      we all saw it     said vimes .      i know all about it .     said carrot triumphantly .     someone   s brought it here with magic .  someone   s stolen a book out of the library and guess what it   s called .         can   t even begin to     said vimes weakly .      it   s called the summoning of dragons .         oook     confirmed the librarian .      oh .  what   s it about .     said vimes .  the librarian rolled his eyes .      it   s about how to summon dragons .  by magic .         oook .         and that   s illegal  that is .     said carrot happily .     releasing feral creatures upon the streets  contrary to the wild animals  public          vimes groaned .  that meant wizards .  you got nothing but trouble with wizards .      i suppose     he said     there wouldn   t be another copy of this book around  would there .         oook .     the librarian shook his head .      and you wouldn   t happen to know what   s in it .     vimes sighed .     what .  oh .  four words     he said wearily .     first word .  sounds like .  bend .  bough .  sow  cow  how   how .  second word .  small word .  the  a  to   to .  yes understood  but i meant in any kind of detail .  no .  i see .         what   re we going to do now  sir .     said carrot anxiously .      it   s out there     intoned nobby .     gone to ground  like  during the hours of daylight .  coiled up in its secret lair  on top of a great hoard of gold  dreamin    ancient reptilian dreams fromma dawna time  waitin    for the secret curtains of the night  when once more it will sally forth       he hesitated and added sullenly     what   re you all looking at me like that for .         very poetic     said carrot .      well  everyone knows the real old dragons used to go to sleep on a hoard of gold     said nobby .     well known folk myth .      vimes looked blankly into the immediate future .  vile though nobby was  he was also a good indication of what was going through the mind of the average citizen .  you could use him as a sort of laboratory rat to forecast what was going to happen next .      i expect you   d be really interested in finding out where that hoard is  wouldn   t you .     said vimes experimentally .   nobby looked even more shifty than usual .     well  cap   n  i was thinking of having a bit of a look around .  you know .  when i   m off duty  of course     he added virtuously .      oh  dear     said captain vimes .     he lifted up the empty bottle and  with great care  put it back in the drawer .       the elucidated brethren were nervous .  a kind of fear crackled from brother to brother .  it was the fear of someone who  having cheerfully experimented with pouring the powder and wadding the ball  has found that pulling the trigger had led to a godawful bang and pretty soon someone is bound to come and see who   s making all the noise .   the supreme grand master knew that he had them  though .  sheep and lamb  sheep and lamb .  since they couldn   t do anything much worse than they had already done they might as well press on and damn the world  and pretend they   d wanted it like this all along .  oh  the joy of it     only brother plasterer was actually happy .      let that be a lesson to all oppressive vegetable sellers     he kept saying .      yes  er     said brother doorkeeper .     only  the thing is  there   s no chance of us sort of accidentally summoning the dragon here  is there .         i   that is  we   have it under perfect control     said the supreme grand master smoothly .     the power is ours .  i can assure you .      the brothers cheered up a little bit .      and now     the supreme grand master continued     there is the matter of the king .      the brothers looked solemn  except for brother plasterer .      have we found him  then .     he said .     that   s a stroke of luck .         you never listen  do you .     snapped brother watchtower .     it was all explained last week  we don   t go around finding anyone  we make a king .           i thought he was supposed to turn up .     cos of destiny .      brother watchtower sniggered .     we sort of help destiny along a bit .      the supreme grand master smiled in the depths of his robe .  it was amazing  this mystic business .  you tell them a lie  and then when you don   t need it anymore you tell them another lie and tell them they   re progressing along the road to wisdom .  then instead of laughing they follow you even more  hoping that at the heart of all the lies they   ll find the truth .  and bit by bit they accept the unacceptable .  amazing .      bloody hell  that   s clever     said brother doorkeeper .     how do we do that  then .         look  the supreme grand master said what we do  we find some handsome lad who   s good at taking orders  he kills the dragon  and bob   s your uncle .  simple .  much more intelligent than waitin    for a so called real king .         but       brother plasterer seemed deep in the toils of cerebration     if we control the dragon  and we do control the dragon  right .  then we don   t need anyone killing it  we just stop summoning it  and everyone   ll be happy  right .         ho yes     said brother watchtower nastily     i can just see it  can you .  we just trot out  say    hallo  we won   t set fire to your houses anymore  aren   t we nice     do we .  the whole point about the thing with the king is that he   ll be a  a sort of           undeniably potent and romantic symbol of absolute authority     said the supreme grand master smoothly .      that   s it     said brother watchtower .     a potent authority .         oh  i see     said brother plasterer .     right .  okay .  that   s what the king   ll be .         that   s it     said brother watchtower .      no one going to argue with a potent authority  are they .           too right     said brother watchtower .      stroke of luck  then  finding the true king right now     said brother plasterer .     million to one chance  really .         we haven   t found the right king .  we don   t need the right king     said the supreme grand master wearily .     for the last time .  i   ve just found us a likely lad who looks good in a crown and can take orders and knows how to flourish a sword .  now just listen        flourishing  of course  was important .  it didn   t have much to do with wielding .  wielding a sword  the supreme grand master considered  was simply the messy business of dynastic surgery .  it was just a matter of thrust and cut .  whereas a king had to flourish one .  it had to catch the light in just the right way  leaving watchers in no doubt that here was destiny   s chosen .  he   d taken a long time preparing the sword and shield .  it had been very expensive .  the shield shone like a dollar in a sweep   s earhole but the sword  the sword was magnificent     it was long and shiny .  it looked like something some genius of metalwork   one of those little zen guys who works only by the light of dawn and can beat a club sandwich of folded steels into something with the cutting edge of a scalpel and the stopping power of a sex crazed rhinoceros on bad acid   had made and then retired in tears because he   d never  ever  do anything so good again .  there were so many jewels on the hilt it had to be sheathed in velvet  you had to look at it through smoked glass .  just laying a hand on it practically conferred kingship .   as for the lad   he was a distant cousin  keen and vain  and stupid in a passably aristocratic way .  currently he was under guard in a distant farmhouse  with an adequate supply of drink and several young ladies  although what the boy seemed most interested in was mirrors .  probably hero material  the supreme grand master thought glumly .        i suppose     said brother watchtower     that he isn   t the real air to the throne .         what do you mean .     said the supreme grand master .      well  you know how it is .  fate plays funny tricks .  haha .  it   d be a laugh  wouldn   t it     said brother watchtower     if this lad turned out to be the real king .  after all this trouble           there is no real king anymore .     snapped the supreme grand master .     what do you expect .  some people wandering in the wilderness for hundreds and hundreds of years  patiently handing down a sword and a birthmark .  some sort of magic .     he spat the word .  he   d make use of magic  means to an end  end justifies means and so forth  but to go around believing it  believing it had some sort of moral force  like logic  made him wince .     good grief  man  be logical .  be rational .  even if any of the old royal family survived  the blood line   d be so watered down by now that there must be thousands of people who lay claim to the throne .  even       he tried to think of the least likely claimant      even someone like brother dunnykin .     he stared at the assembled brethren .     don   t see him here tonight  by the way .         funny thing  that     said brother watchtower thoughtfully .     didn   t you hear .         what .         he got bitten by a crocodile on his way home last night .  poor little bugger .         what .         million to one chance .  it   d escaped from a menagerie  or something  and was lying low in his back yard .  he went to feel under his doormat for his doorkey and it had him by the funes .      brother watchtower fumbled under his robe and produced a grubby brown envelope .     we   re having a whip around to buy him some grapes and that  i don   t know whether you   d like to  er           put me down for three dollars     said the supreme grand master .   brother watchtower nodded .     funny thing     he said     i already have .      just a few more nights  thought the supreme grand master .  by tomorrow the people   ll be so desperate  they   d crown even a one legged troll if he got rid of the dragon .  and we   ll have a king  and he   ll have an advisor  a trusted man  of course  and this stupid rabble can go back to the gutter .  no more dressing up  no more ritual .   no more summoning the dragon .   i can give it up  he thought .  i can give it up any time i like .       the streets outside the patrician   s palace were thronged .  there was a manic air of carnival .  vimes ran a practiced eye over the assortment before him .  it was the usual ankh morpork mob in times of crisis  half of them were here to complain  a quarter of them were here to watch the other half  and the remainder were here to rob  importune or sell hot dogs to the rest .  there were a few new faces  though .  there were a number of grim men with big swords slung over their shoulders and whips slung on their belts  striding through the crowds .      news spreads quick  don   t it     observed a familiar voice by his ear .     morning  captain .      vimes looked into the grinning  cadaverous face of cut me own throat dibbler  purveyor of absolutely anything that could be sold hurriedly from an open suitcase in a busy street and was guaranteed to have fallen off the back of an oxcart .        morning  throat     said vimes absently .     what   re you selling .         genuine article  captain .     throat leaned closer .  he was the sort of person who could make    good morning    sound like a once in a lifetime  never to be repeated offer .  his eyes swiveled back and forth in their sockets  like two rodents trying to find a way out .     can   t afford to be without it     he hissed .     anti dragon cream .  personal guarantee  if you   re incinerated you get your money back  no quibble .         what you   re saying     said vimes slowly     if i understand the wording correctly  is that if i am baked alive by the dragon you   ll return the money .         upon personal application     said cut me own throat .  he unscrewed the lid from a jar of vivid green ointment and thrust it under vimes   s nose .     made from over fifty different rare spices and herbs to a recipe known only to a bunch of ancient monks what live on some mountain somewhere .  one dollar a jar  and i   m cutting my own throat .  it   s a public service  really     he added piously .      you   ve got to hand it to those ancient monks  brewing it up so quickly     said vimes .      clever buggers     agreed cut me own throat .     i must be all that meditation and yak yogurt .         so what   s happening  throat .     said vimes .     who   re all the guys with the big swords .         dragon hunters  cap   n .  the patrician announced a reward of fifty thousand dollars to anyone who brings him the dragon   s head .  not attached to the dragon  either  he   s no fool  that man .         what .         that   s what he said .  it   s all written on posters .         fifty thousand dollars .         not chicken feed  eh .         more like dragon fodder     said vimes .  it   d bring trouble  you mark his words .     i   m amazed you   re not grabbing a sword and joining in .         i   m more in what you might call the service sector  cap   n .     throat looked both ways conspiratorially  and then passed vimes a slip of parchment .   it said       anti dragon mirror shields a      portable lair detectors a      dragon piercing arrows a     per each  shovels a   picks a   sacks a        vimes handed it back .     why the sacks .     he said .      on account of the hoard     said throat .      oh  yes     said vimes gloomily .     of course .         tell you what     said throat     tell you what .  for our boys in brown  ten percent off .         and you   re cutting your own throat  throat .         fifteen percent for officers .     urged throat  as vimes walked away .  the cause of the slight panic in his voice was soon apparent .  he had plenty of competition .   the people of ankh morpork were not by nature heroic but were  by nature  salesmen .  in the space of a few feet vimes could have bought any number of magical weapons genuine certyfycate of orthenticity with everyone  a cloak of invisibility   a good touch  he thought  and he was really impressed by the way the stallowner was using a mirror with no glass in it   and  by way of lighter relief  dragon biscuits  balloons and windmills on sticks .  copper bracelets guaranteed to bring relief from dragons were a nice thought .   there seemed to be as many sacks and shovels about as there were swords .   gold  that was it .  the hoard .  hah .     fifty thousand dollars .  an officer of the watch earned thirty dollars a month and had to pay to have his own dents beaten out .   what he couldn   t do with fifty thousand dollars     vimes thought about this for a while and then thought of the things he could do with fifty thousand dollars .  there were so many more of them  for a start .   he almost walked into a group of men clustered around a poster nailed to the wall .  it declared  indeed  that the head of the dragon that had terrorized the city would be worth a        to the brave hero that delivered it to the palace .   one of the cluster  who from his size  weaponry and that way he was slowly tracing the lettering with his finger vimes decided was a leading hero  was doing the reading for the others .         to ter her pal ack ee     he concluded .      fifty thousand     said one of them reflectively  rubbing his chin .      cheap job     said the intellectual .     well below the rate .  should be half the kingdom and his daughter   s hand in marriage .         yes  but he ain   t a king .  he   s a patrician .         well  half his patrimony or whatever .  what   s his daughter like .      the assembled hunters didn   t know .      he   s not married     vimes volunteered .     and he hasn   t got a daughter .      they turned and looked him up and down .  he could see the disdain in their eyes .  they probably got through dozens like him every day .     not got a daughter .     said one of them .     wants people to kill dragons and he hasn   t got a daughter .      vimes felt  in an odd way  that he ought to support the lord of the city .     he   s got a little dog that he   s very fond of     he said helpfully .        bleeding disgusting  not even having a daughter     said one of the hunters .     and what   s fifty thousand dollars these days .  you spend that much in nets .         s   right     said another .     people think it   s a fortune  but they don   t reckon on  well  it   s not pensionable  there   s all the medical expenses  you   ve got to buy and maintain your own gear              wear and tear on virgins       nodded a small fat hunter .      yeah  and then there   s   what .         my speciality is unicorns     the hunter explained  with an embarrassed smile .      oh  right .     the first speaker looked like someone who   d always been dying to ask the question .     i thought they were very rare these days .         you   re right there .  you don   t see many unicorns  either     said the unicorn hunter .  vimes got the impression that  in his whole life  this was his only joke .      yeah  well .  times are hard     said the first speaker sharply .      monsters are getting more uppity  too     said another .     i heard where this guy  he killed this monster in this lake  no problem  stuck its arm up over the door           pour encourjay lays ortras     said one of the listeners .      right  and you know what .  its mum come and complained .  its actual mum come right down to the hall next day and complained .  actually complained .  that   s the respect you get .         the females are always the worst     said another hunter gloomily .     i knew this cross eyed gorgon once  oh  she was a terror .  kept turning her own nose to stone .         it   s our arses on the line every time     said the intellectual .     i mean  i wish i had a dollar for every horse i   ve had eaten out from underneath me .         right .  fifty thousand dollars .  he can stuff it .           yeah .         right .  cheapskate .         let   s go and have a drink .         right .      they nodded in righteous agreement and strode off toward the mended drum  except for the intellectual  who sidled uneasily back to vimes .      what sort of dog .     he said .      what .     said vimes .      i said  what sort of dog .         a small wire haired terrier  i think     said vimes .   the hunter thought about this for some time .     nah     he said eventually  and hurried off after the others .      he   s got an aunt in pseudopolis  i believe     vimes called after him .   there was no response .  the captain of the watch shrugged  and carried on through the throng to the patrician   s palace            where the patrician was having a difficult lunchtime .      gentlemen .     he snapped .     i really don   t see what else there is to do .      the assembled civic leaders muttered among themselves .      at times like this it   s traditional that a hero comes forth     said the president of the guild of assassins .     a dragon slayer .  where is he  that   s what i want to know .  why aren   t our schools turning out young people with the kind of skills society needs .         fifty thousand dollars doesn   t sound much     said the chairman of the guild of thieves .      it may not be much to you  my dear sir  but it is all the city can afford     said the patrician firmly .        if it doesn   t afford anymore than that i don   t think there   ll be a city for long     said the thief .      and what about trade .     said the representative of the guild of merchants .     people aren   t going to sail here with a cargo of rare comestibles just to have it incinerated  are they .         gentlemen .  gentlemen .     the patrician raised his hands in a conciliatory fashion .     it seems to me     he went on  taking advantage of the brief pause     that what we have here is a strictly magical phenomenon .  i would like to hear from our learned friend on this point .  hmm .      someone nudged the archchancellor of unseen university  who had nodded off .      eh .  what .     said the wizard  startled into wakefulness .      we were wondering     said the patrician loudly     what you were intending to do about this dragon of yours .      the archchancellor was old  but a lifetime of survival in the world of competitive wizardry and the byzantine politics of unseen university meant that he could whip up a defensive argument in a split second .  you didn   t remain archchancellor for long if you let that sort of ingenuous remark whizz past your ear .      my dragon .     he said .      it   s well known that the great dragons are extinct     said the patrician brusquely .     and  besides  their natural habitat was definitely rural .  so it seems to me that this one must be mag           with respect  lord vetinari     said the archchancellor     it has often been claimed that dragons are extinct  but the current evidence  if i may make so bold  tends to cast a certain doubt on the theory .  as to habitat  what we are seeing here is simply a change of behavior pattern  occasioned by the spread of urban areas into the countryside which has led many hitherto rural creatures to adopt  nay in many cases to positively embrace  a more municipal mode of existence  and many of them thrive on the new opportunities thereby opened to them .  for example  foxes are always knocking over my dustbins .      he beamed .  he   d managed to get all the way through it without actually needing to engage his brain .      are you saying     said the assassin slowly     that what we   ve got here is the first civic dragon .         that   s evolution for you     said the wizard  happily .     it should do well  too     he added .     plenty of nesting sites  and a more than adequate food supply .      silence greeted this statement  until the merchant said     what exactly is it that they do eat .      the thief shrugged .     i seem to recall stories about virgins chained to huge rocks     he volunteered .      it   ll starve around here  then     said the assassin .     we   re on loam .         they used to go around ravening     said the thief .     dunno if that   s any help           anyway     said the leader of the merchants     it seems to be your problem again  my lord .      five minutes later the patrician was striding the length of the oblong office  fuming .      they were laughing at me     said the patrician .     i could tell .         did you suggest a working party .     said wonse .      of course i did .  it didn   t do the trick this time .  you know  i really am inclined to increase the reward money .         i don   t think that would work  my lord .  any proficient monster slayer knows the rate for the job .         ha .  half the kingdom     muttered the patrician .      and your daughter   s hand in marriage     said wonse .        i suppose an aunt isn   t acceptable .     the patrician said hopefully .      tradition demands a daughter  my lord .      the patrician nodded gloomily .      perhaps we can buy it off     he said aloud .     are dragons intelligent .         i believe the word traditionally is    cunning     my lord     said wonse .     i understand they have a liking for gold .         really .  what do they spend it on .         they sleep on it  my lord .         what  do you mean in a mattress .         no  my lord .  on it .      the patrician turned this fact over in his mind .     don   t they find it rather knobbly .     he said .      so i would imagine  sir .  i don   t suppose anyone has ever asked .         hmm .  can they talk .         they   re apparently good at it  my lord .         ah .  interesting .      the patrician was thinking  if it can talk  it can negotiate .  if it can negotiate  then i have it by the short   by the small scales  or whatever it is they have .      and they are said to be silver tongued     said wonse .  the patrician leaned back in his chair .      only silver .     he said .   there was the sound of muted voices in the passageway outside and vimes was ushered in .      ah  captain     said the patrician     what progress .         i   m sorry  my lord .     said vimes  as the rain dripped off his cape .      towards apprehending this dragon     said the patrician firmly .      the wading bird .     said vimes .        you know very well what i mean     said vetinari sharply .      investigations are in hand     said vimes automatically .   the patrician snorted .     all you have to do is find its lair     he said .     once you have the lair  you have the dragon .  that   s obvious .  half the city seems to be looking for it .         if there is a lair     said vimes .   wonse looked up sharply .      why do you say that .         we are considering a number of possibilities     said vimes woodenly .      if it has no lair  where does it spend its days .     said the patrician .      inquiries are being pursued     said vimes .      then pursue them with alacrity .  and find the lair     said the patrician sourly .      yes  sir .  permission to leave  sir .         very well .  but i shall expect progress by tonight  do you understand .      now why did i wonder if it has a lair .  vimes thought  as he stepped out into the daylight and the crowded square .  because it didn   t look real  that   s why .  if it isn   t real  it doesn   t need to do anything we expect .  how can it walk out of an alley it didn   t go into .   once you   ve ruled out the impossible then whatever is left  however improbable  must be the truth .  the problem lay in working out what was impossible  of course .  that was the trick  all right .   there was also the curious incident of the orangutan in the night time         by day the library buzzed with activity .  vimes moved through it diffidently .  strictly speaking  he could go anywhere in the city  but the university had always held that it fell under thaumaturgical law and he felt it wouldn   t be wise to make the kind of enemies where you were lucky to end up the same temperature  let alone the same shape .   he found the librarian hunched over his desk .  the ape gave him an expectant look .      haven   t found it yet .  sorry     said vimes .     enquiries are continuing .  but there is a little help you can give me .         oook .         well  this is a magical library  right .  i mean  these books are sort of intelligent  isn   t that so .  so i   ve been thinking  i bet if i got in here at night  they   d soon kick up a fuss .  because they don   t know me .  but if they did know me  they   d probably not mind .  so whoever took the book would have to be a wizard  wouldn   t they .  or someone who works for the university  at any rate .      the librarian glanced from side to side  then grasped vimes   s hand and led him into the seclusion of a couple of bookshelves .  only then did he nod his head .      someone they know .      a shrug  and then another nod .      that   s why you told us  is it .         oook .         and not the university council .         oook .         any idea who it is .      the librarian shrugged  a decidedly expressive gesture for a body which was basically a sack between a pair of shoulderblades .      well  it   s something .  let me know if any other strange things happen  won   t you .     vimes looked up at the banks of shelves .     stranger than usual  i mean .         oook .         thank you .  it   s a pleasure to meet a citizen who regards it as their duty to assist the watch .      the librarian gave him a banana .     vimes felt curiously elated as he stepped out into the city   s throbbing streets again .  he was definitely detecting things .  they were little bits of things  like a jigsaw .  no one of them made any real sense  but they all hinted at a bigger picture .  all he needed to do was find a corner  or a bit of an edge     he was pretty certain it wasn   t a wizard  whatever the librarian might think .  not a proper  paid up wizard .  this sort of thing wasn   t their style .   and there was  of course  this business about the lair .  the most sensible course would be to wait and see if the dragon turned up tonight  and try and see where .  that meant a high place .  was there some way of detecting dragons themselves .  he   d had a look at cut me own throat dibbler   s dragon detectors  which consisted solely of a piece of wood on a metal stick .  when the stick was burned through  you   d found your dragon .  like a lot of cut me own throat   s devices  it was completely efficient in its own special way while at the same time being totally useless .   there had to be a better way of finding the thing than waiting until your fingers were burned off .       the setting sun spread out on the horizon like a lightly poached egg .   the rooftops of ankh morpork sprouted a fine array of gargoyles even in normal times  but now they were alive with as ghastly an array of faces as ever were seen outside a woodcut about the evils of gin drinking among the non woodcut buying classes .  many of the faces were attached to bodies holding a fearsome array of homely weapons that had been handed down from generation to generation for centuries  often with some force .   from his perch on the roof of the watch house vimes could see the wizards lining the rooftops of the university  and the gangs of opportunist hoard researchers waiting in the streets  shovels at the ready .  if the dragon really did have a bed somewhere in the city  then it would be sleeping on the floor tomorrow .   from somewhere below came the cry of cut me own throat dibbler  or one of his colleagues  selling hot sausages .  vimes felt a sudden surge of civic pride .  there had to be something right about a citizenry which  when faced with catastrophe  thought about selling sausages to the participants .   the city waited .  a few stars came out .   colon  nobby and carrot were also on the roof .  colon was sulking because vimes had forbidden him to use his bow and arrow .   these weren   t encouraged in the city  since the heft and throw of a longbow   s arrow could send it through an innocent bystander a hundred yards away rather than the innocent bystander at whom it was aimed .      that   s right     said carrot     the projectile weapons  civic safety  act       .         don   t you keep on quoting all that sort of stuff     snapped colon .     we don   t have any of them laws anymore .  that   s all old stuff .  it   s all more wossname now .  pragmatic .         law or no law     said vimes     i say put it away .         but captain  i was a dab hand at this .     protested colon .     anyway     he added peevishly     a lot of other people have got them .      that was true enough .  neighboring rooftops bristled like hedgehogs .  if the wretched thing turned up  it was going to think it was flying through solid wood with slots in it .  you could almost feel sorry for it .      i said put it away     said vimes .     i   m not having my guards shooting citizens .  so put it away .           that   s very true     said carrot .     we   re here to protect and to serve  aren   t we  captain .      vimes gave him a sidelong look .     er     he said .     yeah .  yes .  that   s right .      on the roof of her house on the hill  lady ramkin adjusted a rather inadequate folding chair on the roof  arranged the telescope  coffee flask and sandwiches on the parapet in front of her  and settled down to wait .  she had a notebook on her knee .   half an hour went by .  hails of arrows greeted a passing cloud  several unfortunate bats  and the rising moon .      bugger this for a game of soldiers     said nobby  eventually .     it   s been scared off .      sgt .  colon lowered his pike .     looks like it     he conceded .      and it   s getting chilly up here     said carrot .  he politely nudged captain vimes  who was slumped against the chimney  staring moodily into space .      maybe we ought to be getting down  sir .     he said .     lots of people are .         hmm .     said vimes  without moving his head .      could be coming onto rain  too     said carrot .   vimes said nothing .  for some minutes he had been watching the tower of art  which was the center of unseen university and reputedly the oldest building in the city .  it was certainly the tallest .  time  weather and indifferent repairs had given it a gnarled appearance  like a tree that has seen too many thunderstorms .   he was trying to remember its shape .  as is the case with many things that are totally familiar  he hadn   t really looked at it for years .  now he was trying to convince himself that the forest of little turrets and crenellations at its top looked just the same tonight as they had done yesterday .   it was giving him some difficulty .     without taking his eyes off it  he grabbed sgt .  colon   s shoulder and gently pointed him in the right direction .   he said     can you see anything odd about the top of the tower .      colon stared up for a while  and then laughed nervously .     well  it looks like there   s a dragon sitting on it  doesn   t it .         yes .  that   s what i thought .         only  only  only when you sort of look properly  you can see it   s just made up out of shadows and clumps of ivy and that .  i mean  if you half close one eye  it looks like two old women and a wheelbarrow .      vimes tried this .     nope     he said .     it still looks like a dragon .  a huge one .  sort of hunched up  and looking down .  look  you can see its wings folded up .         beg pardon  sir .  that   s just a broken turret giving the effect .      they watched it for a while .   then vimes said     tell me  sergeant   i ask in a spirit of pure inquiry   what do you think   s causing the effect of a pair of huge wings unfurling .      colon swallowed .      i think that   s caused by a pair of huge wings  sir     he said .      spot on  sergeant .      the dragon dropped .  it wasn   t a swoop .  it simply kicked away from the top of the tower and half fell  half flew straight downward  disappearing from view behind the university buildings .   vimes caught himself listening for the thump .   and then the dragon was in view again  moving like an arrow  moving like a shooting star  moving like something that has somehow turned a thirty two feet per second plummet into an unstoppable upward swoop .  it glided over the rooftops at little more than head height  all the more horrible because of the sound .  it was as though the air was slowly and carefully being torn in half .   the watch threw themselves flat .  vimes caught a glimpse of huge  vaguely horse like features before it slid past .      sodding assholes     said nobby  from somewhere in the guttering .   vimes redoubled his grip on the chimney and pulled himself upright .     you are in uniform  corporal nobbs     he said  his voice hardly shaking at all .      sorry  captain .  sodding assholes  sir .         where   s sergeant colon .         down here  sir .  holding onto this drainpipe  sir .         oh  for goodness sake .  help him up  carrot .         gosh     said carrot     look at it go .      you could tell the position of the dragon by the rattle of arrows across the city  and by the screams and gurgles of all those hit by the misses and ricochets .      he hasn   t even flapped his wings yet .     shouted carrot  trying to stand on the chimney pot .     look at him go .      it shouldn   t be that big  vimes told himself  watching the huge shape wheel over the river .  it   s as long as a street .   there was a puff of flame above the docks  and for a moment the creature passed in front of the moon .  then it flapped its wings  once  with a sound like the damp hides of a pedigree herd being slapped across a cliff .   it turned in a tight circle  pounded the air a few times to build up speed  and came back .   when it passed over the watch house it coughed a column of spitting white fire .  tiles under it didn   t just melt  they erupted in red hot droplets .  the chimney stack exploded and rained bricks across the street .   vast wings hammered at the air as the creature hovered over the burning building  fire spearing down on what rapidly became a glowing heap .  then  when all that was left was a spreading puddle of melted rock with interesting streaks and bubbles in it  the dragon raised itself with a contemptuous flick of its wings and soared away and upward  over the city .       lady ramkin lowered her telescope and shook her head slowly .      that   s not right     she whispered .     that   s not right at all .  shouldn   t be able to do anything like that .      she raised the lens again and squinted  trying to see what was on fire .  down below  in their long kennels  the little dragons howled .       traditionally  upon waking from blissfully uneventful insensibility  you ask     where am i .     it   s probably part of the racial consciousness or something .   vimes said it .   tradition allows a choice of second lines .  a key point in the selection process is an audit to see that the body has all the bits it remembers having yesterday .   vimes checked .   then comes the tantalizing bit .  now that the snowball of consciousness is starting to roll  is it going to find that it   s waking up inside a body lying in a gutter with something multiple  the noun doesn   t matter after an adjective like    multiple     nothing good ever follows    multiple     or is it going to be a case of crisp sheets  a soothing hand  and a businesslike figure in white pulling open the curtains on a bright new day .  is it all over  with nothing worse to look forward to now than weak tea  nourishing gruel  short  strengthening walks in the garden and possibly a brief platonic love affair with a ministering angel  or was this all just a moment   s blackout and some looming bastard is now about to get down to real business with the thick end of a pickax helve .  are there  the consciousness wants to know  going to be grapes .   at this point some outside stimulus is helpful .     it   s going to be all right    is favorite  whereas    did anyone get his number .     is definitely a bad sign  either  however  is better than    you two hold his hands behind his back .      in fact someone said     you were nearly a goner there  captain .      the pain sensations  which had taken advantage of vimes   s unconscious state to bunk off for a metaphorical quick cigarette  rushed back .   vimes said     arrgh .     then he opened his eyes .   there was a ceiling .  this ruled out one particular range of unpleasant options and was very welcome .  his blurred vision also revealed corporal nobbs  which was less so .  corporal nobbs proved nothing  you could be dead and see something like corporal nobbs .   ankh morpork did not have many hospitals .  all the guilds maintained their own sanitariums  and there were a few public ones run by the odder religious organizations  like the balancing monks  but by and large medical assistance was nonexistent and people had to die inefficiently  without the aid of doctors .  it was generally thought that the existence of cures encouraged slackness and was in any case probably against nature   s way .      have i already said    where am i .        said vimes faintly .      yes .         did i get an answer .         dunno where this place is  captain .  it belongs to some posh bint .  she said to bring you up here .      even though vimes   s mind appeared to be full of pink treacle he nevertheless grabbed two clues and wrestled them together .  the combination of    rich    and    up here    meant something .  so did the strange chemical smell in the room  which even overpowered nobby   s more everyday odors .      we   re not talking about lady ramkin  are we .     he said cautiously .      you could be right .  great big biddy .  mad for dragons .     nobby   s rodent face broke into the most horribly knowing grin vimes had ever seen .     you   re in her bed     he said .   vimes peered around him  feeling the first overtures of a vague panic .  because now that he could halfway focus  he could see a certain lack of bachelor sockness about the place .  there was a faint hint of talcum powder .      bit of a boodwah     said nobby  with the air of a connoisseur .      hang on  hang on a minute     said vimes .     there was this dragon .  it was right over us        the memory rose up and hit him like a zombie with a grudge .      you all right  captain .         the talons  outspread  wide as a man   s reach  the boom and thump of the wings  bigger than sails  the stink of chemicals  the gods alone knew what sort     it had been so close he could see the tiny scales on its legs and the red gleam in its eyes .  they were more than just reptile eyes .  they were eyes you could drown in .   and the breath  so hot that it wasn   t like fire at all  but something almost solid  not burning things but smashing them apart     on the other hand  he was here and alive .  his left side felt as though it had been hit with an iron bar  but he was quite definitely alive .        what happened .     he said .      it was young carrot     said nobby .     he grabbed you and the sergeant and jumped off the roof just before it got us .         my side hurts .  it must have got me     said vimes .      no  i reckon that was where you hit the privy roof     said nobby .     and then you rolled off and hit the water butt .         what about colon .  is he hurt .         not hurt .  not exactly hurt .  he landed more sort of softly .  him being so heavy  he went through the roof .  talk about a short sharp shower of           and then what happened .         well  we sort of made you comfy  and then everyone went blundering about and shouting for the sergeant .  until they found out where he was  o   course  then they just stood where they were and shouted .  and then this woman come running up yelling     said nobby .      this is lady ramkin you   re referring to .     said vimes coldly .  his ribs were aching really magnificently now .      yeah .  big fat party     said nobby  unmoved .     cor  she can   t half boss people about .     oh  the poor dear man  you must bring him up to my house this instant .     so we did .  best place  too .  everyone   s running around down in the city like chickens with their heads cut off .         how much damage did it do .         well  after you were out of it the wizards hit it with fire balls .  it didn   t like that at all .  just seemed to make it stronger and angrier .  took out the university   s entire widdershins wing .         and    .         that   s about it  really .  it flamed a few more things  and then it must of flown away in all the smoke .         no one saw where it went .         if they did  they ain   t saying .     nobby sat back and leered .     disgusting  really  her livin    in a room like this .  she   s got pots of money  sarge says  she   s got no call livin    in ordinary rooms .  what   s the good of not wanting to be poor if the rich are allowed to go around livin    in ordinary rooms .  should be marble .     he sniffed .     anyway  she said i was to fetch her when you woke up .  she   s feeding her dragons now .  odd little buggers  aren   t they .  it   s amazing she   s allowed to keep    em .         what do you mean .         you know .  tarred with the same brush  and that .      when nobby had shambled out vimes took another look around the room .  it did  indeed  lack the gold leaf and marble that nobby felt was compulsory for people of a high station in life .  all the furniture was old  and the pictures on the wall  though doubtless valuable  looked the sort of pictures that are hung on bedroom walls because people can   t think of anywhere else to put them .  there were also a few amateurish watercolors of dragons .  all in all  it had the look about it of a room that is only ever occupied by one person  and has been absentmindedly molded around them over the years  like a suit of clothes with a ceiling .   it was clearly the room of a woman  but one who had cheerfully and without any silly moping been getting on with her life while all that soppy romance stuff had been happening to other people somewhere else  and been jolly grateful that she had her health .   such clothing as was visible had been chosen for sensible hardwearing qualities  possibly by a previous generation by the look of it  rather than its use as light artillery in the war between the sexes .  there were bottles and jars neatly arranged on the dressing table  but a certain severity of line suggested that their labels would say things like    rub on nightly    rather than    just a dab behind the ears .     you could imagine that the occupant of this room had slept in it all her life and had been called    my little girl    by her father until she was forty .   there was a big sensible blue dressing gown hanging behind the door .  vimes knew  without even looking  that it would have a rabbit on the pocket .   in short  it was the room of a woman who never expected that a man would ever see the inside of it .   the bedside table was piled high with papers .  feeling guilty  but doing it anyway  vimes squinted at them .   dragons was the theme .  there were letters from the cavern club exhibitions committee and the friendly flamethrowers league .  there were pamphlets and appeals from the sunshine sanctuary for sick dragons      poor little vinny   s fires were nearly damped after five years    cruel use as a paint stripper  but now       and there were requests for donations  and talks  and things that added up to a heart big enough for the whole world  or at least that part of it that had wings and breathed fire .   if you let your mind dwell on rooms like this  you could end up being oddly sad and full of a strange  diffuse compassion which would lead you to believe that it might be a good idea to wipe out the whole human race and start again with amoebas .   beside the drift of paperwork was a book .  vimes twisted painfully and looked at the spine .  it said  diseases of the dragon  by sybil deidre olgivanna ramkin .   he turned the stiff pages in horrified fascination .  they opened into another world  a world of quite stupefying problems .  slab throat .  the black tups .  dry lung .  storge .  staggers  heaves  weeps  stones .  it was amazing  he decided after reading a few pages  that a swamp dragon ever survived to see a second sunrise .  even walking across a room must be reckoned a biological triumph .     the painstakingly drawn illustrations he looked away from hurriedly .  you could only take so much innards .   there was a knock at the door .      i say .  are you decent .     lady ramkin boomed cheerfully .      er           i   ve brought you something jolly nourishing .      somehow vimes imagined it would be soup .  instead it was a plate stacked high with bacon  fried potatoes and eggs .  he could hear his arteries panic just by looking at it .      i   ve made a bread pudding  too     said lady ramkin  slightly sheepishly .     i don   t normally cook much  just for myself .  you know how it is  catering for one .      vimes thought about the meals at his lodgings .  somehow the meat was always gray  with mysterious tubes in it .      er     he began  not used to addressing ladies from a recumbent position in their own beds .     corporal nobbs tells me           and what a colorful little man nobby is .     said lady ramkin .   vimes wasn   t certain he could cope with this .      colorful .     he said weakly .      a real character .  we   ve been getting along famously .         you have .         oh  yes .  what a great fund of anecdotes he has .         oh  yes .  he   s got that all right .     it always amazed vimes how nobby got along with practically everyone .  it must  he   d decided  have something to do with the common denominator .  in the entire world of mathematics there could be no denominator as common as nobby .      er     he said  and then found he couldn   t leave this strange new byway     you don   t find his language a bit  er  ripe .         salty     corrected lady ramkin cheerfully .     you should have heard my father when he was annoyed .  anyway  we found we   ve got a lot in common .  it   s an amazing coincidence  but my grandfather once had his grandfather whipped for malicious lingering .      that must make them practically family  vimes thought .  another stab of pain from his stricken side made him wince .      you   ve got some very bad bruising and probably a cracked rib or two     she said .     if you roll over i   ll put some more of this on .     lady ramkin flourished a jar of yellow ointment .   panic crossed vimes   s face .  instinctively  he raised the sheets up around his neck .      don   t play silly buggers  man     she said .     i shan   t see anything i haven   t seen before .  one backside is pretty much like another .  it   s just that the ones i see generally have tails on .  now roll over and up with the nightshirt .  it belonged to my grandfather  you know .      there was no resisting that tone of voice .  vimes thought about demanding that nobby be brought in as a chaperon  and then decided that would be even worse .   the cream burned like ice .      what is it .         all kinds of stuff .  it   ll reduce the bruising and promote the growth of healthy scale .         what .         sorry .  probably not scale .  don   t look so worried .  i   m almost positive about that .  okay  all done .     she gave him a slap on the rump .      madam  i am captain of the night watch     said vimes  knowing it was a bloody daft thing to say even as he said it .      half naked in a lady   s bed  too     said lady ramkin  unmoved .     now sit up and eat your tea .  we   ve got to get you good and strong .        vimes   s eyes filled with panic .      why .     he said .   lady ramkin reached into the pocket of her grubby jacket .      i made some notes last night     she said .     about the dragon .         oh  the dragon .     vimes relaxed a bit .  right now the dragon seemed a much safer prospect .      and i did a bit of working out  too .  i   ll tell you this  it   s a very odd beast .  it shouldn   t be able to get airborne .         you   re right there .         if it   s built like swamp dragons  it should weigh about twenty tons .  twenty tons .  it   s impossible .  it   s all down to weight and wingspan ratios  you see .         i saw it drop off the tower like a swallow .         i know .  it should have torn its wings off and left a bloody great hole in the ground     said lady ramkin firmly .     you can   t muck about with aerodynamics .  you can   t just scale up from small to big and leave it at that  you see .  it   s all a matter of muscle power and lifting surfaces .         i knew there was something wrong     said vimes  brightening up .     and the flame  too .  nothing goes around with that kind of heat inside it .  how do swamp dragons manage it .         oh  that   s just chemicals     said lady ramkin dismissively .     they just distill something flammable from whatever they   ve eaten and ignite the flame just as it comes out of the ducts .  they never actually have fire inside them  unless they get a case of blowback .         what happens then .         you   re scraping dragon off the scenery     said lady ramkin cheerfully .     i   m afraid they   re not very well designed creatures  dragons .        vimes listened .   they would never have survived at all except that their home swamps were isolated and short of predators .  not that a dragon made good eating  anyway   once you   d taken away the leathery skin and the enormous flight muscles  what was left must have been like biting into a badly run chemical factory .  no wonder dragons were always ill .  they relied on permanent stomach trouble for supplies of fuel .  most of their brain power was taken up with controlling the complexities of their digestion  which could distill flame producing fuels from the most unlikely ingredients .  they could even rearrange their internal plumbing overnight to deal with difficult processes .  they lived on a chemical knife edge the whole time .  one misplaced hiccup and they were geography .   and when it came to choosing nesting sites  the females had all the common sense and mothering instinct of a brick .   vimes wondered why people had been so worried about dragons in the olden days .  if there was one in a cave near you  all you had to do was wait until it self ignited  blew itself up  or died of acute indigestion .      you   ve really studied them  haven   t you     he said .      someone ought to .         but what about the big ones .         golly  yes .  they   re a great mystery  you know     she said  her expression becoming extremely serious .      yes  you said .         there are legends  you know .  it seems as though one species of dragon started to get bigger and bigger and then   just vanished .         died out  you mean .         no   they turned up  sometimes .  from somewhere .  full of vim and vigor .  and then  one day  they stopped coming at all .     she gave vimes a triumphant look .     i think they found somewhere where they could really be .         really be what .         dragons .  where they could really fulfil their potential .  some other dimension or something .  where the gravity isn   t so strong  or something .         i thought when i saw it     said vimes     i thought  you can   t have something that flies and has scales like that .      they looked at each other .      we   ve got to find it in its lair     said lady ramkin .      no bloody flying newt sets fire to my city     said vimes .      just think of the contribution to dragon lore     said lady ramkin .      listen  if anyone ever sets fire to this city  it   s going to be me .         it   s an amazing opportunity .  there   s so many questions           you   re right there .     a phrase of carrot   s crossed vimes   s mind .     it can help us with our enquiries     he suggested .      but in the morning     said lady ramkin firmly .   vimes   s look of bitter determination faded .      i shall sleep downstairs  in the kitchen     said lady ramkin cheerfully .     i usually have a camp bed made up down there when it   s egg laying time .  some of the females always need assistance .  don   t you worry about me .         you   re being very helpful     vimes muttered .      i   ve sent nobby down to the city to help the others set up your headquarters     said lady ramkin .   vimes had completely forgotten the watch house .     it must have been badly damaged     he ventured .      totally destroyed     said lady ramkin .     just a patch of melted rock .  so i   m letting you have a place in pseudopolis yard .         sorry .           oh  my father had property all over the city     she said .     quite useless to me  really .  so i told my agent to give sergeant colon the keys to the old house in pseudopolis yard .  it   ll do it good to be aired .         but that area   i mean  there   s real cobbles on the streets   the rent alone  i mean  lord vetinari won   t           don   t you worry about it     she said  giving him a friendly pat .     now  you really ought to get some sleep .      vimes lay in bed  his mind racing .  pseudopolis yard was on the ankh side of the river  in quite a high rent district .  the sight of nobby or sergeant colon walking down the street in daylight would probably have the same effect on the area as the opening of a plague hospital .   he dozed  gliding in and out of a sleep where giant dragons pursued him waving jars of ointment     and awoke to the sound of a mob .       lady ramkin drawing herself up haughtily was not a sight to forget  although you could try .  it was like watching continental drift in reverse as various sub continents and islands pulled themselves together to form one massive  angry protowoman .   the broken door of the dragon house swung on its hinges .  the inmates  already as highly strung as a harp on amphetamines  were going mad .  little gouts of flame burst against the metal plates as they stampeded back and forth in their pens .      hwhat     she said     is the meaning of this .      if a ramkin had ever been given to introspection she   d have admitted that it wasn   t a very original line .  but it was handy .  it did the job .  the reason that cliches become cliches is that they are the hammers and screwdrivers in the toolbox of communication .   the mob filled the broken doorway .  some of it was waving various sharp implements with the up and down motion proper to rioters .      worl     said the leader     it   s the dragon  innit .      there was a chorus of muttered agreement .      hwhat about it .     said lady ramkin .      worl .  it   s been burning the city .  they don   t fly far .  you got dragons here .  could be one of them  couldn   t it .         yeah .         s   right .         qed .          so what we   re going to do is  we   re going to put    em down .         s   right .         yeah .         pro bono publico .      lady ramkin   s bosom rose and fell like an empire .  she reached out and grabbed the dunging fork from its hook on the wall .      one step nearer  i warn you  and you   ll be sorry     she said .   the leader looked beyond her to the frantic dragons .      yeah .     he said  nastily .     and what   ll you do  eh .      her mouth opened and shut once or twice .     i shall summon the watch .     she said at last .   the threat did not have the effect she had expected .  lady ramkin had never paid much attention to those bits of the city that didn   t have scales on .      well  that   s too bad     said the leader .     that   s really worrying you know that .  makes me go all weak at the knees  that does .      he extracted a lengthy cleaver from his belt .     and now you just stand aside  lady  because          a streak of green fire blasted out of the back of the shed  passed a foot over the heads of the mob  and burned a charred rosette in the woodwork over the door .   then came a voice that was a honeyed purr of sheer deadly menace .      this is lord mountjoy quickfang winterforth iv  the hottest dragon in the city .  it could burn your head clean off .      captain vimes limped forward from the shadows .   a small and extremely frightened golden dragon was clamped firmly under one arm .  his other hand held it by the tail .   the rioters watched it  hypnotized .      now i know what you   re thinking     vimes went on  softly .     you   re wondering  after all this excitement  has it got enough flame left .  and  y   know  i ain   t so sure myself        he leaned forward  sighting between the dragon   s ears  and his voice buzzed like a knife blade      what you   ve got to ask yourself is  am i feeling lucky .      they swayed backward as he advanced .      well .     he said .     are you feeling lucky .      for a few moments the only sound was lord mountjoy quickfang winterforth iv   s stomach rumbling ominously as fuel sloshed into his flame chambers .      now look  er     said the leader  his eyes fixed hypnotically on the dragon   s head     there   s no call for anything like that           in fact he might just decide to flare off all by himself     said vimes .     they have to do it to stop the gas building up .  it builds up when they get nervous .  and  y   know  i reckon you   ve made them all pretty nervous now .        the leader made what he hoped was a vaguely conciliatory gesture  but unfortunately did it with the hand that was still holding a knife .      drop it     said vimes sharply     or you   re history .      the knife clanged on the flagstones .  there was a scuffle at the back of the crowd as a number of people  metaphorically speaking  were a long way away and knew nothing about it .      but before the rest of you good citizens disperse quietly and go about your business     said vimes meaningfully     i suggest you look hard at these dragons .  do any of them look sixty feet long .  would you say they   ve got an eighty foot wingspan .  how hot do they flame  would you say .         dunno     said the leader .   vimes raised the dragon   s head slightly .  the leader rolled his eyes .      dunno  sir     he corrected .      do you want to find out .      the leader shook his head .  but he did manage to find his voice .      who are you  anyway .     he said .   vimes drew himself up .     captain vimes  city watch     he said .   this met with almost complete silence .  the exception was the cheerful voice  somewhere in the back of the crowd  which said     night shift  is it .      vimes looked down at his nightshirt .  in his hurry to get off his sickbed he   d shuffled hastily into a pair of lady ramkin   s slippers .  for the first time he saw they had pink pompoms on them .   and it was at this moment that lord mountjoy quickfang winterforth iv chose to belch .   it wasn   t another stab of roaring fire .  it was just a near invisible ball of damp flame which rolled over the mob and singed a few eyebrows .  but it definitely made an impression .   vimes rallied magnificently .  they couldn   t have noticed his brief moment of sheer horror .      that one was just to get your attention     he said  pokerfaced .     the next one will be a little lower .         er     said the leader .     right you are .  no problem .  we were just going anyhow .  no big dragons here  right enough .  sorry you   ve been troubled .         oh  no     said lady ramkin triumphantly .     you don   t get away that easily .     she reached up onto a shelf and produced a tin box .  it had a slot in the lid .  it rattled .  on the side was the legend  the sunshine sanctuary for sick dragons .   the initial whip around produced four dollars and thirty one pence .  after captain vimes gestured pointedly with the dragon  a further twenty five dollars and sixteen pence were miraculously forthcoming .  then the mob fled .      we made a profit on the day  anyway     said vimes  when they were alone again .      that was jolly brave of you .         let   s just hope it doesn   t catch on     said vimes  gingerly putting the exhausted dragon back in its pen .  he felt quite lightheaded .   once again he was aware of eyes staring fixedly at him .  he glanced sideways into the long  pointed face of goodboy bindle featherstone  rearing up in a pose best described as the last puppy in the shop .   to his astonishment  he found himself reaching over and scratching it behind its ears  or at least behind the two spiky things at the sides of its head which were presumably its ears .  it responded with a strange noise that sounded like a complicated blockage in a brewery .  he took his hand away hurriedly .      it   s all right     said lady ramkin .     it   s his stomachs rumbling .  that means he likes you .      to his amazement  vimes found that he was rather pleased about this .  as far as he could recall  nothing in his life before had thought him worth a burp .      i thought you were  er  going to get rid of him     he said .      i suppose i shall have to     she said .     you know how it is  though .  they look up at you with those big  soulful eyes        there was a brief  mutual  awkward silence .      how would it be if i           you don   t think you might like        they stopped .      it   d be the least i could do     said lady ramkin .      but you   re already giving us the new headquarters and everything .         that was simply my duty as a good citizen     said lady ramkin .     please accept goodboy as  as a friend .      vimes felt that he was being inched out over a very deep chasm on a very thin plank .      i don   t even know what they eat     he said .      they   re omnivores  actually     she said .     they eat everything except metal and igneous rocks .  you can   t be finicky  you see  when you evolve in a swamp .         but doesn   t he need to be taken for walks .  or flights  or whatever .         he seems to sleep most of the time .     she scratched the ugly thing on top of its scaly head .     he   s the most relaxed dragon i   ve ever bred  i must say .         what about  er  you know .     he indicated the dunging fork .        well  it   s mainly gas .  just keep him somewhere well ventilated .  you haven   t got any valuable carpets  have you .  it   s best not to let them lick your face  but they can be trained to control their flame .  they   re very helpful for lighting fires .      goodboy bindle featherstone curled up amidst a barrage of plumbing noises .   they   ve got eight stomachs  vimes remembered  the drawings in the book had been very detailed .  and there   s lots of other stuff like fractional distillation tubes and mad alchemy sets in there .   no swamp dragon could ever terrorize a kingdom  except by accident .  vimes wondered how many had been killed by enterprising heroes .  it was terribly cruel to do something like that to creatures whose only crime was to blow themselves absent mindedly to pieces in mid air  which was not something any individual dragon made a habit of .  it made him quite angry to think about it .  a race of  of whittles  that   s what dragons were .  born to lose .  live fast  die wide .  omnivores or not  what they must really live on was their nerves  flapping apologetically through the world in mortal fear of their own digestive system .  the family would be just getting over father   s explosion  and some twerp in a suit of armor would come plodding into the swamp to stick a sword into a bag of guts that was only one step away from self destruction in any case .   huh .  it   d be interesting to see how the great dragon slayers of the past stood up to the big dragon .  armor .  best not to wear it .  it   d all be the same in any case  and at least your ashes wouldn   t come prepackaged in their own foil .   he stared and stared at the malformed little thing  and the idea that had been knocking for attention for the last few minutes finally gained entrance .  everyone in ankh morpork wanted to find the dragon   s lair .  at least  wanted to find it empty .  bits of wood on a stick wouldn   t do it  he was certain .  but  as they said  set a thief      he said     cloud one dragon sniff out another .  i mean  follow a scent .          dearest mother  wrote carrot  talk about a turn up for the books .  last night the dragon burned up our headquarters and lo and behold we have been given a better one  it is in a place called pseudopolis yard  opposite the opera house .  sgt .  colon said we have gone up in the world and has told nobby not to try to sell the furnishings .  going up in the world is a metaphor  which i am learning about  it is like lying but more decorative .  there are proper carpets to spit on .  twice today groups of people have tried to search the cellars here for the dragon  it is amazing .  and digging up people   s privies and poking into attics  it is like a fever .  one thing is  people haven   t got time for much else  and sgt .  colon says  when you go out on your rounds and shout twelve of the clock and all   s well while a dragon is melting the street you feel a bit of a burke .   i have moved out of mrs .  palm   s because  there are dozens of bedrooms here .  it was sad and they made me a cake but i think it is for the best  although mrs .  palm never charged me rent which was very nice of her considering she is a widow with so many fine daughters to bring up plus dowries ekcetra .   also i have made friends with this ape who keeps coming around to see if we have found his book .  nobby says it is a flea ridden moron because it won   d off him playing cripple mr .  onion  which is a game of chance with cards which i do not play  i have told nobby about the gambling  regulation  acts  and he said piss off  which i think is in violation of the decency ordinances of      but i have decided to use my discretion .   capt vimes is ill and is being looked after by a lady .  nobby says it is well known she is mental  but sgt .  colon says its just because of living in a big house with a lot of dragons but she is worth a fortune and well done to the capt for getting his feet under the table .  i do not see what the furniture has to do with it .  this morning i went for a walk with reet and showed her many interesting examples of the iron work to be found in the city .  she said it was very interesting .  she said i was quite different to anyone she   s ever met .  your loving son  carrot . x  ps i hope minty is keeping well .       he folded the paper carefully and shoved it into the envelope .      sun   s going down     said sergeant colon .   carrot looked up from his sealing wax .      that means it will be night soon     colon went on  accurately .      yes  sergeant .      colon ran a finger around his collar .  his skin was impressively pink  the result of a morning   s scrubbing  but people were still staying at a respectful distance .   some people are born to command .  some people achieve command .  and others have command thrust upon them  and the sergeant was now included in this category and wasn   t very happy about it .   any minute now  he knew  he was going to have to say that it was time they went out on patrol .  he didn   t want to go out on patrol .  he wanted to find a nice sub basement somewhere .  but nobblyess obligay   if he was in charge  he had to do it .   it wasn   t the loneliness of command that was bothering him .  it was the being fried alive of command that was giving him problems .   he was also pretty sure that unless they came up with something about this dragon very soon then the patrician was going to be unhappy .  and when the patrician was unhappy  he became very democratic .  he found intricate and painful ways of spreading that unhappiness as far as possible .  responsibility  the sergeant thought  was a terrible thing .  so was being horribly tortured .  as far as he could see  the two facts were rapidly heading toward one another .   and thus he was terribly relieved when a small coach pulled up outside the yard .  it was very old  and battered .  there was a faded coat of arms on the door .  painted on the back  and rather newer  was the little message  whinny if you love dragons .   out of it  wincing as he got down  stepped captain vimes .  following him was the woman known to the sergeant as mad sybil ramkin .  and finally  hopping down obediently on the end of its lead  was a small     the sergeant was too nervous to take account of actual size .      well  i   ll be mogadored .  they   ve only gone and caught it .      nobby looked up from the table in the corner where he was continually failing to learn that it is almost impossible to play a game of skill and bluff against an opponent who smiles all the time .  the librarian took advantage of the diversion to help himself to a couple of cards off the bottom of the pack .      don   t be daft .  that   s just a swamp dragon     said nobby .     she   s all right  is lady sybil .  a real lady .      the other two guards turned and stared at him .  this was nobby talking .      you two can bloody well stop that     he said .     why shouldn   t i know a lady when i sees one .  she give me a cup of tea in a cup fin as paper and a silver spoon in it     he said  speaking as one who had peeped over the plateau of social distinction .     and i give it back to her  so you can stop looking at me like that .         what is it you actually do on your evenings off .     said colon .      no business of yourn .         did you really give the spoon back .     said carrot .      yes i bloody well did .     said nobby hotly .      attention  lads     said the sergeant  flooded with relief .   the other two entered the room .  vimes gave his men his usual look of resigned dismay .      my squad     he mumbled .      fine body of men     said lady ramkin .     the good old rank and file  eh .         the rank  anyway     said vimes .   lady ramkin beamed encouragingly .  this led to a strange shuffling among the men .  sergeant colon  by dint of some effort  managed to make his chest stick out more than his stomach .  carrot straightened up from his habitual stoop .  nobby vibrated with soldierly bearing  hands thrust straight down by his sides  thumbs pointing sharply forward  pigeon chest inflated so much that his feet were in danger of leaving the ground .        i always think we can all sleep safer in my bed knowing that these brave men are watching over us     said lady ramkin  walking sedately along the rank  like a treasure galleon running ahead of a mild breeze .     and who is this .      it is difficult for an orangutan to stand to attention .  its body can master the general idea  but its skin can   t .  the librarian was doing his best  however  standing in a sort of respectful heap at the end of the line and maintaining the kind of complex salute you can only achieve with a four foot arm .         e   s plain clothes  ma   am     said nobby smartly .     special ape services .         very enterprising .  very enterprising indeed     said lady ramkin .     how long have you been an ape  my man .         oook .         well done .     she turned to vimes  who was definitely looking incredulous .      a credit to you     she said .     a fine body of men           oook .            anthropoids     corrected lady ramkin  with barely a break in the flow .   for a moment the rank felt as though they had just returned from single handedly conquering a distant province .  they felt  in fact  tremendously bucked up  which was how lady ramkin would almost certainly have put it and which was definitely several letters of the alphabet away from how they normally felt .  even the librarian felt favored  and for once had let the phrase    my man    pass without comment .   a trickling noise and a strong chemical smell prompted them to look around .   goodboy bindle featherstone was squatting with an air of sheepish innocence alongside what was not so much a stain on the carpet as a hole in the floor .  a few wisps of smoke were curling up from the edges .     lady ramkin sighed .      don   t you worry  ma   am     volunteered nobby cheerfully .     soon have that cleaned up .         i   m afraid they   re often like that when they   re excited     she said .      fine specimen you got there  ma   am     nobby went on  revelling in the new found experience of social intercourse .      it   s not mine     she said .     it belongs to the captain now .  or all of you  perhaps .  a sort of mascot .  his name is goodboy bindle featherstone .      goodboy bindle featherstone bore up stoically under the weight of the name  and sniffed a table leg .      he looks more like my brother errol     said nobby  playing the cheeky chirpy lovable city sparrow card for all it was worth .     got the same pointed nose  excuse me for saying so  milady .      vimes looked at the creature  which was investigating its new environment  and knew that it was now  irrevocably  an errol .  the little dragon took an experimental bite out of the table  chewed it for a few seconds  spat it out  curled up and went to sleep .      he ain   t going to set fire to anything  is he .     said the sergeant anxiously .      i don   t think so .  he doesn   t seem to have worked out what his flame ducts are for yet     said lady ramkin .      you can   t teach him anything about relaxing  though     said vimes .     anyway  men           oook .         i wasn   t talking to you  sir .  what   s this doing here .         er     said sergeant colon hurriedly     i  er   with you being away and all  and us likely to be short handed   carrot here says it   s all according to the law and that   i swore him in  sir .  the ape  sir .           swore him in what  sergeant .     said vimes .      as special constable  sir     said colon  blushing .     you know  sir .  sort of citizen   s watch .      vimes threw up his hands .     special .  bloody unique .      the librarian gave vimes a big smile .      just temporarily  sir .  for the duration  like     said colon pleadingly .     we could do with the help  sir  and   well  he   s the only one who seems to like us           i think it   s a frightfully good idea     said lady ramkin .     well done  that ape .      vimes shrugged .  the world was mad enough already  what could make it worse .      okay     he said .     okay .  i give in .  fine .  give him a badge  although i   m damned if i know where he   ll wear it .  fine .  yes .  why not .         you all right  captain .     said colon  all concern .      fine .  fine .  welcome to the new watch .     snapped vimes  striding vaguely around the room .     great .  after all  we pay peanuts  don   t we  so we might as well employ mon        the sergeant   s hand slapped respectfully across vimes   s mouth .      er  just one thing  captain     said colon urgently  to vimes   s astonished eyes .     you don   t use the    m    word .  gets right up his nose  sir .  he can   t help it  he loses all self control .  like a red rag to a wossname  sir .     ape    is all right  sir  but not the    m    word .  because  sir  when he gets angry he doesn   t just go and sulk  sir  if you get my drift .  he   s no trouble at all apart from that  sir .  all right .  just don   t say monkey .  ohshit .          the brethren were nervous .   he   d heard them talking .  things were moving too fast for them .  he thought he   d led them into the conspiracy a bit at a time  never giving them more truth than their little brains could cope with  but he   d still overestimated them .  a firm hand was needed .  firm but fair .      brothers     said the supreme grand master     are the cuffs of veracity duly enhanced .         what .     said brother watchtower vaguely .     oh .  the cuffs .  yeah .  enhanced .  right .         and the martlets of beckoning  are they fittingly divested .      brother plasterer gave a guilty start .     me .  what .  oh .  fine  no problem .  divested .  yes .      the supreme grand master paused .      brothers     he said softly .     we are so near .  just once more .  just a few hours .  once more and the world is ours .  do you understand  brothers .      brother plasterer shuffled a foot .      well     he said .     i mean  of course .  yes .  no fears about that .  behind you one hundred and ten percent        he   s going to say only  thought the supreme grand master .         only        ah .         we  that is  all of us  we   ve been   odd  really  you feel so different  don   t you  after summoning the dragon  sort of           cleaned out     said brother plasterer helpfully .         yes  like it   s sort of       brother watchtower struggled with the serpents of self expression      taking something out of you           sucked dry     said brother plasterer .      yes  like he said  and we   well  it   s maybe it   s a bit risky           like stuff   s been dragged from your actual living brain by eldritch creatures from the beyond     said brother plasterer .      i   d have said more like a bit of a sick headache  myself     said brother watchtower helplessly .     and we was wondering  you know  about all this stuff about cosmic balance and that  because  well  look what happened to poor old dunnykin .  could be a bit of a judgment .  er .         it was just a maddened crocodile hidden in a flower bed     said the supreme grand master .     it could have happened to anyone .  i understand your feelings  however .         you do .     said brother watchtower .      oh  yes .  they   re only natural .  all the greatest wizards feel a little ill at ease before undertaking a great work such as this .     the brethren preened themselves .  great wizards .  that   s us .  yeah .     but in a few hours it   ll be over  and i am sure that the king will reward you handsomely .  the future will be glorious .      this normally did the trick .  it didn   t appear to be working this time .      but the dragon       brother watchtower began .      there won   t be any dragon .  we won   t need it .  look     said the supreme grand master     it   s quite simple .  the lad will have a marvelous sword .  everyone knows kings have marvelous swords           this   d be the marvelous sword you   ve been telling us about  would it .     said brother plasterer .      and when it touches the dragon     said the supreme grand master     it   ll be   foom .         yeah  they do that     said brother doorkeeper .     my uncle kicked a swamp dragon once .  he found it eating his pumpkins .  damn thing nearly took his leg off .      the supreme grand master sighed .  a few more hours  yes  and then no more of this .  the only thing he hadn   t decided was whether to let them alone   who   d believe them  after all .    or send the guard to arrest them for being terminally stupid .      no     he said patiently     i mean the dragon will vanish .  we   ll have sent it back .  end of dragon .         won   t people be a bit suspicious .     said brother plasterer .     won   t they expect lumps of dragon all over the place .         no     said the supreme grand master triumphantly     because one touch from the sword of truth and justice will totally destroy the spawn of evil .      the brethren stared at him .      that   s what they   ll believe  anyway     he added .     we can provide a bit of mystic smoke at the time .         dead easy  mystic smoke     said brother fingers .      no bits  then .     said brother plasterer  a shade disappointed .   brother watchtower coughed .     dunno if people will accept that     he said .     sounds a bit too neat  like .         listen     snapped the supreme grand master     they   ll accept anything .  they   ll see it happen .  people will be so keen to see the boy win  they won   t think twice about it .  depend upon it .  now   let us commence        he concentrated .   yes  it was easier .  easier every time .  he could feel the scales  feel the rage of the dragon as he reached into the place where the dragons went and took control .   this was power  and it was his .       sergeant colon winced .     ow .         don   t be a big softly     said lady ramkin cheerfully  tightening the bandage with a well practiced skill handed down through many generations of ramkin womenfolk .     he hardly touched you .           and he   s very sorry     said carrot sharply .     show the sergeant how sorry you are .  go on .         oook     said the librarian  sheepishly .      don   t let him kiss me .     squeaked colon .      do you think picking someone up by their ankles and bouncing their head on the floor comes under the heading of striking a superior officer .     said carrot .      i   m not pressing charges  me     said the sergeant hurriedly .      can we get on .     said vimes impatiently .     we   re going to see if errol can sniff out the dragon   s lair .  lady ramkin thinks it   s got to be worth a try .         you mean set a deep hole with spring loaded sides  tripwires  whirling knife blades driven by water power  broken glass and scorpions  to catch a thief  captain .     said the sergeant doubtfully .     ow .         yes  we don   t want to lose the scent     said lady ramkin .     stop being a big baby  sergeant .         brilliant idea about using errol  ma   am  if i may make so bold     said nobby  while the sergeant blushed under his bandage .   vimes was not certain how long he would be able to put up with nobby the social mountaineer .   carrot said nothing .  he was gradually coming to terms with the fact that he probably wasn   t a dwarf  but dwarf blood flowed in his veins in accordance with the famous principle of morphic resonance  and his borrowed genes were telling him that nothing was going to be that simple .  finding a hoard even when the dragon wasn   t at home was pretty risky .  anyway  he was certain he   d know if there was one around .  the presence of large amounts of gold always made a dwarf   s palms itch  and his weren   t itching .      we   ll start by that wall in the shades     said the captain .     sergeant colon glanced sideways at lady ramkin  and found it impossible to show cowardice in the face of the supportive .  he contented himself with     is that wise  captain .         of course it isn   t .  if we were wise  we wouldn   t be in the watch .         i say .  all this is tremendously exciting     said lady ramkin .      oh  i don   t think you should come  m   lady       vimes began .         sybil  please .               it   s a very disreputable area  you see .         but i   m sure i shall be perfectly safe with your men     she said .     i   m sure vagabonds just melt away when they see you .      that   s dragons  thought vimes .  they melt away when they see dragons  and just leave their shadows on the wall .  whenever he felt that he was slowing down  or that he was losing interest  he remembered those shadows  and it was like having dull fire poured down his backbone .  things like that shouldn   t be allowed to happen .  not in my city .       in fact the shades were not a problem .  many of its denizens were out hoard hunting anyway  and those that remained were far less inclined than hitherto to lurk in dark alleys .  besides  the more sensible of them recognized that lady ramkin  if waylaid  would probably tell them to pull up their socks and not be silly  in a voice so used to command that they would probably find themselves doing it .   the wall hadn   t been knocked down yet and still bore its grisly fresco .  errol sniffed around it  trotted up the alley once or twice  and went to sleep .      dint work     said sergeant colon .      good idea  though     said nobby loyally .        it could be all the rain and people walking about  i suppose     said lady ramkin .   vimes scooped up the dragon .  it had been a vain hope anyway .  it was just better to be doing something than nothing .      we   d better get back     he said .     the sun   s gone down .      they walked back in silence .  the dragon   s even tamed the shades  vimes thought .  it   s taken over the whole city  even when it isn   t here .  people   ll start tying virgins to rocks any day now .   it   s a metaphor of human bloody existence  a dragon .  and if that wasn   t bad enough  it   s also a bloody great hot flying thing .   he pulled out the key to the new headquarters .  while he was fumbling in the lock  errol woke up and started to yammer .      not now     vimes said .  his side twinged .  the night had barely started and already he felt too tired .   a slate slid down the roof and smashed on the cobbles beside him .      captain     hissed sergeant colon .      what .         it   s on the roof  captain .      something about the sergeant   s voice got through to vimes .  it wasn   t excited .  it wasn   t frightened .  it just had a tone of dull  leaden terror .   he looked up .  errol started to bounce up and down under his arm .   the dragon   the dragon   was peering down interestedly over the guttering .  its face alone was taller than a man .  its eyes were the size of very large eyes  colored a smoldering red and filled with an intelligence that had nothing to do with human beings .  it was far older  for one thing .  it was an intelligence that had already been long basted in guile and marinated in cunning by the time a group of almost monkeys were wondering whether standing on two legs was a good career move .  it wasn   t an intelligence that had any truck with  or even understood  the arts of diplomacy .   it wouldn   t play with you  or ask you riddles .  but it understood all about arrogance and power and cruelty and if it could possibly manage it  it would burn your head off .  because it liked to .   it was even more angry than usual at the moment .  it could sense something behind its eyes .  a tiny  weak  alien mind  bloated with self satisfaction .  it was infuriating  like an unscratchable itch .  it was making it do things it didn   t want to do   and stopping it from doing things it wanted to do very much .   those eyes were  for the moment  focused on errol  who was going frantic .  vimes realized that all that stood between him and a million degrees of heat was the dragon   s vague interest in why vimes had a smaller dragon under his arm .      don   t make any sudden moves     said lady ramkin   s voice behind him .     and don   t show fear .  they can always tell when you   re afraid .         is there any other advice you can offer at this time .     said vimes slowly  trying to speak without moving his lips .      well  tickling them behind their ears often works .         oh     said vimes weakly .      and a good sharp    no .     and taking away their food bowl .         ah .         and hitting them on the nose with a roll of paper is what i do in extreme cases .      in the slow  brightly outlined  desperate world vimes was now inhabiting  which seemed to revolve around the craggy nostrils a few meters away from him  he became aware of a gentle hissing sound .   the dragon was taking a deep breath .   the intake of air stopped .  vimes looked into the darkness of the flame ducts and wondered whether he   d see anything  whether there   d be some tiny white glow or something  before fiery oblivion swept over him .   at that moment a horn rang out .   the dragon raised its head in a puzzled way and made a noise that sounded vaguely interrogative without being in any way a word .   the horn rang out again .  the noise seemed to have a number of echoes that lived a life of their own .  it sounded like a challenge .  if that wasn   t what it was  then the horn blower was soon going to be in trouble  because the dragon gave vimes a smoldering look  unfolded its enormous wings  leapt heavily into the air and  against all the rules of aeronautics  flew slowly away in the direction of the sound .   nothing in the world should have been able to fly like that .  the wings thumped up and down with a noise like potted thunder  but the dragon moved as though it was idly sculling through the air .  if it stopped flapping  the movement suggested  it would simply glide to a halt .  it floated  not flew .  for something the size of a barn with an armor plated hide  it was a pretty good trick .   it passed over their heads like a barge  heading for the plaza of broken moons .      follow it .     shouted lady ramkin .      that   s not right  it flying like that .  i   m pretty sure there   s something in one of the witchcraft laws     said carrot  taking out his notebook .     and it   s damaged the roof .  it   s really piling up the offenses  you know .           you all right  captain .     said sergeant colon .      i could see right up its nose     said captain vimes dreamily .  his eyes focused on the worried face of the sergeant .     where   s it gone .     he demanded .  colon pointed along the street .   vimes glowered at the shape disappearing over the rooftops .      follow it .     he said .       the horn sounded again .   other people were hurrying toward the plaza .  the dragon drifted ahead of them like a shark heading toward a wayward airbed  its tail flicking slowly from side to side .      some loony is going to fight it .     said nobby .      i thought someone would have a go     said colon .     poor bugger   ll be baked in his own armor .      this seemed to be the opinion of the crowds lining the plaza .  the people of ankh morpork had a straightforward  no nonsense approach to entertainment  and while they were looking forward to seeing a dragon slain  they   d be happy to settle instead for seeing someone being baked alive in his own armor .  you didn   t get the chance every day to see someone baked alive in their own armor .  it would be something for the children to remember .   vimes was jostled and bounced around by the crowd as more people flooded into the plaza behind them .   the horn sounded a third challenge .      that   s a slug horn  that is     said colon knowledgeably .     like a tocsin  only deeper .         you sure .     said nobby .      yep .         it must have been a bloody big slug .         peanuts .  figgins .  hot sausages .     whined a voice behind them .     hallo  lads .  hallo  captain vimes .  in at the death  eh .  have a sausage .  on the house .         what   s going on  throat .     said vimes  clinging to the vendor   s tray as more people spilled around them .      some kid   s ridden into the city and said he   d kill the dragon     said cut me own throat .     got a magic sword  he says .         has he got a magic skin .         you   ve got no romance in your soul  captain     said throat  removing a very hot toasting fork from the tiny frying pan on his tray and applying it gently to the buttock of a large woman in front of him .     stand aside  madam  commerce is the lifeblood of the city  thank you very much .  o   course     he continued     by rights there should be a maiden chained to a rock .  only the aunt said no .  that   s the trouble with some people .  no sense of tradition .  this lad says he   s the rightful air  too .      vimes shook his head .  the world was definitely going mad around him .     you   ve lost me there     he said .      air     said throat patiently .     you know .  air to the throne .         what throne .         the throne of ankh .         what throne of ankh .         you know .  kings and that .     throat looked reflective .     wish i knew what his bloody name is     he said .     i put an order in to igneous the troll   s all night wholesale pottery for three gross of coronation mugs and it   s going to be a right pain  painting all the names in afterward .  shall i put you down for a couple  cap   n .  to you ninety pence  and that   s cutting me own throat .      vimes gave up  and shoved his way back through the throng using carrot as a lighthouse .  the lance constable loomed over the crowd  and the rest of the rank had anchored themselves to him .      it   s all gone mad     he shouted .     what   s going on  carrot .         there   s a lad on a horse in the middle of the plaza     said carrot .     he   s got a glittery sword  you know .  doesn   t seem to be doing much at the moment  though .      vimes fought his way into the lee of lady ramkin .      kings     he panted .     of ankh .  and thrones .  are there .         what .  oh  yes .  there used to be     said lady ramkin .     hundreds of years ago .  why .         some kid says he   s heir to the throne .         that   s right     said throat  who   d followed vimes in the hope of clinching a sale .     he made a big speech about how he was going to kill the dragon  overthrow the usurpers and right all wrongs .  everyone cheered .  hot sausages  two for a dollar  made of genuine pig  why not buy one for the lady .         don   t you mean pork  sir .     said carrot warily  eyeing the glistening tubes .      manner of speaking  manner of speaking     said throat quickly .     certainly your actual pig products .  genuine pig .         everyone cheers any speech in this city     growled vimes .     it doesn   t mean anything .         get your pig sausages  five for two dollars .     said throat  who never let a conversation stand in the way of trade .     could be good for business  could monarchy .  pig sausages .  pig sausages .  inna bun .  and righting all wrongs  too .  sounds like a solid idea to me .  with onions .         can i press you to a hot sausage  ma   am .     said nobby .   lady ramkin looked at the tray around throat   s neck .  thousands of years of good breeding came to her aid and there was only the faintest suggestion of horror in her voice when she said     my  they look good .  what splendid foodstuffs .           are they made by monks on some mystic mountain .     said carrot .   throat gave him an odd look .     no     he said patiently     by pigs .         what wrongs .     said vimes urgently .     come on  tell me .  what wrongs is he going to right .         we ell     said throat     there   s  well  taxes .  that   s wrong  for a start .     he had the grace to look slightly embarrassed .  paying taxes was something that  in throat   s world  happened only to other people .      that   s right     said an old woman next to him .     and the gutter of my house leaks something dreadful and the landlord won   t do nothing .  that   s wrong .         and premature baldness     said the man in front of her .     that   s wrong  too .     vimes   s mouth dropped open .      ah .  kings can cure that  you know     said another protomonarchist knowingly .      as a matter of fact     said throat  rummaging in his pack     i   ve got one bottle left of this astonishing ointment what is made       he glared at carrot      by some ancient monks who live on a mountain           and they can   t answer back  you know     the monarchist went on .     that   s how you can tell they   re royal .  completely incapable of it .  it   s to do with being gracious .         fancy     said the leaky guttering woman .      money  too     said the monarchist  enjoying the attention .     they don   t carry it .  that   s how you can always tell a king .         why .  it   s not that heavy     said the man whose remaining hair was spread across the dome of his head like the remnant of a defeated army .     i can carry hundreds of dollars  no problem .         you probably get weak arms  being a king     said the woman wisely .     probably with the waving .           i   ve always thought     said the monarchist  pulling out a pipe and beginning to fill it with the ponderous air of one who is going to deliver a lecture     that one of the major problems of being a king is the risk of your daughter getting a prick .      there was a thoughtful pause .      and falling asleep for a hundred years     the monarchist went on stolidly .      ah     said the others  unaccountably relieved .      and then there   s wear and tear on peas     he added .      well  there would be     said the woman  uncertainly .      having to sleep on them all the time     said the monarchist .      not to mention hundreds of mattresses .         right .         is that so .  i think i could get    em for him wholesale     said throat .  he turned to vimes  who had been listening to all this with leaden depression .     see  captain .  and you   d be in the royal guard  i expect .  get some plumes in your helmet .         ah  pageantry     said the monarchist  pointing with his pipe .     very important .  lots of spectacles .         what  free .     said throat .      we ell  i think maybe you have to pay for the frames     said the monarchist .      you   re all bloody mad .     shouted vimes .     you don   t know anything about him and he hasn   t even won yet .         bit of a formality  i expect     said the woman .      it   s a fire breathing dragon .     screamed vimes  remembering those nostrils .     and he   s just a guy on a horse  for heaven   s sake .      throat prodded him gently in the breastplate .     you got no soul  cap   n     he said .     when a stranger comes into the city under the thrall of the dragon and challenges it with a glittery sword  weeell  there   s only one outcome  ain   t there .  it   s probably destiny .         thrall .     shouted vimes .     thrall .  you thieving bugger  throat  you were flogging cuddly dragon dolls yesterday .         that was just business  cap   n .  no need to get excited about it     said throat pleasantly .   vimes went back to the rank in a gloomy rage .  say what you liked about the people of ankh morpork they had always been staunchly independent  yielding to no man their right to rob  defraud  embezzle and murder on an equal basis .  this seemed absolutely right  to vimes   s way of thinking .  there was no difference at all between the richest man and the poorest beggar  apart from the fact that the former had lots of money  food  power  fine clothes  and good health .  but at least he wasn   t any better .  just richer  fatter  more powerful  better dressed and healthier .  it had been like that for hundreds of years .      and now they get one sniff of an ermine robe and they go all gooey     he muttered .   the dragon was circling the plaza slowly and warily .  vimes craned to see over the heads in front of him .   in the same way that various predators have the silhouette of their prey almost programmed into their genes  it was possible that the shape of someone on a horse holding a sword clicked a few tumblers in a dragon   s brain .  it was showing keen but wary interest .   back in the crowd  vimes shrugged .     i didn   t even know we were a kingdom .         well  we haven   t been for ages     said lady ramkin .     the kings got thrown out  and jolly good job too .  they could be quite frightful .         but you   re  well  from a pos   from a high born family     he said .     i should have thought you   d be all for kings .         some of them were fearful oiks  you know     she said airily .     wives all over the place  and chopping people   s heads off  fighting pointless wars  eating with their knife  chucking half eaten chicken legs over their shoulders  that sort of thing .  not our sort of people at all .      the plaza went quiet .  the dragon had flapped slowly to the far end and was almost stationary in the air  apart from the slow beating of its wings .   vimes felt something claw gently at his back  and then errol was on his shoulder  gripping with his hind claws .  his stubby wings were beating in time with those of the bigger specimen .  he was hissing .  his eyes were fixed on the hovering bulk .   the boy   s horse jigged nervously on the plaza   s flagstones as he dismounted  flourished the sword and turned to face the distant enemy .   he certainly looks confident  vimes told himself .  on the other hand  how does the ability to slay dragons fit you for kingship in this day and age .   it was certainly a very shiny sword .  you had to admit that .       and now it was two of the clock the following morning .  and all was well  apart from the rain .  it was drizzling again .   there are some towns in the multiverse which think they know how to have a good time .  places like new orleans and rio reckon they not only know how to push the boat out but set fire to the harbor as well  but compared to ankh morpork with its hair down they   re a welsh village at   p . m .  on a wet sunday afternoon .   fireworks banged and sparkled in the damp air over the turbid mud of the river ankh .  various domesticated animals were being roasted in the streets .  dancers conga   d from house to house  often managing to pick up any loose ornaments while doing so .  there was a lot of quaffing going on .  people who in normal circumstances would never think of doing it were shouting    hurrah .      vimes stalked gloomily through the crowded streets  feeling like the only pickled onion in a fruit salad .  he   d given the rank the evening off .   he wasn   t feeling at all royalist .  he didn   t think he had anything against kings as such  but the sight of ankh morporkians waving flags was mysteriously upsetting .  that was something only silly subject people did  in other countries .  besides  the idea of royal plumes in his hat revolted him .  he   d always had a thing about plumes .  plumes sort of  well  bought you off  told everyone that you didn   t belong to yourself .  and he   d feel like a bird .  it   d be the last straw .   his errant feet led him back to the yard .  after all  where else was there .  his lodgings were depressing and his landlady had complained about the holes which  despite much shouting  errol kept making in the carpet .  and the smell errol made .  and vimes couldn   t drink in a tavern tonight without seeing things that would upset him even more than the things he normally saw when he was drunk .   it was nice and quiet  although the distant sounds of revelry could be heard through the window .   errol scrambled down from his shoulder and started to eat the coke in the fireplace .   vimes sat back and put his feet up .   what a day .  and what a fight .  the dodging  the weaving  the shouts of the crowd  the young man standing there looking tiny and unprotected  the dragon taking a deep breath in a way now very familiar to vimes     and not flaming .  that had surprised vimes .  it had surprised the crowd .  it had certainly surprised the dragon  which had tried to squint at its own nose and clawed desperately at its flame ducts .  it had remained surprised right up to the moment when the lad ducked in under one claw and thrust the sword home .   and then a thunderclap .   you   d have thought there   d have been some bits of dragon left  really .   vimes pulled a scrap of paper toward him .  he looked at the notes he   d made yesterday       itym  heavy draggon  but yet it can flye right welle   itym  the fyre be main hot  yet issueth from ane living thinge   itym  the swamp draggons be right poor thinges  yet this monstrous form waxeth full mightily   itym  from whence it cometh none knowe  nor wither it goeth  nor where it bideth betweentimes   itym  whyfore did it burneth so neatlie .       he pulled the pen and ink toward him and  in a slow around hand  added       itym  can a draggon be destroyed into utterlye noethinge .       he thought for a while  and continued       itym  whyfore did it explode that noone may find it  search they greatly .       a puzzler  that .  lady ramkin said that when a swamp dragon exploded there was dragon everywhere .  and this one had been a damn great thing .  admittedly its insides must have been an alchemical nightmare  but the citizens of ankh morpork should still have been spending the night shovelling dragon off the streets .  no one seemed to have bothered about this .  the purple smoke was quite impressive  though .   errol finished off the coke and started on the fire irons .   so far this evening he had eaten three cobblestones  a doorknob  something unidentifiable he   d found in the gutter and  to general astonishment  three of cut me own throat   s sausages made of genuine pork organs .  the crunching of the poker going down mingled with the patter of rain on the windows .   vimes stared at the paper again and then wrote       itym  how can kinges come of noethinge .       he hadn   t even seen the lad close to .  he looked personable enough  not exactly a great thinker  but definitely the kind of profile you wouldn   t mind seeing on your small change .  mind you  after killing the dragon he could have been a cross eyed goblin for all that it mattered .  the mob had borne him in triumph to the patrician   s palace .   lord vetinari had been locked up in his own dungeons .  he hadn   t put up much fight  apparently .  just smiled at everyone and went quietly .   what a happy coincidence for the city that  just when it needed a champion to kill the dragon  a king came forth .   vimes turned this thought over for a while .  then he turned it back to front .  he picked up the quill and wrote       itym  what a happy chance it be  for a lad that would be kinge  that there be a draggon to slae to prove beyond doubt his boney fiddes .       it was a lot better than birthmarks and swords  that was for sure .   he twiddled the quill for a while  and then doodled       itym  the draggon was not a mechanical devise  yette surely no wizzard has the power to create a beaste of that mag .  magg .  maggnyt .  size .   itym  whye  in the pinche  could it not flame .   itym  where did it come from .   itym  where did it goe .       the rain pounded harder on the window .  the sounds of celebration became distinctly damp  and then faded completely .  there was a murmur of thunder .   vimes underlined goe several times .  after further consideration he added two more question marks  .  .   after staring at the effect for some time he rolled the paper into a ball and threw it into the fireplace  where it was fielded and swallowed by errol .   there had been a crime .  senses vimes didn   t know he possessed  ancient policeman   s senses  prickled the hairs on his neck and told him there had been a crime .  it was probably such an odd crime that it didn   t figure anywhere in carrot   s book  but it had been committed all right .  a handful of high temperature murders was only the start of it .  he   d find it  and give it a name .   then he stood up  took his leather rain cape from its hook behind the door  and stepped out into the naked city .       this is where the dragons went .   they lie     not dead  not asleep .  not waiting  because waiting implies expectation .  possibly the word we   re looking for here is        angry .     it could remember the feel of real air under its wings  and the sheer pleasure of the flame .  there had been empty skies above and an interesting world below  full of strange running creatures .  existence had a different texture there .  a better texture .   and just when it was beginning to enjoy it  it had been crippled  stopped from flaming and whipped back  like some hairy canine mammal .   the world had been taken away from it .   in the reptilian synapses of the dragon   s mind the suggestion was kindled that  just possibly  it could get the world back .  it had been summoned  and disdainfully banished again .  but perhaps there was a trail  a scent  a thread which would lead it to the sky     perhaps there was a pathway of thought itself     it recalled a mind .  the peevish voice  so full of its own diminutive importance  a mind almost like that of a dragon  but on a tiny  tiny scale .   aha .   it stretched its wings .       lady ramkin made herself a cup of cocoa and listened to the rain gurgling in the pipes outside .   she slipped off the hated dancing shoes  which even she was prepared to concede were like a pair of pink canoes .  but nobbyless obligay  as the funny little sergeant would say  and as the last representative of one of ankh morpork   s oldest families she   d had to go to the victory ball to show willing .   lord vetinari seldom had balls .  there was a popular song about it  in fact .  but now it was going to be balls all the way .   she couldn   t stand balls .  for sheer enjoyment it wasn   t a patch on mucking out dragons .  you knew where you were  mucking out dragons .  you didn   t get hot and pink and have to eat silly things on sticks  or wear a dress that made you look like a cloud full of cherubs .  little dragons didn   t give a damn what you looked like so long as there was a feeding bowl in your hands .   funny  really .  she   d always thought it took weeks  months  to organize a ball .  invitations  decorations  sausages on poles  ghastly chickeny mixture to force into those little pastry cases .  but it had all been done in a matter of hours  as if someone had been expecting it .  one of the miracles of catering  obviously .  she   d even danced with the  for want of a better word  new king  who had said some polite words to her although they had been rather muffled .   and a coronation tomorrow .  you   d have thought it   d take months to sort out .   she was still musing on that as she mixed the dragons    late night feed of rock oil and peat  spiked with flowers of sulfur .  she didn   t bother to change out of the ballgown but slipped the heavy apron over the top  donned the gloves and helmet  pulled the visor down over her face and ran  clutching the feed buckets  through the driving rain to the shed .   she knew it as soon as she opened the door .  normally the arrival of food would be greeted with hoots and whistles and brief bursts of flame .   the dragons  each in its pen  were sitting up in attentive silence and staring up through the roof .   it was somehow scary .  she clanged the buckets together .      no need to be afraid  nasty big dragon all gone .     she said brightly .     get stuck in to this  you people .      one or two of them gave her a brief glance  and then went back to their     what .  they didn   t seem to be frightened .  just very  very attentive .  it was like a vigil .  they were waiting for something to happen .   the thunder muttered again .     a couple of minutes later she was on her way down into the damp city .       there are some songs which are never sung sober .     nellie dean    is one .  so is any song beginning    as i was a walking       in the area around ankh morpork the favored air is    a wizard   s staff has a knob on the end .      the rank were drunk .  at least  two out of three of the rank were drunk .  carrot had been persuaded to try a shandy and hadn   t liked it much .  he didn   t know all the words  either  and many of the ones he did know he didn   t understand .      oh  i see     he said eventually .     it   s a sort of humorous play on words  is it .         you know     said colon wistfully  peering into the thickening mists rolling in off the ankh     s   at times like this i wish old           you   re not to say it     said nobby  swaying a little .     you agreed  we wouldn   t say nothing  it   s no good talking about it .         it was his favorite song     said colon sadly .     he was a good light tenor .         now  sarge           he was a righteous man  our gaskin     said colon .      we couldn   t of helped it     said nobby sulkily .      we could have     said colon .     we could have run faster .         what happened  then .     said carrot .      he died     said nobby     in the hexecution of his duty .         i told him     said colon  taking a swig at the bottle they had brought along to see them through the night     i told him .  slow down  i said .  you   ll do yourself a mischief  i said .  i don   t know what got into him  running ahead like that .           i blame the thieves    guild     said nobby .     allowing people like that on the streets           there was this bloke we saw done a robbery one night     said colon miserably .     right in front of us .  and captain vimes  he said come on  and we run  only the point is you shouldn   t run too fast  see .  else you might catch them .  leads to all sorts of problems  catching people           they don   t like it     said nobby .  there was a mutter of thunder  and a flurry of rain .      they don   t like it     agreed colon .     but gaskin went and forgot  he ran on  went around the corner and  well  this bloke had a couple of mates waiting           it was his heart really     said nobby .      well .  anyway .  and there he was     said colon .     captain vimes was very upset about it .  you shouldn   t run fast in the watch  lad     he said solemnly .     you can be a fast guard or you can be an old guard  but you can   t be a fast old guard .  poor old gaskin .         it didn   t ought to be like that     said carrot .   colon took a pull at the bottle .      well  it is     he said .  rain bounced on his helmet and trickled down his face .      but it didn   t ought to be     said carrot flatly .      but it is     said colon .       someone else in the city was also ill at ease .  he was the librarian .   sergeant colon had given him a badge .  the librarian turned it around and around in his big gentle hands  nibbling at it .   it wasn   t that the city suddenly had a king .  orangs are traditionalists  and you couldn   t get more traditional than a king .  but they also liked things neat  and things weren   t neat .  or  rather  they were too neat .  truth and reality were never as neat as this .  sudden heirs to ancient thrones didn   t grow on trees  and he should know .   besides  no one was looking for his book .  that was human priorities for you .   the book was the key to it .  he was sure of that .  well  there was one way to find out what was in the book .  it was a perilous way  but the librarian ambled along perilous ways all day .   in the silence of the sleeping library he opened his desk and removed from its deepest recesses a small lantern carefully built to prevent any naked flame being exposed .  you couldn   t be too careful with all this paper around     he also took a bag of peanuts and  after some thought  a large ball of string .  he bit off a short length of the string and used it to tie the badge around his neck  like a talisman .  then he tied one end of the ball to the desk and  after a moment   s contemplation  knuckled off between the bookshelves  paying out the string behind him .   knowledge equals power     the string was important .  after a while the librarian stopped .  he concentrated all his powers of librarianship .   power equals energy     people were stupid  sometimes .  they thought the library was a dangerous place because of all the magical books  which was true enough  but what made it really one of the most dangerous places there could ever be was the simple fact that it was a library .   energy equals matter     he swung into an avenue of shelving that was apparently a few feet long and walked along it briskly for half an hour .   matter equals mass .   and mass distorts space .  it distorts it into polyfractal l space .   so  while the dewey system has its fine points  when you   re setting out to look something up in the multidimensional folds of l space what you really need is a ball of string .       now the rain was trying hard .  it glistened off the flagstones in the plaza of broken moons  littered here and there with torn bunting  flags  broken bottles and the occasional regurgitated supper .  there was still plenty of thunder about  and a green  fresh smell in the air .  a few shreds of mist from the ankh hovered over the stones .  it would be dawn soon .   vimes   s footsteps echoed wetly from the surrounding buildings as he picked his way across the plaza .  the boy had stood here .   he peered through the mist shreds at the surrounding buildings  getting his bearings .  so the dragon had been hovering   he paced forward   here .      and     said vimes     this is where it was killed .      he fumbled in his pockets .  there were all sorts of things in there   keys  bits of string  corks .  his finger closed on a stub end of chalk .   he knelt down .  errol jumped off his shoulder and waddled away to inspect the detritus of the celebration .  he always sniffed everything before he ate it  vimes noticed .  it was a bit of a puzzle why he bothered  because he always ate it anyway .   its head had been about  let   s see  here .   he walked backward  dragging the chalk over the stones  progressing slowly over the damp  empty square like an ancient worshipper treading a maze .  here a wing  curving away toward a tail which stretched out to here  change hands  now head for the other wing     when he finished he walked to the center of the outline and ran his hands over the stones .  he realized he was half expecting them to be warm .     surely there should be something .  some  oh  he didn   t know  some grease or something  some crispy fried dragon lumps .   errol started eating a broken bottle with every sign of enjoyment .      you know what i think .     said vimes .     i think it went somewhere .      thunder rolled again .      all right  all right     muttered vimes .     it was just a thought .  it wasn   t that dramatic .      errol stopped in mid crunch .   very slowly  as though it was mounted on very smooth  well oiled bearings  the dragon   s head turned to face upward .   what it was staring at intently was a patch of empty air .  there wasn   t much else you could say about it .   vimes shivered under his cape .  this was daft .      look  don   t muck about     he said .     there   s nothing there .      errol started to tremble .      it   s just the rain     said vimes .     go on  finish your bottle .  nice bottle .      a thin  worried keening noise broke from the dragon   s mouth .      i   ll show you     said vimes .  he cast around and spotted one of throat   s sausages  cast aside by a hungry reveller who had decided he was never going to be that hungry .  he picked it up .      look     he said  and threw it upward .   he felt sure  watching its trajectory  that it ought to have fallen back to the ground .  it shouldn   t have fallen away  as if he   d dropped it neatly into a tunnel in the sky .  and the tunnel shouldn   t have been looking back at him .   vivid purple lightning lashed from the empty air and struck the houses on the near side of the plaza  skittering across the walls for several yards before winking out with a suddenness that almost denied that it had ever happened at all .   then it erupted again  this time hitting the rimward wall .  the light broke where it hit into a network of searching tendrils spreading across the stones .   the third attempt went upward  forming an actinic column that eventually rose fifty or sixty feet in the air  appeared to stabilize  and started to spin slowly .   vimes felt that a comment was called for .  he said     arrgh .      as the light revolved it sent out thin zigzag streamers that jittered away across the rooftops  sometimes dipping  sometimes doubling back .  searching .   errol ran up vimes   s back in a flurry of claws and fastened himself firmly on his shoulder .  the excruciating agony recalled to vimes that there was something he should be doing .  was it time to scream again .  he tried another    arrgh .     no  probably not .   the air started to smell like burning tin .   lady ramkin   s coach rattled into the plaza making a noise like a roulette wheel and pounded straight for vimes  stopping in a skid that sent it juddering around in a semi circle and forced the horses either to face the other way or plait their legs .  a furious vision in padded leather  gauntlets  tiara and thirty yards of damp pink tulle leaned down toward him and screamed     come on  you bloody idiot .      one glove caught him under his unresisting shoulder and hauled him bodily onto the box .      and stop screaming .     the phantom ordered  focusing generations of natural authority into four syllables .  another shout spurred the horses from a bewildered standing start to a full gallop .     the coach bounced away over the flagstones .  an exploratory tendril of flickering light brushed the reins for a moment and then lost interest .      i suppose you haven   t got any idea what   s happening .     shouted vimes  against the crackling of the spinning fire .      not the foggiest .      the crawling lines spread like a web over the city  growing fainter with distance .  vimes imagined them creeping through windows and sneaking under doors .      it looks as though it   s searching for something .     he shouted .      then getting away before it finds it is a first class idea  don   t you think .      a tongue of fire hit the dark tower of art  slid blindly down its ivy grown flanks  and disappeared through the dome of unseen university   s library .   the other lines blinked out .   lady ramkin brought the coach to a halt at the far side of the square .      what does it want the library for .     she said  frowning .      maybe it wants to look something up .         don   t be silly     she said breezily .     there   s just a lot of books in there .  what would a flash of lightning want to read .         something very short .         i really think you could try to be a bit more help .      the line of light exploded into an arc between the library   s dome and the center of the plaza and hung in the air  a band of brilliance several feet across .   then  in a sudden rush  it became a sphere of fire which grew swiftly to encompass almost all the plaza  vanished suddenly  and left the night full of ringing  violet shadows .   and the plaza full of dragon .       who would have thought it .  so much power  so close at hand .  the dragon could feel the magic flowing into it  renewing it from second to second  in defiance of all boring physical laws .  this wasn   t the poor fare it had been given before .  this was the right stuff .  there was no end to what it could do  with power like this .   but first it had to pay its respects to certain people     it sniffed the dawn air .  it was searching for the stink of minds .   noble dragons don   t have friends .  the nearest they can get to the idea is an enemy who is still alive .       the air became very still  so still that you could almost hear the slow fall of dust .  the librarian swung on his knuckles between the endless bookshelves .  the dome of the library was still overhead but then  it always was .       it seemed quite logical to the librarian that  since there were aisles where the shelves were on the outside then there should be other aisles in the space between the books themselves  created out of quantum ripples by the sheer weight of words .  there were certainly some odd sounds coming from the other side of some shelving  and the librarian knew that if he gently pulled out a book or two he would be peeking into different libraries under different skies .   books bend space and time .  one reason the owners of those aforesaid little rambling  poky secondhand bookshops always seem slightly unearthly is that many of them really are  having strayed into this world after taking a wrong turning in their own bookshops in worlds where it is considered commendable business practice to wear carpet slippers all the time and open your shop only when you feel like it .  you stray into l space at your peril .   very senior librarians  however  once they have proved themselves worthy by performing some valiant act of librarianship  are accepted into a secret order and are taught the raw arts of survival beyond the shelves we know .  the librarian was highly skilled in all of them  but what he was attempting now wouldn   t just get him thrown out of the order but probably out of life itself .   all libraries everywhere are connected in l space .  all libraries .  everywhere .  and the librarian  navigating by booksign carved on shelves by past explorers  navigating by smell  navigating even by the siren whisperings of nostalgia  was heading purposely for one very special one .   there was one consolation .  if he got it wrong  he   d never know it .       somehow the dragon was worse on the ground .  in the air it was an elemental thing  graceful even when it was trying to burn you to your boots .  on the ground it was just a damn great animal .   its huge head reared against the gray of dawn  turning slowly .   lady ramkin and vimes peered cautiously from behind a watertrough .  vimes had his hand clamped over errol   s muzzle .  the little dragon was whimpering like a kicked puppy  and fighting to get away .      it   s a magnificent brute     said lady ramkin  in what she probably thought was a whisper .      i do wish you wouldn   t keep saying that     said vimes .   there was a scraping noise as the dragon dragged itself over the stones .      i knew it wasn   t killed     growled vimes .     there were no bits .  it was too neat .  it was sent somewhere by some sort of magic  i bet .  look at it .  it   s bloody impossible .  it needs magic to keep it alive .         what do you mean .     said lady ramkin  not tearing her gaze from its armored flanks .     what did he mean .  what did he mean .  he thought fast .      it   s just not physically possible  that   s what i mean     he said .     nothing that heavy should be able to fly  or breathe fire like that .  i told you .         but it looks real enough .  i mean  you   d expect a magical creature to be  well  gauzy .         oh  it   s real .  it   s real all right     said vimes bitterly .     but supposing it needs magic like we need  like we need   sunlight .  or food .         it   s a thaumivore  you mean .         i just think it eats magic  that   s all     said vimes  who had not had a classical education .     i mean  all these little swamp dragons  always on the point of extinction  suppose one day back in prehistoric times some of them found out how to use magic .         there used to be a lot of natural magic around once     said lady ramkin thoughtfully .      there you are  then .  after all  creatures use the air and the sea .  i mean  if there   s a natural resource around  something   s going to use it  aren   t they .  then it wouldn   t matter about bad digestion and weight and wing size and so on  because the magic would take care of it .  wow .      but you   d need a lot  he thought .  he wasn   t certain how much magic you   d need to change the world enough to let tons of armored carcass flit around the sky like a swallow  but he   d bet it was lots .   all those thefts .  someone   d been feeding the dragon .   he looked at the bulk of the unseen university library of magic books  the greatest accumulation of distilled magical power on the discworld .   and now the dragon had learned how to feed itself .   he became terribly aware that lady ramkin had moved  and saw to his horror that she was striding toward the dragon  chin stuck out like an anvil .        what the hell are you doing .     he whispered loudly .      if it   s descended from the swamp dragons then i can probably control it     she called back .     you have to look them in the eye and use a no nonsense tone of voice .  they can   t resist a stern human voice .  they don   t have the willpower  you know .  they   re just big softies .      to his shame  vimes realized that his legs were going to have nothing to do with any mad dash to drag her back .  his pride didn   t like that  but his body pointed out that it wasn   t his pride that stood a very reasonable chance of being thinly laminated to the nearest building .  through ears burning with embarrassment he heard her say     bad boy .      the echoes of that stern injunction rang out across the plaza .   oh gods  he thought  is that how you train a dragon .  point them at the melted patch on the floor and threaten to rub their nose in it .   he risked a peep over the horsetrough .   the dragon   s head was swinging around slowly  like a crane jib .  it had some difficulty focusing on her  right below it .  vimes could see the great red eyes narrow as the creature tried to squint down the length of its own nose .  it looked puzzled .  he wasn   t surprised .      sit .     bellowed lady ramkin  in a tone so undisobeyable that even vimes felt his legs involuntarily sag .     good boy .  i think i may have a lump of coke somewhere       she patted her pockets .   eye contact .  that was the important thing .  she really  vimes thought  shouldn   t have looked down even for a moment .   the dragon raised one talon in a leisurely fashion and pinned her to the ground .   as vimes half rose in horror errol escaped from his grip and cleared the trough in one leap .  he bounced across the plaza in a series of wing whirring arcs  mouth gaping  emitting wheezing burps  trying to flame .   he was answered with a tongue of blue white fire that melted a streak of bubbling rock several yards long but failed to strike the challenger .  it was hard to pick him out of the air because  quite clearly  even errol didn   t know where he was going to be  or what way up he was going to be when he got there .  his only hope at this point lay in movement  and he vaulted and spun between the increasingly furious bursts of fire like a scared but determined random particle .   the great dragon reared up with the sound of a dozen anchor chains being thrown into a corner  and tried to bat the tormenter out of the air .   vimes   s legs gave in at that point and decided that they might allow themselves to be heroic legs for a while .  he scurried across the intervening space  sword at the ready for what good it might do  grabbed lady ramkin by an arm and a handful of bedraggled ballgown  and swung her onto his shoulder .   he got several yards before the essential bad judgment of this move dawned on him .   he went    gngh .     his vertebrae and knees were trying to fuse into one lump .  purple spots flashed on and off in front of his eyes .  on top of it all  something unfamiliar but apparently made of whalebone was poking sharply into the back of his neck .   he managed a few more steps by sheer momentum  knowing that when he stopped he was going to be utterly crushed .  the ramkins hadn   t bred for beauty  they   d bred for healthy solidity and big bones  and they   d got very good at it over the centuries .   a gout of livid dragonfire crackled into the flagstones a few feet away .     afterward he wondered if he   d only imagined leaping several inches into the air and covering the rest of the distance to the horsetrough at a respectable run .  perhaps  in extremis  everyone learned the kind of instant movement that was second nature to nobby .  anyway  the horsetrough was behind him and lady ramkin was in his arms  or at least was pinning his arms to the ground .  he managed to free them and tried to massage a bit of life back .  what did you do next .  she didn   t seem to be injured .  he recalled something about loosening a person   s clothing  but in lady ramkin   s case that might be dangerous without special tools .   she solved the immediate problem by grabbing the edge of the trough and hauling herself upright .      right     she said     it   s the slipper for you       her eyes focused on vimes for the first time .      what the hell   s going on       she began again  and then caught the scene over his shoulder .      oh sod     she said .     pardon my klatchian .      errol was running out of energy .  the stubby wings were indeed incapable of real flight  and he was remaining airborne solely by flapping madly  like a chicken .  the great talons swished through the air .  one of them caught one of the plaza   s fountains  and demolished it .   the next one swatted errol neatly .   he shot over vimes   s head in a straight rising line  hit a roof behind him  and slid down it .      you   ve got to catch him .     shouted lady ramkin .     you must .  it   s vital .      vimes stared at her  and then dived forward as errol   s pear shaped body slithered over the edge of the roof and dropped .  he was surprisingly heavy .      thank goodness     said lady ramkin  struggling to her feet .     they explode so easily  you know .  it could have been very dangerous .        they remembered the other dragon .  it wasn   t the exploding sort .  it was the killing people kind .  they turned  slowly .   the creature loomed over them  sniffed and then  as if they were of no importance at all  turned away .  it sprang ponderously into the air and  with one slow flap of its wings  began to scull leisurely away down the plaza and up and into the mists that were rolling over the city .   vimes was currently more concerned with the smaller dragon in his hands .  its stomach was rumbling alarmingly .  he wished he   d paid more attention to the book on dragons .  was a stomach noise like this a sign they were about to explode  or was the point you had to watch out for the point when the rumbling stopped .      we   ve got to follow it .     said lady ramkin .     what happened to the carriage .      vimes waved a hand vaguely in the direction that  as far as he could tell  the horses had taken in their panic .   errol sneezed a cloud of warm gas that smelled worse than something walled up in a cellar  pawed the air weakly  licked vimes   s face with a tongue like a hot cheese grater  struggled out of his arms and trotted away .      where   s he off to .     boomed lady ramkin  emerging from the mists dragging the horses behind her .  they didn   t want to come  their hooves were scraping up sparks  but they were fighting a losing battle .      he   s still trying to challenge it .     said vimes .     you   d think he   d give in  wouldn   t you .         they fight like blazes     said lady ramkin  as he climbed onto the coach .     it   s a matter of making your opponent explode  you see .         i thought  in nature  the defeated animal just rolls on its back in submission and that   s an end of it     said vimes  as they clattered after the disappearing swamp dragon .        wouldn   t work with dragons     said lady ramkin .     some daft creature rolls on its back  you disembowel it .  that   s how they look at it .  almost human  really .          the clouds were clustered thickly over ankh morpork .  above them  the slow golden sunlight of the discworld unrolled .   the dragon sparkled in the dawn as it trod the air joyously  doing impossible turns and rolls for the sheer delight of it .  then it remembered the business of the day .   they   d had the presumption to summon it     below it  the rank wandered from side to side up the street of small gods .  despite the thick fog it was beginning to get busy .      what d   you call them things  like thin stairs .     said sergeant colon .      ladders     said carrot .      lot of    em about     said nobby .  he mooched over to the nearest one  and kicked it .      oi .     a figure struggled down  half buried in a string of flags .      what   s going on .     said nobby .   the flag bearer looked him up and down .      who wants to know  tiddler .     he said .      excuse me  we do     said carrot  looming out of the fog like an iceberg .  the man gave a sickly grin .      well  it   s the coronation  isn   t it     he said .     got to get the streets ready for the coronation .  got to have the flags up .  got to get the old bunting out  haven   t we .      nobby gave the dripping finery a jaundiced look .     doesn   t look that old to me     he said .     it looks new .  what   re them fat saggy things on that shield .         those are the royal hippos of ankh     said the man proudly .     reminders of our noble heritage .           how long have we had a noble heritage  then .     said nobby .      since yesterday  of course .         you can   t have a heritage in a day     said carrot .     it has to last a long time .         if we haven   t got one     said sergeant colon     i bet we   ll soon have had one .  my wife left me a note about it .  all these years  and she turns out to be a monarchist .     he kicked the pavement viciously .     huh .     he said .     a man knocks his pipes out for thirty years to put a bit of meat on the table  but all she   s talking about is some boy who gets to be king for five minutes    work .  know what was for my tea last night .  beef dripping sandwiches .      this did not have the expected response from the two bachelors .      cor .     said nobby .      real beef dripping .     said carrot .     the kind with the little crunchy bits on top .  and shiny blobs of fat .         can   t remember when i last addressed the crust on a bowl of dripping     mused nobby  in a gastronomic heaven .     with just a bit of salt and pepper  you   ve got a meal fit for a k           don   t even say it     warned colon .      the best bit is when you stick the knife in and crack the fat and all the browny gold stuff bubbles up     said carrot dreamily .     a moment like that is worth a ki           shutup .  shutup .     shouted colon .     you   re just   what the hell was that .      they felt the sudden downdraft  saw the mist above them roll into coils that broke against the house walls .  a blast of colder air swept along the street  and was gone .      it was like something gliding past  up there somewhere     said the sergeant .  he froze .     here  you don   t think    .           we saw it killed  didn   t we .     said nobby urgently .      we saw it vanish     said carrot .   they looked at one another  alone and damp in the mist shrouded street .  there could be anything up there .  the imagination peopled the dank air with terrible apparitions .  and what was worse was the knowledge that nature might have done an even better job .      nah     said colon .     it was probably just some   some big wading bird .  or something .         isn   t there anything we should do .     said carrot .      yes     said nobby .     we should go away quickly .  remember gaskin .         maybe it   s another dragon     said carrot .     we should warn people and           no     said sergeant colon vehemently     because  ae  they wouldn   t believe us and  bee  we   ve got a king now .     s his job  dragons .         s   right     said nobby .     he   d probably be really angry .  dragons are probably  you know  royal animals .  like deer .  a man could probably have his tridlins plucked just for thinking about killing one  when there   s a king around .          makes you glad you   re common     said colon .      commoner     corrected nobby .      that   s not a very civic attitude       carrot began .  he was interrupted by errol .   the little dragon came trotting up the middle of the street  stumpy tail high  his eyes fixed on the clouds above him .  he went right by the rank without giving them any attention at all .      what   s up with him .     said nobby .     a clatter behind them introduced the ramkin coach .      men .     said vimes hesitantly  peering through the fog .      definitely     said sergeant colon .      did you see a dragon go past .  apart from errol .         well  er     said the sergeant  looking at the other two .     sort of  sir .  possibly .  it might of been .         then don   t stand there like a lot of boobies     said lady ramkin .     get in .  plenty of room inside .      there was .  when it was built  the coach had probably been the marvel of the day  all plush and gilt and tasselled hangings .  time  neglect and the ripping out of the seats to allow its frequent use to transport dragons to shows had taken their toll  but it still reeked of privilege  style and  of course  dragons .      what do you think you   re doing .     said colon  as it rattled off through the fog .      wavin        said nobby  gesturing graciously to the billows around them .      disgusting  this sort of thing  really     mused sergeant colon .     people goin    around in coaches like this when there   s people with no roof to their heads .         it   s lady ramkin   s coach     said nobby .     she   s all right .         well  yes  but what about her ancestors  eh .  you don   t get big houses and carriages without grindin    the faces of the poor a bit .         you   re just annoyed because your missus has been embroidering crowns on her undies     said nobby .      that   s got nothing to do with it     said sergeant colon indignantly .     i   ve always been very firm on the rights of man .         and dwarf     said carrot .      yeah  right     said the sergeant uncertainly .     but all this business about kings and lords  it   s against basic human dignity .  we   re all born equal .  it makes me sick .         never heard you talk like this before  frederick     said nobby .      it   s sergeant colon to you  nobby .         sorry  sergeant .      the fog itself was shaping up to be a real ankh morpork autumn gumbo .   vimes squinted through it as the droplets buckled down to a good day   s work soaking him to the skin .      i can just make him out     he said .     turn left here .         any ideas where we are .     said lady ramkin .      business district somewhere     said vimes shortly .  errol   s progress was slowing a bit .  he kept looking up and whining .      can   t see a damn thing above us in this fog     he said .     i wonder if        the fog  as if in acknowledgment  lit up .  ahead of them it blossomed  like a chrysanthemum and made a noise like    whoomph .         oh  no     moaned vimes .     not again .             are the cups of integrity well and truly suffused .     intoned brother watchtower .      aye  suffused full well .         the waters of the world  are they abjured .         yea  abjured full mightily .         have the demons of infinity been bound with many chains .         damn     said brother plasterer     there   s always something .        brother watchtower sagged .     just once it would be nice if we could get the ancient and timeless rituals right  wouldn   t it .  you   d better get on with it .         wouldn   t it be quicker  brother watchtower  if i just did it twice next time .     said brother plasterer .   brother watchtower gave this some grudging consideration .  it seemed reasonable .      all right     he said .     now get back down there with the others .  and you should call me acting supreme grand master  understand .      this did not meet with what he considered to be a proper and dignified reception among the brethren .      no one said anything to us about you being acting supreme grand master     muttered brother doorkeeper .      well  that   s all you know because i bloody well am because supreme grand master asked me to open the lodge on account of him being delayed with all this coronation work     said brother watchtower haughtily .     if that doesn   t make me acting supreme grand bloody master i   d like to know what does  all right .         i don   t see why     muttered brother doorkeeper .     you don   t have to have a grand title like that .  you could just be called something like  well   rituals monitor .         yeah     said brother plasterer .     don   t see why you should give yourself airs .  you ain   t even been taught the ancient and mystic mysteries by monks  or anything .         we   ve been hanging around for hours  too     said brother doorkeeper .     that   s not right .  i thought we   d get rewarded        brother watchtower realized that he was losing control .  he tried wheedling diplomacy .      i   m sure supreme grand master will be along directly     he said .     let   s not spoil it all now  eh .  lads .  arranging that fight with the dragon and everything  getting it all off right  that was something  wasn   t it .  we   ve been through a lot  right .  it   s worth waiting just a bit longer  okay .      the circle of robed and cowled figures shuffled in grudging agreement .      okay .         fair enough .         yeah .      certainly .      okay .         if you say so .      it began to creep over brother watchtower that something wasn   t right  but he couldn   t quite put a name to it .      uh     he said .     brothers .      they  too  shifted uneasily .  something in the room was setting their teeth on edge .  there was an atmosphere .      brothers     repeated brother watchtower  trying to re assert himself     we are all here  aren   t we .      there was a worried chorus of agreement .      of course we are .         what   s the matter .         yes .      yes .      yes .      there it was again  a subtle wrongness about things that you couldn   t quite put your finger on because your finger was too scared .  but brother watchtower   s troublesome thoughts were interrupted by a scrabbling sound on the roof .  a few nubs of plaster dropped into the circle .      brothers .     repeated brother watchtower nervously .   now there was one of those silent sounds  a long  buzzing silence of extreme concentration and just possibly the indrawing of breath into lungs the size of haystacks .  the last rats of brother watchtower   s self confidence fled the sinking ship of courage .        brother doorkeeper  if you could just unbolt the dread portal       he quavered .   and then there was light .   there was no pain .  there was no time .   death strips away many things  especially when it arrives at a temperature hot enough to vaporize iron  and among them are your illusions .  the immortal remains of brother watchtower watched the dragon flap away into the fog  and then looked down at the congealing puddle of stone  metal and miscellaneous trace elements that was all that remained of the secret headquarters .  and of its occupants  he realized in the dispassionate way that is part of being dead .  you go through your whole life and end up a smear swirling around like cream in a coffee cup .  whatever the gods    games were  they played them in a damn mysterious way .   he looked up at the hooded figure beside him .      we never intended this     he said weakly .     honestly .  no offense .  we just wanted what was due to us .      a skeletal hand patted him on the shoulder  not unkindly .   and death said  congratulations .       apart from the supreme grand master  the only elucidated brother to be away at the time of the dragon was brother fingers .  he   d been sent out for some pizzas .  brother fingers was always the one sent out for takeaway food .  it was cheaper .  he   d never bothered to master the art of paying for things .   when the guards rolled up just behind errol  brother fingers was standing with a stack of cardboard boxes in his hands and his mouth open .   where the dread portal should have been was a warm melted patch of assorted substances .      oh  my goodness     said lady ramkin .     vimes slid down from the coach and tapped brother fingers on the shoulder .      excuse me  sir     he said     did you by any chance see what        when brother fingers turned toward him his face was the face of a man who has hang glided over the entrance to hell .  he kept opening and shutting his mouth but no words were coming out .   vimes tried again .  the sheer terror frozen in brother fingers   s expression was getting to him .      if you would be so kind to accompany me to the yard     said vimes     i have reason to believe that you       he hesitated .  he wasn   t entirely certain what it was that he had reason to believe .  but the man was clearly guilty .  you could tell just by looking at him .  not  perhaps  guilty of anything specific .  just guilty in general terms .      mmmmmuh     said brother fingers .   sergeant colon gently lifted the lid of the top box .      what do you make of it  sergeant .     said vimes  stepping back .      er .  it looks like a klatchian hots with anchovies  sir     said sergeant colon knowledgeably .      i mean the man     said vimes wearily .      nnnnn     said brother fingers .   colon peered under the hood .     oh  i know him  sir     he said .     bengy    lightfoot    boggis  sir .  he   s a capo de monty in the thieves    guild .  i know him of old  sir .  sly little bugger .  used to work at the university .         what  as a wizard .     said vimes .      odd job man  sir .  gardening and carpentry and that .         oh .  did he .         can   t we do something for the poor man .     said lady ramkin .     nobby saluted smartly .     i could kick him in the bollocks for you if you like  m   lady .         dddrrr     said brother fingers  beginning to shake uncontrollably  while lady ramkin smiled the iron hard blank smile of a high born lady who is determined not to show that she has understood what has just been said to her .      put him in the coach  you two     said vimes .     if it   s all right with you  lady ramkin              sybil       corrected lady ramkin .  vimes blushed  and plunged on      it might be a good idea to get him indoors .  charge him with the theft of one book  to whit  the summoning of dragons .         right you are  sir     said sergeant colon .     the pizzas   re getting cold  too .  you know how the cheese goes all manky when it gets cold .         and no kicking him  either     vimes warned .     not even where it doesn   t show .  carrot  you come with me .         ddddrrraa     brother fingers volunteered .      and take errol     added vimes .     he   s driving himself mad here .  game little devil  i   ll give him that .         marvellous  when you come to think about it     said colon .   errol was trotting up and down in front of the ravaged building  whining .      look at him     said vimes .     can   t wait to get to grips .     his gaze found itself drawn  as though by wires  up to the rolling clouds of fog .   it   s in there somewhere  he thought .      what we going to do now  sir .     said carrot  as the carriage rattled off .      not nervous  are you .     said vimes .      no  sir .      the way he said it jogged something in vimes   s mind .      no     he said     you   re not  are you .  i suppose it   s being brought up by the dwarfs that did it .  you   ve got no imagination .         i   m sure i try to do my best  sir     said carrot firmly .      still sending all your pay home to your mother .         yes  sir .         you   re a good boy .         yessir .  so what are we going to do  captain vimes .     carrot repeated .   vimes looked around him .  he walked a few aimless  exasperated steps .  he spread his arms wide and then flopped them down by his sides .      how should i know .     he said .     warn people  i guess .  we   d better get over to the patrician   s palace .  and then        there were footsteps in the fog .  vimes stiffened  put his finger to his lips and pulled carrot into the shelter of a doorway .   a figure loomed out of the billows .   another one of    em  thought vimes .  well  there   s no law about wearing long black robes and deep cowls .  there could be dozens of perfectly innocent reasons why this person is wearing long black robes and a deep cowl and standing in front of a melted down house at dawn .   perhaps i should ask him to name just one .   he stepped out .      excuse me  sir       he began .   the cowl swung around .  there was a hiss of indrawn breath .      i just wonder if you would mind   after him  lance constable .      the figure had a good start .  it scuttled along the street and had reached the corner before vimes was halfway there .  he skidded around it in time to see a shape vanish down an alley .   vimes realized he was running alone .  he panted to a halt and looked back just in time to see carrot jog gently around the corner .      what   s wrong .     he wheezed .      sergeant colon said i wasn   t to run     said carrot .   vimes looked at him vaguely .  then slow comprehension dawned .      oh     he said .     i  er  see .  i don   t think he meant in every circumstance  lad .     he stared back into the fog .     not that we had much of a chance in this fog and these streets .         might have been just an innocent bystander  sir     said carrot .      what  in ankh morpork .         yes  sir .         we should have grabbed him  then  just for the rarity value     said vimes .   he patted carrot on the shoulder .     come on .  we   d better get along to the patrician   s palace .         the king   s palace     corrected carrot .      what .     said vimes  his train of thought temporarily shunted .      it   s the king   s palace now     said carrot .  vimes squinted sideways at him .   he gave a short  mirthless laugh .      yeah  that   s right     he conceded .     our dragon killing king .  well done that man .     he sighed .     they   re not going to like this .          they didn   t .  none of them did .   the first problem was the palace guard .   vimes had never liked them .  they   d never liked him .  okay  so maybe the rank were only one step away from petty scofflaws  but in vimes   s professional opinion the palace guard these days were only one step away from being the worst criminal scum the city had ever produced .  a step further down .  they   d have to reform a bit before they could even be considered for inclusion in the ten most unwanted list .   they were rough .  they were tough .  they weren   t the sweepings off the gutter  they were what you still found sticking to the gutter when the gutter sweepers had given up in exhaustion .  they had been extremely well paid by the patrician  and presumably were extremely well paid by someone else now  because when vimes walked up to the gates a couple of them stopped lounging against the walls and straightened up while still maintaining just the right amount of psychological slouch to cause maximum offense .      captain vimes     said vimes  staring straight ahead .     to see the king .  it   s of the utmost importance .         yeah .  well  it   d have to be     said a guard .     captain slimes  was it .         vimes     said vimes evenly .     with a vee .      one of the guards nodded to his companion .      vimes     he said .     with a vee .         fancy     said the other guard .      it   s most urgent     said vimes  maintaining a wooden expression .  he tried to move forward .   the first guard sidestepped neatly and pushed him sharply in the chest .      no one is going nowhere     he said .     orders of the king  see .  so you can push off back to your pit  captain vimes with a vee .      it wasn   t the words which made up vimes   s mind .  it was the way the other man sniggered .      stand aside     he said .   the guard leaned down .     who   s going to make me     he rapped on vimes   s helmet     copper .      there are times when it is a veritable pleasure to drop the bomb right away .        lance constable carrot  i want you to charge these men     said vimes .   carrot saluted .     very good  sir     he said  and turned and trotted smartly back the way they had come .      hey .     shouted vimes  as the boy disappeared around a corner .      that   s what i like to see     said the first guard  leaning on his spear .     that   s a young man with initiative  that young man .  a bright lad .  he doesn   t want to stop along here and have his ears twisted off .  that   s a young man who   s going to go a long way  if he   s got any sense .         very sensible     said the other guard .   he leaned the spear against the wall .      you watch men make me want to throw up     he said conversationally .     poncing around all the time  never doing a proper job of work .  throwing your weight about as if you counted for something .  so me and clarence are going to show you what real guarding is all about  isn   t that right .      i could just about manage one of them  vimes thought as he took a few steps backward .  if he was facing the other way  at least .   clarence propped his spear against the gateway and spat on his hands .   there was a long  terrifying ululation .  vimes was amazed to realize it wasn   t coming from him .   carrot appeared around the corner at a dead run .  he had a felling ax in either hand .   his huge leather sandals flapped on the cobblestones as he bounded closer  accelerating all the time .  and all the time there was this cry  deedahdeedahdeedah  like something caught in a trap at the bottom of a two tone echo canyon .   the two palace guards stood rigid with astonishment .        i should duck  if i was you     said vimes from near ground level .   the two axes left carrot   s hands and whirred through the air making a noise like a brace of partridges .  one of them hit the palace gate  burying half the head in the woodwork .  the other one hit the shaft of the first one  and split it .  then carrot arrived .   vimes went and sat down on a nearby bench for a while  and rolled himself a cigarette .   eventually he said     i think that   s about enough  constable .  i think they   d like to come quietly now .         yes  sir .  what are they accused of  sir .     said carrot  holding one limp body in either hand .      assaulting an officer of the watch in the execution of his duty and   oh  yes .  resisting arrest .         under section  vii  of the public order act of      .     said carrot .      yes     said vimes solemnly .     yes .  yes  i suppose so .         but they didn   t resist very much  sir     carrot pointed out .      well  attempting to resist arrest .  i should just leave them over by the wall until we come back .  i don   t expect they   ll want to go anywhere .         right you are  sir .         don   t hurt them  mind     said vimes .     you mustn   t hurt prisoners .         that   s right  sir     said carrot  conscientiously .     prisoners once charged have rights  sir .  it says so in the dignity of man  civic rights  act of      .  i keep telling corporal nobbs .  they have rights  i tell him .  this means you do not put the boot in .         very well put  constable .      carrot looked down .     you have the right to remain silent     he said .     you have the right not to injure yourself falling down the steps on the way to the cells .  you have the right not to jump out of high windows .  you do not have to say anything  you see  but anything you do say  well  i have to take it down and it might be used in evidence .     he pulled out his notebook and licked his pencil .  he leaned down further .      pardon .     he said .  he looked up at vimes .      how do you spell    groan     sir .     he said .      g r o n e  i think .         very good  sir .         oh  and constable .         yes  sir .         why the axes .         they were armed  sir .  i got them from the blacksmith in market street  sir .  i said you   d be along later to pay for them .         and the cry .     said vimes weakly .      dwarfish war yodel  sir     said carrot proudly .      it   s a good cry     said vimes  picking his words with care .     but i   d be grateful if you   d warn me first another time  all right .         certainly  sir .         in writing  i think .          the librarian swung on .  it was slow progress  because there were things he wasn   t keen on meeting .  creatures evolve to fill every niche in the environment  and some of those in the dusty immensity of l space were best avoided .  they were much more unusual than ordinary unusual creatures .   usually he could forewarn himself by keeping a careful eye on the kickstool crabs that grazed harmlessly on the dust .  when they were spooked  it was time to hide .  several times he had to flatten himself against the shelves as a thesaurus thundered by .  he waited patiently as a herd of critters crawled past  grazing on the contents of the choicer books and leaving behind them piles of small slim volumes of literary criticism .  and there were other things  things which he hurried away from and tried not to look hard at     and you had to avoid cliches at all costs .   he finished the last of his peanuts atop a stepladder  which was browsing mindlessly off the high shelves .   the territory definitely had a familiar feel  or at least he got the feeling that it would eventually be familiar .  time had a different meaning in l space .   there were shelves whose outline he felt he knew .  the book titles  while still unreadable  held a tantalizing hint of legibility .  even the musty air had a smell he thought he recognized .   he shambled quickly along a side passage  turned the corner and  with only the slightest twinge of disorientation  shuffled into that set of dimensions that people  because they don   t know any better  think of as normal .   he just felt extremely hot and his fur stood straight out from his body as temporal energy gradually discharged .   he was in the dark .   he extended one arm and explored the spines of the books by his side .  ah .  now he knew where he was .   he was home .   he was home a week ago .   it was essential that he didn   t leave footprints .  but that wasn   t a problem .  he shinned up the side of the nearest bookcase and  under the starlight of the dome  hurried onward .       lupine wonse glared up  red eyed  from the heap of paperwork on his desk .  no one in the city knew anything about coronations .  he   d had to make it up as he went along .  there should be plenty of things to wave  he knew that .      yes .     he said  abruptly .      er  there   s a captain vimes to see you     said the flunkey .      vimes of the watch .         yes  sir .  says it   s of the utmost importance .      wonse looked down his list of other things that were also of the utmost importance .  crowning the king  for one thing .  the high priests of fifty three religions were all claiming the honor .  it was going to be a scrum .  and then there were the crown jewels .   or rather  there weren   t the crown jewels .  somewhere in the preceding generations the crown jewels had disappeared .  a jeweller in the street of cunning artificers was doing the best he could in the time with gilt and glass .   vimes could wait .      tell him to come back another day     said wonse .      good of you to see us     said vimes  appearing in the doorway .   wonse glared at him .      since you   re here       he said .  vimes dropped his helmet on wonse   s desk in what the secretary thought was an offensive manner  and sat down .      take a seat     said wonse .      have you had breakfast yet .     said vimes .      now really       wonse began .      don   t worry     said vimes cheerfully .     constable carrot will go and see what   s in the kitchens .  this chap will show him the way .      when they had gone wonse leaned across the drifts of paperwork .      there had better     he said     be a very good reason for           the dragon is back     said vimes .     wonse stared at him for a while .   vimes stared back .   wonse   s senses came back from whatever corners they   d bounced into .      you   ve been drinking  haven   t you     he said .      no .  the dragon is back .         now  look       wonse began .      i saw it     said vimes flatly .      a dragon .  you   re sure .      vimes leaned across the desk .     no .  i could be bloody mistaken .     he shouted .     it may have been something else with sodding great big claws  huge leathery wings and hot  fiery breath .  there must be masses of things like that .         but we all saw it killed .     said wonse .      i don   t know what we saw .     said vimes     but i know what i saw .      he leaned back  shaking .  he was suddenly feeling extremely tired .      anyway     he said  in a more normal voice     it   s flamed a house in bitwash street .  just like the other ones .         any of them get out .      vimes put his head in his hands .  he wondered how long it was since he   d last had any sleep  proper sleep  the sort with sheets .  or food  come to that .  was it last night  or the night before .  had he ever  come to think of it  ever slept at all in all his life .  it didn   t seem like it .  the arms of morpheus had rolled up their sleeves and were giving the back of his brain a right pummeling  but bits were fighting back .  any of them get    .      any of who .     he said .      the people in the house  of course     said wonse .     i assume there were people in it .  at night  i mean .         oh .  oh .  yes .  it wasn   t like a normal house .  i think it was some sort of secret society thing     vimes managed .  something was clicking in his mind  but he was too tired to examine it .      magic  you mean .         dunno     said vimes .     could be .  guys in robes .      he   s going to tell me i   ve been overdoing it  he said .  he   ll be right  too .      look     said wonse  kindly .     people who mess around with magic and don   t know how to control it  well  they can blow themselves up and           blow themselves up .         and you   ve had a busy few days     said wonse soothingly .      if i   d been knocked down and almost burned alive by a dragon i expect i   d be seeing them all the time .      vimes stared at him with his mouth open .  he couldn   t think of anything to say .  whatever stretched and knotted elastic had been driving him along these last few days had gone entirely limp .      you don   t think you   ve been overdoing it  do you .     said wonse .   ah  thought vimes .  jolly good .   he slumped forward .       the librarian leaned cautiously over the top of the bookcase and unfolded an arm into the darkness .   there it was .   his thick fingernails grasped the spine of the book  pulled it gently from its shelf and hoisted it up .  he raised the lantern carefully .   no doubt about it .  the summoning of dragons .  single copy  first edition  slightly foxed and extremely dragoned .   he set the lamp down beside him  and began to read the first page .          mmm .     said vimes  waking up .      brung you a nice cup of tea  cap   n     said sergeant colon .     and a figgin .      vimes looked at him blankly .      you   ve been asleep     said sergeant colon helpfully .     you was spark out when carrot brought you back .      vimes looked around at the now familiar surroundings of the yard .     oh     he said .      me and nobby have been doing some detectoring     said colon .     you know that house that got melted .  well  no one lives there .  it   s just rooms that get hired out .  so we found out who hires them .  there   s a caretaker who goes along every night to put the chairs away and lock up .  he wasn   t half creating about it being burned down .  you know what caretakers are like .      he stood back  waiting for the applause .      well done     said vimes dutifully  dunking the figgin into the tea .      there   s three societies use it     said colon .  he extracted his notebook .     to wit  viz  the ankh morpork fine art appreciation society  hem hem  the morpork folk dance and song club  and the elucidated brethren of the ebon night .         why hem hem .     said vimes .      well  you know .  fine art .  it   s just men paintin    pictures of young wimmin in the nudd .  the altogether     explained colon the connoisseur .     the caretaker told me .  some of them don   t even have any paint on their brushes  you know .  shameful .      there must be a million stories in the naked city  thought vimes .  so why do i always have to listen to ones like these .      when do they meet .     he said .      mondays        admission ten pence     said colon  promptly .     as for the folk dance people   well  no problem there .  you know you always wondered what corporal nobbs does on his evenings off .      colon   s face split into a watermelon grin .      no .     said vimes incredulously .     not nobby .         yep .     said colon  delighted at the result .      what  jumping about with bells on and waving his hanky in the air .         he says it is important to preserve old folkways     said colon .      nobby .  mr .  steel toecaps in the groin  i was just checking the doorhandle and it opened all by itself .         yeah .  funny old world  ain   t it .  he was very bashful about it .         good grief     said vimes .      it just goes to show  you never can tell     said colon .     anyway  the caretaker said the elucidated brethren always leave the place in a mess .  scuffed chalk marks on the floor  he said .  and they never put the chairs back properly or wash out the tea urn .  they   ve been meeting a lot lately  he said .  the nuddy wimmin painters had to meet somewhere else last week .         what did you do with our suspect .     said vimes .      him .  oh  he done a runner  captain     said the sergeant  looking embarrassed .      why .  he didn   t look in any shape to run anywhere .         well  when we got back here  we sat him down by the fire and wrapped him up because he kept on shivering     said sergeant colon  as vimes buckled his armor on .      i hope you didn   t eat his pizzas .         errol et    em .  it   s the cheese  see  it goes all           go on .         well     said colon awkwardly     he kept on shivering  sort of thing  and groaning on about dragons and that .  we felt sorry for him  to tell the truth .  and then he jumps up and runs out of the door for no reason at all .      vimes glanced at the sergeant   s big  open  dishonest face .      no reason .     he prompted .      well  we decided to have a bite  so i sent nobby out to the baker   s  see  and  well  we fought the prisoner ought to have something to eat           yes .     said vimes encouragingly .      well  when nobby asked him if he wanted his figgin toasted  he just give a scream and ran off .         just that .     said vimes .     you didn   t threaten him in any way .         straight up  captain .  bit of a mystery  if you ask me .  he kept going on about someone called supreme grand master .         hmm .     vimes glanced out of the window .  grey fog lagged the world with dim light .     what time is it .     he said .      five of the clock  sir .         right .  well  before it gets dark        colon gave a cough .     in the morning  sir .  this is tomorrow  sir .         you let me sleep all day .         didn   t have the heart to wake you up  sir .  no dragon activity  if that   s what you   re thinking .  dead quiet all round  in fact .      vimes glared at him and threw the window open .   the fog rolled in  in a slow  yellow edged waterfall .      we reckon it must of flown away     said colon   s voice  behind him .   vimes stared up into the heavy  rolling clouds .      hope it clears up for the coronation     colon went on  in a worried voice .     you all right  sir .        it hasn   t flown away  vimes thought .  why should it fly away .  we can   t hurt it  and it   s got everything it wants right here .  it   s up there somewhere .      you all right  sir .     colon repeated .   it   s got to be up high somewhere  in the fog .  there   s all kinds of towers and things .      what time   s the coronation  sergeant .     he said .      noon  sir .  and mr .  wonse has sent a message about how you   re to be in your best armor among all the civic leaders  sir .         oh  has he .         and sergeant hummock and the day squad will be lining the route  sir .         what with .     said vimes vaguely  watching the skies .      sorry  sir .      vimes squinted upward to get a better view of the roof .     hmm .     he said .      i said they   ll be lining the route  sir     said sergeant colon .      it   s up there  sergeant     said vimes .     i can practically smell it .         yes  sir     said colon obediently .      it   s deciding what to do next .         yes  sir .         they   re not unintelligent  you know .  they just don   t think like us .         yes  sir .         so be damned to any lining of the route .  i want you three up on roofs  understand .         yes  si   what .         up on the roofs .  up high .  when it makes its move  i want us to be the first to know .      colon tried to indicate by his expression that he didn   t .      do you think that   s a good idea  sir .     he ventured .     vimes gave him a blank look .     yes  sergeant  i do .  it was one of mine     he said coldly .     now go and see to it .      when he was left to himself vimes washed and shaved in cold water  and then rummaged in his campaign chest until he unearthed his ceremonial breastplate and red cloak .  well  the cloak had been red once  and still was  here and there  although most of it resembled a small net used very successfully for catching moths .  there was also a helmet  defiantly without plumes  from which the molecule thick gold leaf had long ago peeled .   he   d started saving up for a new cloak  once .  whatever had happened to the money .   there was no one in the guardroom .  errol lay in the wreckage of the fourth fruit box nobby had scrounged for him .  the rest had all been eaten  or had dissolved .   in the warm silence the everlasting rumbling of his stomach sounded especially loud .  occasionally he whimpered .   vimes scratched him vaguely behind the ears .      what   s up with you  boy .     he said .   the door creaked open .  carrot came in  saw vimes hunkered down by the ravaged box  and saluted .      we   re a bit worried about him  captain     he volunteered .     he hasn   t eaten his coal .  just lies there twitching and whining all the time .  you don   t think something   s wrong with him  do you .         possibly     said vimes .     but having something wrong with them is quite normal for a dragon .  they always get over it .  one way or another .      errol gave him a mournful look and closed his eyes again .  vimes pulled his scrap of blanket over him .   there was a squeak .  he fished around beside the dragon   s shivering body  pulled out a small rubber hippo  stared at it in surprise and then gave it one or two experimental squeezes .        i thought it would be something for him to play with     said carrot  slightly shamefaced .      you bought him a little toy .         yes  sir .         what a kind thought .      vimes hoped carrot hadn   t noticed the fluffy ball tucked into the back of the box .  it had been quite expensive .   he left the two of them and stepped into the outside world .   there was even more bunting now .  people were beginning to line the main streets  even though there were hours to wait .  it was still very depressing .   he felt an appetite for once  one that it   d take more than a drink or two to satisfy .  he strolled along for breakfast at harga   s house of ribs  the habit of years  and got another unpleasant surprise .  normally the only decoration in there was on sham harga   s vest and the food was good solid stuff for a cold morning  all calories and fat and protein and maybe a vitamin crying softly because it was all alone .  now laboriously made paper streamers criss crossed the room and he was confronted with a crayonned menu in which the words    coronasion    and    royall    figured somewhere on every crooked line .   vimes pointed wearily at the top of the menu .      what   s this .     he said .   harga peered at it .  they were alone in the grease walled cafe .      it says    bye royarl appointmente     captain     he said proudly .      what   s it mean .      harga scratched his head with a ladle .     what it means is     he said     if the king comes in here  he   ll like it .         have you got anything that isn   t too aristocratic for me to eat  then .     said vimes sourly  and settled for a slice of plebeian fried bread and a proletarian steak cooked so rare you could still hear it bray .  vimes ate it at the counter .   a vague scraping noise disturbed his thoughts .     what   re you doing .     he said .   harga looked up guiltily from his work behind the counter .      nothing  cap   n     he said .  he tried to hide the evidence behind him when vimes glared over the knife chewed woodwork .      come on  sham .  you can show me .      harga   s beefy hands came reluctantly into view .      i was only scraping the old fat out of the pan     he mumbled .      i see .  and how long have we known each other  sham .     said vimes  with terrible kindness .      years  cap   n     said harga .     you bin coming in here nearly every day  reg   lar .  one of my best customers .      vimes leaned over the counter until his nose was level with the squashy pink thing in the middle of harga   s face .      and in all that time  have you ever changed the fat .     he demanded .   harga tried to back away .     well           it   s been like a friend to me  that old fat     said vimes .     there   s little black bits in there i   ve grown to know and love .  it   s a meal in itself .  and you   ve cleaned out the coffee jug  haven   t you .  i can tell .  this is love in a canoe coffee if ever i tasted it .  the other stuff had flavor .         well  i thought it was time           why .      harga let the pan fall from his pudgy fingers .     well  i thought  if the king should happen to come in           you   re all mad .           but  cap   n        vimes   s accusing finger buried itself up to the second joint in harga   s expensive vest .      you don   t even know the wretched fellow   s name .     he shouted .   harga rallied .     i do  cap   n     he stuttered .     course i do .  seen it on the decorations and everything .  he   s called rex vivat .      very gently  shaking his head in despair  crying in his heart for the essential servility of mankind  vimes let him go .       in another time and place  the librarian finished reading .  he   d reached the end of the text .  not the end of the book   there was plenty more book .  it had been scorched beyond the point of legibility  though .   not that the last few unburned pages were very easy to read .  the author   s hand had been shaking  he   d been writing fast  and he   d blotted a lot .  but the librarian had wrestled with many a terrifying text in some of the worst books ever bound  words that tried to read you as you read them  words that writhed on the page .  at least these weren   t words like that .  these were just the words of a man frightened for his life .  a man writing a dreadful warning .   it was a page a little back from the burned section that drew the librarian   s eye .  he sat and stared at it for some time .   then he stared at the darkness .   it was his darkness .  he was asleep out there somewhere .  somewhere out there a thief was heading for this place  to steal this book .  and then someone would read this book  read these words  and do it anyway .   his hands itched .     all he had to do was hide the book  or drop onto the thief   s head and unscrew it by the ears .   he stared into the darkness again     but that would be interfering with the course of history .  horrible things could happen .  the librarian knew all about this sort of thing  it was part of what you had to know before you were allowed into l space .  he   d seen pictures in ancient books .  time could bifurcate  like a pair of trousers .  you could end up in the wrong leg  living a life that was actually happening in the other leg  talking to people who weren   t in your leg  walking into walls that weren   t there anymore .  life could be horrible in the wrong trouser of time .   besides  it was against library rules .   the assembled librarians of time and space would certainly have something to say about it if he started to tinker with causality .   he closed the book carefully and tucked it back into the shelf .  then he swung gently from bookcase to bookcase until he reached the doorway .  for a moment he stopped and looked down at his own sleeping body .  perhaps he wondered  briefly  whether to wake himself up  have a little chat  tell himself that he had friends and not to worry .  if so  he must have decided against it .  you could get yourself into a lot of trouble that way .   instead he slipped out of the door  and lurked in the shadows  and followed the hooded thief when it came out clutching the book  and waited near the dread portal in the rain until the elucidated brethren had met and  when the last one left  followed him to his home  and murmured to himself in anthropoid surprise       and then ran back to his library and the treacherous pathways of l space .       by mid morning the streets were packed  vimes had docked nobby a day   s salary for waving a flag  and an air of barbed gloom settled over the yard  like a big black cloud with occasional flashes of lightning in it .         get up in a high place .        muttered nobby .     that   s all very well to say .         i was looking forward to lining the streets     said colon .     i   d have got a good view .         you were going on about privilege and the rights of man the other night     said nobby accusingly .      yes  well  one of the privileges and rights of this man is getting a good view     said the sergeant .     that   s all i   m saying .         i   ve never seen the captain in such a filthy temper     said nobby .     i liked it better when he was on the drink .  i reckon he   s           you know  i think errol is really ill     said carrot .   they turned toward the fruit basket .      he   s very hot .  and his skin looks all shiny .         what   s the right temperature for a dragon .     said colon .      yeah .  how do you take it .     said nobby .      i think we ought to ask lady ramkin to have a look at him     said carrot .     she knows about these things .         no  she   ll be getting ready for the coronation .  we shouldn   t go disturbing her     said colon .  he stretched out his hand to errol   s quivering flanks .     i used to have a dog that   arrgh .  that   s not hot  that   s boiling .         i   ve offered him lots of water and he just won   t touch it .  what are you doing with that kettle  nobby .      nobby looked innocent .     well  i thought we might as well make a cup of tea before we go out .  it   s a shame to waste           take it off him .          noon came .  the fog didn   t lift but it did thin a bit  to allow a pale yellow haze where the sun should have been .   although the passage of years had turned the post of captain of the watch into something rather shabby  it still meant that vimes was entitled to a seat at official occasions .  the pecking order had moved it  though  so that now he was in the lowest tier on the rickety bleachers between the master of the fellowship of beggars and the head of the teachers    guild .  he didn   t mind that .  anything was better than the top row  among the assassins  thieves  merchants and all the other things that had floated to the top of society .  he never knew what to talk about .  anyway  the teacher was restful company since he didn   t do much but clench and un clench his hands occasionally  and whimper .      something wrong with your neck  captain .     said the chief beggar politely  as they waited for the coaches .      what .     said vimes distractedly .      you keep on staring upward     said the beggar .      hmm .  oh .  no .  nothing wrong     said vimes .   the beggar wrapped his velvet cloak around him .      you couldn   t by any chance spare       he paused  calculating a sum in accordance with his station      about three hundred dollars for a twelve course civic banquet  could you .         no .         fair enough .  fair enough     said the chief beggar amiably .  he sighed .  it wasn   t a rewarding job  being chief beggar .  it was the differentials that did for you .  low grade beggars made a reasonable enough living on pennies  but people tended to look the other way when you asked them for a sixteen bedroom mansion for the night .   vimes resumed his study of the sky .   up on the dais the high priest of blind io  who last night by dint of elaborate ecumenical argument and eventually by a club with nails in it had won the right to crown the king  fussed over his preparations .  by the small portable sacrificial altar a tethered billy goat was peacefully chewing the cud and possibly thinking  in goat  what a lucky billy goat i am  to be given such a good view of the proceedings .  this is going to be something to tell the kids .   vimes scanned the diffused outlines of the nearest buildings .   a distant cheering suggested that the ceremonial procession was on its way .   there was a scuffle of activity around the dais as lupine wonse chivvied a scramble of servants who rolled a purple carpet down the steps .   across the square  among the ranks of ankh morpork   s faded aristocracy  lady ramkin   s face tilted upward .   around the throne  which had been hastily created out of wood and gold foil  a number of lesser priests  some of them with slight head wounds  shuffled into position .   vimes shifted in his seat  aware of the sound of his own heartbeat  and glared at the haze over the river .      and saw the wings .       dear mother and father  wrote carrot  in between staring dutifully into the fog  well  the town is on fate for the coronation  which is more complicated than at home  and now i am on day duty as well .  this is a shame because  i was going to watch the coronation with reet  but it does not do to complain .  i must go now because we are expecting a dragon any minute although it does not exist really .  your loving son  carrot .   ps .  have you seen anything of minty lately .          you idiot .         sorry     said vimes .     sorry .      people were climbing back into their seats  many of them giving him furious looks .  wonse was white with fury .      how could you have been so stupid .     he raged .   vimes stared at his own fingers .      i thought i saw       he began .      it was a raven .  you know what ravens are .  there must be hundreds of them in the city .         in the fog  you see  the size wasn   t easy to       vimes mumbled .      and poor master greetling  you ought to have known what loud noises do to him .     the head of the teachers    guild had to be led away by some kind people .      shouting out like that .     wonse went on .      look  i said i   m sorry .  it was an honest mistake .         i   ve had to hold up the procession and everything .      vimes said nothing .  he could feel hundreds of amused or unsympathetic eyes on him .      well     he muttered     i   d better be getting back to the yard        wonse   s eyes narrowed .     no     he snapped .     but you can go home  if you like .  or anywhere your fancies take you .  give me your badge .         huh .      wonse held out his hand .      your badge     he repeated .      my badge .           that   s what i said .  i want to keep you out of trouble .      vimes looked at him in astonishment .     but it   s my badge .         and you   re going to give it to me     said wonse grimly .     by order of the king .         what d   you mean .  he doesn   t even know .     vimes heard the wailing in his own voice .   wonse scowled .     but he will     he said .     and i don   t expect he   ll even bother to appoint a successor .      vimes slowly unclipped the verdigrised disc of copper  weighed it in his hand  and then tossed it to wonse without a word .   for a moment he considered pleading  but something rebelled .  he turned  and stalked off through the crowd .   so that was it .   as simple as that .  after half a lifetime of service .  no more city watch .  huh .  vimes kicked at the pavement .  it   d be some sort of royal guard now .   with plumes in their damn helmets .   well  he   d had enough .  it wasn   t a proper life anyway  in the watch .  you didn   t meet people in the best of circumstances .  there must be hundreds of other things he could do  and if he thought for long enough he could probably remember what some of them were .   pseudopolis yard was off the route of the procession  and as he stumbled into the watch house he could hear the distant cheering beyond the rooftops .  across the city the temple gongs were being sounded .   now they are ringing the gongs  thought vimes  but soon they will   they will   they will not be ringing the gongs .  not much of an aphorism  he thought  but he could work on it .  he had the time  now .   vimes noticed the mess .   errol had started eating again .  he   d eaten most of the table  the grate  the coal scuttle  several lamps and the squeaky rubber hippo .  now he lay in his box again  skin twitching  whimpering in his sleep .      a right mess you   ve made     said vimes enigmatically .  still  at least he wouldn   t have to tidy it up .   he opened his desk drawer .   someone had eaten into that  too .  all that was left was a few shards of glass .       sergeant colon hauled himself onto the parapet around the temple of small gods .  he was too old for this sort of thing .  he   d joined for the bell ringing  not sitting around on high places waiting for dragons to find him .   he got his breath back  and peered through the fog .      anyone human still up here .     he whispered .   carrot   s voice sounded dead and featureless in the dull air .      here i am  sergeant     he said .      i was just checking if you were still here     said colon .      i   m still here  sergeant     said carrot  obediently .   colon joined him .      just checking you were not et     he said  trying to grin .      i haven   t been et     said carrot .      oh     said colon .     good  then .     he tapped his fingers on the damp stonework  feeling he ought to make his position absolutely clear .      just checking     he repeated .     part of my duty  see .  going around  sort of thing .  it   s not that i   m frightened of being up on the roofs by myself  you understand .  thick up here  isn   t it .         yes  sergeant .         everything all okay .     nobby   s muffled voice sidled its way through the thick air  quickly followed by its owner .      yes  corporal     said carrot .        what you doing up here .     colon demanded .      i was just coming up to check lance constable carrot was all right     said nobby innocently .     what were you doing  sergeant .         we   re all all right     said carrot  beaming .     that   s good  isn   t it .      the two ncos shifted uneasily and avoided looking at one another .  it seemed like a long way back to their posts  across the damp  cloudy and  above all  exposed rooftops .   colon made an executive decision .      sod this     he said  and found a piece of fallen statuary to sit on .  nobby leaned on the parapet and winkled a damp dog end from the unspeakable ashtray behind his ear .      heard the procession go by     he observed .  colon filled his pipe  and struck a match on the stone beside him .      if that dragon   s alive     he said  blowing out a plume of smoke and turning a small patch of fog into smog     then it   ll have got the hell away from here  i   m telling you .  not the right sort of place for dragons  a city     he added  in the tones of someone doing a great job of convincing himself .     it   ll have gone off to somewhere where there   s high places and plenty to eat  you mark my words .         somewhere like the city  you mean .     said carrot .      shut up     said the other two in unison .      chuck us the matches  sergeant     said nobby .   colon tossed the bundle of evil yellow headed lucifers across the leads .  nobby struck one  which was immediately blown out .  shreds of fog drifted past him .      wind   s getting up     he observed .      good .  can   t stand this fog     said colon .     what was i saying .         you were saying the dragon   ll be miles away     prompted nobby .      oh .  right .  well  it stands to reason  doesn   t it .  i mean  i wouldn   t hang around here if i could fly away .  if i could fly  i wouldn   t be sitting on a roof on some manky old statue .  if i could fly  i   d           what statue .     said nobby  cigarette halfway to his mouth .      this one     said colon  thumping the stone .     and don   t try to give me the willies  nobby .  you know there   s hundreds of moldy old statues up on small gods .         no i don   t     said nobby .     what i do know is  they were all taken down last month when they releaded the roof .  there   s just the roof and the dome and that   s it .  you have to take notice of little things like that     he added     when you   re detectoring .      in the damp silence that followed sergeant colon looked down at the stone he was sitting on .  it had a taper  and a scaly pattern  and a sort of indefinable tail like quality .  then he followed its length up and into the rapidly thinning fog .   on the dome of small gods the dragon raised its head  yawned  and unfolded its wings .   the unfolding wasn   t a simple operation .  it seemed to go on for some time  as the complex biological machinery of ribs and pleats slid apart .  then  with wings outstretched  the dragon yawned  took a few steps to the edge of the roof  and launched itself into the air .   after a while a hand appeared over the edge of the parapet .  it flailed around for a moment until it got a decent grip .   there was a grunt .  carrot hauled himself back onto the roof and pulled the other two up behind him .  they lay flat out on the leads  panting .  carrot observed the way that the dragon   s talons had scored deep grooves in the metal .  you couldn   t help noticing things like that .      hadn   t     he panted     hadn   t we better warn people .      colon dragged himself forward until he could look across the city .        i don   t think we need bother     he said .     i think they   ll soon find out .          the high priest of blind io was stumbling over his words .  there had never been an official coronation service in ankh morpork as far as he could find out .  the old kings had managed quite well with something on the lines of     we hath got the crown  i   faith  and we will kill any whore son who tries to take it away  by the lord harry .     apart from anything else  this was rather short .  he   d spent a long time drafting something longer and more in keeping with the spirit of the times  and was having some trouble remembering it .   he was also being put off by the goat  which was watching him with loyal interest .      get on with it .     wonse hissed  from his position behind the throne .      all in good time     the high priest hissed back .     this is a coronation  i   ll have you know .  you might try to show a little respect .         of course i   m showing respect .  now get on        there was a shout  off to the right .  wonse glared into the crowd .      it   s that ramkin woman     he said .     what   s she up to .      people around her were chattering excitedly now .  fingers pointed all the same way  like a small fallen forest .  there were one or two screams  and then the crowd moved like a tide .   wonse looked along the wide street of small gods .   it wasn   t a raven out there .  not this time .       the dragon flew slowly  only a few feet above the ground  wings sculling gracefully through the air .   the flags that crisscrossed the street were caught up and snapped like so much cobweb  piling up on the creature   s spine plates and flapping back along the length of its tail .   it flew with head and neck fully extended  as if the great body was being towed like a barge .  the people on the street yelled and fought one another for the safety of doorways .  it paid them no attention .   it should have come roaring  but the only sounds were the creaking of wings and the snapping of banners .   it should have come roaring .  not like this  not slowly and deliberately  giving terror time to mature .  it should have come threatening .  not promising .   it should have come roaring  not flying gently to the accompaniment of the zip and zing of merry bunting .       vimes pulled open the other drawer of his desk and glared at the paperwork  such as there was of it .  there wasn   t really much in there that he could call his own .  a scrap of sugar bag reminded him that he now owed the tea kitty six pence .   odd .  he wasn   t angry yet .  he would be later on  of course .  by evening he   d be furious .  drunk and furious .  but not yet .  not yet .  it hadn   t really sunk in  and he knew he was just going through the motions as a preventative against thinking .   errol stirred sluggishly in his box  raised his head and whined .      what   s the matter  boy .     said vimes  reaching down .     upset stomach .      the little dragon   s skin was moving as though heavy industry was being carried on inside .  nothing in diseases of the dragon said anything about this .  from the swollen stomach came sounds like a distant and complicated war in an earthquake zone .   that surely wasn   t right .  sybil ramkin said you had to pay great attention to a dragon   s diet  since even a minor stomach upset would decorate the walls and ceiling with pathetic bits of scaly skin .  but in the past few days   well  there had been cold pizzas  and the ash from nobby   s horrible dog ends  and all in all errol had eaten more or less what he liked .  which was just about everything  to judge by the room .  not to mention the contents of the bottom drawer .      we really haven   t looked after you very well  have we .     said vimes .     treated you like a dog  really .     he wondered what effect squeaky rubber hippos had on the digestion .   vimes became slowly aware that the distant cheering had turned to screams .   he stared vaguely at errol  and then smiled an incredibly evil smile and stood up .   there were sounds of panic and the mob on the run .   he placed his battered helmet on his head and gave it a jaunty tap .  then  humming a mad little tune  he sauntered out of the building .   errol remained quite still for a while and then  with extreme difficulty  half crawled and half rolled out of his box .  strange messages were coming from the massive part of his brain that controlled his digestive system .  it was demanding certain things that he couldn   t put a name to .  fortunately it was able to describe them in minute detail to the complex receptors in his enormous nostrils .  they flared  subjecting the air of the room to an intimate examination .  his head turned  triangulating .   he pulled himself across the floor and began to eat  with every sign of enjoyment  carrot   s tin of armor polish .       people streamed past vimes as he strolled up the street of small gods .  smoke rose into the air from the plaza of broken moons .     the dragon squatted in the middle of it  on what remained of the coronation dais .  it had a self satisfied expression .   there was no sign of the throne  or of its occupant  although it was possible that complicated forensic examination of the small pile of charcoal in the wrecked and smoldering woodwork might offer some clue .   vimes caught hold of an ornamental fountain to steady himself as the crowds stampeded by .  every street out of the plaza was packed with struggling bodies .  not noisy ones  vimes noticed .  people weren   t wasting their breath with screaming anymore .  there was just this solid  deadly determination to be somewhere else .   the dragon spread its wings and flapped them luxuriously .  the people at the rear of the crowd took this as a signal to climb up the backs of the people in front of them and run for safety from head to head .   within a few seconds the square was empty of all save the stupid and the terminally bewildered .  even the badly trampled were making a spirited crawl for the nearest exit .   vimes looked around him .  there seemed to be a lot of fallen flags  some of which were being eaten by an elderly goat which couldn   t believe its luck .  he could distantly see cut me own throat on his hands and knees  trying to restore the contents of his tray .   by vimes   s side a small child waved a flag hesitantly and shouted    hurrah .      then everything went quiet .   vimes bent down .      i think you should be going home     he said .   the child squinted up at him .      are you a watch man .     it said .      no     said vimes .     and yes .         what happened to the king  watch man .           er .  i think he   s gone off for a rest     said vimes .      my auntie said i shouldn   t talk to watch men     said the child .      do you think it might be a good idea to go home and tell her how obedient you   ve been  then .     said vimes .      my auntie said  if i was naughty  she   d put me on the roof and call the dragon     said the child  conversationally .     my auntie said it eats you all up starting with the legs  so   s you can see what   s happening .         why don   t you go home and tell your auntie she   s acting in the best traditions of ankh morpork child rearing .     said vimes .     go on .  run along .         it crunches up all your bones     said the child happily .     and when it gets to your head  it           look  it   s up there .     shouted vimes .     the great big dragon that crunches you up .  now go home .      the child looked up at the thing perched on the crippled dais .      i haven   t seen it crunch anyone yet     it complained .      push off or you   ll feel the back of my hand     said vimes .   this seemed to fit the bill .  the child nodded understandingly .      right .  can i shout hurrah again .         if you like     said vimes .      hurrah .      so much for community policing  vimes thought .  he peered out from behind the fountain again .   a voice immediately above him rumbled     say what you like  i still swear it   s a magnificent specimen .      vimes   s gaze traveled upward until it crested the edge of the fountain   s top bowl .      have you noticed     said sybil ramkin  hauling herself upright by a piece of eroded statuary and dropping down in front of him     how every time we meet  a dragon turns up .     she gave him an arch smile .     it   s a bit like having your own tune .  or something .         it   s just sitting there     said vimes hurriedly .     just looking around .  as if it   s waiting for something to happen .      the dragon blinked with jurassic patience .   the roads off the square were packed with people .  that   s the ankh morpork instinct  vimes thought .  run away  and then stop and see if anything interesting is going to happen to other people .   there was a movement in the wreckage near the dragon   s front talon  and the high priest of blind io staggered to his feet  dust and splinters cascading from his robes .  he was still holding the ersatz crown in one hand .   vimes watched the old man look upward into a couple of glowing red eyes a few feet away .      can dragons read minds .     whispered vimes .      i   m sure mine understand every word i say     hissed lady ramkin .     oh  no .  the silly old fool is giving it the crown .         but isn   t that a smart move .     said vimes .     dragons like gold .  it   s like throwing a stick for a dog  isn   t it .         oh dear     said sybil ramkin .     it might not  you know .  dragons have such sensitive mouths .      the great dragon blinked at the tiny circle of gold .  then  with extreme delicacy  it extended one meter long claw and hooked the thing out of the priest   s trembling fingers .      what d   you mean  sensitive .     said vimes  watching the claw travel slowly toward the long  horse like face .      a really incredible sense of taste .  they   re so  well  chemically orientated .         you mean it can probably taste gold .     whispered vimes  watching the crown being carefully licked .      oh  certainly .  and smell it .        vimes wondered what the chances were of the crown being made of gold .  not high  he decided .  gold foil over copper  perhaps .  enough to fool human beings .  and then he wondered what someone   s reaction would be if they were offered sugar which turned out  once you   d put three spoonfuls in your coffee  to be salt .   the dragon removed the claw from its mouth in one graceful movement and caught the high priest  who was just sneaking away  a blow which knocked him high into the air .  when he was screaming at the top of the arc the great mouth came around and      gosh .     said lady ramkin .   there was a groan from the watchers .      the temperature of the thing .     said vimes .     i mean  nothing left .  just a wisp of smoke .      there was another movement in the rubble .  another figure pulled itself upright and leaned dazedly against a broken spar .   it was lupine wonse  under a coating of soot .   vimes watched him look up into a pair of nostrils the size of drain covers .   wonse broke into a run .  vimes wondered what it felt like  running away from something like that  expecting any minute your backbone to reach  very briefly  a temperature somewhere beyond the vaporization point of iron .  he could guess .   wonse made it halfway across the square before the dragon darted forward with surprising agility for such a bulk and snatched him up .  the talon swept on upward until the struggling figure was being held a few feet from the dragon   s face .   it appeared to examine him for some time  turning him this way and that .  then  moving on its three free legs and flapping its wings occasionally to help with its balance  it trotted away across the plaza and headed toward the   what once had been the patrician   s palace .  to what once had been the king   s palace  too .   it ignored the frightened spectators silently pressing themselves against the walls .  the arched gateway was shouldered aside with depressing ease .  the doors themselves  tall and iron bound and solid  lasted a surprising ten seconds before collapsing into a heap of glowing ash .   the dragon stepped through .   lady ramkin turned in astonishment .  vimes had started to laugh .   there was a manic edge to it and there were tears in his eyes  but it was still laughter .  he laughed and laughed until he slid gently down the edge of the fountain  his legs splaying out in front of him .      hooray  hooray  hooray .     he giggled  almost choking .      what on earth d   you mean .     lady ramkin demanded .      put out more flags .  blow the cymbals  roast the tocsin .  we   ve crowned it .  we   ve got a king after all .  what ho .         have you been drinking .     she snapped .      not yet .     sniggered vimes .     not yet .  but i will be .      he laughed on  knowing that when he stopped black depression was going to drop on him like a lead souffl   .  but he could see the future stretching out ahead of them        after all  it was definitely noble .  and it didn   t carry money  and it couldn   t answer back .  it could certainly do something for the inner cities  too .  like torching them to the bedrock .   we   ll really do it  he thought .  that   s the ankh morpork way .  if you can   t beat it or corrupt it  you pretend it was your idea in the first place .   vivat draco .   he became aware that the small child had wandered up again .  it waved its flag gently at him and said     can i shout hurrah again now .           why not .     said vimes .     everyone else will .      from the palace came the muffled sounds of complicated destruction         errol pulled a broomstick across the floor with his mouth and  whimpering with effort  hauled it upright .  after a lot more whimpering and several false starts he managed to winkle the end of it between the wall and the big jar of lamp oil .   he paused for a moment  breathing like a bellows  and pushed .   the jar resisted for a moment  rocked back and forth once or twice  and then fell over and smashed on the flagstones .  crude  very badly refined oil spread out in a black puddle .   errol   s huge nostrils twitched .  somewhere in the back of his brain unfamiliar synapses clicked like telegraph keys .  great balks of information flooded down the thick nerve cord to his nose  carrying inexplicable information about triple bonds  alkanes and geometric isomerism .  however  almost all of it missed the small part of errol   s brain that was used for being errol .   all he knew was that he was suddenly very  very thirsty .       something major was happening in the palace .  there was the occasional crash of a floor or thump of a falling ceiling     in his rat filled dungeon  behind a door with more locks than a major canal network  the patrician of ankh morpork lay back and grinned in the darkness .       outside  bonfires flared in the dusk .   ankh morpork was celebrating .  no one was quite sure why  but they   d worked themselves up for a celebration tonight  barrels had been broached  oxen had been put on spits  one paper hat and celebratory mug had been issued per child  and it seemed a shame to waste all that effort .  anyway  it had been a very interesting day  and the people of ankh morpork set great store by entertainment .      the way i see it     said one of the revellers  halfway through a huge greasy lump of half raw meat     a dragon as king mightn   t be a bad idea .  when you think it through  is what i mean .         it definitely looked very gracious     said the woman to his right  as if testing the idea .     sort of  well  sleek .  nice and smart .  not scruffy .  takes a bit of a pride in itself .     she glared at some of the younger revellers further down the table .     the trouble with people today is they don   t take pride in themselves .         and there   s foreign policy  of course     said a third  helping himself to a rib .     when you come to think about it .         what d   you mean .         diplomacy     said the rib eater  flatly .   they thought about it .  and then you could see them turning the idea around and thinking about it the other way  in a polite effort to see what the hell he was getting at .      dunno     said the monarchical expert slowly .     i mean  your actual dragon  it   s got these  basically  two sort of ways of negotiation .  hasn   t it .  i mean  it   s either roasting you alive  or it isn   t .  correct me if i   m wrong     he added .      that   s my point .  i mean  let   s say the ambassador from klatch comes along  you know how arrogant that lot are  suppose he says  we want this  we want that  we want the other thing .  well     he said  beaming at them     what we say is  shut your face unless you want to go home in a jar .      they tried out this idea for mental fit .  it had that certain something .      they   ve got a big fleet  klatch     said the monarchist uncertainly .     could be a bit risky  roasting diplomats .  people see a pile of charcoal come back on the boat  they tend to look a bit askance .         ah  then we say  ho there  johnny klatchian  you no likeum  big fella lizard belong sky bake mud hut belong you pretty damn chop chop .         we could really say that .         why not .  and then we say  send plenty tribute toot sweet .         i never did like them klatchians     said the woman firmly .     the stuff they eat .  it   s disgustin    .  and gabblin    away all the time in their heathen lingo        in the shadows  a match flared .   vimes cupped his hands around the flame  sucked on the foul tobacco  tossed the match into the gutter and slouched off down the damp  puddle punctuated alley .   if there was anything that depressed him more than his own cynicism  it was that quite often it still wasn   t as cynical as real life .   we   ve got along with the other guys for centuries  he thought .  getting along has practically been all our foreign policy .  now i think i   ve just heard us declare war on an ancient civilization that we   ve always got along with  more or less  even if they do talk funny .  and after that  the world .  what   s worse  we   ll probably win .       similar thoughts  although with a different perspective  were going through the minds of the civic leaders of ankh morpork when  next morning  each received a short note bidding them to be at the palace for a working lunch  by order .   it didn   t say whose order .  or  they noted  whose lunch .   now they were assembled in the antechamber .   and there had been changes .  it had never been what you might call a select place .  the patrician had always felt that if you made people comfortable they might want to stay .  the furniture had been a few very elderly chairs and  around the walls  portraits of earlier city rulers holding scrolls and things .   the chairs were still there .  the portraits were not .  or  rather  the stained and cracked canvases were piled in a corner  but the gilt frames were gone .   the councillors tried to avoid one another   s faces  and sat tapping their fingers on their knees .   finally a couple of very worried looking servants opened the doors to the main hall .  lupine wonse lurched through .   most of the councillors had been up all night anyway  trying to formulate some kind of policy vis    vis dragons  but wonse looked as though he hadn   t been to sleep in years .  his face was the color of a fermented dishcloth .  never particularly well padded  he now looked like something out of a pyramid .      ah     he intoned .     good .  are you all here .  then perhaps you would step this way  gentlemen .         er     said the head thief     the note mentioned lunch .         yes .     said wonse .      with a dragon .         good grief  you don   t think it would eat you  do you .     said wonse .     what an idea .         never crossed me mind     said the head thief  relief blowing from his ears like steam .     the very idea .  haha .         haha     said the chief merchant .      hoho     said the head assassin .     the very idea .         no  i expect you   re all far too stringy     said wonse .     haha .         haha .         ahaha .         hoho .     the temperature lowered by several degrees .        so if you would kindly step this way .      the great hall had changed .  for one thing  it was a great deal greater .  several walls had been knocked into adjoining rooms  and the ceiling and several storys of upper rooms had been entirely removed .  the floor was a mass of rubble except in the middle of the room  which was a heap of gold     well  goldish .  it looked as though someone had scoured the palace for anything that shone or glittered .  there were the picture frames  and the gold thread out of the tapestries  and silver  and the occasional gem .  there were also tureens from the kitchens  candlesticks  warming pans  fragments of mirror .  sparkly stuff .   the councillors were not in a position to pay much attention to this  however  because of what was hanging above their heads .   it looked like the biggest badly rolled cigar in the universe  if the biggest badly rolled cigar in the universe was in the habit of hanging upside down .  two talons could be dimly seen gripping the dark rafters .   halfway between the glittering heap and the doorway a small table had been laid .  the councillors noted without much surprise that the familiar ancient silverware was missing .  there were china plates  and cutlery that looked as though it had very recently been whittled from bits of wood .  wonse took a seat at the head of the table and nodded to the servants .      please be seated  gentlemen     he said .     i am sorry things are a little   different  but the king hopes you will bear with it until matters can be more suitably organized .         the  er     said the head merchant .      the king     repeated wonse .  his voice sounded one dribble away from madness .      oh .  the king .  right     said the merchant .  from where he was sitting he had a good view of the big hanging thing .  there seemed to be some movement there  some trembling in the great folds that wrapped it .     long life to him  say i     he added quickly .   the first course was soup with dumplings in it .  wonse didn   t have any .  the rest of them ate in a terrified silence broken only by the dull chiming of wood on china .      there are certain matters of decree to which the king feels your assent would be welcome     said wonse  eventually .     a pure formality  of course  and i am sorry to bother you with such petty detail .      the big bundle appeared to sway in the breeze .      no trouble at all     squeaked the head thief .      the king graciously desires it to be known     said wonse     that it would be pleased to receive coronation gifts from the population at large .  nothing complex  of course .  simply any precious metals or gems they might have by them and can easily spare .  i should stress  by the way  that this is by no means compulsory .  such generosity as he is confident of expecting should be an entirely voluntary act .      the chief assassin looked sadly at the rings on his fingers  and sighed .  the head merchant was already resignedly unshipping his gilt chain of office from around his neck .      why  gentlemen .     said wonse .     this is most unexpected .         um     said the archchancellor of unseen university .     you will be   that is  i am sure the king is aware that  traditionally  the university is exempt from all city levies and taxes        he stifled a yawn .  the wizards had spent the night directing their best spells against the dragon .  it was like punching fog .      my dear sir  this is no levy     protested wonse .     i hope that nothing i have said would lead you to expect anything like that .  oh  no .  no .  any tribute should be  as i said  entirely voluntary .  i hope that is absolutely clear .         as crystal     said the head assassin  glaring at the old wizard .     and these entirely voluntary tributes we are about to make  they go    .         on the hoard     said wonse .      ah .         while i am positive the people of the city will be very generous indeed once they fully understand the situation     said the head merchant     i am sure the king will understand that there is very little gold in ankh morpork .         good point     said wonse .     however  the king intends to pursue a vigorous and dynamic foreign policy which should remedy matters .         ah     the councillors chorused  rather more enthusiastically this time .      for example     wonse went on     the king feels that our legitimate interests in quirm  sto lat  pseudopolis and tsort have been seriously compromised in recent centuries .  this will be speedily corrected and  gentlemen  i can assure you that treasure will positively flow into the city from those anxious to enjoy the king   s protection .      the head assassin glanced at the hoard .  a very definite idea formed in his mind as to where all that treasure would end up .  you had to admire the way dragons knew how to put the bite on .  it was practically human .      oh     he said .      of course  there will probably be other acquisitions in the way of land  property and so forth  and the king wishes it to be fully understood that loyal privy councillors will be richly rewarded .         and  er     said the head assassin  who was beginning to feel that he had got a firm grip on the nature of the king   s mental processes     no doubt the  er           privy councillors     said wonse .      no doubt they will respond with even greater generosity in the matter of  for example  treasure .         i am sure such considerations haven   t crossed the king   s mind     said wonse     but the point is very well made .         i thought it would be .      the next course was fat pork  beans and floury potatoes .  more  as they couldn   t help noticing  fattening food .   wonse had a glass of water .      which brings us onto a further matter of some delicacy which i am sure that well traveled  broadminded gentlemen such as yourselves will have no difficulty in accepting     he said .  the hand holding the glass was beginning to shake .      i hope it will also be understood by the population at large  especially since the king will undoubtedly be able to contribute in so many ways to the well being and defense of the city .  for example  i am sure that the people will rest more contentedly in their beds knowing that the dr   the king is tirelessly protecting them from harm .  there can  however  be ridiculous ancient   prejudices   which will only be eradicated by ceaseless work   on the part of all men of good will .      he paused  and looked at them .  the head assassin said later that he had looked into the eyes of many men who  obviously were very near death  but he had never looked into eyes that were so clearly and unmistakably looking back at him from the slopes of hell .  he hoped he would never  he said  ever have to look into eyes like that again .      i am referring     said wonse  each word coming slowly to the surface like bubbles in some quicksand     to the matter of   the king   s   diet .        there was a terrible silence .  they heard the faint rustle of wings behind them  and the shadows in the corners of the hall grew darker and seemed to close in .      diet     said the head thief  in a hollow voice .      yes     said wonse .  his voice was almost a squeak .  sweat was dripping down his face .  the head assassin had once heard the word    rictus    and wondered when you should use it correctly to describe someone   s expression  and now he knew .  that was what wonse   s face had become  it was the ghastly rictus of someone trying not to hear the words his own mouth was saying .      we  er  we thought     said the head assassin  very carefully     that the dr   the king  well  must have been arranging matters for himself  over the weeks .         ah  but poor stuff  you know .  poor stuff .  stray animals and so forth     said wonse  staring hard at the tabletop .     obviously  as king  such makeshifts are no longer appropriate .      the silence grew and took on a texture .  the councillors thought hard  especially about the meal they had just eaten .  the arrival of a huge trifle with a lot of cream on it only served to concentrate their minds .      er     said the head merchant     how often is the king hungry .         all the time     said wonse     but it eats once a month .  it is really a ceremonial occasion .         of course     said the head merchant .     it would be .         and  er     said the head assassin     when did the king last  er  eat .         i   m sorry to say it hasn   t eaten properly ever since it came here     said wonse .      oh .         you must understand     said wonse  fiddling desperately with his wooden cutlery     that merely waylaying people like some common assassin             excuse me       the head assassin began .      some common murderer  i mean   there is no   satisfaction there .  the whole essence of the king   s feeding is that it should be  well   an act of bonding between king and subjects .  it is  it is perhaps a living allegory .  reinforcing the close links between the crown and the community     he added .      the precise nature of the meal       the head thief began  almost choking on the words .     are we talking about young maidens here .         sheer prejudice     said wonse .     the age is immaterial .  marital status is  of course  of importance .  and social class .  something to do with flavor  i believe .     he leaned forward  and now his voice was pain filled and urgent and  they felt  genuinely his own for the first time .     please consider it .     he hissed .     after all  just one a month .  in exchange for so much .  the families of people of use to the king  privy councillors such as yourselves  would not  of course  even be considered .  and when you think of all the alternatives        they didn   t think about all the alternatives .  it was enough to think about just one of them .   the silence purred at them as wonse talked .  they avoided one another   s faces  for fear of what they might see mirrored there .  each man thought  one of the others is bound to say something soon  some protest  and then i   ll murmur agreement  not actually say anything  i   m not as stupid as that  but definitely murmur very firmly  so that the others will be in no doubt that i thoroughly disapprove  because at a time like this it behooves all decent men to nearly stand up and be almost heard     but no one said anything .  the cowards  each man thought .   and no one touched the pudding  or the brick thick chocolate mints served afterward .  they just listened in flushed  gloomy horror as wonse   s voice droned on  and when they were dismissed they tried to leave as separately as possible  so that they didn   t have to talk to one another .   except for the head merchant  that is .  he found himself leaving the palace with the chief assassin  and they strolled side by side  minds racing .  the chief merchant tried to look on the bright side  he was one of those men who organize sing songs when things go drastically wrong .      well  well     he said .     so we   re privy councillors now .  just fancy .         hmm     said the assassin .      i wonder what   s the difference between ordinary councillors and privy councillors .     wondered the merchant aloud .   the assassin scowled at him .     i think     he said     it is because you   re expected to eat shit .      he turned the glare back on his feet again .  what kept going through his mind were wonse   s last words  as he shook the secretary   s limp hand .  he wondered if anyone else had heard them .  unlikely   they   d been a shape rather than a sound .  wonse had simply moved his lips around them while staring fixedly at the assassin   s moon tanned face .   help .  me .   the assassin shivered .  why him .  as far as he could see there was only one kind of help he was qualified to give  and very few people ever asked for it for themselves .  in fact  they usually paid large sums for it to be given as a surprise present to other people .  he wondered what was happening to wonse that made any alternative seem better         wonse sat alone in the dark  ruined hall .  waiting .   he could try running .  but it   d find him again .  it   d always be able to find him .  it could smell his mind .     or it would flame him .  that was worse .  just like the brethren .  perhaps it was an instantaneous death  it looked an instantaneous death  but wonse lay awake at night wondering whether those last micro seconds somehow stretched to a subjective  white hot eternity  every tiny part of your body a mere smear of plasma and you  there  alive in the middle of it all     not you .  i would not flame you .   it wasn   t telepathy .  as far as wonse had always understood it  telepathy was like hearing a voice in your head .   this was like hearing a voice in your body .  his whole nervous system twanged to it  like a bow .   rise .   wonse jerked to his feet  overturning the chair and banging his legs on the table .  when that voice spoke  he had as much control over his body as water had over gravity .   come .   wonse lurched across the floor .   the wings unfolded slowly  with the occasional creak  until they filled the hall from side to side .  the tip of one smashed a window  and stuck out into the afternoon air .   the dragon slowly  sensuously  stretched out its neck and yawned .  when it had finished  it brought its head around until it was a few inches in front of wonse   s face .   what does voluntary mean .      it  er  it means doing something of your own free will     said wonse .   but they have no free will .  they will increase my hoard  or i will flame them .   wonse gulped .     yes     he said     but you mustn   t        the silent roar of fury spun him around .   there is nothing i mustn   t .      no  no  no .     squeaked wonse  clutching his head .     i didn   t mean that .  believe me .  this way is better  that   s all .  better and safer .      none can defeat me .      this is certainly the case        none can control me .   wonse flung up his finger spread hands in a conciliatory fashion .     of course  of course     he said .     but there are ways and ways  you know .  ways and ways .  all the roaring and flaming  you see  you don   t need it        foolish ape .  how else can i make them do my bidding .   wonse put his hands behind his back .      they   ll do it of their own free will     he said .     and in time  they   ll come to believe it was their own idea .  it   ll be a tradition .  take it from me .  we humans are adaptable creatures .      the dragon gave him a long  blank stare .      in fact     said wonse  trying to keep the trembling out of his voice     before too long  if someone comes along and tells them that a dragon king is a bad idea  they   ll kill him themselves .      the dragon blinked .   for the first time wonse could remember  it seemed uncertain .      i know people  you see     said wonse  simply .   the dragon continued to pin him with its gaze .   if you are lying   it thought  eventually .      you know i can   t .  not to you .      and they really act like this .      oh  yes .  all the time .  it   s a basic human trait .      wonse knew the dragon could read at least the upper levels of his mind .  they resonated in terrible harmony .  and he could see the mighty thoughts behind the eyes in front of him .     the dragon was horrified .      i   m sorry     said wonse weakly .     that   s just how we are .  it   s all to do with survival  i think .      there will be no mighty warriors sent to kill me .  it thought  almost plaintively .      i don   t think so .      no heroes .      not anymore .  they cost too much .      but i will be eating people .   wonse whimpered .   he felt the sensation of the dragon rummaging around in his mind  trying to find a clue to understanding .  he half saw  half sensed the flicker of random images  of dragons  of the mythical age of reptiles and   and here he felt the dragon   s genuine astonishment   of some of the less commendable areas of human history  which were most of it .  and after the astonishment came the baffled anger .  there was practically nothing the dragon could do to people that they had not  sooner or later  tried on one another  often with enthusiasm .   you have the effrontery to be squeamish  it thought at him .  but we were dragons .  we were supposed to be cruel  cunning  heartless  and terrible .  but this much i can tell you  you ape   the great face pressed even closer  so that wonse was staring into the pitiless depths of his eyes   we never burned and tortured and ripped one another apart and called it morality .   the dragon stretched its wings again  once or twice  and then dropped heavily onto the tawdry assortment of mildly precious things .  its claws scrabbled at the pile .  it sneered .   a three legged lizard wouldn   t hoard this lot  it thought .      there will be better things     whispered wonse  temporarily relieved at the change in direction .     there had better be .      can i       wonse hesitated      can i ask you a question .      ask .      you don   t need to eat people  surely .  i think that   s the only problem from people   s point of view  you see     he added  his voice speeding up to a gabble .     the treasure and everything  that doesn   t have to be a problem  but if it   s just a matter of  well  protein  then perhaps it has occurred to a powerful intellect such as your own that something less controversial  like a cow  might        the dragon breathed a horizontal streak of fire that calcined the opposite wall .   need .  need .  it roared  when the sound had died away .  you talk to me of need .  isn   t it the tradition that the finest flower of womanhood should be sent to the dragon to ensure peace and prosperity .      but  you see  we have always been moderately peaceful and reasonably prosperous        do you want this state of affairs to continue .   the force of the thought drove wonse to his knees .      of course     he managed .   the dragon stretched its claws luxuriantly .   then the need is not mine  it is yours  it thought .   now get out of my sight .   wonse sagged as it left his mind .   the dragon slithered over the cut price hoard  leapt up onto the ledge of one of the hall   s big windows  and smashed the stained glass with its head .  the multicolored image of a city father cascaded into the other debris below .   the long neck stretched out into the early evening air  and turned like a seeking needle .  lights were coming on across the city .  the sound of a million people being alive made a muted  deep thrumming .     the dragon breathed deeply  joyfully .   then it hauled the rest of its body onto the ledge  shouldered the remains of the window   s frame aside  and leapt into the sky .          what is it .     said nobby .   it was vaguely round  of a woodish texture  and when struck made a noise like a ruler plucked over the edge of a desk .   sergeant colon tapped it again .      i give in     he said .   carrot proudly lifted it out of the battered packaging .      it   s a cake     he said  shoving both hands under the thing and raising it with some difficulty .     from my mother .     he managed to put it on the table without trapping his fingers .      can you eat it .     said nobby .     it   s taken months to get here .  you   d think it would go stale .         oh  it   s to a special dwarfish recipe     said carrot .     dwarfish cakes don   t go stale .      sergeant colon gave it another sharp rap .     i suppose not     he conceded .      it   s incredibly sustaining     said carrot .     practically magical .  the secret has been handed down from dwarf to dwarf for centuries .  one tiny piece of this and you won   t want anything to eat all day .         get away .     said colon .      a dwarf can go hundreds of miles with a cake like this in his pack     carrot went on .      i bet he can     said colon gloomily     i bet all the time he   d be thinking     bloody hell  i hope i can find something else to eat soon  otherwise it   s the bloody cake again .         carrot  to whom the word irony meant something to do with metal  picked up his pike and after a couple of impressive rebounds managed to cut the cake into approximately four slices .      there we are     he said cheerfully .     one for each of us  and one for the captain .     he realized what he had said .     oh .  sorry .         yes     said colon flatly .   they sat in silence for a moment .      i liked him     said carrot .     i   m sorry he   s gone .      there was some more silence  very similar to the earlier silence but even deeper and more furrowed with depression .      i expect you   ll be made captain now     said carrot .   colon started .     me .  i don   t want to be captain .  i can   t do the thinking .  it   s not worth all that thinking  just for another nine dollars a month .      he drummed his fingers on the table .      is that all he got .     said nobby .     i thought officers were rolling in it .         nine dollars a month     said colon .     i saw the pay scales once .  nine dollars a month and two dollars plumes allowance .  only he never claimed that bit  funny  really .         he wasn   t the plumes type     said nobby .      you   re right     said colon .     the thing about the captain  see  i read this book once   you know we   ve all got alcohol in our bodies   sort of natural alcohol .  even if you never touch a drop in your life  your body sort of makes it anyway   but captain vimes  see  he   s one of those people whose body doesn   t do it naturally .  like  he was born two drinks below normal .         gosh     said carrot .      yes   so  when he   s sober  he   s really sober .  knurd  they call it .  you know how you feel when you wake up if you   ve been on the piss all night  nobby .  well  he feels like that all the time .           poor bugger     said nobby .     i never realized .  no wonder he   s always so gloomy .         so he   s always trying to catch up  see .  it   s just that he doesn   t always get the dose right .  and  of course       colon glanced at carrot      he was brung low by a woman .  mind you  just about anything brings him low .         so what do we do now  sergeant .     said nobby .      and do you think he   d mind if we eat his cake .     said carrot wistfully .     it   d be a shame to let it go stale .      colon shrugged .   the older men sat in miserable silence as carrot macerated his way through the cake like a bucket wheel rock crusher in a chalk pit .  even if it had been the lightest of souffl  s they wouldn   t have had any appetite .   they were contemplating life without the captain .  it was going to be bleak  even without dragons .  say what you liked about captain vimes  he   d had style .  it was cynical  black nailed style  but he   d had it and they didn   t .  he could read long words and add up .  even that was style  of a sort .  he even got drunk in style .   they   d been trying to drag the minutes out  trying to stretch out the time .  but the night had come .   there was no hope for them .   they were going to have to go out on the streets .   it was six of the clock .  and all wasn   t well .      i miss errol  too     said carrot .      he was the captain   s  really     said nobby .     anyway  lady ramkin   ll know how to look after him .         it   s not as though we could leave anything around  either     said colon .     i mean  even the lamp oil .  he even drank the lamp oil .         and mothballs     said nobby .     a whole box of mothballs .  why would anyone want to eat mothballs .  and the kettle .  and sugar .  he was a devil for sugar .         he was nice  though     said carrot .     friendly .         oh  i   ll grant you     said colon .     but it   s not right  really  a pet where you have to jump behind a table every time it hiccups .         i shall miss his little face     said carrot .   nobby blew his nose  loudly .   it was echoed by a hammering on the door .  colon jerked his head .  carrot got up and opened it .   a couple of members of the palace guard were waiting with arrogant impatience .  they stepped back when they saw carrot  who had to bend a bit to see under the lintel  bad news like carrot travels fast .      we   ve brung you a proclamation     said one of them .     you   ve got to           what   s all that fresh paint on your breastplate .     said carrot politely .  nobby and the sergeant peered around him .      it   s a dragon     said the younger of the guards .      the dragon     corrected his superior .         ere  i know you     said nobby .     you   re skully maltoon .  used to live in mincing street .  your mum made cough sweets  din   t she  and fell in the mixture and died .  i never have a cough sweet but i think of your mum .         hallo  nobby     said the guard  without enthusiasm .      i bet your old mum   d be proud of you  you with a dragon on your vest     said nobby conversationally .  the guard gave him a look made of hatred and embarrassment .      and new plumes on your hat  too     nobby added sweetly .      this here is a proclamation what you are commanded to read     said the guard loudly .     and post up on street corners also .  by order .         whose .     said nobby .     sergeant colon grabbed the scroll in one ham like fist .      where as     he read slowly  tracing the lettering with a hesitant finger     it hathe pleas sed the der rer aa ger   the dragon  ker ii   king of kings and aa ber ess uh ler       sweat beaded on the broad pink cliff of his forehead      absolute  that is  rer uh ler eh rer  ruler of        he lapsed into the tortured silence of academia  his fingertip jerking slowly down the parchment .      no     he said at last .     that   s not right  is it .  it   s not going to eat someone .         consume     said the older guard .      it   s all part of the social   social contract     said his assistant woodenly .     a small price to pay  i   m sure you will agree  for the safety and protection of the city .         from what .     said nobby .     we   ve never had an enemy we couldn   t bribe or corrupt .         until now     said colon darkly .      you catch on fast     said the guard .     so you   re going to broadcast it .  on pain of pain .      carrot peered over colon   s shoulder .      what   s a virgin .     he said .      an unmarried girl     said colon quickly .      what  like my friend reet .     said carrot  horrified .      well  no     said colon .      she   s not married  you know .  none of mrs .  palm   s girls are married .         well  yes     said colon .      well  then     said carrot  with an air of finality .     we   re not having any of that kind of thing  i hope .         people won   t stand for it     said colon .     you mark my words .      the guards stepped back  out of range of carrot   s rising wrath .      they can please themselves     said the senior guard .        but if you don   t proclaim it  you can try explaining things to his majesty .      they hurried off .   nobby darted out into the street .     dragon on your vest .     he shouted .     if your old mum knew about this she   d turn in her vat  you goin    around with a dragon on your vest .      colon wandered back to the table and spread out the scroll .      bad business     he mumbled .      it   s already killed people     said carrot .     contrary to sixteen separate acts in council .         well  yes .  but that was just like  you know  the hurly burly of this and that     said colon .     not that it wasn   t bad  i mean  but people sort of participating  just handing over some slip of a girl and standing around watching as if it   s all proper and legal  that   s much worse .         i reckon it all depends on your point of view     said nobby thoughtfully .      what d   you mean .         well  from the point of view of someone being burned alive  it probably doesn   t matter much     said nobby philosophically .      people won   t stand for it  i said     said colon  ignoring this .     you   ll see .  they   ll march on the palace  and what will the dragon do then  eh .         burn    em all     said nobby promptly .   colon looked puzzled .     it wouldn   t do that  would it .     he said .      don   t see what   s to prevent it  do you .     said nobby .  he glanced out of the doorway .     he was a good lad  that boy .  used to run errands for my grandad .  who   d have thought he   d go around with a dragon on his chest           what are we going to do  sergeant .     said carrot .      i don   t want to be burned alive     said sergeant colon .        my wife   d give me hell .  so i suppose we   ve got to wossname  proclaim it .  but don   t worry  lad     he said  patting carrot on one muscular arm and repeating  as if he hadn   t quite believed himself the first time     it won   t come to that .  people   ll never stand for it .          lady ramkin ran her hands over errol   s body .      damned if i know what   s going on in there     she said .  the little dragon tried to lick her face .     what   s he been eating .         the last thing  i think  was a kettle     said vimes .      a kettle of what .         no .  a kettle .  a black thing with a handle and spout .  he sniffed it for ages  then he ate it .      errol grinned weakly at him  and belched .  they both ducked .      oh  and then we found him eating soot out of the chimney     vimes went on  as their heads rose again over the railings .   they leaned back over the reinforced bunker that was one of lady ramkin   s sickbay pens .  it had to be reinforced .  usually one of the first things a sick dragon did was lose control of its digestive processes .      he doesn   t look sick  exactly     she said .     just fat .         he whines a lot .  and you can sort of see things moving under his skin .  you know what i think .  you know you said they can rearrange their digestive system .         oh  yes .  all the stomachs and pancreatic crackers can be hooked up in various ways  you see .  to take advantage           of whatever they can find to make flame with     said vimes .     yes .  i think he   s trying to make some sort of very hot flame .  he wants to challenge the big dragon .  every time it takes to the air he just sits there whining .           and doesn   t explode .         not that we   ve noticed .  i mean  i   m sure if he did  we   d spot it .         he just eats indiscriminately .         hard to be sure .  he sniffs everything  and eats most things .  two gallons of lamp oil  for example .  anyway  i can   t leave him down there .  we can   t look after him properly .  it   s not as if we need to find out where the dragon is now     he added bitterly .      i think you   re being a bit silly about all this     she said  leading the way back to the house .      silly .  i was sacked in front of all those people .         yes  but it was all a misunderstanding  i   m sure .         i didn   t misunderstand it .         well  i think you   re just upset because you   re impotent .      vimes   s eyes bulged .     whee .     he said .      against the dragon     lady ramkin went on  quite unconcerned .     you can   t do anything about it .         i reckon this damn city and the dragon just about deserve one another     said vimes .      people are frightened .  you can   t expect much of people when they   re so frightened .     she touched him gingerly on his arm .  it was like watching an industrial robot being expertly manipulated to grasp an egg gently .      not everyone   s as brave as you     she added  timidly .      me .         the other week .  when you stopped them killing my dragons .         oh  that .  that   s not bravery .  anyway  that was just people .  people are easier .  i   ll tell you one thing for nothing  i   m not looking up that dragon   s nose again .  i wake up at days thinking about that .         oh .     she seemed deflated .     well  if you   re sure   i   ve got a lot of friends  you know .  if you need any help  you   ve only got to say .  the duke of sto helit is looking for a guard captain  i   m sure .  i   ll write you a letter .  you   ll like them  they   re a very nice young couple .         i   m not sure what i shall do next     said vimes  more gruffly than he intended .     i   m considering one or two offers .         well  of course .  i   m sure you know best .      vimes nodded .   lady ramkin twisted her handkerchief around and around in her hands .      well  then     she said .      well     said vimes .      i  er  expect you   ll be wanting to be off  then .         yes  i expect i had better be going .      there was a pause .  then they both spoke at once .      it   s been very           i   d just like to say           sorry .         sorry .         no  you were speaking .         no  sorry  you were saying .         oh .     vimes hesitated .     i   ll be off  then .         oh .  yes .     lady ramkin gave him a washed out smile .     can   t keep all these offers waiting  can you     she said .   she thrust out a hand .  vimes shook it carefully .      so i   ll just be going  then     he said .      do call again     said lady ramkin  more coldly .     if you are ever in this area .  and so on .  i   m sure errol would like to see you .         yes .  well .  goodbye  then .         goodbye  captain vimes .      he stumbled out of the door and walked hurriedly down the dark  overgrown path .  he could feel her gaze on the back of his neck as he did so or  at least  he told himself that he could .  she   d be standing in the doorway  nearly blocking out the light .  just watching me .  but i   m not going to look back  he thought .  that would be a really silly thing to do .  i mean  she   s a lovely person  she   s got a lot of common sense and an enormous personality  but really     i   m not going to look back  even if she stands there while i walk all the way down the street .  sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind .   so when he heard the door shut when he was only halfway down the drive he suddenly felt very  very angry  as if he had just been robbed .   he stood still and clasped and unclasped his hands in the darkness .  he wasn   t captain vimes anymore  he was citizen vimes  which meant that he could do things he   d once never dreamed of doing .  perhaps he could go and smash some windows .   no  that wouldn   t be any good .  he wanted more than that .  to get rid of that bloody dragon  to get his job back  to get his hands on whoever was behind all this  to forget himself just once and hit someone until he was exhausted     he stared at nothing .  down below the city was a mass of smoke and steam .  he wasn   t thinking of that  though .   he was thinking of a running man .  and  further back in the fuddled mists of his life  a boy running to keep up .   and under his breath he said     any of them get out .          sergeant colon finished the proclamation and looked around at the hostile crowd .      don   t blame me     he said .     i just read the things .  i don   t write    em .         that   s a human sacrifice  that is     said someone .      there   s nothing wrong with human sacrifice     said a priest .      ah  per say     said the first speaker quickly .     for proper religious reasons .  and using condemned criminals and so on .   but that   s different from bunging someone to a dragon just because it   s feeling peckish .         that   s the spirit .     said sergeant colon .      taxes is one thing  but eating people is another .         well said .         if we all say we won   t put up with it  what can the dragon do .      nobby opened his mouth .  colon clamped a hand over it and raised a triumphant fist in the air .      it   s just what i   ve always said     he said .     the people united can never be ignited .      there was a ragged cheer .      hang on a minute     said a small man  slowly .     as far as we know  the dragon   s only good at one thing .  it flies around the city setting fire to people .  i   m not actually certain what is being proposed that would stop it doing this .         yes  but if we all protest       said the first speaker  his voice modulated with uncertainty .      it can   t burn everybody     said colon .  he decided to play his new ace again and added  proudly     the people united can never be ignited .     there was rather less of a cheer this time .  people were reserving their energy for worrying .      i   m not exactly sure i understand why not .  why can   t it burn everyone and fly off to another city .         because           the hoard     said colon .     it needs people to bring it treasure .         yeah .           well  maybe  but how many  exactly .         what .         how many people .  out of the whole city  i mean .  perhaps it won   t need to burn the whole city down  just some bits .  do we know what bits .         look  this is getting silly     said the first speaker .     if we go around looking at the problems the whole time  we   ll never do anything .         it just pays to think things through first  that   s all i   m saying .  such as  what happens even if we beat the dragon .         oh  come on .     said sergeant colon .      no  seriously .  what   s the alternative .         a human being  for a start .         please yourself     said the little man primly .     but i reckon one person a month is pretty good compared to some rulers we   ve had .  anyone remember nersh the lunatic .  or giggling lord smince and his laugh a minute dungeon .      there was a certain amount of mumbling of the    he   s got a point    variety .      but they got overthrown .     said colon .      no they didn   t .  they were assassinated .         same thing     said colon .     i mean  no one   s going to assassinate the dragon .  it   d take more than a dark night and a sharp knife to see it off  i know that .      i can see what the captain means  he thought .  no wonder he always has a drink after he thinks about things .  we always beat ourselves before we even start .  give any ankh morpork man a big stick and he   ll end up clubbing himself to death .      look here  you mealy mouthed little twerp     said the first speaker  picking up the little one by his collar and curling his free hand into a fist     i happen to have three daughters  and i happen to not want any of them et  thank you very much .           yes  and the people united   will   never   be        colon   s voice faltered .  he realized that the rest of the crowd were all staring upward .   the bugger  he thought  as rationality began to drain away .  it must have flannel feet .   the dragon shifted its position on the ridge of the nearest house  flapped its wings once or twice  yawned  and then stretched its neck down into the street .   the man blessed with daughters stood  with his fist upraised  in the center of a rapidly expanding circle of bare cobbles .  the little man wriggled out of his frozen grasp and darted into the shadows .   it suddenly seemed that no man in the entire world was so lonely and without friends .      i see     he said quietly .  he scowled up at the inquisitive reptile .  in fact it didn   t seem particularly belligerent .  it was looking at him with something approaching interest .      i don   t care .     he shouted  his voice echoing from wall to wall in the silence .     we defy you .  if you kill me  you might as well kill all of us .      there was some uneasy shuffling of feet among those sections of the crowd who didn   t feel that this was absolutely axiomatic .      we can resist you  you know .     growled the man .     can   t we  everyone .  what was that slogan about being united  sergeant .         er     said colon  feeling his spine turn to ice .      i warn you  dragon  the human spirit is        they never found out what it was  or at least what he thought it was  although possibly in the dark hours of a sleepless night some of them might have remembered the subsequent events and formed a pretty good and gut churning insight  to whit  that one of the things sometimes forgotten about the human spirit is that while it is  in the right conditions  noble and brave and wonderful  it is also  when you get right down to it  only human .   the dragon flame caught him full on the chest .  for a moment he was visible as a white hot outline before the neat  black remains spiraled down into a little puddle of melting cobbles .   the flame vanished .   the crowd stood like statues  not knowing if it was staying put or running that would attract more attention .   the dragon stared down  curious to see what they were going to do next .   colon felt that  as the only civic official present  it was up to him to take charge of the situation .  he coughed .      right  then     he said  trying to keep the squeak out of his voice .     if you would just move along there  ladies and gentlemen .  move along  now .  move along .  let   s be having you  please .      he waved his arms in a vague gesture of authority as the people shuffled nervously away .  out of the corner of his eye he saw red flames behind the rooftops  and sparks spiraling in the sky .      haven   t you got any homes to go to .     he croaked .       the librarian knuckled out into the library of the here and now .  every hair on his body bristled with rage .   he pushed open the door and swung out into the stricken city .   someone out there was about to find that their worst nightmare was a maddened librarian .   with a badge .       the dragon swooped leisurely back and forth over the nighttime city  barely flapping its wings .  it didn   t need to .  the thermals were giving it the lift it needed .     there were fires all over ankh morpork .  so many bucket chains had formed between the river and various burning buildings that buckets were getting misdirected and hijacked .  not that you really needed a bucket to pick up the turbid waters of the river ankh   a net was good enough .   downstream  teams of smoke stained people worked feverishly to close the huge  corroded gates under the brass bridge .  they were ankh morpork   s last defense against fire  since then the ankh had no outlet and gradually  oozingly  filled the space between the walls .  a man could suffocate under it .   the workers on the bridge were the ones who couldn   t or wouldn   t run .  many others were teeming through the gates of the city and heading out across the chilly  mist wreathed plains .   but not for long .  the dragon  looping and curving gracefully above the devastation  glided out over the walls .  after a few seconds the guards saw actinic fire stab down through the mists .  the tide of humanity flowed back  with the dragon hovering over it like a sheepdog .  the fires of the stricken city glowed redly off the underside of its wings .      got any suggestions about what we do next  sergeant .     said nobby .   colon didn   t reply .  i wish captain vimes were here  he thought .  he wouldn   t have known what to do either  but he   s got a much better vocabulary to be baffled in .   some of the fires went out as the rising waters and the confused tangle of fire chains did their work .  the dragon didn   t appear to be inclined to start anymore .  it had made its point .      i wonder who it   ll be     said nobby .      what .     said carrot .      the sacrifice  i mean .           sergeant said people wouldn   t put up with it     said carrot stoically .      yeah  well .  look at it this way  if you say to people  what   s it to be  either your house burned down around you or some girl you   ve probably never met being eaten  well  they might get a bit thoughtful .  human nature  see .         i   m sure a hero will turn up in time     said carrot .     with some new sort of weapon  or something .  and strike at its voonerable spot .      there was the silence of sudden intense listening .      what   s one of them .     said nobby .      a spot .  where it   s voonerable .  my grandad used to tell me stories .  hit a dragon in its voonerables  he said  and you   ve killed it .         like kicking it in the wossnames .     said nobby  interestedly .      dunno .  i suppose so .  although  nobby  i   ve told you before it is not right to           and where   s the spot  like .         oh  a different place on each dragon .  you wait till it flies over and then you say  there   s the voonerable spot  and then you kill it     said carrot .     something like that .      sergeant colon stared blankly into space .      hmm     said nobby .   they watched the panorama of panic for a while .  then sergeant colon said     you sure about the voonerables .         yes .  oh  yes .         i wish you hadn   t been  lad .      they looked at the terrified city again .      you know     said nobby     you always told me you used to win prizes for archery in the army  sergeant .  you said you had a lucky arrow  you always made sure you got your lucky arrow back  you said you             all right .  all right .  but this isn   t the same thing  is it .  anyway  i   m not a hero .  why should i do it .         captain vimes pays us thirty dollars a month     said carrot .      yes     said nobby  grinning  and you get five dollars extra responsibility allowance .         but captain vimes has gone     said colon wretchedly .   carrot looked at him sternly .     i am sure     he said     that if he were here  he   d be the first to        colon waved him into silence .     that   s all very well     he said .     but what if i miss .         look on the bright side     said nobby .     you   ll probably never know it .      sergeant colon   s expression mutated into an evil  desperate grin .     we   ll never know it  you mean     he said .      what .         if you think i   m standing on some rooftop on my tod  you can think again .  i order you to accompany me .  anyway     he added     you get one dollar responsibility allowance  too .      nobby   s face twisted in panic .     no i don   t .     he croaked .     captain vimes said he was docking it for five years for being a disgrace to the species .         well  you might just get it back .  anyway  you know all about voonerables .  i   ve watched you fight .      carrot saluted smartly .     permission to volunteer  sir     he said .     and i only get twenty dollars a month training pay an i don   t mind at all  sir .      sergeant colon cleared his throat .  then he straightened the hang of his breastplate .  it was one of those with astonishingly impressive pectoral muscles embossed upon it .  his chest and stomach fitted into it in the same way that jelly fits into a mold .     what would captain vimes do now .  well  he   d have a drink .  but if he didn   t have a drink  what would he do .      what we need     he said slowly     is a plan .      that sounded good .  that sentence alone sounded worth the pay .  if you had a plan  you were halfway there .   and already he thought he could hear the cheering of crowds .  they were lining the streets  and they were throwing flowers  and he was being carried triumphantly through the grateful city .   the drawback was  he suspected  that he was being carried in an urn .       lupine wonse padded along the drafty corridors to the patrician   s bedroom .  it had never been a sumptuous apartment at best  and contained little more than a narrow bed and a few battered cupboards .  it looked even worse now  with one wall gone .  sleepwalk at night now and you could step right into the vast cavern that was the great hall .   even so  he shut the door behind him for a semblance of privacy .  then  cautiously and with many nervous glances at the great space beyond  he knelt down in the center of the floor and pried up a board .   a long black robe was dragged into view .  then wonse reached further down into the dusty space between the floors and rummaged around .  he rummaged still further .  then he lay down and stuck both arms into the gap and flailed desperately .   a book sailed across the room and hit him in the back of the head .      looking for this  were you .     said vimes .   he stepped out of the shadows .   wonse was on his knees  his mouth opening and shutting .   what   s he going to say  vimes thought .  is it going to be  i know what this looks like  or will it be  how did you get in here  or maybe it   ll be  listen  i can explain everything .  i wish i had a loaded dragon in my hands right now .   wonse said     okay .  clever of you to guess .      of course  that was always an outside chance  vimes added .      under the floorboards     he said aloud .     first place anyone   d look .  rather foolish  that was .         i know .  i suppose he didn   t think anyone would be searching     said wonse  standing up and brushing the dust off himself .      i   m sorry .     said vimes pleasantly .      vetinari .  you know how he was for scheming and things .  he was involved in most of the plots against himself  that was how he ran things .  he enjoyed it .  obviously he called it up and couldn   t control it .  something even more cunning than he was .         so what were you doing .     said vimes .      i wondered if it might be possible to reverse the spell .  or maybe call up another dragon .  they   d fight then .         a sort of balance of terror  you mean .     said vimes .      could be worth a try     said wonse earnestly .  he took a few steps closer .     look  about your job  i know we were both a bit overwrought at the time  so of course if you want it back there   ll be no prob           it must have been terrible     said vimes .     imagine what must have gone through his mind .  he called it up  and then found it wasn   t just some sort of tool but a real thing with a mind of its own .  a mind just like his  but with all the brakes off .  you know  i wouldn   t mind betting that at the start he really thought that what he was doing was all for the best .  he must have been insane .  sooner or later  anyway .         yes     said wonse hoarsely .     it must have been terrible .         ye gods  but i   d like to get my hands on him .  all those years i   ve known the man  and i   d never realized          wonse said nothing .      run     said vimes softly .      what .         run .  i want to see you run .         i don   t underst           i saw someone run away  the night the dragon flamed that house .  i remember thinking at the time that he moved in a funny way  sort of bounding along .  and then the other day i saw you running away from the dragon .  could almost have been the same man  i thought .  skipping  almost .  like someone running to keep up .  any of them get out  wonse .      wonse waved a hand in what he might have thought was a nonchalant way .     that   s just ridiculous  that   s not proof     he said .      i noticed you sleep in here now     said vimes .     i suppose the king likes to have you handy  does he .         you   ve got no proof at all     whispered wonse .      of course  i haven   t .  the way someone runs .  the eager tone of voice .  that   s all .  but that doesn   t matter  does it .  because it wouldn   t matter even if i did have proof     said vimes .     there   s no one to take it to .  and you can   t give me my job back .         i can .     said wonse .     i can  and you needn   t just be captain           you can   t give me my job back     repeated vimes .     it was never yours to take away .  i was never an officer of the city  or an officer of the king  or an officer of the patrician .  i was an officer of the law .  it might have been corrupted and bent  but it was law  of a sort .  there isn   t any law now except     you   ll get burned alive if you don   t watch out .     where   s the place in there for me .      wonse darted forward and grabbed him by the arm .      but you can help me .     he said .     there may be a way to destroy the dragon  d   you see  or at least we can help people  channel things to mitigate the worst of it  somehow find a meeting point        vimes   s blow caught wonse on the cheek and spun him around .      the dragon   s here     he snapped .     you can   t channel it or persuade it or negotiate with it .  there   s no truce with dragons .  you brought it here and we   re stuck with it  you bastard .      wonse lowered his hand from the bright white mark where the punch had connected .      what are you going to do .     he said .   vimes didn   t know .  he   d thought of a dozen ways that the thing could go  but the only one that was really suitable was killing wonse .  and  face to face  he couldn   t do it .      that   s the trouble with people like you     said wonse  getting up .     you   re always against anything attempted for the betterment of mankind  but you never have any proper plans of your own .  guards .  guards .      he grinned maniacally at vimes .      didn   t expect that  did you .     he said .     we   ve still got guards here  you know .  not so many  of course .  not many people want to come in .      there were footsteps in the passage outside and four of the palace guards padded in  swords drawn .      i wouldn   t put up a fight  if i were you     wonse went on .     they   re desperate and uneasy men .  but very highly paid .      vimes said nothing .  wonse was a gloater .  you always stood a chance with gloaters .  the old patrician had never been a gloater  you could say that for him .  if he wanted you dead  you never even heard about it .   the thing to do with gloaters was play the game according to the rules .      you   ll never get away with it     he said .        you   re right .  you   re absolutely right .  but never is a long time     said wonse .     none of us get away with anything for that long .         you shall have some time to reflect on this     he said and nodded to the guards .     throw him in the special dungeon .  and then go about that other little task .         er     said the leader of the guards  and hesitated .      what   s the matter  man .         you  er  want us to attack him .     said the guard miserably .  thick though the palace guard were  they were as aware as everyone else of the conventions  and when guards are summoned to deal with one man in overheated circumstances it   s not a good time for them .  the bugger   s bound to be heroic  he was thinking .  this guard was not looking forward to a future in which he was dead .      of course  you idiot .         but  er  there   s only one of him     said the guard captain .      and he   s smilin        said a man behind him .      prob   ly goin    to swing on the chandeliers any minute     said one of his colleagues .     and kick over the table  and that .         he   s not even armed .     shrieked wonse .      worst kind  that     said one of the guards  with deep stoicism .     they leap up  see  and grab one of the ornamental swords behind the shield over the fireplace .         yeah     said another  suspiciously .     and then they chucks a chair at you .         there   s no fireplace .  there   s no sword .  there   s only him .  now take him .     screamed wonse .   a couple of guards grabbed vimes tentatively by the shoulders .      you   re not going to do anything heroic  are you .     whispered one of them .      wouldn   t know where to start     he said .        oh .  right .      as vimes was hauled away he heard wonse breaking into insane laughter .  they always did  your gloaters .   but he was correct about one thing .  vimes didn   t have a plan .  he hadn   t thought much about what was going to happen next .  he   d been a fool  he told himself  to think that you just had a confrontation and that was the end of it .   he also wondered what the other task was .   the palace guards said nothing  but stared straight ahead and marched him down  across the ruined hall  and through the wreckage of another corridor to an ominous door .  they opened it  threw him in  and marched away .   and no one  absolutely no one  noticed the thin  leaf like thing that floated gently down from the shadows of the roof  tumbling over and over in the air like a sycamore seed  before landing in the tangled gewgaws of the hoard .   it was a peanut shell .       it was the silence that awoke lady ramkin .  her bedroom looked out over the dragon pens  and she was used to sleeping to the susurration of rustling scales  the occasional roar of a dragon flaming in its sleep  and the keening of the gravid females .  absence of any sound at all was like an alarm clock .   she had cried a bit before going to sleep  but not much  because it was no use being soppy and letting the side down .  she lit the lamp  pulled on her rubber boots  grabbed the stick which might be all that stood between her and theoretical loss of virtue  and hurried down through the shadowy house .  as she crossed the damp lawn to the kennels she was vaguely aware that something was happening down in the city  but dismissed it as not currently worth thinking about .  dragons were more important .   she pushed open the door .     well  they were still there .  the familiar stink of swamp dragons  half pond mud and half chemical explosion  gusted out into the night .   each dragon was balancing on its hind legs in the center of its pen  neck arched  staring with ferocious intensity at the roof .      oh     she said .     flying around up there again  is it .  showing off .  don   t you worry about it  children .  mummy   s here .      she put the lamp on a high shelf and stamped along to errol   s pen .      well now  my lad     she began  and stopped .   errol was stretched out on his side .  a thin plume of gray smoke was drifting from his mouth  and his stomach expanded and contracted like a bellows .  and his skin from the neck down was an almost pure white .      i think if i ever rewrite diseases you   ll get a whole chapter all to yourself     she said quietly  and unbolted the gate of the pen .     let   s see if that nasty temperature has gone down  shall we .      she reached out to stroke his skin and gasped .  she pulled the hand back hurriedly and watched the blisters form on her fingertips .   errol was so cold he burned .   as she stared at him the small around marks that her warmth had melted filmed over with frozen air .   lady ramkin sat back on her haunches .      just what kind of dragon are you    .     she began .   there was the distant sound of a knock at the front door of the house .  she hesitated for a moment  then blew out the lamp  crept heavily along the length of the kennels and pulled aside the scrap of sacking over the window .   the first light of dawn showed her the silhouette of a guardsman on her doorstep  the plumes of his helmet blowing in the breeze .   she bit her lip in panic  scuttled back to the door  fled across the lawn and dived into the house  taking the stairs three at a time .      stupid  stupid     she muttered  realizing the lamp was back downstairs .  but no time for that .  by the time she went and got it  vimes might have gone away .   working by feel and memory in the gloom she found her best wig and rammed it on her head .  somewhere among the ointments and dragon remedies on her dressing table was something called  as far as she could remember  dew of the night or some such unsuitable name  a present long ago from a thoughtless nephew .  she tried several bottles before she found something that  by the smell of it  was probably the one .  even to a nose which had long ago shut down most of its sensory apparatus in the face of the overpoweringness of dragons  it seemed  well  more potent than she remembered .  but apparently men liked that kind of thing .  or so she had read .  damn nonsense  really .  she twitched the top hem of her suddenly far too sensible nightshirt into a position which  she hoped  revealed without actually exposing  and hurried back down the stairs .   she stopped in front of the door  took a deep breath  twisted the handle and realized even as she pulled the door open that she should have taken the rubber boots off        why  captain     she said winsomely     this is a who the hell are you .      the head of the palace guard took several steps backward and  because he was of peasant stock  made a few surreptitious signs to ward off evil spirits .  they clearly didn   t work .  when he opened his eyes again the thing was still there  still bristling with rage  still reeking of something sickly and fermented  still crowned with a skewed mass of curls  still looming behind a quivering bosom that made the roof of his mouth go dry     he   d heard about these sort of things .  harpies  they were called .  what had it done with lady ramkin .   the sight of the rubber boots had him confused  though .  legends about harpies were short on references to rubber boots .      out with it  fellow     lady ramkin boomed  hitching up her nightie to a more respectable neckline .     don   t just stand there opening and shutting your mouth .  what d   you want .         lady sybil ramkin .     said the guard  not in the polite way of someone seeking mere confirmation but in the incredulous tones of someone who found it very hard to believe the answer could be    yes .         use your eyes  young man .  who d   you think i am .      the guard pulled himself together .      only i   ve got a summons for lady sybil ramkin     he said uncertainly .   her voice was withering .     what do you mean  a summons .         to attend upon the palace  you see .         i can   t imagine why that is necessary at this time in the morning     she said  and made to slam the door .  it wouldn   t shut  though  because of the sword point jammed into it at the last moment .      if you don   t come     said the guard     i have been ordered to take steps .      the door shot back and her face pressed against his  almost knocking him unconscious with the scent of rotting rose petals .      if you think you   ll lay a hand on me       she began .     the guard   s glance darted sideways  just for a moment  to the dragon kennels .  sybil ramkin   s face went pale .      you wouldn   t .     she hissed .   he swallowed .  fearsome though she was  she was only human .  she could only bite your head off metaphorically .  there were  he told himself  far worse things than lady ramkin although  admittedly  they weren   t three inches from his nose at this point in time .      take steps     he repeated  in a croak .   she straightened up  and eyed the row of guards behind him .      i see     she said coldly .     that   s the way  is it .  six of you to fetch one feeble woman .  very well .  you will  of course  allow me to fetch a coat .  it is somewhat chilly .      she slammed the door .   the palace guards stamped their feet in the cold and tried not to look at one another .  this obviously wasn   t the way you went around arresting people .  they weren   t allowed to keep you waiting on the doorstep  this wasn   t the way the world was supposed to work .  on the other hand  the only alternative was to go in there and drag her out  and it wasn   t one anyone could summon any enthusiasm for .  besides  the guard captain wasn   t sure he had enough men to drag lady ramkin anywhere .  you   d need teams of thousands  with log rollers .   the door creaked open again  revealing only the musty darkness of the hall within .      right  men       said the captain  uneasily .   lady ramkin appeared .  he got a brief  blurred vision of her bounding through the doorway  screaming  and it might well have been the last thing he remembered if a guard hadn   t had the presence of mind to trip her up as she hurtled down the steps .  she plunged forward  cursing  plowed into the overgrown lawn  hit her head on a crumbling statue of an antique ramkin  and slid to a halt .   the double handed broadsword she had been holding landed beside her  bolt upright  and vibrated to a standstill .   after a while one of the guards crept forward cautiously and tested the blade with his finger .      bloody hell     he said  in a voice of mixed horror and respect .     and the dragon wants to eat her .         fits the bill     said the captain .     she   s got to be the highest born lady in the city .  i don   t know about maiden     he added     and right at this minute i   m not going to speculate .  someone go and fetch a cart .      he fingered his ear  which had been nicked by the tip of the sword .  he was not  by nature  an unkind man  but at this moment he was certain that he would prefer the thickness of a dragon   s hide between himself and sybil ramkin when she woke up .      weren   t we supposed to kill her pet dragons  sir .     said another guard .     i thought mr .  wonse said something about killing all the dragons .         that was just a threat we were supposed to make     said the captain .   the guard   s brow furrowed .     you sure  sir .  i thought        the captain had had enough of this .  screaming harpies and broadswords making a noise like tearing silk in the air beside him had severely ruined his capacity for seeing the other fellow   s point of view .      oh  you thought  did you .     he growled .     a thinker  are you .  do you think you   d be suitable for another posting  then .  city guard  maybe .  they   re full of thinkers  they are .      there was an uncomfortable titter from the rest of the guards .      if you   d thought     added the captain sarcastically     you   d have thought that the king is hardly going to want other dragons dead  is he .  they   re probably distant relatives or something .  i mean  it wouldn   t want us to go around killing its own kind  would it .         well  sir  people do  sir     said the guard sulkily .      ah  well     said the captain .     that   s different .     he tapped the side of his helmet meaningfully .     that   s    cos we   re intelligent .          vimes landed in damp straw and also in pitch darkness  although after a while his eyes became accustomed to the gloom and he could make out the walls of the dungeon .   it hadn   t been built for gracious living .  it was basically just a space containing all the pillars and arches that supported the palace .  at the far end a small grille high on the wall let in a mere suspicion of grubby  secondhand light .   there was another square hole in the floor .  it was also barred .  the bars were quite rusty  though .  it occurred to vimes that he could probably work them loose eventually  and then all he would have to do was slim down enough to go through a nine inch hole .   what the dungeon did not contain was any rats  scorpions  cockroaches or snakes .  it had once contained snakes  it was true  because vimes   s sandals crunched on small  long white skeletons .   he crept cautiously along one damp wall  wondering where the rhythmic scraping sound was coming from .  he rounded a squat pillar  and found out .   the patrician was shaving  squinting into a scrap of mirror propped against the pillar to catch the light .  no  vimes realized  not propped .  supported  in fact .  by a rat .  it was a large rat  with red eyes .   the patrician nodded to him without apparent surprise .      oh     he said .     vimes  isn   t it .  i heard you were on the way down .  jolly good .  you had better tell the kitchen staff       and here vimes realized that the man was speaking to the rat      that there will be two for lunch .  would you like a beer  vimes .         what .     said vimes .      i imagine you would .  pot luck  though  i am afraid .  skrp   s people are bright enough  but they seem to have a bit of a blind spot when it comes to labels on bottles .      lord vetinari patted his face with a towel and dropped it on the floor .  a gray shape darted from the shadows and dragged it away down the floor grille .   then he said     very well  skrp .  you may go .     the rat twitched its whiskers at him  leaned the mirror against the wall  and trotted off .      you   re waited on by rats .     said vimes .      they help out  you know .  they   re not really very efficient  i   m afraid .  it   s their paws .         but  but  but     said vimes .     i mean  how .         i suspect skrp   s people have tunnels that extend into the university     lord vetinari went on .     although i think they were probably pretty bright to start with .      at least vimes understood that bit .  it was well known that thaumic radiations affected animals living around the unseen university campus  sometimes prodding them toward minute analogues of human civilization and even mutating some of them into entirely new and specialized species  such as the  .     bookworm and the wallfish .  and  as the man said  rats were quite bright to start with .      but they   re helping you .     said vimes .      mutual .  it   s mutual .  payment for services rendered  you might say     said the patrician  sitting down on what vimes couldn   t help noticing was a small velvet cushion .  on a low shelf  so as to be handy  were a notepad and a neat row of books .      how can you help rats  sir .     he said weakly .        advice .  i advise them  you know .     the patrician leaned back .     that   s the trouble with people like wonse     he said .     they never know when to stop .  rats  snakes and scorpions .  it was sheer bedlam in here when i came .  the rats were getting the worst of it  too .      and vimes thought he was beginning to get the drift .      you mean you sort of trained them .     he said .      advised .  advised .  i suppose it   s a knack     said lord vetinari modestly .   vimes wondered how it was done .  did the rats side with the scorpions against the snakes and then  when the snakes were beaten  invite the scorpions to a celebratory slap up meal and eat them .  or were individual scorpions hired with large amounts of  oh  whatever it was scorpions ate  to sidle up to selected leading snakes at night and sting them .   he remembered hearing once about a man who  locked up in a cell for years  trained little birds and created a sort of freedom .  and he thought of ancient sailors  shorn of the sea by old age and infirmity  who spent their days making big ships in little bottles .   then he thought of the patrician  robbed of his city  sitting cross legged on the gray floor in the dim dungeon and recreating it around him  encouraging in miniature all the little rivalries  power struggles and factions .  he thought of him as a somber  brooding statue amid paving stones alive with slinking shadows and sudden  political death .  it had probably been easier than ruling ankh  which had larger vermin who didn   t have to use both hands to carry a knife .   there was a clink over by the drain .  half a dozen rats appeared  dragging something wrapped in a cloth .  they rathandled it past the grille and  with great effort  hauled it to the patrician   s feet .  he leaned down and undid the knot .      we seem to have cheese  chicken legs  celery  a piece of rather stale bread and a nice bottle  oh  a nice bottle apparently of merckle and stingbat   s very famous brown sauce .  beer  i said  skrp .     the leading rat twitched its nose at him .     sorry about this  vimes .  they can   t read  you see .  they don   t seem to get the hang of the concept .  but they   re very good at listening .  they bring me all the news .         i see you   re very comfortable here     said vimes weakly .      never build a dungeon you wouldn   t be happy to spend the night in yourself     said the patrician  laying out the food on the cloth .     the world would be a happier place if more people remembered that .         we all thought you had built secret tunnels and such like     said vimes .      can   t imagine why     said the patrician .     one would have to keep on running .  so inefficient .  whereas here i am at the hub of things .  i hope you understand that  vimes .  never trust any ruler who puts his faith in tunnels and bunkers and escape routes .  the chances are that his heart isn   t in the job .         oh .      he   s in a dungeon in his own palace with a raving lunatic in charge upstairs  and a dragon burning the city  and he thinks he   s got the world where he wants it .  it must be something about high office .  the altitude sends people mad .      you  er  you don   t mind if i have a look around  do you .     he said .      feel free     said the patrician .   vimes paced the length of the dungeon and checked the door .  it was heavily barred and bolted  and the lock was massive .   then he tapped the walls in what might possibly be hollow places .  there was no doubt that it was a well built dungeon .  it was the kind of dungeon you   d feel good about having dangerous criminals put in .  of course  in those circumstances you   d prefer there to be no trapdoors  hidden tunnels or secret ways of escape .   these weren   t those circumstances .  it was amazing what several feet of solid stone did to your sense of perspective .      do guards come in here .     he demanded .      hardly ever     said the patrician  waving a chicken leg .     they don   t bother about feeding me  you see .  the idea is that one should molder .  in fact     he said     up    til recently i used to go to the door and groan a bit every now and then  just to keep them happy .         they   re bound to come in and check  though .     said vimes hopefully .      oh  i don   t think we should tolerate that     said the patrician .      how are you going to prevent them .      lord vetinari gave him a pained look .      my dear vimes     he said     i thought you were an observant man .  did you look at the door .         of course i did     said vimes  and added     sir .  it   s bloody massive .         perhaps you should have another look .      vimes gaped at him  and then stamped across the floor and glared at the door .  it was one of the popular dread portal variety  all bars and bolts and iron spikes and massive hinges .  no matter how long he looked at it  it didn   t become any less massive .  the lock was one of those dwarfish made buggers that it   d take years to pick .  all in all  if you had to have a symbol for something totally immovable  that door was your man .   the patrician appeared alongside him in heart stopping silence .      you see     he said     it   s always the case  is it not  that should a city be overtaken by violent civil unrest the current ruler is thrown into the dungeons .  to a certain type of mind that is so much more satisfying than mere execution .         well  okay  but i don   t see       vimes began .      and you look at this door and what you see is a really strong cell door  yes .         of course .  you   ve only got to look at the bolts and           you know  i   m really rather pleased     said lord vetinari quietly .   vimes stared at the door until his eyebrows ached .  and then  just as random patterns in cloud suddenly  without changing in any way  become a horse   s head or a sailing ship  he saw what he   d been looking at all along .   a sense of terrifying admiration overcame him .   he wondered what it was like in the patrician   s mind .  all cold and shiny  he thought  all blued steel and icicles and little wheels clicking along like a huge clock .  the kind of mind that would carefully consider its own downfall and turn it to advantage .   it was a perfectly normal dungeon door  but it all depended on your sense of perspective .   in this dungeon the patrician could hold off the world .   all that was on the outside was the lock .   all the bolts and bars were on the inside .       the rank clambered awkwardly across the damp rooftops as the morning mist was boiled off by the sun .  not that there would be any clear air today   sticky swathes of smoke and stale steam wreathed the city and filled the air with the sad smell of dampened cinders .      what is this place .     said carrot  helping the others along a greasy walkway .   sergeant colon looked around at the forest of chimneys .      we   re just above jimkin bearhugger   s whiskey distillery     he said .     on a direct line  see  between the palace and the plaza .  it   s bound to fly over here .      nobby looked wistfully over the side of the building .      i bin in there once     he said .     checked the door one dark night and it just come open in my hand .         eventually  i expect     said colon sourly .      well  i had to go in  din   t i  to check there was no miscreanting going on .  amazing place in there .  all pipes and stuff .  and the smell .            every bottle matured for up to seven minutes        quoted colon .        ha    a drop afore ye go     it says on the label .  damn right  too .  i had a drop once  and i went all day .      he knelt down and unwrapped the long sacking package he had been manhandling  with extreme difficulty  during the climb .  this revealed a longbow of ancient design and a quiver of arrows .   he picked up the bow slowly  reverentially  and ran his pudgy fingers along it .      you know     he said quietly     i was damn good with this  when i were a lad .  the captain should of let me have a go the other night .         you keep on telling us     said nobby unsympathetically .      well  i used to win prizes .     the sergeant unwound a new bowstring  looped it around one end of the bow  stood up  pressed down  grunted a bit        er .  carrot .     he said  slightly out of breath .      yes  sarge .         you any good at stringing bows .      carrot grasped the bow  compressed it easily  and slipped the other end of the string into place .      that   s a good start  sarge     said nobby .      don   t you be sarcastic with me  nobby .  it ain   t strength  it   s keenness of eye and steadiness of hand what counts .  now you pass me an arrow .  not that one .      nobby   s fingers froze in the act of grasping a shaft .      that   s my lucky arrow .     spluttered colon .     none of you is to touch my lucky arrow .         looks just like any other bloody arrow to me  sarge     said nobby mildly .      that   s the one i shall use for the actual wossname  the coup de grass     said colon .     never let me down  my lucky arrow didn   t .  hit whatever i shot at .  hardly even had to aim .  if that dragon   s got any voonerables  that arrow   ll find    em .      he selected an identical looking but presumably less lucky arrow and nocked it .  then he looked around the rooftops with a speculative eye .      better get my hand in     he muttered .     of course  once you learn you never forget  it   s like riding a   riding a   riding something you never forget being able to ride .      he pulled the bowstring back to his ear  and grunted .      right     he wheezed  as his arm trembled with the tension like a branch in a gale .     see the roof of the assassins    guild over there .      they peered through the grubby air .      right  then     said colon .     and do you see the weathervane on it .  do you see it .      carrot glanced at the arrowhead .  it was weaving back and forth in a series of figure eights .      it   s a long way off  sarge     said nobby doubtfully .      never you mind me  you keep an eye on the weathervane     groaned the sergeant .   they nodded .  the weathervane was in the shape of a creeping man with a big cloak  his outstretched dagger was always turned to stab the wind .  at this distance  though  it was tiny .        okay     panted colon .     now  d   you see the man   s eye .         oh  come on     said nobby .      shutup  shutup  shutup .     groaned colon .     do you see it  i said .         i think i can see it  sarge     said carrot loyally .      right .  right     said the sergeant  swaying backward and forward with effort .     right .  good lad .  okay .  now keep an eye on it  right .      he grunted  and loosed the arrow .   several things happened so fast that they will have to be recounted in stop motion prose .  probably the first was the bowstring slapping into the soft inner part of colon   s wrist  causing him to scream and drop the bow .  this had no effect on the path of the arrow  which was already flying straight and true toward a gargoyle on the rooftop just across the road .  it hit it on the ear  bounced  ricocheted off a wall six feet away  and headed back toward colon apparently at a slightly increased speed  going past his ear with a silky humming noise .   it vanished in the direction of the city walls .   after a while nobby coughed and gave carrot a look of innocent enquiry .      about how big     he said     is a dragon   s voonerables  roughly .         oh  it can be a tiny spot     said carrot helpfully .      i was sort of afraid of that     said nobby .  he wandered to the edge of the roof  and pointed downward .     there   s a pond just here     he said .     they use it for cooling water in the stills .  i reckon it   s pretty deep  so after the sergeant has shot at the dragon we can jump in it .  what d   you say .         oh  but we don   t need to do that     said carrot .     because the sergeant   s lucky arrow would of hit the spot and the dragon   ll be dead  so we won   t have anything to worry about .           granted  granted     said nobby hurriedly  looking at colon   s scowling face .     but just in case  you know  if by a million to one chance he misses   i   m not saying he will  mark you  you just have to think of all eventualities   if  by incredible bad luck  he doesn   t quite manage to hit the voonerable dead on  then your dragon is going to lose his rag  right  and it   s probably a good idea to not be here .  it   s a long shot  i know .  call me a worry wart if you like .  that   s all i   m saying .      sergeant colon adjusted his armor haughtily .      when you really need them the most     he said     million to one chances always crop up .  well known fact .         the sergeant is right  nobby     said carrot virtuously .     you know that when there   s just one chance which might just work   well  it works .  otherwise there   d be no       he lowered his voice      i mean  it stands to reason  if last desperate chances didn   t work  there   d be no   well  the gods wouldn   t let it be any other way .  they wouldn   t .      as one man  the three of them turned and looked through the murky air toward the hub of the discworld  thousands of miles away .  now the air was gray with old smoke and mist shreds  but on a clear day it was possible to see cori celesti  home of the gods .  site of the home of the gods  anyway .  they lived in dunmanifestin  the stuccoed valhalla  where the gods faced eternity with the kind of minds that were at a loss to know what to do to pass a wet afternoon .  they played games with the fates of men  it was said .  exactly what game they thought they were playing at the moment was anyone   s guess .   but of course there were rules .  everyone knew there were rules .  they just had to hope like hell that the gods knew the rules  too .      it   s got to work     mumbled colon .     i   ll be using my lucky arrow    n all .  you   re right .  last hopeless chances have got to work .  nothing makes any sense otherwise .  you might as well not be alive .      nobby looked down at the pond again .  after a moment   s hesitation colon joined him .  they had the speculative faces of men who had seen many things  and knew that while you could of course depend on heroes  and kings  and ultimately on gods  you could really depend on gravity and deep water .      not that we   ll need it     said colon virtuously .      not with your lucky arrow     said nobby .      that   s right .  but  just out of interest  how far down is it  d   you think .     said colon .      about thirty feet  i   d say .  give or take .         thirty feet .     colon nodded slowly .     that   s what i   d reckon .  and it   s deep  is it .         very deep  i   ve heard .         i   ll take your word for it .  it looks pretty mucky .  i   d hate to have to jump in it .      carrot slapped him cheerfully on the back  nearly pushing him over  and said     what   s up  sarge .  do you want to live forever .         dunno .  ask me again in five hundred years .         it   s a good job we   ve got your lucky arrow  then .     said carrot .      hmm .     said colon  who seemed to be in a miserable daydream world of his own .      i mean  it   s a good job we   ve got a last desperate million to one chance to rely on  or we   d really be in trouble .         oh  yes     said nobby sadly .     lucky old us .          the patrician lay back .  a couple of rats dragged a cushion under his head .      things are rather bad outside  i gather     he said .      yes     said vimes bitterly .     you   re right .  you   re the safest man in the city .        he wedged another knife in a crack in the stones and tested his weight carefully  while lord vetinari looked on with interest .  he   d managed to get six feet off the floor and up to a level with the grille .   now he started to hack at the mortar around the bars .   the patrician watched him for a while  and then took a book off the little shelf beside him .  since the rats couldn   t read the library he   d been able to assemble was a little baroque  but he was not a man to ignore fresh knowledge .  he found his bookmark in the pages of lacemaking through the ages  and read a few pages .   after a while he found it necessary to brush a few crumbs of mortar off the book  and looked up .      are you achieving success .     he inquired politely .   vimes gritted his teeth and hacked away .  outside the little grille was a grubby courtyard  barely lighter than the cell .  there was a midden in one corner  but currently it looked very attractive .  more attractive than the dungeon  at any rate .  an honest midden was preferable to the way ankh morpork was going these days .  it was probably allegorical  or something .   he stabbed  stabbed  stabbed .  the knife blade twanged and shook in his hand .       the librarian scratched his armpits thoughtfully .  he was facing problems of his own .   he had come here full of rage against book thieves and that rage still burned .  but the seditious thought had occurred to him that  although crimes against books were the worst kind of crimes  revenge ought  perhaps  to be postponed .   it occurred to him that  while of course what humans chose to do to one another was all one to him  there were certain activities that should be curtailed in case the perpetrators got over confident and started doing things like that to books  too .   the librarian stared at his badge again  and gave it a gentle nibble in the optimistic hope that it had become edible .  no doubt about it  he had a duty to the captain .   the captain had always been kind to him .  and the captain had a badge  too .   yes .   there were times when an ape had to do what a man had to do     the orangutan threw a complex salute and swung away into the darkness .       the sun rose higher  rolling through the mists and stale smoke like a lost balloon .   the rank sat in the shade of a chimney stack  waiting and killing time in their various ways .  nobby was thoughtfully probing the contents of a nostril  carrot was writing a letter home  and sergeant colon was worrying .   after a while he shifted his weight uneasily and said     i   ve fought of a problem .         wassat  sarge .     said carrot .   sergeant colon looked wretched .     weeell  what if it   s not a million to one chance .     he said .   nobby stared at him .      what d   you mean .     he said .      well  all right  last desperate million to one chances always work  right  no problem  but   well  it   s pretty wossname  specific .  i mean  isn   t it .         you tell me     said nobby .      what if it   s just a thousand to one chance .     said colon agonizedly .        what .         anyone ever heard of a thousand to one shot coming up .      carrot looked up .     don   t be daft  sergeant     he said .     no one ever saw a thousand to one chance come up .  the odds against it are       his lips moved      millions to one .         yeah .  millions     agreed nobby .      so it   d only work if it   s your actual million to one chance     said the sergeant .      i suppose that   s right     said nobby .      so         to one  for example       colon began .   carrot shook his head .     wouldn   t have a hope .  no one ever said     it   s a         to one chance but it might just work .         they stared out across the city in the silence of ferocious mental calculation .      we could have a real problem here     said colon eventually .   carrot started to scribble furiously .  when questioned  he explained at length about how you found the surface area of a dragon and then tried to estimate the chances of an arrow hitting any one spot .      aimed  mind     said sergeant colon .     i aim .      nobby coughed .      in that case it   s got to be a lot less than a million to one chance     said carrot .     it could be a hundred to one .  if the dragon   s flying slowly and it   s a big spot  it could be practically a certainty .      colon   s lips shaped themselves around the phrase  it   s a certainty but it might just work .  he shook his head .     nah     he said .      so what we   ve got to do  then     said nobby slowly     is adjust the odds            now there was a shallow hole in the mortar near the middle bar .  it wasn   t much  vimes knew  but it was a start .      you don   t require assistance  by any chance .     said the patrician .      no .         as you wish .      the mortar was half rotted  but the bars had been driven deep into the rock .  under their crusting of rust there was still plenty of iron .  it was a long job  but it was something to do and required a blessed absence of thought .  they couldn   t take it away from him .  it was a good  clean challenge  you knew if you went on chipping away  you   d win through eventually .   it was the    eventually    that was the problem .  eventually great a    tuin would reach the end of the universe .  eventually the stars would go out .  eventually nobby might have a bath  although that would probably involve a radical re thinking of the nature of time .   he hacked at the mortar anyway  and then stopped as something small and pale fell down outside  quite slowly .      peanut shell .     he said .   the librarian   s face  surrounded by the inner tube jowls of the librarian   s head  appeared upside down in the barred opening  and gave him a grin that wasn   t any less terrible for being the wrong way up .      oook .      the orangutan flopped down off the wall  grabbed a couple of bars  and pulled .  muscles shunted back and forward across its barrel chest in a complex pavane of effort .  the mouthful of yellow teeth gaped in silent concentration .   there were a couple of dull    things    as the bars gave up and broke free .  the ape flung them aside and reached into the gaping hole .  then the longest arm of the law grabbed the astonished vimes under his shoulders and pulled him through in one movement .       the rank surveyed their handiwork .      right     said nobby .     now  what are the chances of a man standing on one leg with his hat on backward and a handkerchief in his mouth hitting a dragon   s voonerables .         mmph     said colon .      it   s pretty long odds     said carrot .     i reckon the hanky is a bit over the top  though .      colon spat it out .     make up your minds     he said .     me leg   s going to sleep .          vimes picked himself up off the greasy cobbles and stared at the librarian .  he was experiencing something which had come as a shock to many people  usually in much more unpleasant circumstances such as a brawl started in the mended drum when the ape wanted a bit of peace and quiet to enjoy a reflective pint  which was this  the librarian might look like a stuffed rubber sack  but what it was stuffed with was muscle .      that was amazing     was all he could find to say .  he looked down at the twisted bars  and felt his mind darken .  he grabbed the bent metal .     you don   t happen to know where wonse is  do you .     he added .      eeek .     the librarian thrust a tattered piece of parchment under his nose .     eeek .      vimes read the words .   it hathe pleased   whereas   at the stroke of noone   a maiden pure  yet high born   compact between ruler and rul  d        in my city .     he growled .     in my bloody city .      he grabbed the librarian by two handfuls of chest hair and pulled him up to eye height .        what time is it .     he shouted .      oook .      a long red haired arm unfolded itself upward .  vimes   s gaze followed the pointing finger .  the sun definitely had the look of a heavenly body that was nearly at the crest of its orbit and looking forward to a long  lazy coasting toward the blankets of dusk        i   m not bloody well going to have it  understand .     vimes shouted  shaking the ape back and forth .      oook     the librarian pointed out  patiently .      what .  oh .  sorry .     vimes lowered the ape  who wisely didn   t make an issue of it because a man angry enough to lift    lbs of orangutan without noticing is a man with too much on his mind .   now he was staring around the courtyard .      any way out of here .     he said .     without climbing the walls i mean .      he didn   t wait for an answer but loped around the walls until he reached a narrow  grubby door  and kicked it open .  it hadn   t been locked anyway  but he kicked it just the same .  the librarian trailed along behind  swinging on his knuckles .   the kitchen on the other side of the door was almost deserted  the staff having finally lost their nerve and decided that all prudent chefs refrained from working in an establishment where there was a mouth bigger than they were .  a couple of palace guards were eating a cold lunch .      now     said vimes  as they half rose     i don   t want to have to        they didn   t seem to want to listen .  one of them reached for a crossbow .      oh  the hell with it .     vimes grabbed a butcher   s knife from a block beside it and threw it .   there is an art in throwing knives and  even then  you need the right kind of knife .  otherwise it does just what this one did  which is miss completely .   the guard with the bow leaned sideways  righted himself  and found that a purple fingernail was gently blocking the firing mechanism .  he looked around .  the librarian hit him right on top of his helmet .   the other guard shrank back  waving his hands frantically .      nonono .     he said .     it   s a misunderstanding .  what was it you said you didn   t want to have to do .  nice monkey .         oh  dear     said vimes .     wrong .      he ignored the terrified screaming and rummaged through the debris of the kitchen until he came up with a cleaver .  he   d never felt really at home with swords  but a cleaver was a different matter .  a cleaver had weight .  it had purpose .  a sword might have a certain nobility about it  unless it was the one belonging for example to nobby  which relied on rust to hold it together  but what a cleaver had was a tremendous ability to cut things up .   he left the biology lesson   that no monkey was capable of bouncing someone up and down by their ankles   found a likely door  and hurried through it .  this took him outside again  into the big cobbled area that surrounded the palace .  now he could get his bearings  now he could     there was a boom in the air above him .  a gale blew downward  knocking him over .   the king of ankh morpork wings outspread  glided across the sky and settled for a moment on the palace gateway  talons gouging long scars in the stone as it caught its balance .  the sun glittered off its arched back as it stretched its neck  roared a lazy billow of flames  and sprang into the air again .   vimes made an animal   a mammalian animal   noise in the back of his throat  and ran out into the empty streets .       silence filled the ancestral home of the ramkins .  the front door swung back and forth on its hinges  letting in the common  badly brought up breeze which wandered through the deserted rooms  gawping and looking for dust on the top of the furniture .  it wound up the stairs and banged through the door of sybil ramkin   s bedroom  rattling the bottles on the dressing table and riffling through the pages of diseases of the dragon .   a really fast reader could have learned the symptoms of everything from abated heels to zigzag throat .   and down below  in the low  warm and foul smelling shed that housed the swamp dragons  it seemed that errol had got them all .  now he sat in the center of his pen  swaying and moaning softly .  white smoke rolled slowly from his ears and drifted toward the floor .  from somewhere inside his swollen stomach came complex explosive hydraulic noises  as though desperate teams of gnomes were trying to drive a culvert through a cliff in a thunderstorm .   his nostrils flared  turning more or less of their own volition .   the other dragons craned over the pen walls  watching him cautiously .   there was another distant gastric roar .  errol shifted painfully .   the dragons exchanged glances .  then  one by one  they lay down carefully on the floor and put their paws over their eyes .       nobby put his head on one side .      it looks promising     he said critically .     we might be nearly there .  i reckon the chances of a man with soot on his face  his tongue sticking out  standing on one leg and singing the hedgehog song ever hitting a dragon   s voonerables would be   what   d you say  carrot .         a million to one  i reckon     said carrot virtuously .   colon glared at them .      listen  lads     he said     you   re not winding me up  are you .      carrot looked down at the plaza below them .      oh  bloody hell     he said softly .      wassat .     said colon urgently  looking around .      they   re chaining a woman to a rock .      the rank stared over the parapet .  the huge and silent crowd that lined the plaza stared too  at a white figure struggling between half a dozen palace guards .      wonder where they got the rock from .     said colon .     we   re on loam here  you know .         fine strapping wench  whoever she is     said nobby approvingly  as one of the guards wheeled off bow legged and collapsed .     that   s one lad who won   t know what to do with his evenin   s for a few weeks .  got a mean right knee  so she has .         anyone we know .     said colon .   carrot squinted .      it   s lady ramkin .     he said  his mouth dropping open .      never .         he   s right .  in a nightie     said nobby .      the buggers .     colon snatched up his bow and fumbled for an arrow .     i   ll give    em voonerables .  well spoken lady like her  it   s a disgrace .         er     said carrot  who had glanced over his shoulder .     sergeant .         this is what it comes to .     muttered colon .     decent women can   t walk down the street without being eaten .  right  you bastards  you   re   you   re geography           sergeant .     carrot repeated urgently .        it   s history  not geography     said nobby .     that   s what you   re supposed to say .  history .     you   re history .     you say .         well  whatever     snapped colon .     let   s see how           sergeant .      nobby was looking behind them  too .      oh  shit     he said .      can   t miss     muttered colon  taking aim .      sergeant .         shut up  you two  i can   t concentrate when you keep shout           sergeant  it   s coming .          the dragon accelerated .   the drunken rooftops of ankh morpork blurred as it passed over  wings sneering at the air .  its neck stretched out straight ahead  the pilot flames of its nostrils streamed behind it  the sound of its flight panned across the sky .       colon   s hands shook .  the dragon seemed to be aiming at his throat  and it was moving too fast  far too fast        this is it .     said carrot .  he glanced toward the hub  in case any gods had forgotten what they were there for  and added  speaking slowly and distinctly     it   s a million to one chance  but it might just work .         fire the bloody thing .     screamed nobby .      picking my spot  lad  picking my spot     quavered colon .     don   t you worry  lads  i told you this is my lucky arrow .  first class arrow  this arrow  had it since i was a lad  you   d be amazed at the things i shot at with this  don   t you worry .      he paused  as the nightmare bore down on him on wings of terror .      er  carrot .     he said meekly .      yes  sarge .           did your old grandad ever say what a voonerable spot looks like .      and then the dragon wasn   t approaching anymore  it was there  passing a few feet overhead  a streaming mosaic of scales and noise  filling the entire sky .   colon fired .   they watched the arrow rise straight and true .       vimes half ran  half staggered over the damp cobbles  out of breath and out of time .   it can   t be like this  he thought wildly .  the hero always cuts it fine  but he always gets there just in the nick of time .  only the nick of time was probably five minutes ago .   and i   m not a hero .  i   m out of condition  and i need a drink  and i get a handful of dollars a month without plumes allowance .  that   s not hero   s pay .  heroes get kingdoms and princesses  and they take regular exercise  and when they smile the light glints off their teeth  ting .  the bastards .   sweat stung his eyes .  the rush of adrenalin that had carried him out of the palace had spent itself  and was now exacting its inevitable toll .   he stumbled to a halt  and grabbed a wall to keep him upright while he gasped for air .  and thus he saw the figures on the rooftop .   oh  no .  he thought .  they   re not heroes either .  what do they think they   re playing at .       it was a million to one chance .  and who was to say that  somewhere in the millions of other possible universes  it might not have worked .   that was the sort of thing the gods really liked .  but chance  who sometimes can overrule even the gods  has         casting votes .     in this universe  for example  the arrow bounced off a scale and clattered away into oblivion .   colon stared as the dragon   s pointed tail passed overhead .      it   missed       he mouthed .      but it couldn   t of missed .     he stared red eyed at the other two .     it was a sodding last desperate million to one chance .      the dragon twisted its wings  swung its huge bulk around on a pivot of air  and bore down on the roof .   carrot grabbed nobby around the waist and laid a hand on colon   s shoulder .   the sergeant was weeping with rage and frustration .      million to bloody one last desperate bloody chance .         sarge        the dragon flamed .   it was a beautifully controlled line of plasma .  it went through the roof like butter .   it cut through stairways .   it crackled into ancient timbers and made them twist like paper .  it sliced into pipes .   it punched through floor after floor like the fist of an angry god and  eventually  reached the big copper vat containing a thousand gallons of freshly made mature whiskey type spirit .   it burned into that  too .   fortunately  the chances of anyone surviving the ensuing explosion were exactly a million to one .       the fireball rose like a   well  a rose .  a huge orange rose  streaked with yellow .  it took the roof with it and wrapped it around the astonished dragon  lifting it high into the air in a boiling cloud of broken timber and bits of piping .   the crowd watched in bemusement as the superhot blast flung it into the sky and barely noticed vimes as he pushed his way  wheezing and crying  through the press of bodies .   he shouldered past a row of palace guards and shambled as fast as he could across the flagstones .  no one was paying him much attention at the moment .   he stopped .   it wasn   t a rock  because ankh morpork was on loam .  it was just some huge remnant of mortared masonry  probably thousands of years old  from somewhere in the city foundations .  ankh morpork was so old now that what it was built on  by and large  was ankh morpork .   it had been dragged into the center of the plaza  and lady sybil ramkin had been chained to it .  she appeared to be wearing a nightie and huge rubber boots .  by the look of her she had been in a fight  and vimes felt a momentary pang of sympathy for whoever else had been involved .  she gave him a look of pure fury .      you .         you .      he waved the cleaver vaguely .      but why you    .     he began .      captain vimes     she said sharply     you will oblige me by not waving that thing about and you will start putting it to its proper use .      vimes wasn   t listening .      thirty dollars a month .     he muttered .     that   s what they died for .  thirty dollars .  and i docked some from nobby .  i had to  didn   t i .  i mean  that man could make a melon go rusty .         captain vimes .      he focused on the cleaver .      oh     he said .     yes .  right .      it was a good steel cleaver  and the chains were elderly and rather rusty iron .  he hacked away  raising sparks from the masonry .   the crowd watched in silence  but several palace guards hurried toward him .      what the hell do you think you   re doing .     said one of them  who didn   t have much imagination .      what the hell do you think you   re doing .     vimes growled  looking up .   they stared at him .      what .      vimes took another hack at the chains .  several loops tinkled to the ground .      right  you   ve asked for       one of the guards began .  vimes   s elbow caught him under his rib cage  before he collapsed  vimes   s foot kicked savagely at the other one   s kneecaps  bringing his chin down ready for another stab with the other elbow .      right     said vimes absently .  he rubbed the elbow .  it was sheer agony .   he moved the cleaver to his other hand and hammered at the chains again  aware at the back of his mind that more guards were hurrying up  but with that special kind of run that guards had .  he knew it well .  it was the run that said  there   s a dozen of us  let someone else get there first .  it said  he looks ready to kill  no one   s paying me to get killed  maybe if i run slowly enough he   ll get away     no point in spoiling a good day by catching someone .   lady ramkin shook herself free .  a ragged cheer went up and started to grow in volume .  even in their current state of mind  the people of ankh morpork always appreciated a performance .   she grabbed a handful of chain and wrapped it around one pudgy fist .        some of those guards don   t know how to treat       she began .      no time  no time     said vimes  grabbing her arm .  it was like trying to drag a mountain .   the cheering stopped  abruptly .   there was a sound behind vimes .  it was not  particularly  a loud noise .  it just had a peculiarly nasty carrying quality .  it was the click of four sets of talons hitting the flagstones at the same time .   vimes looked around and up .   soot clung to the dragon   s hide .  a few pieces of charred wood had lodged here and there  and were still smoldering .  the magnificent bronze scales were streaked with black .   it lowered its head until vimes was a few feet away from its eyes  and tried to focus on him .   probably not worth running  vimes told himself .  it   s not as if i   ve got the energy anyway .   he felt lady ramkin   s hand engulf his .      jolly well done     she said .     it nearly worked .          charred and blazing wreckage rained down around the distillery .  the pond was a swamp of debris  covered with a coating of ash .  out of it  dripping slime  rose sergeant colon .   he clawed his way to the bank and pulled himself up  like some sea dwelling lifeform that was anxious to get the whole evolution thing over with in one go .   nobby was already there  spread out like a frog  leaking water .      is that you  nobby .     said sergeant colon anxiously .      it   s me  sergeant .         i   m glad about that  nobby     said colon fervently .      i wish it wasn   t me  sergeant .        colon tipped the water out of his helmet  and then paused .      what about young carrot .     he said .   nobby pushed himself up on his elbows  groggily .      dunno     he said .     one minute we were on the roof  next minute we were jumping .      they both looked at the ashen waters of the pond .      i suppose     said colon slowly     he can swim .         dunno .  he never said .  not much to swim in  up in the mountains .  when you come to think about it     said nobby .      but perhaps there were limpid blue pools and deep mountain streams     said the sergeant hopefully .     and icy tarns in hidden valleys and that .  not to mention subterranean lakes .  he   d be bound to have learned .  in and out of the water all day  i expect .      they stared at the greasy gray surface .      it was probably that protective     said nobby .     p   raps it filled with water and dragged him down .      colon nodded gloomily .      i   ll hold your helmet     said nobby  after a while .      but i   m your superior officer .         yes     said nobby reasonably     but if you get stuck down there  you   re going to want your best man up here  ready to rescue you  aren   t you .         that   s   reasonable     said colon eventually .     that   s a good point .         right  then .         drawback is  though           what .            i can   t swim     colon said .      how did you get out of that  then .      colon shrugged .     i   m a natural floater .      their eyes  once again  turned to the dankness of the pond .  then colon stared at nobby .  then nobby  very slowly  unbuckled his helmet .        there isn   t someone still in there  is there .     said carrot  behind them .   they looked around .  he hoicked some mud out of an ear .  behind him the remains of the brewery smoldered .      i thought i   d better nip out quickly  see what was going on     he said brightly  pointing to a gate leading out of the yard .  it was hanging by one hinge .      oh     said nobby weakly .     jolly good .         there   s an alley out there     said carrot .      no dragons in it  are there .     said colon suspiciously .      no dragons  no humans .  there   s no one around     said carrot impatiently .  he drew his sword .     come on .     he said .      where to .     said nobby .  he   d pulled a damp butt from behind his ear and was looking at it with an expression of deepest sorrow .  it was obviously too far gone .  he tried to light it anyway .      we want to fight the dragon  don   t we .     said carrot .   colon shifted uncomfortably .     yes  but aren   t we allowed to go home for a change of clothes first .         and a nice warm drink .     said nobby .      and a meal     said colon .     a nice plate of           you should be ashamed of yourselves     said carrot .     there   s a lady in distress and a dragon to fight and all you can think of is food and drink .         oh  i   m not just thinking about food and drink     said colon .      we could be all that stands between the city and total destruction .         yes  but       nobby began .   carrot drew his sword and waved it over his head .      captain vimes would have gone .     he said .     all for one .      he glared at them  and rushed out of the yard .   colon gave nobby a sheepish look .        young people today     he said .      all for one what .     said nobby .   the sergeant sighed .     come on  then .         oh  all right .      they staggered out into the alley .  it was empty .      where   d he go .     said nobby .   carrot stepped out of the shadows  grinning all over his face .      knew i could rely on you     he said .     follow me .         something odd about that boy     said colon  as they limped after him .     he always manages to persuade us to follow him  have you noticed .         all for one what .     said nobby .      something about the voice  i reckon .         yes  but all for one what .          the patrician sighed and  carefully marking his place  laid aside his book .  to judge from the noise there seemed to be an awful lot of excitement going on out there .  it was highly unlikely any palace guards would be around  which was just as well .  the guards were highly trained men and it would be a shame to waste them .   he would need them later on .   he padded over to the wall and pushed a small block that looked exactly like all the other small blocks .  no other small block  however  would have caused a section of flagstone to grind ponderously aside .   there was a carefully chosen assortment of stuff in there   iron rations  spare clothes  several small chests of precious metals and jewels  tools .  and there was a key .  never build a dungeon you couldn   t get out of .   the patrician took the key and strolled over to the door .  as the wards of the lock slid back in their well oiled grooves he wondered  again  whether he should have told vimes about the key .  but the man seemed to have got so much satisfaction out of breaking out .  it would probably have been positively bad for him to have told him about the key .  anyway  it would have spoiled his view of the world .  he needed vimes and his view of the world .   lord vetinari swung the door open and  silently  strode out into the ruins of his palace .   they trembled as  for the second time in a couple of minutes  the city rocked .       the dragon kennels exploded .  the windows blew out .  the door left the wall ahead of a great billow of black smoke and sailed into the air  tumbling slowly  to plow into the rhododendrons .   something very energetic and hot was happening in that building .  more smoke poured out  thick and oily and solid .  one of the walls folded in on itself  and then another one toppled sluggishly onto the lawn .   swamp dragons shot determinedly out of the wreckage like champagne corks  wings whirring frantically .   still the smoke unrolled .  but there was something in there  some point of fierce white light that was gently rising .   it disappeared from view as it passed a stricken window  and then  with a piece of roof tile still spinning on the top of his head  errol climbed above his own smoke and ascended into the skies of ankh morpork .   the sunlight glinted off his silver scales as he hovered about a hundred feet up  turning slowly  balancing nicely on his own flame     vimes  awaiting death on the plaza  realized that his mouth was hanging open .  he shut it again .   there was absolutely no sound in the city now but the noise of errol   s ascent .   they can rearrange their own plumbing  vimes told himself bemusedly .  to suit circumstances .  he   s made it work in reverse .  but his thingys  his genes   surely he must have been halfway to it anyway .  no wonder the little bugger has got such stubby wings .  his body must have known he wasn   t going to need them  except to steer .   good grief .  i   m watching the first ever dragon to flame backward .   he risked a glance immediately above him .  the great dragon was frozen  its enormous bloodshot eyes concentrating on the tiny creature .   with a challenging roar of flame and a pummeling of air the king of ankh morpork rose  all thought of mere humans forgotten .   vimes turned sharply to lady ramkin .      how do they fight .     he said urgently .     how do dragons fight .         i   that is  well  they just flap at each other and blow flame     she said .     swamp dragons  that is .  i mean  who   s ever seen a noble dragon fight .     she patted her nightie .     i must take some notes  i   ve got my memo book somewhere           in your nightshirt .         it   s amazing how ideas come to one in bed  i   ve always said .      flames roared into the space where errol had been  but he wasn   t there .  the king tried to spin in mid air .  the little dragon circled in an easy series of smoke rings  weaving a cat   s cradle in the sky with the huge adversary gyrating helplessly in the middle .  more flames  hotter and longer  stabbed at him and missed .   the crowd watched in breathless silence .         allo  captain     said an ingratiating voice .   vimes looked down .  a small and stagnant pond disguised as nobby grinned sheepishly up at him .        i thought you were dead .     he said .      we   re not     said nobby .      oh .  good .     there didn   t seem much else to say .      what do you reckon on the fight  then .      vimes looked back up .  smoke trails spiraled across the city .      i   m afraid it   s not going to work     said lady ramkin .     oh .  hallo  nobby .         afternoon  ma   am     said nobby  touching what he thought was his forelock .      what d   you mean  it   s not going to work .     said vimes .     look at him go .  it hasn   t hit him yet .         yes  but his flame has touched it several times .  it doesn   t seem to have any effect .  it   s not hot enough  i think .  oh  he   s dodging well .  but he   s got to be lucky every time .  it has only got to be lucky once .      the meaning of this sank in .      you mean     said vimes     all this is just   just show .  he   s just doing it to impress .         s   not his fault     said colon  materializing behind them .     it   s like dogs innit .  doesn   t really dawn on the poor little bugger that he   s up against a big one .  he   s just ready for a scrap .      both dragons appeared to realize that the fight was the well known klatchian standoff .  with another smoke ring and a billow of white flame they parted and retreated a few hundred yards .   the king hovered  flapping its wings quickly .  height .  that was the thing .  when dragon fought dragon  height was always the thing     errol balanced on his flame .  he seemed to be thinking .   then he nonchalantly kicked his back legs out as though hovering on your own stomach gases was something dragons had mastered over millions of years  somersaulted  and fled .  for a moment he was visible as a silver streak  and then he was out over the city walls and gone .   a groan followed him .  it came from ten thousand throats .   vimes threw up his hands .      don   t you worry  guv     said nobby quickly .     he   s   he   s probably gone to  to have a drink .  or something .  maybe it   s the end of round one .  or something .         i mean  he ate our kettle and everything     said colon uncertainly .     he wouldn   t just run away after eating a kettle .  stands to reason .  anyone who could eat a kettle wouldn   t run away from anything .         and my armor polish     said carrot .     it was nearly a whole dollar for the tin .         there you are then     said colon .     it   s like i said .         look     said vimes  as patiently as he could manage .     he   s a nice dragon  i liked him as much as you  a very nice little chap  but he   s just done the sensible thing  for gods    sake  he   s not going to get burned to bits just to save us .  life just doesn   t work like that .  you might as well face it .      overhead the great dragon strutted through the air and flamed a nearby tower .  it had won .      i   ve never seen that before     said lady ramkin .     dragons normally fight to the death .         at last they   ve bred one who   s sensible     said vimes morosely .     let   s be honest  the chances of a dragon the size of errol beating something that big are a million to one .      there was one of those silences you get after one clear bright note has been struck and the world pauses .   the rank looked at one another .      million to one .     asked carrot nonchalantly .      definitely     said vimes .     million to one .      the rank looked at one another again .      million to one     said colon .        million to one     agreed nobby .      that   s right     said carrot .     million to one .      there was another high toned silence .  the members of the rank were wondering who was going to be the first to say it .   sergeant colon took a deep breath .      but it might just work     he said .      what are you talking about .     snapped vimes .     there   s no        nobby nudged him urgently in the ribs and pointed out across the plains .   there was a column of black smoke out there .  vimes squinted .  running ahead of the smoke  speeding over the cabbage fields and closing fast  was a silvery bullet .   the great dragon had seen it too .  it flamed defiance and climbed for extra height  mashing the air with its enormous wings .   now errol   s flame was visible  so hot as to be almost blue .  the landscape rolled away underneath him at an impossible speed  and he was accelerating .   ahead of him the king extended its claws .  it was almost grinning .   errol   s going to hit it  vimes thought .  gods help us all  it   ll be a fireball .   something odd was happening out in the fields .  a little way behind errol the ground appeared to be plowing itself up  throwing cabbage stalks into the air .  a hedgerow erupted in a shower of sawdust     errol passed silently over the city walls  nose up  wings folded down to tiny flaps  his body honed to a mere cone with a flame at one end .  his opponent blew out a tongue of fire  vimes watched errol  with a barely noticeable flip of a wing stub  roll easily out of its path .  and then he was gone  speeding out toward the sea in the same eerie silence .        he miss       nobby began .   the air ruptured .  an endless thunderclap of noise dragged across the city  smashing tiles  toppling chimneys .  in mid air  the king was picked up  flattened out and spun like a top in the sonic wash .  vimes  his hands over his own ears  saw the creature flame desperately as it turned and became the center of a spiral of crazy fire .   magic crackled along its wings .  it screamed like a distressed foghorn .  then  shaking its head dazedly  it began to glide in a wide circle .   vimes groaned .  it had survived something that tore masonry apart .  what did you have to do to beat it .  you can   t fight it  he thought .  you can   t burn it  you can   t smash it .  there   s nothing you can do to it .   the dragon landed .  it wasn   t a perfect landing .  a perfect landing wouldn   t have demolished a row of cottages .  it was slow  and it seemed to go on for a long time and rip up a considerable stretch of city .   wings flapping aimlessly  neck waving and spraying random flame  it plowed on through a debris of beams and thatch .  several fires started up along the trail of destruction .   finally it came to rest at the end of the furrow  almost invisible under a heap of former architecture .   the silence that it left was broken only by the shouts of someone trying to organize yet another bucket chain from the river to douse the fires .   then people started to move .   from the air ankh morpork must have looked like a disturbed anthill  with streams of dark figures flowing toward the wreck of the dragon .   most of them had some kind of weapon .   many of them had spears .   some of them had swords .   all of them had one aim in mind .        you know what .     said vimes aloud .     this is going to be the world   s first democratically killed dragon .  one man  one stab .         then you   ve got to stop them .  you can   t let them kill it .     said lady ramkin .   vimes blinked at her .      pardon .     he said .      it   s wounded .         lady  that was the intention  wasn   t it .  anyway  it   s only stunned     said vimes .      i mean you can   t let them kill it like this     said lady ramkin insistently .     poor thing .         what do you want to do  then .     demanded vimes  his temper unravelling .     give it a strengthening dose of tar oil and a nice comfy basket in front of the stove .         it   s butchery .         suits me fine .         but it   s a dragon .  it   s just doing what a dragon does .  it never would have come here if people had left it alone .      vimes thought  it was about to eat her  and she can still think like this .  he hesitated .  perhaps that did give you the right to an opinion     sergeant colon sidled up as they glared  white faced  at one another  and hopped desperately from one squelching foot to the other .      you better come at once  captain     he said .     it   s going to be bloody murder .      vimes waved a hand at him .     as far as i   m concerned     he mumbled  avoiding sybil ramkin   s glare     it   s got it coming to it .         it   s not that     said colon .     it   s carrot .  he   s arrested the dragon .      vimes paused .        what do you mean  arrested .     he said .     you don   t mean what i think you mean  do you .         could be  sir     said colon uncertainly .     could be .  he was up on the rubble like a shot  sir  grabbed it by a wing and said    you   re nicked  chummy     sir .  couldn   t believe it  sir .  sir  the thing is           well .      the sergeant hopped from one foot to the other .     you know you said prisoners weren   t to be molested  sir            it was quite a large and heavy roof timber and it scythed quite slowly through the air  but when it hit people they rolled backward and stayed hit .      now look     said carrot  hauling it in and pushing back his helmet     i don   t want to have to tell anyone again  right .      vimes shouldered his way through the dense crowd  staring at the bulky figure atop the mound of rubble and dragon .  carrot turned slowly  the roof beam held like a staff .  his gaze was like a lighthouse beam .  where it fell  the crowd lowered their weapons and looked merely sullen and uncomfortable .     i must warn you     carrot went on     that interfering with an officer in the execution of his duty is a serious offense .  and i shall come down like a ton of bricks on the very next person who throws a stone .      a stone bounced off the back of his helmet .  there was a barrage of jeers .      let us at it .         that   s right .         we don   t want guards ordering us about .         quis custodiet custard .         yeah .  right .      vimes pulled the sergeant toward him .     go and organize some rope .  lots of rope .  as thick as possible .  i suppose we can   oh  tie its wings together  maybe  and bind up its mouth so it can   t flame .      colon peered at him .      are you serious  sir .  we   re really going to arrest it .         do it .      it   s been arrested  he thought  as he pushed his way forward .  personally i would have preferred it to drop in the sea  but it   s been arrested and now we   ve got to deal with it or let it go free .   he felt his own feelings about the bloody thing evaporate in the face of the mob .  what could you do with it .  give it a fair trial  he thought  and then execute it .  not kill it .  that   s what heroes do out in the wilderness .  you can   t think like that in cities .  or rather  you can  but if you   re going to then you might as well burn the whole place down right now and start again .  you ought to do it   well  by the book .   that   s it .  we tried everything else .  now we might as well try and do it by the book .   anyway  he added mentally  that   s a city guard up there .  we   ve got to stick together .  nobody else will have anything to do with us .   a burly figure in front of him drew back an arm with a halfbrick in it .      throw that brick and you   re a dead man     said vimes  and then ducked and pushed his way through the press of people while the would be thrower looked around in amazement .   carrot half raised his club in a threatening gesture as vimes climbed up the rubble pile .      oh  hallo  captain vimes     he said  lowering it     i have to report i have arrested this           yes  i can see     said vimes .     did you have any suggestions about what we do next .           oh  yes  sir .  i have to read it its rights  sir     said carrot .      i mean apart from that .         not really  sir .      vimes looked at those parts of the dragon still visible under the rubble .  how could you kill one of these .  you   d have to spend a day at it .   a lump of rock ricocheted off his breastplate .      who did that .      the voice lashed out like a whip .   the crowd went quiet .   sybil ramkin scrambled up on the wreckage  eyes afire  and glared furiously at the mob .      i said     she said     who did that .  if the person who did it does not own up i shall be extremely angry .  shame on you all .      she had their full attention .  several people holding stones and things let them drop quietly to the ground .   the breeze flapped the remnants of her nightshirt as her ladyship took up a new haranguing position .      here is the gallant captain vimes           oh gods     said vimes in a small voice  and pulled his helmet down over his eyes .         and his dauntless men  who have taken the trouble to come here today  to save your        vimes gripped carrot   s arm and maneuverd him down the far side of the heap .      you all right  captain .     said the lance constable .     you   ve gone all red .         don   t you start     snapped vimes .     it   s bad enough getting all those leers from nobby and the sergeant .      to his astonishment carrot patted him companionably on the shoulder .      i know how it is     he said sympathetically .     i had this girl back home  her name was minty  and her father             look  for the last time  there is absolutely nothing between       vimes began .   there was a rattle beside them .  a small avalanche of plaster and thatch rolled down .  the rubble heaved  and opened one eye .  one big black pupil floating in a bloodshot glow tried to focus on them .      we must be mad     said vimes .      oh  no  sir     said carrot .     there   s plenty of precedents .  in      a hen was arrested for crowing on soul cake thursday .  and during the regime of psychoneurotic lord snapcase a colony of bats was executed for persistent curfew violations .  that was in      .  august  i think .  great days for the law  they were     said carrot dreamily .     in       you know  a small cloud was prosecuted for covering the sun during the climax of frenzied earl hargath   s investiture ceremony .         i hope colon gets a move on with       vimes stopped .  he had to know .     how .     he said .     what can you do to a cloud .         the earl sentenced it to be stoned to death     said carrot .     apparently thirty one people were killed .     he pulled out his notebook and glared at the dragon .      can it hear us  do you think .     he said .      i suppose so .         well  then .     carrot cleared his throat and turned back to the stunned reptile .     it is my duty to warn you that you are to be reported for consideration of prosecution on some or all of the following counts  to whit  one   one  i  that on or about   th grune last  in a place known as sweetheart lane  the shades  you did unlawfully vent flame in a manner likely to cause grievous bodily harm  in contravention of clause seven of the industrial processes act        and that  one   one  ii  that on or about   th grune last  in a place known as sweetheart lane  the shades  you caused or did cause to cause the death of six persons unknown        vimes wondered how long the rubble would hold the creature down .  several weeks would be necessary  if the length of the charge sheet was anything to go by .   the crowd went silent .  even sybil ramkin was standing in astonishment .      what   s the matter .     said vimes to the upturned faces .     haven   t you ever seen a dragon being arrested before .            sixteen  three  ii  on the night of grune   th last  you did flame or cause to flame those premises known as the old watch house  ankh morpork valued at two hundred dollars  and that  sixteen  three  iii  on the night of grune   th last  upon being apprehended by an officer of the watch in the execution of his duty           i think we should hurry up     whispered vimes .     it   s getting rather restive .  is all this necessary .         well  i believe one can summarize     said carrot .     in exceptional circumstances  according to bregg   s rules for           it may come as a surprise  but these are exceptional circumstances  carrot     said vimes .     and they   re going to be really astonishingly exceptional if colon doesn   t hurry up with that rope .      more rubble moved as the dragon strained to get up .  there was a thump as a heavy beam was shouldered aside .  the crowd began to run for it .   it was at this point that errol came back over the rooftops in a series of minor explosions  leaving a trail of smoke rings .  dipping low  he buzzed the crowd and sent the front rank stumbling backward .   he was also wailing like a foghorn .   vimes grabbed carrot and stumbled down the heap as the king started to scrabble desperately to get free .        he   s come back for the kill .     he shouted .     it probably took him all this time just to slow down .      now errol was hovering over the fallen dragon  and hooting shrilly enough to bust bottles .   the great dragon stuck its head up in a cascade of plaster dust .  it opened its mouth but  instead of the lance of white fire that vimes tensed himself to expect  it merely made a noise like a kitten .  admittedly a kitten shouting into a tin bath at the bottom of a cave  but still a kitten .   broken spars fell aside when the huge creature got unsteadily to its feet .  the great wings opened  showering the surrounding streets with dust and bits of thatch .  some of it clanged off the helmet of sergeant colon  hurrying back with what looked like a small washing line coiled over his arm .      you   re letting it get up .     vimes shouted  pushing the sergeant to safety .     you   re not supposed to let it get up  errol .  don   t let it get up .      lady ramkin frowned .     that   s not right     she said .     they never usually fight like that .  the winner usually kills the loser .         right on .     shouted nobby .      and then half the time he explodes with the excitement in any case .         look  it   s me .     vimes yelled  as errol hovered unconcernedly over the scene .     i bought you the fluffy ball .  the one with the bell in it .  you can   t do this to us .         no  wait a minute     said lady ramkin  laying a hand on his arm .     i   m not sure we haven   t got hold of the wrong end of the stick here        the great dragon leapt into the air and brought its wings down with a whump that flattened a few more buildings .  the huge head swung around  the bleary eyes caught sight of vimes .     there seemed to be some thought going on inside them .   errol arced across the sky and hovered protectively in front of the captain  facing the thing down .  for a moment it looked as though he might be turned into a small flying charcoal biscuit  and then the dragon lowered its gaze in a slightly embarrassed way and started to rise .   it climbed in a wide spiral  gathering speed as it did so .  errol went with it  orbiting the huge body like a tug around a liner .      it   s   it   s as though he   s fussing over it     said vimes .      add up the bastard .     shouted nobby enthusiastically .      total  nobby     said colon .     you mean    total .         vimes felt lady ramkin   s gaze on the back of his neck .  he looked at her expression .   realization dawned .     oh     he said .   lady ramkin nodded .      really .     said vimes .      yes     she said .     i really ought to have thought of it before .  it was such a hot flame  of course .  and they   re always so much more territorial than the males .         why don   t you fight the bastard .     shouted nobby  at the dwindling dragons .      bitch  nobby     said vimes quietly .     not bastard .  bitch .         why don   t you fi   what .         it   s a member of the female gender     explained lady ramkin .      what .         we meant that if you tried your favorite kick  nobby  it wouldn   t work     said vimes .      it   s a girl     translated lady ramkin .      but it   s sodding enormous .     said nobby .   vimes coughed urgently .  nobby   s rodent eyes slid sideways to sybil ramkin  who blushed like a sunset .      a fine figure of a dragon  i mean     he said quickly .        er .  wide  egg bearing hips     said sergeant colon anxiously .      statueskew     nobby added fervently .      shut up     said vimes .  he brushed the dust off the remains of his uniform  adjusted the hang of his breastplate  and set his helmet on squarely .  he patted it firmly .  this wasn   t where it ended  he knew that .  this was where it all got started .      you men come with me .  come on  hurry .  while everyone   s still watching them     he added .      but what about the king .     said carrot .     or queen .  or whatever it is now .      vimes stared at the rapidly shrinking shapes .     i really don   t know     he said .     that   s up to errol  i suppose .  we   ve got other things to do .      colon saluted  still fighting for breath .     where we going  sir .     he managed .      to the palace .  any of you still got a sword .         you can use mine  captain     said carrot .  he handed it over .      right     said vimes quietly .  he glared at them .     let   s go .          the rank trailed behind vimes through the stricken streets .   he started to walk faster .  the rank started to trot to keep up .   vimes began to trot to keep ahead .   the rank broke into a canter .   then  as if on an unspoken word of command  they broke into a run .   then into a gallop .   people scurried away as they rattled past .  carrot   s enormous sandals hammered on the cobbles .  sparks flew up from the scads of nobby   s boots .  colon ran quietly for such a fat man  as fat men often do  face locked in a scowl of concentration .   they pounded along the street of cunning artificers  turned into hogsback alley  emerged into the street of small gods and thundered toward the palace .  vimes kept barely in the lead  mind currently empty of everything except the need to run and run .   at least  nearly everything .  but his head buzzed and resonated manically with those of all city guards everywhere  all the pavement pounding meatheads in the multiverse who had ever  just occasionally  tried to do what was right .   far ahead of them a handful of palace guards drew their swords  took a second look  thought better of it  darted back inside the wall and started to close the gates .  they clanged together as vimes arrived .   he hesitated  panting for breath  and looked at the massive things .  the ones that the dragon had burned had been replaced by gates even more forbidding .  from behind them came the sound of bolts sliding back .   this was no time for half measures .  he was a captain  godsdammit .  an officer .  things like this didn   t present a problem for an officer .  officers had a tried and tested way of solving problems like this .  it was called a sergeant .      sergeant colon .     he snapped  his mind still buzzing with universal policemanhood     shoot the lock off .      the sergeant hesitated .     what  sir .  with a bow and arrow  sir .         i mean       vimes hesitated .     i mean  open these gates .         sir .     colon saluted .  he glared at the gates for a moment .     right .     he barked .     lance constable carrot  one stepa forwarda  take .  lance constable carrot  inna youra owna timer .  open these gatesa .         yes  sir .        carrot stepped forward  saluted  folded an enormous hand into a fist and rapped gently on the woodwork .      open up     he said     in the name of the law .      there was some whispering on the other side of the gates  and eventually a small hatch halfway up the door slid open a fraction and a voice said     why .         because if you don   t it will be impeding an officer of the watch in the execution of his duty  which is punishable by a fine of not less than thirty dollars  one month   s imprisonment  or being remanded in custody for social inquiry reports and half an hour with a red hot poker     said carrot .   there was some more muffled whispering  the sound of bolts being drawn  and then the gates opened about halfway .   there was no one visible on the other side .   vimes put a finger to his lips .  he motioned carrot toward one gate and dragged nobby and colon to the other .      push     he whispered .  they pushed  hard .  there was a sudden eruption of pained cursing from behind the woodwork .      run .     shouted colon .      no .     shouted vimes .  he walked around the gate .  four semi crushed palace guards glowered at him .      no     he said .     no more running .  i want these men arrested .         you wouldn   t dare     said one of the men .  vimes peered at him .      clarence  isn   t it .     he said .     with a c .  well  clarence with a c  watch my lips .  either you can be charged with aiding and abetting or       he leaned closer  and glanced meaningfully at carrot      with an ax .         swivel on that one  doggybag .     added nobby  jumping from one foot to the other in vicious excitement .     clarence   s little piggy eyes glared at the looming bulk that was carrot  and then at vimes   s face .  there was absolutely no mercy there .  he appeared to reach a reluctant decision .      jolly good     said vimes .     lock them in the gatehouse  sergeant .      colon drew his bow and squared his shoulders .     you heard the man     he rasped .     one false move and you   re   you   re       he took a desperate stab at it      you   re home economics .         yeah .  slam    em up in the banger .     shouted nobby .  if worms could turn  nobby was revolving at generating speeds .     doucheballs .     he sneered  at their retreating backs .      aiding and abetting what  captain .     said carrot  as the weaponless guards trooped away .     you have to aid and abet something .         i think in this case it will just be generalized abetting     said vimes .     persistent and reckless abetment .         yeah     said nobby .     can   t stand abettors .  slime breaths .      colon handed captain vimes the guardhouse key .     it   s not very secure in there  captain     he said .     they   ll be able to break out eventually .         i hope so     said vimes     because the very first drain we come to  you   re going to drop the key down it .  everyone here .  right .  follow me .          lupine wonse scurried along the ruined corridors of the palace  the summoning of dragons under one arm  the glittering royal sword grasped uncertainly in one hand .   he halted  panting  in a doorway .   not a lot of his mind was currently in a state sane enough to have proper thoughts  but the small part that was still in business kept insisting that it couldn   t have seen what it had seen or heard what it had heard .   someone was following him .   and he   d seen vetinari walking through the palace .  he knew the man was securely put away .  the lock was completely unpickable .  he remembered the patrician being absolutely insistent that it be an unpickable lock when it was installed .   there was movement in the shadows at the end of the passage .  wonse gibbered a bit  fumbled with the doorhandle beside him  darted in  slammed the door and leaned against it  fighting for breath .   he opened his eyes .   he was in the old private audience room .  the patrician was sitting in his old seat  one leg crossed on the other  watching him with mild interest .      ah  wonse     he said .   wonse jumped  scrabbled at the doorhandle  leapt into the corridor and ran for it until he reached the main staircase  rising now through the ruins of the central palace like a forlorn corkscrew .  stairs   height   high ground   defense .  he ran up them three at a time .   all he needed was a few minutes of peace .  then he   d show them .   the upper floors were more full of shadows .  what they were short on was structural strength .  pillars and walls had been torn out by the dragon as it built its cave .  rooms gaped pathetically on the edge of the abyss .  dangling shreds of wall hanging and carpet flapped in the wind from the smashed windows .  the floor sprang and wobbled like a trampoline as wonse scurried across it .  he struggled to the nearest door .      that was commendably fast     said the patrician .     wonse slammed the door in his face and ran  squeaking  down a corridor .   sanity took a brief hold .  he paused by a statue .  there was no sound  no hurrying footsteps  no whirr of hidden doors .  he gave the statue a suspicious look and prodded it with the sword .   when it failed to move he opened the nearest door and slammed it behind him  found a chair and wedged it under the handle .  this was one of the upper state rooms  bare now of most of its furnishings  and lacking its fourth wall .  where it should have been was just the gulf of the cavern .   the patrician stepped out of the shadows .      now you have got it out of your system       he said .   wonse spun around  sword raised .      you don   t really exist     he said .     you   re a   a ghost  or something .         i believe this is not the case     said the patrician .      you can   t stop me .  i   ve got some magic stuff left  i   ve got the book .     wonse took a brown leather bag out of his pocket .     i   ll bring back another one .  you   ll see .         i urge you not to     said lord vetinari mildly .      oh  you think you   re so clever  so in control  so swave  just because i   ve got a sword and you haven   t .  well  i   ve got more than that  i   ll have you know     said wonse triumphantly .     yes .  i   ve got the palace guards on my side .  they follow me  not you .  no one likes you  you know .  no one ever liked you .      he swung the sword so that its needle point was a foot from the patrician   s thin chest .      so it   s back to the cells for you     he said .     and this time i   ll make sure you stay there .  guards .  guards .      there was the clatter of running feet outside .  the door rattled  the chair shook .  there was a moment   s silence  and then door and chair erupted in splinters .        take him away .     screamed wonse .     fetch more scorpions .  put him in   you   re not the           put the sword down     said vimes  while behind him carrot picked bits of door out of his fist .      yeah     said nobby  peering around the captain .     up against the wall and spread    em  motherbreath .         eh .  what   s he supposed to spread .     whispered sergeant colon anxiously .   nobby shrugged .     dunno     he said .     everything  i reckon .  safest way .      wonse stared at the rank in disbelief .      ah  vimes     said the patrician .     you will           shut up     said vimes calmly .     lance constable carrot .         sir .         read the prisoner his rights .         yes  sir .     carrot produced his notebook  licked his thumb  flicked through the pages .      lupine wonse     he said     aka lupin squiggle sec   y pp           wha .     said wonse .         currently domiciled in the domicile known as the palace  ankh morpork it is my duty to inform you that you have been arrested and will be charged with       carrot gave vimes an agonized look      a number of offenses of murder by means of a blunt instrument  to whit  a dragon  and many further offenses of generalized abetting  to be more specifically ascertained later .  you have the right to remain silent .  you have the right to be summarily thrown into a piranha tank .  you have the right to trial by ordeal .  you have the           this is madness     said the patrician calmly .      i thought i told you to shut up .     snapped vimes  spinning around and shaking a finger under the patrician   s nose .        tell me  sarge     whispered nobby     do you think we   re going to like it in the scorpion pit .            say anything  er  but anything you do say will be written down  er  here  in my notebook  and  er  may be used in evidence        carrot   s voice trailed into silence .      well  if this pantomime gives you any pleasure  vimes     said the patrician eventually     take him down to the cells .  i   ll deal with him in the morning .      wonse made no signal .  there was no scream or cry .  he just rushed at the patrician  sword raised .   options flickered across vimes   s mind .  in the lead came the suggestion that standing back would be a good plan  let wonse do it  disarm him afterward  let the city clean itself up .  yes .  a good plan .   and it was therefore a total mystery to him why he chose to dart forward  bringing carrot   s sword up in a half baked attempt at blocking the stroke     perhaps it was something to do with doing it by the book .   there was a clang .  not a particularly loud one .  he felt something bright and silver whirr past his ear and strike the wall .   wonse   s mouth fell open .  he dropped the remnant of his sword and backed away  clutching the summoning .      you   ll be sorry     he hissed .     you   ll all be very sorry .      he started to mumble under his breath .   vimes felt himself trembling .  he was pretty certain he knew what had zinged past his head  and the mere thought was making his hands sweat .  he   d come to the palace ready to kill and there   d been this minute  just this minute  when for once the world had seemed to be operating properly and he was in charge of it and now  now all he wanted was a drink .  and a nice week   s sleep .        oh  give up .     he said .     are you going to come quietly .      the mumbling went on .  the air began to feel hot and dry .   vimes shrugged .     that   s it  then     he said  and turned away .     throw the book at him  carrot .         right  sir .      vimes remembered too late .   dwarfs have trouble with metaphors .   they also have a very good aim .   the laws and ordinances of ankh and morpork caught the secretary on the forehead .  he blinked  staggered  and stepped backward .   it was the longest step he ever took .  for one thing  it lasted the rest of his life .   after several seconds they heard him hit  five storys below .   after several more seconds their faces appeared over the edge of the ravaged floor .      what a way to go     said sergeant colon .      that   s a fact     said nobby  reaching up to his ear for a dog end .      killed by a wossname .  a metaphor .         dunno     said nobby .     looks like the ground to me .  got a light  sarge .         that was right  wasn   t it  sir .     said carrot anxiously .     you said to           yes  yes     said vimes .     don   t worry .     he reached down with a shaking hand  picked up the bag wonse had been holding  and tipped out a pile of stones .  every one had a hole in it .  why .  he thought .   a metallic noise behind him made him look around .  the patrician was holding the remains of the royal sword .  as the captain watched  the man wrenched the other half of the sword out of the far wall .  it was a clean break .      captain vimes     he said .        sir .         that sword  if you please .      vimes handed it over .  he couldn   t  right now  think of anything else to do .  he was probably due for a scorpion pit of his very own as it was .   lord vetinari examined the rusty blade carefully .      how long have you had this  captain .     he said mildly .      isn   t mine  sir .  belongs to lance constable carrot  sir .         lance    .         me  sir  your graciousness     said carrot  saluting .      ah .      the patrician turned the blade over and over slowly  staring at it as if fascinated .  vimes felt the air thicken  as though history was clustering around this point  but for the life of him he couldn   t think why .  this was one of those points where the trousers of time bifurcated themselves  and if you weren   t careful you   d go down the wrong leg         wonse arose in a world of shades  icy confusion pouring into his mind .  but all he could think of at the moment was the tall cowled figure standing over him .      i thought you were all dead     he mumbled .  it was strangely quiet and the colors around him seemed washed out  muted .  something was very wrong .     is that you  brother doorkeeper .     he ventured .   the figure reached out .   metaphorically  it said .          and the patrician handed the sword to carrot .      very well done  young man     he said .     captain vimes  i suggest you give your men the rest of the day off .         thank you  sir     said vimes .     okay  lads .  you heard his lordship .         but not you  captain .  we must have a little talk .           yes  sir .     said vimes innocently .   the rank scurried out  giving vimes sympathetic and sorrowful glances .   the patrician walked to the edge of the floor and looked down .      poor wonse     he said .      yes  sir .     vimes stared at the wall .      i would have preferred him alive  you know .         sir .         misguided  yes  but a useful man .  his head could have been of further use to me .         yes  sir .         the rest  of course  we could have thrown away .         yes  sir .         that was a joke  vimes .         yes  sir .         the chap never grasped the idea of secret passages  mind you .         no  sir .         that young fellow .  carrot  you called him .         yes  sir .         keen fellow .  likes it in the watch .         yes  sir .  right at home  sir .         you saved my life .         sir .         come with me .      he stalked away through the ruined palace  vimes trailing behind  until he reached the oblong office .  it was quite tidy .  it had escaped most of the devastation with nothing more than a layer of dust .  the patrician sat down  and suddenly it was as if he   d never left .  vimes wondered if he ever had .   he picked up a sheaf of papers and brushed the plaster off them .        sad     he said .     lupine was such a tidy minded man .         yes  sir .      the patrician steepled his hands and looked at vimes over the top of them .      let me give you some advice  captain     he said .      yes  sir .         it may help you make some sense of the world .         sir .         i believe you find life such a problem because you think there are the good people and the bad people     said the man .     you   re wrong  of course .  there are  always and only  the bad people  but some of them are on opposite sides .      he waved his thin hand toward the city and walked over to the window .      a great rolling sea of evil     he said  almost proprietorially .     shallower in some places  of course  but deeper  oh  so much deeper in others .  but people like you put together little rafts of rules and vaguely good intentions and say  this is the opposite  this will triumph in the end .  amazing .     he slapped vimes good naturedly on the back .      down there     he said     are people who will follow any dragon  worship any god  ignore any iniquity .  all out of a kind of humdrum  everyday badness .  not the really high  creative loathesomeness of the great sinners  but a sort of mass produced darkness of the soul .  sin  you might say  without a trace of originality .  they accept evil not because they say yes  but because they don   t say no .  i   m sorry if this offends you     he added  patting the captain   s shoulder     but you fellows really need us .         yes  sir .     said vimes quietly .      oh  yes .  we   re the only ones who know how to make things work .  you see  the only thing the good people are good at is overthrowing the bad people .  and you   re good at that  i   ll grant you .  but the trouble is that it   s the only thing you   re good at .  one day it   s the ringing of the bells and the casting down of the evil tyrant  and the next it   s everyone sitting around complaining that ever since the tyrant was overthrown no one   s been taking out the trash .  because the bad people know how to plan .  it   s part of the specification  you might say .  every evil tyrant has a plan to rule the world .  the good people don   t seem to have the knack .         maybe .  but you   re wrong about the rest .     said vimes .     it   s just because people are afraid  and alone       he paused .  it sounded pretty hollow  even to him .   he shrugged .     they   re just people     he said .     they   re just doing what people do .  sir .      lord vetinari gave him a friendly smile .      of course  of course     he said .     you have to believe that  i appreciate .  otherwise you   d go quite mad .  otherwise you   d think you   re standing on a feather thin bridge over the vaults of hell .  otherwise existence would be a dark agony and the only hope would be that there is no life after death .  i quite understand .     he looked at his desk  and sighed .     and now     he said     there is such a lot to do .  i   m afraid poor wonse was a good servant but an inefficient master .  so you may go .  have a good night   s sleep .  oh  and do bring your men in tomorrow .  the city must show its gratitude .         it must what .     said vimes .   the patrician looked at a scroll .  already his voice was back to the distant tones of one who organizes and plans and controls .      it   s gratitude     he said .     after every triumphant victory there must be heroes .  it is essential .  then everyone will know that everything has been done properly .      he glanced at vimes over the top of the scroll .      it   s all part of the natural order of things     he said .     after a while he made a few pencil annotations to the paper in front of him and looked up .      i said     he said     that you may go .      vimes paused at the door .      do you believe all that  sir .     he said .     about the endless evil and the sheer blackness .         indeed  indeed     said the patrician  turning over the page .     it is the only logical conclusion .         but you get out of bed every morning  sir .         hmm .  yes .  what is your point .         i   d just like to know why  sir .         oh  do go away  vimes .  there   s a good fellow .          in the dark and drafty cave hacked from the heart of the palace the librarian knuckled across the floor .  he clambered over the remains of the sad hoard and looked down at the splayed body of wonse .   then he reached down  very gently  and prised the summoning of dragons from the stiffening fingers .  he blew the dust off it .  he brushed it tenderly  as if it was a frightened child .   he turned to climb down the heap  and stopped .  he bent down again  and carefully pulled another book from among the glittering rubble .  it wasn   t one of his  except in the wide sense that all books came under his domain .  he turned a few pages carefully .      keep it     said vimes behind him .     take it away .  put it somewhere .      the orangutan nodded at the captain  and rattled down the heap .  he tapped vimes gently on the kneecap  opened the summoning of dragons  leafed through its ravaged pages until he found the one he   d been looking for  and silently passed the book up .     vimes squinted at the crabbed writing .   yet draggons are notte liken unicornes  i willen .  they dwellyth in some realm defin  d bye thee fancie of the wille and  thus  it myte bee thate whomsoever calleth upon them  and giveth them theyre patheway unto thys worlde  calleth theyre owne dragon of the mind .   yette  i trow  the pure in harte maye stille call a draggon of power as a forse for goode in thee worlde  and this ane nighte the grate worke will commense .  all bathe been prepared .  i hath labored most mytily to be a worthie vessle     a realm of fancy  vimes thought .  that   s where they went  then .  into our imaginations .  and when we call them back we shape them  like squeezing dough into pastry shapes .  only you don   t get gingerbread men  you get what you are .  your own darkness  given shape     vimes read it through again  and then looked at the following pages .   there weren   t many .  the rest of the book was a charred mass .   vimes handed it back to the ape .      what kind of a man was de malachite .     he said .   the librarian gave this the consideration due from someone who knew the dictionary of city biography by heart .  then he shrugged .      particularly holy .     said vimes .   the ape shook his head .      well  noticeably evil  then .      the ape shrugged  and shook his head again .      if i were you     said vimes     i   d put that book somewhere very safe .  and the book of the law with it .  they   re too bloody dangerous .         oook .        vimes stretched .     and now     he said     let   s go and have a drink .         oook .         but just a small one .         oook .         and you   re paying .         eeek .      vimes stopped and stared down at the big  mild face .      tell me     he said .     i   ve always wanted to know   is it better  being an ape .      the librarian thought about it .     oook     he said .      oh .  really .     said vimes .       it was next day .  the room was wall to wall with civic dignitaries .  the patrician sat on his severe chair  surrounded by the council .  everyone present was wearing the shiny waxen grins of those bent on good works .   lady sybil ramkin sat off to one side  wearing a few acres of black velvet .  the ramkin family jewels glittered on her fingers  neck and in the black curls of today   s wig .  the total effect was striking  like a globe of the heavens .   vimes marched the rank to the center of the hall and stamped to a halt with his helmet under his arm  as per regulations .  he   d been amazed to see that even nobby had made an effort   the suspicion of shiny metal could be seen here and there on his breastplate .  and colon was wearing an expression of almost constipated importance .  carrot   s armor gleamed .   colon ripped off a textbook salute for the first time in his life .      all present and correct  sah .     he barked .      very good  sergeant     said vimes coldly .  he turned to the patrician and raised an eyebrow politely .     lord vetinari gave a little wave of his hand .      stand easy  or whatever it is you chaps do     he said .     i   m sure we needn   t wait on ceremony here .  what do you say  captain .         just as you like  sir     said vimes .      now  men     said the patrician  leaning forward     we have heard some remarkable accounts of your magnificent efforts in defense of the city        vimes let his mind wander as the golden platitudes floated past .  for a while he derived a certain amount of amusement from watching the faces of the council .  a whole sequence of expressions drifted across them as the patrician spoke .  it was  of course  vitally important that there be a ceremony like this .  then the whole thing could be neat and settled .  and forgotten .  just another chapter in the long and exciting history of eckcetra  eckcetra .  ankh morpork was good at starting new chapters .   his trawling gaze fell on lady ramkin .  she winked .  vimes   s eyes swiveled front again  his expression suddenly as wooden as a plank .         token of our gratitude     the patrician finished  sitting back .   vimes realized that everyone was looking at him .      pardon .     he said .      i said  we have been trying to think of some suitable recompense  captain vimes .  various public spirited citizens       the patrician   s eyes took in the council and lady ramkin      and  of course  myself  feel that an appropriate reward is due .      vimes still looked blank .      reward .     he said .      it is customary for such heroic endeavor     said the patrician  a little testily .     vimes faced forward again .     really haven   t thought about it  sir     he said .     can   t speak for the men  of course .      there was an awkward pause .  out of the corner of his eye vimes was aware of nobby nudging the sergeant in the ribs .  eventually colon stumbled forward and ripped off another salute .     permission to speak  sir     he muttered .   the patrician nodded graciously .   the sergeant coughed .  he removed his helmet and pulled out a scrap of paper .      er     he said .     the thing is  saving your honor   s presence  we think  you know  what with saving the city and everything  or sort of  or  what i mean is   we just had a go  you see  man on the spot and that sort of thing   the thing is  we reckon we   re entitled .  if you catch my drift .      the assembled company nodded .  this was exactly how it should be .      do go on     said the patrician .      so we  like  put our heads together     said the sergeant .     a bit of a cheek  i know           please carry on  sergeant     said the patrician .     you needn   t keep stopping .  we are well aware of the magnitude of the matter .         right  sir .  well  sir .  first  it   s the wages .         the wages .     said lord vetinari .  he stared at vimes  who stared at nothing .   the sergeant raised his head .  his expression was the determined expression of a man who is going to see it through .      yes  sir     he said .     thirty dollars a month .  it   s not right .  we think       he licked his lips and glanced behind him at the other two  who were making vague encouraging motions      we think a basic rate of  er  thirty five dollars .  a month .     he stared at the patrician   s stony expression .     with increments as per rank .  we thought five dollars .        he licked his lips again  unnerved by the patrician   s expression .     we won   t go below four     he said .     and that   s flat .  sorry  your highness  but there it is .      the patrician glanced again at vimes   s impassive face  then looked back at the rank .      that   s it .     he said .   nobby whispered in colon   s ear and then darted back .  the sweating sergeant gripped his helmet as though it was the only real thing in the world .      there was another thing  your reverence     he said .      ah .     the patrician smiled knowingly .      there   s the kettle .  it wasn   t much good anyway  and then errol et it .  it was nearly two dollars .     he swallowed .     we could do with a new kettle  if it   s all the same  your lordship .      the patrician leaned forward  gripping the arms of his chair .      i want to be clear about this     he said coldly .     are we to believe that you are asking for a petty wage increase and a domestic utensil .      carrot whispered in colon   s other ear .   colon turned two bulging  watery rimmed eyes to the dignitaries .  the rim of his helmet was passing through his fingers like a millwheel .      well     he began     sometimes  we thought  you know  when we has our dinner break  or when it   s quiet  like  at the end of a watch as it may be  and we want to relax a bit  you know  wind down       his voice trailed away .      yes .      colon took a deep breath .      i suppose a dartboard would be out of the question    .      the thunderous silence that followed was broken by an erratic snorting .     vimes   s helmet dropped out of his shaking hand .  his breastplate wobbled as the suppressed laughter of the years burst out in great uncontrollable eruptions .  he turned his face to the row of councillors and laughed and laughed until the tears came .   laughed at the way they got up  all confusion and outraged dignity .   laughed at the patrician   s carefully immobile expression .   laughed for the world and the saving of souls .   laughed and laughed  and laughed until the tears came .   nobby craned up to reach colon   s ear .      i told you     he hissed .     i said they   d never wear it .  i knew a dartboard   d be pushing our luck .  you   ve upset    em all now .          dear mother and father  wrote carrot  you will never guess  i have been in the watch only a few weeks and  already i am to be a full constable .  captain vimes said  the patrician himself said i was to be one  and that also he hoped i should have a long and successful career in the watch as well and  he would follow it with special interest .  also my wages are to go up by ten dollars and we had a special bonus of twenty dollars that captain vimes paid for out of his own pocket  sgt .  colon said .  please find money enclosed .  i am keeping a little bit by though because i went to see reet and mrs .  palm said all the girls had been following my career with great interest as well and i am to come to dinner on my night off .  sgt .  colon has been telling me about how to start courting  which is very interesting and not at all complicated it appears .  i arrested a dragon but it got away .  i hope mr .  varneshi is well .   i am as happy as anyone can be in the whole world .   your son  carrot .       vimes knocked on the door .   an effort had been made to spruce up the ramkin mansion  he noticed .  the encroaching shrubbery had been pitilessly hacked back .  an elderly workman atop a ladder was nailing the stucco back on the walls while another  with a spade  was rather arbitrarily defining the line where the lawn ended and the old flower beds had begun .   vimes stuck his helmet under his arm  smoothed back his hair  and knocked .  he   d considered asking sergeant colon to accompany him  but had brushed the idea aside quickly .  he couldn   t have tolerated the sniggering .  anyway  what was there to be afraid of .  he   d stared into the jaws of death three times  four  if you included telling lord vetinari to shut up .   to his amazement the door was eventually opened by a butler so elderly that he might have been resurrected by the knocking .      yerss .     he said .      captain vimes  city watch     said vimes .   the man looked him up and down .      oh  yes     he said .     her ladyship did say .  i believe her ladyship is with her dragons     he said .     if you like to wait in    ere  i will           i know the way     said vimes  and set off around the overgrown path .   the kennels were a ruin .  an assortment of battered wooden boxes were lying around under an oilcloth awning .  from their depths a few sad swamp dragons whiffled a greeting at him .   a couple of women were moving purposefully among the boxes .  ladies  rather .  they were far too untidy to be mere women .  no ordinary women would have dreamed of looking so scruffy  you needed the complete self confidence that comes with knowing who your great great great great grandfather was before you could wear clothes like that .  but they were  vimes noticed  incredibly good clothes  or had been once  clothes bought by one   s parents  but so expensive and of such good quality that they never wore out and were handed down  like old china and silverware and gout .   dragon breeders  he thought .  you can tell .  there   s something about them .  it   s the way they wear their silk scarves  old tweed coats and granddad   s riding boots .  and the smell  of course .   a small wiry woman with a face like old saddle leather caught sight of him .      ah     she said     you   ll be the gallant captain .     she tucked an errant strand of white hair back under a headscarf and extended a veiny brown hand .     brenda rodley .  that   s rosie devant molei .  she runs the sunshine sanctuary  you know .     the other woman  who had the build of someone who could pick up carthorses in one hand and shoe them with the other  gave him a friendly grin .      samuel vimes     said vimes weakly .      my father was a sam     said brenda vaguely .     you can always trust a sam  he said .     she shooed a dragon back into its box .     we   re just helping sybil .  old friends  you know .  the collection   s all to blazes  of course .  they   re all over the city  the little devils .  i dare say they   ll come back when they   re hungry  though .  what a bloodline  eh .         i   m sorry .         sybil reckons he was a sport  but i say we should be able to breed back into the line in three or four generations .  i   m famed for my stud  you know     she said .     that   d be something  though .  a whole new type of dragon .        vimes thought of supersonic contrails criss crossing the sky .      er     he said .     yes .         well  we must get on .         er  isn   t lady ramkin around .     said vimes .     i got this message that it was essential  she said  for me to come here .         she   s indoors somewhere     said miss rodley .     said she had something important to see to .  oh  do be careful with that one  rose  you silly gel .         more important than dragons .     said vimes .      yes .  can   t think what   s come over her .     brenda rodley fished in the pocket of an oversized waistcoat .     nice to have met you  captain .  always good to meet new members of the fancy .  do drop in any time you   re passing  i   d be only too happy to show you around .     she extracted a grubby card and pressed it into his hand .     must be off now  we   ve heard that some of them are trying to build nests on the university tower .  can   t have that .  must get    em down before it gets dark .      vimes squinted at the card as the women crunched off down the drive  carrying nets and ropes .   it said  brenda  lady rodley .  the dower house  quirm castle  quirm .  what it meant  he realized  was that striding away down the path like an animated rummage stall was the dowager duchess of quirm  who owned more country than you could see from a very high mountain on a very clear day .  nobby would not have approved .  there seemed to be a special kind of poverty that only the very  very rich could possibly afford     that was how you got to be a power in the land  he thought .  you never cared a toss about whatever anyone else thought and you were never  ever  uncertain about anything .   he padded back to the house .  a door was open .  it led into a large but dark and musty hall .  up in the gloom the heads of dead animals haunted the walls .  the ramkins seemed to have endangered more species than an ice age .   vimes wandered aimlessly through another mahogany archway .   it was a dining room  containing the kind of table where the people at the other end are in a different time zone .  one end had been colonized by silver candlesticks .   it was laid for two .  a battery of cutlery flanked each plate .  antique wineglasses sparkled in the candlelight .   a terrible premonition took hold of vimes at the same moment as a gust of captivation  the most expensive perfume available anywhere in ankh morpork blew past him .      ah  captain .  so nice of you to come .      vimes turned around slowly  without his feet appearing to move .   lady ramkin stood there  magnificently .   vimes was vaguely aware of a brilliant blue dress that sparkled in the candlelight  a mass of hair the color of chestnuts  a slightly anxious face that suggested that a whole battalion of skilled painters and decorators had only just dismantled their scaffolding and gone home  and a faint creaking that said underneath it all mere corsetry was being subjected to the kind of tensions more usually found in the heart of large stars .      i  er     he said .     if you  er .  if you   d said  er .  i   d  er .  dress more suitable  er .  extremely  er .  very .  er .      she bore down upon him like a glittering siege engine .   in a sort of dream he allowed himself to be ushered to a seat .  he must have eaten  because servants appeared out of nowhere with things stuffed with other things  and came back later and took the plates away .  the butler reanimated occasionally to fill glass after glass with strange wines .  the heat from the candles was enough to cook by .  and all the time lady ramkin talked in a bright and brittle way   about the size of the house  the responsibilities of a huge estate  the feeling that it was time to take one   s position in society more seriously  while the setting sun filled the room with red and vimes   s head began to spin .   society  he managed to think  didn   t know what was going to hit it .  dragons weren   t mentioned once  although after a while something under the table put its head on vimes   s knee and dribbled .   vimes found it impossible to contribute to the conversation .  he felt outflanked  beleaguered .  he made one sally  hoping maybe to reach high ground from which to flee into exile .      where do you think they   ve gone .     he said .      where what .     said lady ramkin  temporarily halted .      the dragons .  you know .  errol and his wi   female .         oh  somewhere isolated and rocky  i should imagine     said lady ramkin .     favorite country for dragons .         but it   she   s a magical animal     said vimes .     what   ll happen when the magic goes away .      lady ramkin gave him a shy smile .      most people seem to manage     she said .   she reached across the table and touched his hand .      your men think you need looking after     she said meekly .      oh .  do they .     said vimes .      sergeant colon said he thought we   d get along like a maison en flamb   .         oh .  did he .         and he said something else     she said .     what was it  now .  oh  yes     it   s a million to one chance        said lady ramkin     i think he said     but it might just work .         she smiled at him .   and then it arose and struck vimes that  in her own special category  she was quite beautiful  this was the category of all the women  in his entire life  who had ever thought he was worth smiling at .  she couldn   t do worse  but then  he couldn   t do better .  so maybe it balanced out .  she wasn   t getting any younger but then  who was .  and she had style and money and common sense and self assurance and all the things that he didn   t  and she had opened her heart  and if you let her she could engulf you  the woman was a city .   and eventually  under siege  you did what ankh morpork had always done   unbar the gates  let the conquerors in  and make them your own .   how did you start .  she seemed to be expecting something .   he shrugged  and picked up his wine glass and sought for a phrase .  one crept into his wildly resonating mind .      here   s looking at you  kid     he said .       the gongs of various midnights banged out the old day .       and further toward the hub  where the ramtop mountains joined the forbidding spires of the central massif  where strange hairy creatures roamed the eternal snows  where blizzards howled around the freezing peaks  the lights of a lone lamasery shone out over the high valleys .  in the courtyard a couple of yellow robed monks stacked the last case of small green bottles onto a sleigh  ready for the first leg of the incredibly difficult journey down to the distant plains .  the box was labeled  in careful brush strokes     mstr .  c . m . o . t .  dibbler  ankh morpork .         you know  lobsang     said one of them     one cannot help wondering what it is he does with this stuff .       corporal nobbs and sergeant colon lounged in the shadows near the mended drum  but straightened up as carrot came out bearing a tray .  detritus the troll stepped aside respectfully .        here we are  lads     said carrot .     three pints .  on the house .         bloody hell  i never thought you   d do it     said colon  grasping a handle .     what did you say to him .         i just explained how it was the duty of all good citizens to help the guard at all times     said carrot innocently     and i thanked him for his cooperation .         yeah  and the rest     said nobby .      no  that was all i said .         then you must have a really convincing tone of voice .         ah .  well  make the most of it  lads  while it lasts     said colon .   they drank thoughtfully .  it was a moment of supreme peace  a few minutes snatched from the realities of real life .  it was a brief bite of stolen fruit and enjoyed as such .  no one in the whole city seemed to be fighting or stabbing or making affray and  just for now  it was possible to believe that this wonderful state of affairs might continue .   and even if it didn   t  then there were memories to get them through .  of running  and people getting out of the way .  of the looks on the faces of the horrible palace guard .  of  when all the thieves and heroes and gods had failed  of being there .  of nearly doing things nearly right .   nobby shoved the pot on a convenient windowsill  stamped some life back into his feet and blew on his fingers .  a brief fumble in the dark recesses of his ear produced a fragment of cigarette .      what a time  eh .     said colon contentedly  as the flare of a match illuminated the three of them .   the others nodded .  yesterday seemed like a lifetime ago  even now .  but you could never forget something like that  no matter who else did  no matter what happened from now on .        if i never see any bloody king it   ll be too soon     said nobby .      i don   t reckon he was the right king  anyway     said carrot .     talking of kings  anyone want a crisp .         there   s no right kings     said colon  but without much rancor .  ten dollars a month was going to make a big difference .  mrs .  colon was acting very differently toward a man bringing home another ten dollars a month .  her notes on the kitchen table were a lot more friendly .      no  but i mean  there   s nothing special about having an ancient sword     said carrot .     or a birthmark .  i mean  look at me .  i   ve got a birthmark on my arm .         my brother   s got one  too     said colon .     shaped like a boat .         mine   s more like a crown thing     said carrot .      oho  that makes you a king  then     grinned nobby .     stands to reason .         i don   t see why .  my brother   s not an admiral     said colon reasonably .      and i   ve got this sword     said carrot .   he drew it .  colon took it from his hand  and turned it over and over in the light from the flare over the drum   s door .  the blade was dull and short  and notched like a saw .  it was well made and there might have been an inscription on it once  but it had long ago been worn into indecipherability by sheer use .      it   s a nice sword     he said thoughtfully .     well balanced .         but not one for a king     said carrot .     kings    swords are big and shiny and magical and have jewels on and when you hold them up they catch the light  ting .         ting     said colon .     yes .  i suppose they have to  really .         i   m just saying you can   t go round giving people thrones just because of stuff like that     said carrot .     that   s what captain vimes said .         nice job  mind     said nobby .     good hours  kinging .         hmm .     colon had momentarily been lost in a little world of speculation .  real kings had shiny swords  obviously .  except  except  except maybe your real real king of  like  days of yore  he would have a sword that didn   t sparkle one bit but was bloody efficient at cutting things .  just a thought .      i say kinging   s a good job     nobby repeated .     short hours .         yeah .  yeah .  but not long days     said colon .  he gave carrot a thoughtful look .      ah .  there   s that  of course .         anyway  my father says being king   s too much like hard work     said carrot .     all the surveying and assaying and everything .     he drained his pint .     it   s not the kind of thing for the likes of us .  us       he looked proudly      guards .  you all right  sergeant .         hmm .  what .  oh .  yes .     colon shrugged .  what about it  anyway .  maybe things turned out for the best .  he finished the beer .     best be off     he said .     what time was it .         about twelve o   clock     said carrot .      anything else .      carrot gave it some thought .     and all   s well .     he said .      right .  just testing .         you know     said nobby     the way you say it  lad  you could almost believe it was true .          let the eye of attention pull back     this is the disc  world and mirror of worlds  borne through space on the back of four giant elephants who stand on the back of great a    tuin the sky turtle .  around the rim of this world the ocean pours off endlessly into the night .  at its hub rises the ten mile spike of the cori celesti  on whose glittering summit the gods play games with the fates of men        if you know what the rules are  and who are the players .   on the far edge of the disc the sun was rising .  the light of the morning began to flow across the patchwork of seas and continents  but it did so slowly  because light is tardy and slightly heavy in the presence of a magical field .   on the dark crescent  where the old light of sunset had barely drained from the deepest valleys  two specks  one big  one small  flew out of the shadow  skimmed low across the swells of the rim ocean  and struck out determinedly over the totally unfathomable  star dotted depths of space .   perhaps the magic would last .  perhaps it wouldn   t .  but then  what does .       the end      about the author      terry pratchett is one of the most

raisins .     the dictionary would have been invaluable for the supreme grand master when he thought up the society   s oaths  since it also includes welchet     a type of waistcoat worn by certain clock makers      gaskin     a shy  gray brown bird of the coot family      and moules     a game of skill and dexterity  involving tortoises     .        the pronoun is used by dwarfs to indicate

one of the remarkable innovations introduced by the patrician was to make the thieves    guild responsible for theft  with annual budgets  forward planning and  above all  rigid job protection .  thus  in return for an agreed average level of crime per annum  the thieves themselves saw to it that unauthorized crime was met with the full force of injustice  which was generally a stick with nails in it .        lit     good day .  good day .  what is all of this that is going on here  in this place   .              listen  sunshine  lit     the stare of the great hot eye in the sky whose fiery

outlawed by the patrician the previous year after many complaints .  the point was that  if you bought a contract from the guild  your house would be protected against fire .  unfortunately  the general ankh morpork ethos quickly came to the fore and fire fighters would tend to go to prospective clients    houses in groups  making loud comments like    very inflammable looking place  this    and    probably go up like a firework with just one carelessly dropped match  know what i mean .           a species of geranium .        some rioters can be quite ell educated .        the phrase

city law said that only condemned criminals should be used  but that was all right because in most of the religions refusing to volunteer for sacrifice was an offense punishable by death .
