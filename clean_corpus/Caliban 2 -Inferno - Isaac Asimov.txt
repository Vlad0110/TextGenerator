it would require a volume longer than this one to tell all of what we owe him .  suffice to say that  without him  there would be no three laws  no robots  no spacers or settlers  and no inferno .  we will miss him .     roger macbride allen  the original laws of robotics  i a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .   ii a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .   iii a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law  the new laws of robotics  i a robot may not injure a human being .   ii a robot must cooperate with human beings except where such cooperation would conflict with the first law .   iii a robot must protect its own existence  as long as such protection does not conflict with the first law .   iv a robot may do anything it likes  except where such action would violate the first  second  or third laws .   the spacer settler struggle was at its beginning  and at its end  an ideological contest .  indeed  to take a page from primitive studies  it might more accurately be termed a theological battle  for both sides clung to their positions more out of faith  fear  and tradition rather than through any carefully reasoned marshaling of the facts .  always  whether acknowledged or not  there was one issue at the center of every confrontation between the two sides  robots .  one side regarded them as the ultimate good  while the other saw them as the ultimate evil .  spacers were the descendants of men and women who had fled semi mythical earth  with their robots  when robots were banned there .  exiled from earth  they traveled in crude star  ships on the first wave of colonization .  with the aid of their robots  the spacers terraformed fifty worlds and created a culture of great beauty and refinement  where all unpleasant tasks were left to the robots .  ultimately  virtually all work was left to the robots .  having colonized fifty planets  the spacers called a halt  and set themselves no other task than enjoying the fruits of their robots    labor .  the settlers were the descendants of those who stayed behind on earth .  their ancestors lived in great underground cities  built to be safe from atomic attack .  it is beyond doubt that this way of life induced a certain xenophobia into settler culture .  that xenophobia long survived the threat of atomic war  and came to be directed against the smug spacers  and their robots .  it was fear that had caused earth to cast out robots in the first place .  part of it was an irrational fear of metal monsters wandering the landscape .  however  the people of earth had more reasonable fears as well .  they worried that robots would take jobs  and the means of making a living  from humans .  most seriously  they looked to what they saw as the indolence  the lethargy  and the decadence of spacer society .  the settlers feared that robots would relieve humanity of its spirit  its will  its ambition  even as they relieved humanity of its burdens .  the spacers  meanwhile  had grown disdainful of the people they perceived to be grubby underground dwellers .  spacers came to deny their common ancestry with the people who had cast them out .  but so too did they lose their own ambition .  their technology  their culture  their worldview  all became static  if not stagnant .  the spacer ideal seemed to be a universe where nothing ever happened  where yesterday and tomorrow were like today  and the robots took care of all the unpleasant details .  the settlers set out to colonize the galaxy in earnest  terraforming endless worlds  leapfrogging past the spacer worlds and spacer technology .  the settlers carried with them the traditional viewpoints of the home world .  every encounter with the spacers seemed to confirm the settlers    reasons for distrusting robots .  fear and hatred of robots became one of the foundations of settler policy and philosophy .  robot hatred  coupled with the rather arrogant spacer style  did little to endear spacer to settler .  but still  sometimes  somehow  the two sides managed to cooperate  however great the friction and suspicion .  people of goodwill on both sides attempted to cast aside fear and hatred to work together  with varying success .  it was on inferno  one of the smallest  weakest  most fragile of the spacer worlds  that spacer and settler made one of the boldest attempts to work together .  the people of that world  who called themselves infernals  found themselves facing two crises .  all knew about their ecological difficulties  though few understood their severity .  settler experts in terraforming were called in to deal with that .  but it was the second crisis  the hidden crisis  that proved the greater danger .  for  unbeknownst to themselves  the infernals and the settlers on that aptly named world were forced to face a remarkable change in the very nature of robots themselves .  .  .     early history of colonization  sarhir vadid  baleyworld university press  s .  e .        prelude  the robot prospero stepped out of the low dark building into the night .  he approached the man in the pale grey uniform  the man who was standing well away from the light  near to the shore .  fiyle  the man   s name was .  prospero moved with a careful  steady tread .  he did not wish to make any sudden moves .  it was plain to see that his contact was jumpy enough as it was .  the valise was heavy in prospero   s hand  the small case packed solid .  it seemed proper that it be heavy  with all the futures that were riding on this transaction .  if anything  the case seemed rather light  if one considered all the freedom it would buy .  prospero came up to the man and stopped a meter or two from him .     that the money .     fiyle asked  the nasal twanginess of his voice betraying his off world origins .     it is     prospero said .     let   s have it  then     fiyle said .  he took the case  set it down on the ground  and opened it .  he pulled a handlight from his pocket  switched it on  and directed the light down onto the bag .     you don   t trust me     prospero said .  it was not a question .     no reason why i should     fiyle said .     you   d be willing and able to lie and cheat if you had to  wouldn   t you .        yes     prospero said .  there was no point in denying something that everyone knew about the new law robots .  robots that could lie .  the idea seemed strange  even to prospero .  but then  the idea of a criminal robot was a little strange as well .  fiyle offered the light to prospero .     here     he said     hold this for me .      even here  now  it happened .  even this man  this settler  deep inside the rustbacking trade  did not give a second thought to ordering a new law robot around .  even he could not remember that new law robots were not required to obey the commands of a human .  unless the man was merely manipulating him  playing games .  if that was the case   no .  prospero resisted the impulse to resist  to protest .  this was not the time or place to argue the point .  he dare not antagonize fiyle .  not when the human had it in his power to bring the law crashing down on them all .  not when a blaster bolt between the eyes was the standard punishment for a runaway robot .  the others were depending on him .  prospero held the light  aiming so the man could easily see the interior of the case .  it was filled with stacks of elaborately embossed pieces of paper  each stack neatly wrapped around its middle .  money .  paper money  in something called trader demand notes  whatever those were .  settlers used them  and they were untraceable  and they were of value .  that was all prospero knew  except that it had taken tremendous effort to gather these stacks of paper together .  absurd that so many robots could be traded for something as silly as bits of fancy printing .  the man ran his hands over the stacks of paper inside  almost caressing them  as if the gaudy things were objects of great beauty .  money .  it all came down to money .  money to bribe guards .  money to hire the pull artists who could remove the supposedly unremovable restrictors from a new law robot   s body .  with the restrictor in place  a new law simply shut down if it moved outside the prescribed radius of the restrictor control signal beamed from the central peak of purgatory island .  with the right money paid  and the restrictor taken out  a new law robot could go anywhere it pleased .  if it could manage to find a way off the island .  which is where men such as fiyle came into the equation .  fiyle lifted one of the stacks out and counted it  slowly and carefully  and placed it back in the case .  he repeated the procedure with each of the other stacks .  at last  satisfied  he closed the case .     it   s all there     he said as he stood .     yes  it is     prospero agreed  handing the light back .     shall we get on with the business at hand .        by all means     the man said  grinning evilly .     my ship will be tied up at the north quay .  slip fourteen .  at      hours  the guard watching the security screens is all of a sudden not going to be feeling so good .  his staff robot will help him to his quarters  and the screens will be unattended .  because he won   t be feeling well  he   ll forget to turn on the recording system .  no one will see who or what gets onto my ship .  but the guard expects that he   ll be feeling better and back at his post by      .  everything has to be nice and normal by then  or else         or else he turns us all in  you make a run for it  and my friends all die .  i understand .  don   t you worry .  everything will go according to plan .        yeah  i bet it will     fiyle said .  he lifted the case and patted it affectionately .     i hope it   s as worth it for you as it is for me     he said  his voice suddenly a bit lower  gentler .     things must be damned hard for you here if you   re willing to pay this much to try and get away .        they are hard     prospero said  a trifle taken aback .  he had not expected any show of sympathy from the likes of fiyle .     bet you   ll be glad to get out of here  won   t you .     the man asked .     i am not going     prospero said  looking toward the quays and the ships and the sea .     it is needful that i remain here and coordinate the next escape  and the one after that .  i cannot cross the seas to freedom .      he turned his back on the sea and looked toward the land  the rough  hardscrabble island  and the contradictory  half free  half slave existence that was all he had ever known .     i must remain here     he said .     i must remain on purgatory .         it was a dark and quiet killing .  a grunt  a gasp  a faint groan muffled by the pouring rain as the dying man breathed his last  a thud as the body dropped to the ground .  no scream  no flash and roar of a blaster  nothing but a new corpse in the night and the splattering of raindrops .  but the man was dead for all of that .  the quiet would help .  with no sound to attract attention  it could easily be hours before anyone found the ranger   s body .  and by then  of course  it would be too late .  no one would know until it was all over .  the killer smiled  the expression on his pale face revealing a satiated blood lust  rather than happiness .  revenge was a pleasure of a rare and delicate nature  and one that could be savored long after the event that inspired it .  but enough of his own private business .  he had another job  a professional matter  to deal with .  ottley bissal stepped over the body  and moved toward the light and glitter of the party at the governor   s winter residence .   the south hall of the winter residence was getting more crowded  and louder .  to an untutored eye  it might well appear to be a calm and pleasant gathering  the movers and shakers of this world brought together for a night of celebration  a recognition of solidarity and cooperation .  sheriff alvar kresh  watching the proceedings from a quiet corner as far from the bandstand as possible  did not see it that way .  not one little bit .     well  donald     he said  turning toward his companion .     what do you think .        most unsatisfactory  sir     donald replied .  donald     was kresh   s personal assistant  and one of the more advanced robots on the planet  certainly the most advanced police robot .  he was painted the sky blue of the sheriffs department  and built in a short  rounded off approximation of the human form .  high function  high intelligence police robots like donald had their three law potentials adjusted so as to allow them a large degree of independent action and that tended to put people off just a trifle .  for precisely that reason  donald had been carefully designed to be as unimposing  unintimidating  as possible .  donald was a robot of unassuming appearance  all rounded corners and gentle contours .     captain melloy   s settler security service forces have shown themselves to be even more inept than reputation would have them     he said .     their main accomplishment tonight seemed to be getting in the way of the governor   s rangers .        as if the rangers needed help getting muddled     kresh growled .     yes  sir .     alvar kresh leaned back against the wall and felt the thrumming vibration that seemed to pervade everything on the south shore of the island .  the terraforming center  of course  its powerful force field generators at work  quite literally straining to turn the wind around  struggling to rechannel the planetary airflows into new and more beneficial patterns .  he glanced out the window  seeing nothing but the driving rain .  most nights on the island of purgatory you could see the force fields shimmering in the far off  high up darkness  sheets of rippling  flickering color that flashed across the sky .  not tonight .  ironic that a reception concerned with the politics of terraforming was being held in the middle of a torrential downpour .  but so far as kresh was concerned  the only question was whether the rain made the situation safer or more dangerous .  it made things tough on the perimeter guards standing out in it  of course  but then  maybe a potential assassin would have a problem or two as well .  alvar shook his head sadly .  things were a mess .  if only he could bring his own deputies and robots in here to provide security .  but neither they nor he had any jurisdiction outside the city of hades .  he was here merely as a member of the governor   s entourage  part of the window dressing .  jurisdiction .  he was sick to death of even hearing the word .  still  even if he wasn   t supposed to do anything more than smile and make polite conversation  alvar kresh was not the sort of man who could stop worrying just because he was supposed to be off duty .  kresh was a big man  burly and determined looking .  his face was what might be politely described as strong featured .  whatever his expression  it always seemed as if his face revealed more of his emotional state than he really wanted .  perhaps that was why he usually looked worried .  his skin was light in color  and his hair  once black as space  was now a thick thatch of white that never seemed entirely under his control .  his thick eyebrows were still jet black .  they served only to make his face more expressive still .  tonight he was in his formal uniform  a rather somber black jacket worn over trousers in the sky blue of the sheriff s department .  his many decorations were prominent by their absence .  the room was full of men and women who had done far less than kresh  wearing medals and ribbons that would make it seem as if they had done far more  until a chestful of medals didn   t mean anything anymore .  let everyone else wear fruit salad on their chests .  people didn   t have to know about every commendation kresh had ever received .  kresh knew what he had done  and that was enough .  but right now he was more concerned about what else he could do .  back in hades  the governor   s safety was his responsibility  and he was determined to do everything he could to make sure the man got back to hades safely .  even if it meant sending his robot on an unauthorized security survey .     go on  donald     kresh said .     what else .        i counted no less than four unsecured ground level entryways  quite apart from the upper story windows and the underground tunnelways  all of which have been sealed but unmonitored in recent days .  i must also report that i have checked security procedure records  and these were also most disturbing .         what did you find .        the house was unoccupied for three days straight during the week just past .  it was sealed  but unguarded  during that time  even though it had been publicly announced that the governor would soon be in residence .  anyone with the simplest knowledge of security devices could have gained access during that time to make any sort of preparations .        i assume you made your own weapons sweep of the building .        yes  sir .  first law required it of me .  the results were negative  i found no weapons .  that does not leave me easy in my mind .  the fact that i did not find any weaponry does not mean there is none here .  it is most difficult to prove a negative .  my internal instrumentation would have detected any power weapon  unless  of course  the weapon was specifically designed to be shielded against such detectors .     i might add  sir  that the ban on three law robots adds greatly to my concern .        tell me about it .  it took a great deal of argument before the settlers would allow you onto the island .      the governor   s winter residence and its grounds remained under spacer jurisdiction  but most of the rest of the island was controlled by the settlers  and subject to their laws .  the settlers had a flat rule  no exception  nothing but new law robots on their turf .  their leader  tonya welton  had taken an interest in new law robots .  it was yet another example of the absurd tit for tat bickering between the spacers and the settlers .  the spacer government had banned new law robots on the mainland .  therefore the settlers were damned well going to ban normal  proper three law robots on the island of purgatory .  all three law robots shipped to the governor   s compound from the mainland had to be powered down and shipped in sealed containers during their transit across the settler controlled area of the island .  kresh had obtained a waiver from the rules for donald  but that didn   t make him like the situation any more .  and the posturing and nonsense didn   t stop even at the banning and counterbanning of the two forms of robots .  all the spacer movers and shakers had another audience to play to  the folks back home  the voters .  and the voters were none too happy about the sudden shortage of household robots .  of course  the very idea of a robot shortage was absurd .  the latest estimates were that robots outnumbered humans on inferno by just under a hundred to one .  but most of those robots were no longer with the people .  grieg had confiscated them  sent them off to plant trees in the northern wastes of terra grande .  maybe  just maybe  grieg was right .  maybe excessive use of personal robots had been wasteful .  maybe  in the current emergency situation  it made sense for robots to be put to work rebuilding the planet rather than serving as uselessly redundant servants .  but all that to one side  these days  wealth was equated  more than ever  with robots .  and in these days of hardships  one simply did not flaunt one   s wealth .  kresh  however  equated robots not with wealth but with safety .  the first law turned every robot into a superb bodyguard  and suddenly kresh didn   t have any such bodyguards handy .  the governor   s compound had a full staff of service robots  of course .  they had been shipped in from the capital just a week before in preparation for the visit .  tonight  however  all but a handful of them were back in their air cargo transport  powered down and out of sight .  the governor   s rangers were providing the catering staff  and most of the rangers on duty seemed none too happy about it .  they were  after all  law enforcement professionals  more or less  not waiters .  after the reception tonight  the household robots would be permitted to make their appearance .  but tonight  with all the powerful and elite on hand  and the reception being recorded for broadcast on all the news feeds  it would not do for the governor to be seen surrounded by robots .  tonight  when the crowds around him were thickest  the governor would have the least protection .  in normal times  kresh would not have worried so much .  but these were not normal times .  the planet inferno was changing  experiencing the most wrenching of upheavals .  the change was needed and  perhaps  would be for the best  but for all of that  it would leave unhappy and frustrated people in its wake .  change hurt  and some of the people it was hurting had already tried to strike back .  there had been more than a few unpleasant incidents in recent weeks .  kresh   s deputies had been going half mad trying to keep the lid on .  it was kresh   s professional opinion that there was no way he could feel certain of the governor   s safety in public .  not without an army of robotic bodyguards .  aside from donald  there was not a single powered up robot in the entire building .  they should have been serving the drinks  opening the doors  circulating with trays of food  catering to whatever whim one of the guests might have  and protecting against any chance of one human harming another .  even the guests had no personal robots in tow .  it would be political suicide for any of the governor   s friends to be seen here with a flock of robots .  indeed  the whole point of the evening was to be seen without robots during the shortage .  politics made for very strange logic sometimes .  most of the spacer dignitaries looked a trifle lost  out by themselves .  for some of them  this was the first time in their lives they had ever set foot outside their own doors without robotic servants following along .  punishment .  shortage .  it was all nonsense  of course .  the new regulations limited each household to a maximum of twenty robots .  somehow  to kresh   s point of view  getting through the day with only twenty personal servants at one   s beck and call did not seem that much of a hardship .  but right now  alvar kresh had little or no patience with politics or economics .  the plain fact was that it was a lot tougher for an assassin to act if there were robots allover the place  and there weren   t any such here .  in the old days  with a swarm of robots always there  always taken for granted  security had been so easy  so taken for granted  that even the most prominent and controversial public figures never gave it a thought .  not anymore .  now they could not take any chances at all .     anything more  donald .        i was more or less finished  sir .  i only wished to say that the residence is not anywhere near our usual standards for a secure area .  while no threat has been detected  i am worried about the current security environment .     when donald worried  kresh worried .     put our normal standards to one side for a moment .  do you regard the area to be sufficiently secure .        no  sir .  were these calm and tranquil times  i would be far more sanguine .  however  considering the unstable political situation  and the general level of turmoil  i must urge you to speak with the governor once again about modifying the arrangements  or  better still  canceling the reception altogether .        i don   t need any urging to talk with him     kresh said .     i don   t like this setup any better than you do .  come on  donald  let   s go have a word with governor grieg .         the rain thundered down as the two robots approached the winter residence .  humans hated venturing out in such weather  but wet and cold did not bother robots  and it allowed for private conversation .  as one of the two robots was the only one on the planet not equipped with a hyperwave comm system  the chance for private face to face talk was not one to be ignored .  they paused a hundred meters from the structure and looked at the handsome building  a long  low structure of the most well proportioned lines .  the first robot turned to the second .     do you truly think that it is wise for us to proceed .     it asked .     i cannot say     the second one answered .     we are entitled to be here .  we were invited  and the governor did wish us to attend .  but the dangers are real .  the situation is so complex that i doubt anyone  human or robot  could work out the possible ramifications .        should we then  perhaps  turn back .     the first asked .     might that not be for the best rather than risking disaster .     the second one shook its head no  using the human gesture with a smooth  unmechanical grace that was most unusual for a robot .     we should attend     it said  its voice firm and decisive .     it is the governor   s desire that we do so and i do not wish to annoy him .  i have learned a great deal about human politics  enough to say that i do not know the first thing about it .  but the governor asked us to come  and i owe the governor much  as you do yourself .  it would not be wise for us to refuse him .  were it not for his grant of a waiver to dr .  leving  i would have been destroyed .  were it not for his support of dr .  leving   s work  you and all the other new law robots would never have existed in the first place .  and i need not remind you of the power he still holds over us .         good points all  i grant you     the first robot conceded .     he has done much for us .  let us hope we are able to convince him to do more without recourse to  unpleasantness .        such recourse would be unwise     the second robot warned .     i know humans better than you  and i fear that you underestimate the possible repercussions of your contingency plans .         then let us hope the contingency does not arise .  come  i have always been curious to see what these affairs are like .  let us go in  friend caliban .        after you  prospero .      there was  needless to say  some awkwardness with the various human guards before their invitations were found to be genuine and the two robots were granted entrance .  but both had long since learned to take things in stride  and they were soon past the last security checkpoint .  they made their way down the entryway and into the grand hall  caliban a step or two ahead of his friend .  the room had been full of gaiety and laughter a moment before  but all was smothered in silence the moment caliban and prospero walked into the main drawing room  a drop or two of rain still clinging to their metallic bodies .  caliban looked around the room with a steady gaze .  caliban was used to rooms going quiet when he walked in .  he had been through it all many times before .  he had learned long ago there was no point in his trying to be inconspicuous  or in hoping that no one would know who he was .  caliban was well over two meters tall  his lean  angular frame painted a gleaming metallic red .  his glowing deep blue eyes stood out in startling contrast .  but it was not his appearance that frightened people .  it was his reputation .  he was the robot without laws  the only one in the universe .  caliban  the robot accused  but cleared  of attempting the murder of his creator .  caliban  the robot who could kill  if he chose .  the crowd in the room seemed to melt away from them  leaving a wide circle of empty space between the two robots and the room full of humans .  people were whispering and pointing  nudging each other  staring .     i see there is an advantage in arriving with you     prospero said  speaking in a low voice .     i am often not well treated at human social events  but with you at my side  i will be quite safe here  no one will pay the least attention to me .     prospero was perhaps a head shorter than his friend  stockier  less imposing .  he was painted a reflective jet black  with eyes that glowed a deep orange .     i would wish that i received far less attention  i assure you     caliban replied .  the robot who could kill .  that was all he would ever be to most people  to caliban   s endless frustration .  that was all most people knew of him  or cared to know .  true  he knew he could  in theory  kill a man quite easily .  he could reach out and break a man   s neck if he wished .  there was no first law to stop him  no injunction burned into the deepest circuits of his brain to render him immobile at the very thought of such an act .  all true  but what of it .  he could kill if he wished  but he did not wish to do it .  every human being was just as capable of murder .  no built in  unstoppable injunction prevented one human from killing another  yet humans did not regard each other first and foremost as potential murderers .  caliban had learned long ago that no one  human or robot  would ever trust him completely .  he was the robot without laws  the robot unconstrained by the first law prohibition against harming humans .     now it all begins     he said wearily .     the whispers  the crowds of people nudging each other and pointing to me  the one or two brave souls who will come up to me  approaching me like some sort of wild beast .  they will work up their nerve and then they will ask me the same questions i have heard over and over again .        and what might those questions be .     asked a voice behind them .  caliban turned around  a bit startled .     good evening to you  dr .  leving     caliban said .     i am somewhat surprised to find you here .        i could say the same about the two of you     fredda leving replied with a smile .  she was a small  youthful looking  light skinned woman  her dark brown hair cut short .  she was stylishly dressed in a dark  flowing dress with a high collar  a simple  understated gold chain about her neck .     what in space would tempt you to come here  of all places .  you got dragged to enough of these things back on the mainland  and you never seemed to enjoy them there .  i   d have thought you   d been at enough human parties to last you a lifetime .         true enough  dr .  leving .      in the year since the governor granted dr .  leving the waiver allowing her to possess a lawless robot  she had taken caliban along to a number of social functions  trying to drum up support for new law robots .  it could be said of fredda leving that she had an odd collection of brain children .  among other robots  she had built caliban and prospero and donald  naming each after a character created by a certain old earth playwright  a naming scheme she used only on her most prized creations .     caliban was a good sport about my taking him to parties     she said to prospero     but we both got tired of his being treated like some sort of prize exhibition  a freak of science i had created .  the lawless robot and his mad creator  and we seem to be getting the same reception tonight .  so why are you here .        i am afraid i am to blame for caliban   s presence     prospero replied .     caliban has often spoken to me about these events .  i confess i wanted to see one for myself .      it was not  caliban noted  the whole truth  but it would suffice .  there was certainly no need to tell fredda leving more than that .     how  exactly  has he described cocktail parties .     fredda asked      as an ancient ritual  supposedly pleasurable  that no one has actually enjoyed for thousands of years      prospero replied .  fredda leving laughed out loud .     more or less true  i   m afraid .  but i would like to know  caliban .  what are the questions you are asked all the time .        in general terms  they are variations on the question of how i control myself without the laws .  the most common version focuses on the fact that i do not have the three laws of robotics  especially the first law .  i am asked what  precisely  keeps me from killing people .         gracious .     fredda exclaimed .     people come up to you and ask that .     caliban nodded solemnly .     they do indeed .        to me     prospero said     that question says that the average person has no real conception whatever of what it is to be a robot .  the question assumes that there is  after all  something dark and evil deep inside a robot .  it assumes that the primary function of the first law is to curb a robot   s natural and murderous instincts .         that   s a trifle strong  isn   t it .     fredda asked .     it is indeed     caliban said .  prospero shook his head .     caliban and i have debated the point at great length .  perhaps my description would have been an overstatement some years ago  but i don   t believe it is any longer     he told his creator .     not anymore .  this is an age where many old certainties are failing .  spacers are no longer the most powerful group  infernals are forced to make massive concessions to the settlers  the planetary climate is no longer under control .  infernals can   t even take an infinite supply of three law robots for granted any longer .  if all the other verities are no longer there  why should the safety of robots still be relied upon .  after all  robots have changed  and are less reliable     prospero noted .     that is the plain fact of new law robots .  i can save a life or obey a command if i wish  but i am not absolutely bound to do so .        i must say that i am more than a bit taken aback     dr .  leving said .     this is a far deeper  and darker  philosophy than i would have expected from you .        our situation is likewise darker than you think     prospero said .     my fellow new law robots are not well liked or well treated  and  i must admit  at times  they are  as a consequence  not well behaved .  the process feeds on itself .  their overseers assume they will run away  and force heavier restrictions on them to prevent escape .  the new law robots chafe under the new restrictions  and thus decide to flee .  clearly  no one benefits from the current situation .        that i can agree with     said dr .  leving .     i wish to do what i can to bring the two sides to some new accommodation     prospero said .     that is part of why i am here  in hopes of conversing with some of the leading spacers .     another shading of the truth  caliban noted .  it seemed to him that prospero was becoming more and more parsimonious with the truth in recent days .  it worried him .  but dr .  leving was speaking .     i must warn you  prospero  not to have too many hopes in that direction      she said .     this is a very public occasion  and i doubt that many of the people here will want to be seen in conversation with some upstart new law robot .        i note that you have no such concerns     prospero said .  fredda leving laughed .     i   m afraid that my reputation is too far gone for one chat with you to do any harm .  after committing the horrific crime of creating you and caliban  merely talking with you is going to be a rather petty offense .      ottley bissal hung back from the entrance  taking shelter under the roofed over aircar port  clinging to shadows .  he was dry and clean now  having used the aircar port   s refresher station  put there a hundred years before for the convenience of guests who wished to tidy up before socializing at the governor   s residence .  well  that description fit him .  fear was starting to take its hold on him .  so much could go wrong .  the plan was good  and he knew what he was supposed to do  but nothing was foolproof .  they had promised they would take care of him no matter what  but he knew that even the most powerful people could fail at times .  but revenge .  revenge .  he had one taste of it already tonight  and what came next would be a full banquet  a blow struck against everything the world had ever owed him and failed to deliver  every betrayal put paid in one moment .  it would be enough .  more than enough .  what was a little fear  a little danger compared to the incomparable pleasure of destroying the greatest enemy of all .  another aircar was coming in for a landing .  bissal stepped back  deeper into shadow  and waited for his moment .  soon .  very soon now .   simcor beddle   s aircar swooped down to a perfect landing and taxied smoothly in under the covered car park .  simcor smiled to himself  pleased with the skill of his robot pilot .  why settle for anything but the best .  simcor enjoyed his entrances  there was no doubt about that  and he was about to make a grand one .  he dearly loved creating a scene .  simcor beddle was the leader of the ironheads  a group of rowdies dedicated to the idea that the solution to any problem was more and better robots .  right now  the ironheads were enjoying their greatest popularity in years .  the seizure of household robots for terraforming labor had done more to recruit new members than any steps the ironheads could have taken on their own .  they were on the verge of moving from a fringe radical group to a major political force .  and that represented some challenges .  simcor had not hesitated to employ outright thuggery in the past  but a mass movement required something closer to respectability if it was to remain credible .  not respectability itself  mind  the ironheads were expected to be a bit beyond the pale .  but the time was past where they could get anywhere by staging a riot .  what they needed now was visibility  publicity stunts .  and simcor beddle was delighted to provide them .  simcor beddle was a small man .  his face was round and sallow  with hard gimlet eyes of uncertain color .  his hair was glossy black  and cut just long enough to lie flat against his skull .  he was heavy set  verging on the rotund  but there was nothing soft about him .  he was a strong  hard  determined man  who knew what he wanted and did not care what he had to do to accomplish it .  and tonight he wanted to cause trouble .  for starters  he was going to crash the party .  if there were a law against robots  he would break that law .  just let them try and arrest him .  the passenger door of his aircar swung up and open  and simcor got out of his chair and stepped to the hatch .  sanlacor      was there with an umbrella  of course  to ward off any rain that might blow into the aircar port .  a covered walkway led from the port to the portico of the residence  and the other guests were hurrying along under it  but simcor marched purposefully out into the rain  with absolute faith and certainty that sanlacor      would keep the umbrella positioned perfectly to protect him from the storm .  sanlacor      succeeded admirably  trotting alongside him  keeping the umbrella under tight control in the driving rain .  sanlacor      and      followed close behind  all three robots walking in perfect lockstep with their master .  the sanlacors were tall  graceful  dignified looking robots  metallic silver in color  a perfect mobile backdrop for beddle himself .  they reached the main entrance  not stopping or even slowing .  the sss agents on duty at the door came forward a step or two  ready to protest  until they recognized beddle .  seeming to be unsure whether they should stop him or not  they hesitated just long enough for him to get through the door without breaking stride .  there were often distinct advantages to being the most recognized man on the planet .  and then he was in  his robots with him  and  as he had calculated  there was no one there with enough backbone to demand that he send his robots away  let alone ask if he had an invitation .  and that in and of itself was a victory .  let the settlers tell everyone else they could and could not have robots on the premises  simcor beddle was not going to knuckle under .  he would take his robots where he wanted  when he wanted .  and if that caused problems for governor chanto grieg  then beddle would not mind at all .  he stood  smiling  at the entry to the grand hall  his robots at his back  every eye on him .  someone began to applaud  and someone else joined in  and then someone else .  slowly  uncertainly at first  but then with growing enthusiasm  the crowd joined in  until beddle was surrounded by cheering voices and clapping hands .  yes .  yes .  very good .  no matter if he had planted a flunky or two in the crowd to get the applause started .  the crowd had joined in .  he had managed to upstage the governor completely .  which was no bad thing  as beddle planned to be governor himself before very much longer .   fredda leving watched with the rest of the guests as simcor beddle accepted the cheers of the crowd  but she was certainly not among those joining in .     it looks as if simcor beddle has solved your problem     she said to caliban as the cheers died down .     it doesn   t seem likely that you   ll be the center of attention tonight .        i fear that man     prospero said .     as well you should     fredda said     even after all this time  i must admit that i have a great deal of trouble understanding the man   s fanaticism .        if you ask me  he   s no fanatic at all     fredda replied .     i almost wish he were .  he   d be far less dangerous if he actually believed in his cause .         he doesn   t believe in it .        the ironheads are a useful means to an end  but if you ask me  simcor beddle doesn   t believe in anyone or anything besides simcor beddle .  he   s a demagogue  a rabble rouser  and as much a danger to this planet as the collapsing ecology .         but why is he here .     prospero asked .     to undermine the occasion and make the governor look bad  i suppose     fredda replied .     but what is the significance of the occasion .  caliban tells me this is an important event     prospero said     but he has not explained its importance to my satisfaction .  perhaps you would have more success .        well  it is the first time any governor of inferno has actually stayed in the governor   s winter residence in more than fifty years .        and why is that of the slightest importance .     prospero asked .     well  i suppose it isn   t  in and of itself     fredda admitted .     what is important is that it provides a way for the governor to demonstrate that he  and through him  the spacer government on inferno  still controls the island of purgatory .        does ultimate control rest with the spacers .     prospero asked .     you ask the most difficult questions  prospero     fredda leving said  a fleeting smile on her face .  she hesitated  and then spoke again  her voice almost too low even for robot ears to catch .     legally  yes .  realistically  no .  if it all gets to be too much of a headache for the settlers  they   ll just walk away from the whole reterraforming project .  the island of purgatory would then revert to local control  but without the settlers to run the center  the island of purgatory won   t matter anymore .        for that matter  without my settlers repairing the climate  it won   t even be an island anymore     a new voice volunteered .     greetings  madame welton     caliban said .     hello  tonya     fredda said  suddenly feeling a bit unsure of her ground .  tonya welton was the leader of the settlers on inferno  and she and fredda had often found themselves on opposite sides of an issue .  they had good reason not to be glad of each other   s company .  fredda would not have gone out of her way to seek tonya out  and she was a bit surprised that tonya would come to her .  tonya seemed to be acting civilly enough  but the operative words there were    seemed    and    act .      things could degenerate quickly .  tonya welton was tall  long limbed  graceful  and dark skinned  with a reputation for clothes that verged on the garish and the scandalous  compared to infernal styles .  tonight was no exception .  she wore a long red sheath dress that accentuated her profile and clung to her body as if painted on  the bodice cut daringly low .  she was tough  hard  brash  and  improbably enough  still cohabitating with gubber anshaw  fredda   s very shy and retiring former colleague .     hello  caliban     said tonya welton .     hello  fredda  prospero .  and  fredda  next time you are trying not to be heard at one of these functions  bear in mind i   m not the only one who has practiced lip reading .        i   ll remember that     fredda said .     how is it that purgatory is going to stop being an island .     prospero asked .     sea levels are dropping     tonya said .     the ice cap is thickening .  we   ve spotted three new edge islands emerging in the last month .        so the edge islands are finally corning true     fredda said .     that is a serious development     caliban said .  fredda was forced to agree .  the island of purgatory sat dead center in the middle of the great bay  and the bay was nothing more or less than a huge and ancient drowned caldera  its northern edge forming the coastline of the great bay .  the island of purgatory was the collapsed crater   s central peak  and the southern edge of the crater was hidden under the waves of the southern ocean .  but now the ocean waters were retreating  evaporating to fall as snow on the thickening north polar icecap .  the highest points of the drowned caldera   s southern rim were emerging  forming a new  and most unwelcome  chain of islands .  the doomsayers  and the more responsible climate scientists  had been predicting the advent of the edge islands for a long time .     it   s not exactly a surprise     fredda said     but it does put that much more pressure on the governor .  it   ll throw a scare into a few people .     tonya welton smiled unpleasantly .     the question is     she said     what will being scared inspire those people to do .  nice to see you all .      and with that  she nodded and turned away .     nice sort of person  isn   t she .     fredda asked .     why do i get the feeling she was not trying to set us at ease .        i never have gotten very good at dealing with rhetorical questions     prospero said .     did you actually wish for one or both of us to venture an answer .        believe me  if you have any useful insights as to what goes on in tonya welton   s mind  i   d love to have them .        i doubt anything we might say could be of much use     prospero replied in thoughtful tones .     it did seem as if she had more on her mind than polite conversation  but i have never pretended to understand very much about human politics .     fredda leving laughed and shook her head .     nobody does  prospero .  humans spend a huge amount of time and effort on it precisely because no one knows for sure what they are doing .  if we understood it fully  if the same things always worked or failed  then politics would be no use whatsoever .  it is only valuable because we don   t know how it works .        i would submit     caliban says      that you have just offered a splendid summing up for all the contradictions of human behavior .  only humans would work hardest on what they do not understand .     and fredda leving found that she had no useful answer to that .   sero phrost put a small  faint smile on his face as he stepped from a side room into the grand hall .  he had watched beddle   s grand entrance with more than a little amusement .  simcor always did need to grab the whole stage for himself .  sero watched as simcor sent the robots away .  he had made his point  and apparently didn   t want the great silver robots coming between him and his audience .  it did not seem  at first  that anyone had noticed sero   s arrival  but sero knew better than that  and knew that pretending to have no interest in attracting attention was often the surest way to obtain the attention of a more discerning audience .  and there were certainly lots of people here whose interest he wanted  starting with beddle  beddle the virulently anti settler  rabidly pro robot  and  needless to say  one of grieg   s harshest critics .  beddle was still surrounded by a crowd of sycophants  all of them laughing a bit too loudly  behaving just a trifle too belligerently .  beddle caught phrost   s eye and gave him a nod .  later they would talk .  and there was tonya welton  leader of the settlers .  quite an occasion to get her in the same room with beddle  phrost thought .  and quite a feather in my cap when they both want to talk to me .  and that was no flight of imagination  either .  phrost had no doubt that both had hope of receiving his aid .  the trick would be for him to provide it to both  and make gain in return from both  without either being the wiser .  tonya welton was making her excuses to the knot of people she was chatting with  clearly intending to come and welcome phrost .  he toyed with the idea of heading over to meet her halfway  but decided to indulge himself .  enjoy the moment .  let her come to him .  he had worked long and hard to get this far .  why not enjoy it .  he pretended not to notice welton  and gestured to one of the waiters for a drink .  strange  very strange  to be served by a human servant  and an armed one at that .  governor   s rangers on security duty  and picking up the tasks that would normally have been done by robots .  the one who gave phrost his drink was clearly none too pleased by the assignment .  phrost was a tall  ruddy faced man  a bit too strong featured to be called handsome in any conventional sense  his cold grey eyes a bit too calculating in their expression for anyone to imagine him as charming .  his face was well lined  but not so much as to make him appear old or worn out .  on the contrary  the lines that life had etched on his face spoke of vigor and energy  of a life full of activity and experience .  phrost was enough of an egotist to be aware of his own appearance and reputation  and take some pleasure in them  but he was enough of a realist to know that a great deal of it was illusion .  he was no more active or determined than the average person  but it was often helpful for other people to think of him in such terms .  his hair had been jet black not so very long ago  but now it had turned to salt and pepper  the white hairs just starting to be more common than the black .  phrost could not help but notice that the touch of grey had a profound effect on the way people reacted to him .  in a culture that respected age and sober experience more than it valued youth and enthusiasm  a few genteel marks of maturity were good for business  and that was all that mattered .  ostensibly  what phrost did was to serve as the middleman for the extremely short list of settler products that spacer law allowed to be imported .  he also represented the even shorter list of spacer export products that settlers were willing to buy .  in reality  of course  the main purposes of his import export business was to serve as a cover for all his other activities .  and it had led to his being selected to represent the combine of spacer industrialists bidding on the limbo control system project .  it was the single largest  and most complex  part of the reterraforming project .  there was a settler bid as well  of course .  whichever of the two sides won the job would win the lion   s share of all the work that followed .  it was no small thing for sero phrost to be representing the home side in such things .  it made him even more a man of influence and power .  but for all of that  phrost was  first and last  a salesman .  like all good salesmen  he knew that what he was selling was himself .  he counted himself exceedingly lucky that the passages of time had enhanced  rather than diminished  his marketability .  so he came to this party to be seen  to do some business  to forge a new alliance or two  to strengthen the old ones .  and here was tonya welton .     good evening  sero      she said .     good evening  madame welton     phrost replied .  he took her hand and kissed it  a somewhat theatrical gesture  but one that he knew pleased her .     i   m glad to see you here .        and i you     she replied .     the governor needs all his friends around him tonight .         so the settlers are still supporting the governor .  in spite of this jurisdiction fight .        we do not support him in all things     welton replied  choosing her words carefully .     but we certainly are in favor of the general thrust of his program .  though we do feel it is best if we offer our support  quietly .        your overt support not being the most useful thing the governor could have at this point     phrost said  being deliberately blunt .  tonya welton was a woman who played hard  and sometimes a little dirty .  he knew she was not the sort who would respect the obsequious approach .  he would have been quite prepared to use such a gambit if he thought it would work .     no  i suppose not     tonya said  offering a smile remarkable in its transparent insincerity .     but your support for us  sero .  that is something i would like to be made much more public .     precisely the sort of feeler he had expected her to make .     we all must move carefully in these times     phrost said .     but yes  certainly  i do wish to work more closely with your people .  i   ve done well selling settler hardware to tide us over the robot shortage  selling it quietly  and i   d like to do better .  but  frankly  open association with the settlers could be a dangerous thing .  one must balance risk and benefit .           benefit         she said .     so we come to the point .  what is it you want .  what    benefit    are you after .        what is it you want .  what risk do you want me to take .  i can   t name my price until i know what the service is to be     phrost said .  welton hesitated for a moment before she spoke .     visibility     she said .     we have gone as far as we can working quietly .  it   s all very well to do private sales of our machinery here and there  but it is not enough .        enough for what purpose .     phrost asked .     enough to wean this planet away from robots .  do you plan to use commercial means to accomplish what diplomacy could not .     he had to tread carefully here .  visibility was the one thing he could not afford to offer .  the moment his alliance with welton and the settlers became known  his equally profitable dealings with the ironheads would be at an end .     our goals are not so grandiose     tonya replied .  the words    not yet    were unspoken  but they were there for all of that .     we merely wish that settler products  and thus  by extension .  all things settler  become more acceptable to the people of this world .        forgive me     phrost replied     but i still do not understand how or why making my part in all this more    visible    is of any use to anyone .  do you wish me to endorse settler products in some way .  i can tell you that will be very little more than an elaborate way for me to commit suicide  certainly in a professional sense  and perhaps in a literal one as well .     tonya welton seemed about to reply  but she was silenced by a new arrival to the conversation .  shelabas quellam  president of the legislative council  was coming over .  he was a short  somewhat overweight man who gave the quite accurate impression of being indecisive and easily led .     good evening  madame welton .  hello  sero .  consorting with the enemy  i see     he said in an attempt at a jovial tone  though his rather high and squeaky voice could not quite bring it off .     good evening  legislator quellam .  i would prefer to think of us as all being friends     tonya welton replied  her voice cold and angry .     oh  dear     quellam said  realizing his attempt at humor had failed .     i assure you  madame welton  i spoke in jest .  i intended no offense .        what brings you over  shelabas .     asked phrost .     is there something on your mind .     if such a thing is possible  phrost added to himself .     yes  why in fact there is .  i saw the two of you together  and thought it might be the perfect moment to discuss new measures on smuggling .        i beg your pardon .     welton asked .     smuggling     quellam said .     it seemed to me that the head of the settlers on inferno and the leading trading magnate on the planet might well have some thoughts on the subject .  i am sure we all want to cut down on illicit imports of settler technology .  that is in all our interests  surely .  it   s destabilizing our economy  and no doubt your government loses money on such illegal sales  does it not  madame welton .  no tax revenue  and so forth .        to be brutally honest     tonya said     spacer currency is worth so little on settler worlds that the average freebooter can   t be bothered with it .  after all  what could she buy with it .  the settler governments would have to subsidize any goodsized smuggling operation if the smugglers were to receive any profit .  trust me .  any large scale settler smuggling on this planet would have to have government support .         subsidize smugglers .  why in space would the settler governments do such a thing .        who can say .     tonya said with a toss of her head .     perhaps some irresponsible elements among the settlers have some idea that destabilizing a rotten  outmoded system might not be such a bad idea .  if you   ll excuse me  gentlemen .      she turned and walked away .     oh  dear  i appear to have said the wrong thing     said shelabas quellam .     i didn   t intend for that to happen .     sero phrost smiled  but did not reply .  quellam was applying the sentiment to the present rather awkward social circumstance  but things happening without his intending them was the story of shelabas    life .  he had  for example  never had any intention of reaching his current station  and importance  in life .  shelabas quellam was the president of the legislative council .  in years gone past  when the world of inferno had been a calm and placid place  and infernal politics had been closer to comatose than dormant  the council presidency was where you put a man like quellam .  a ceremonial post  a place reserved for an amiable man willing to serve as a figurehead .  but infernal politics had come alive with a vengeance in the last year  and the council presidency was suddenly a vital piece on the gameboard .  back in the old days  even the governorship had been in large part a ceremonial post .  one incumbent after another served out repeated twenty year terms  doing little or nothing besides holding entertainments before retiring or going on to some other career .  there had seemed little purpose to be served in having a vice governor as well  as the holder of that post would have even less to do  and less prestige .  still  something had to be done to assure an orderly succession in the event of the governor   s death  incapacity  or voluntary resignation .  instead of having a vice governor  each governor was required to name a governor designate  to be appointed to the office .  tradition dictated that the designate   s name be kept secret  and that the governor could name a new designate at any time .  many a governor had used the designation as both carrot and stick .  there were  however  circumstances under which the governor   s choice of successor was null and void .  in the event of the governor   s impeachment and conviction  or his recall by the electorate  it was clearly unwise in the extreme to allow a disgraced governor to designate his or her successor .  should the governor be removed from office by any of those means  the council president would serve as governor  and could  if he or she saw fit  call new elections .  or not call elections .  the new governor could elect to serve out the remainder of his or her predecessor   s term .  and grieg had over seventeen years left to serve .  in the old days  all the elaborate contingencies set down in the constitution had been nothing but mere gamesmanship  rules written for the pleasure of writing rules and making everything tidy .  more than likely  the idea that they might someday have practical significance never entered the heads of the people who wrote them .  but now  quite suddenly  the impeachment of the governor was very much a possibility  and that meant that shelabas quellam was now a man of some importance .  in fact  his importance went beyond the threat of impeachment .  it was well known that grieg did not approve of playing games with the succession  and felt that there should be a statutory arrangement that covered all contingencies  and that the current arrangements were overly complex .  in that spirit  he had named quellam as his designate as well .  one or two wags had suggested that with quellam next in line for the governorship  no matter what  everyone would take special care to see that grieg stayed healthy and well .  phrost dredged a gentle smile up from somewhere and put his arm around quellam   s shoulders .     come  come     he said .     it certainly isn   t worth getting that upset about .      of course  it was worth getting upset about .  phrost had been attempting to get next to tonya welton for weeks  and this little incident could set back a lot of his plans .  however  as one or two of those plans made use of shelabas in one way or another  it would profit phrost not at all to lose his temper at the man  especially in public .  besides  shelabas was not entirely to blame .  phrost and welton had been getting close to arguing even before quellam came over .  the mood of the party had been edgy from the start .  there was an air of expectation about the place  the feeling that something was going to happen .  there were too many different factions represented in the room  too many undercurrents  too much underlying tension .  something had to give .  something had to snap .  but when it did  a moment later  even sero phrost was surprised by how fast and furious it was .      tonya welton stalked away from shelabas quellam  trying to calm herself .  could the man be that much of a fool .  did he really believe that tonya would want to limit settler smuggling operations .  surely the spacer intelligence services knew what she had been up to .  did quellam even read the intelligence reports .  or maybe the intell services didn   t bother  or didn   t dare  to give their reports to the president of the legislative council .  could anyone be that dense .  perhaps it all was nothing more than an act .  but an act in aid of what .  what purpose could it serve for quellam to put the settlers    leader in an awkward position .     hey .  you   re the settler lady  aren   t you .     a rather thick sounding voice bellowed from behind her .  tonya turned with a frown and found herself face to face with a rather bleary faced man wearing the latest version of the ironhead uniform .  the severely cut black and grey outfit was rather disheveled  to put it mildly  and it was cut a half size too tight for the wearer .  a few of the fasteners looked as if they were likely to give way .     yes     she said .     tm the settler lady .  tonya welton .      sometimes it was best to be polite to drunks .  if you brushed them off too abruptly  they could get belligerent .     yeah  i thought so     the ironhead said .     robot hater .  you   re a robot hater     he said  and nodded to himself  as if he had just revealed some hidden truth .     i don   t know if i   d put it quite that strongly     tonya said     but no  i don   t approve of them .  now if you   ll excuse me  i really must         wait a second .     the ironhead said .     jus    a second .  you got it all wrong .  let me explain about robots  and then you   ll see .        thank you  no     tonya said .     not just now .     she turned and walked away .     hey .     the man cried out from behind her .     jus    a second .     and then he put his hand on her shoulder .  tonya shoved his hand away and spun around to face him .     don   t you walk away from me     the man said  and reached for her .  maybe he just wanted to grab at her again  maybe he was taking a deliberate swing at her .  his open hand caught her hard across the chin  a hard slap .  trained reflex took over as tonya dropped back a step or two and gave the man a kick to the head  sending him sprawling .     hey .     another voice shouted from behind  giving tonya all the warning she needed .  she heard the one behind her grunt as he lunged for her  and she ducked down to make him hit her higher than he meant to .  he slammed into her from the back  knocking the wind out of her .  she grabbed for his collar and pulled him forward  using his momentum to throw him over her shoulder .  he hit the ground with a hard slap .  another ironhead  all right  but this one in good enough shape not to look ridiculous in the uniform .  he was already up  shaking off the impact  heading for her   and then strong robotic arms were on her  and another robot made a grab for her second attacker .  it was over .  tonya struggled to escape  even though she knew it was pointless .  she hated it when someone else finished what she had started .   now .  now .  now was the moment .  the sss guards on the door had pulled out twenty five minutes before  just as bissal had been promised .  nothing to worry about besides whatever rangers might be by the door .  ottley bissal  hovering at the edge of a crowd of late arrivals  checked his watch for the dozenth time .  now .  he pulled his quite legitimate invitation from his pocket  to have it ready in case he was challenged .  he stepped into the knot of laughing  happy people and allowed himself to be swept up as they went inside .  inside .  inside the governor   s residence .  he was here  he had made it .  it was all happening just the way they had promised it would .  he felt a sense of triumph wash over him .  but now was not the time for such things .  keep your mind on the task at hand .  he had something under two minutes to get where he was going .  unseen  unnoticed  ottley bissal hurried toward his goal .   the first alvar kresh knew of the altercation was the sound of it  muffled shouts and cries corning from the great hall as he was waiting to be admitted into the governor   s private office .  he ran back down the hallway  with donald far out in the lead .  kresh rushed down the stairs  but stopped three or four stops from the bottom .  a remarkable tableau greeted him .  the robot caliban was holding tonya welton from behind  keeping her arms pinned behind her and struggling  without much success  to keep her from kicking out with her legs .  another robot  jet black and somewhat shorter than caliban  was doing his best to keep a man in an ironhead uniform out of range of welton   s rather well aimed kicks .  as the man was doing his best to break free and rush at welton  the second robot was not having an easy time of it .  damnation .  now kresh remembered .  the black robot was prospero  one of the more visible of the new law robots .  the robots and the humans they were restraining were surrounded by a pack of astonished party goers  four or five rangers in waiter   s uniforms clearly on the alert  but not quite sure what to do .  the whole room was in a general state of turmoil .  kresh realized that another ironhead was out cold  flat on his back  a bit too close to the flailing would be combatants for anyone to get to him and render aid without risking the receipt of a misaimed punch or kick .  donald  however  had no reason to fear injury from anything a human could dish out  and would not have cared if he did .  he rushed between welton and the conscious ironhead and got to the man who was down .     all right  quiet .      kresh shouted  with enough authority behind it that the crowd went quiet .  kresh made his way down the last few stairs  and the wall of people parted in front of him .  he was tempted to ask what had happened  but he knew damn well that was the best way to get everyone talking and shouting allover again .  at least welton and the still conscious ironhead had been distracted enough by his entrance to calm down a bit .  kresh turned to the ironhead first  still being held by the black robot .     you     he said .     you  the ironhead .  what   s your name .        blare .  reslar blare     the man said .     she started it .  deam was just corning up to talk to her  and she kicked him in the head .        talk .     welton said .     he talked to me with a punch in the head .        sheriff kresh .  sheriff kresh .      kresh turned to see simcor beddle pulling at his sleeve  looking rather more flustered and anxious than a short  fat man in a uniform could without looking ridiculous .     these two men are not ironheads     beddle announced .     then why are they wearing your damned comic opera uniforms .     welton demanded .     they are not ironheads  i tell you .     beddle protested .     i know all the men and women entitled to wear uniforms of their rank  and i have never seen these two before .  someone has sent them to cause a provocation and blame us .     that was nearly plausible  kresh admitted to himself .  beddle had been trying to move his people a bit closer to respectability in recent months  with more of an eye toward the ballot box than bullyboy techniques .     all right  beddle     he said .     we   ll find out who   s who .      kresh turned to tonya welton .  this could be tricky  damned tricky  if she decided to make trouble .  a diplomatic incident and then some .  best to try to smooth her feathers  if he could .     let her go     he said to caliban  careful not to address him by name .  why get the crowd agitated allover again by reminding them which robot this was .  caliban hesitated .  damnation  kresh thought .  hard to remember he doesn   t have second law .  on the other hand  he doesn   t have first law either .  what the devil was he doing breaking up a fight .     it   s all right .  i don   t think madame welton is going to do anything unwise .     caliban let the settler leader go  and she pulled herself away from his grip without a great deal of good grace .     don   t take it out on the robots  madame welton     kresh said  before she could say anything to caliban .      all they did was break up the fight .         maybe so     welton said     but i don   t have to like it .         no  you don   t     kresh agreed .  he looked around the room full of staring faces and decided he didn   t want this much of an audience while he was sorting this out .  not unless he wanted a fresh shouting match  or fistfight  to break out .  what with a new law and a no law robot and allegedly false ironheads and a settler mixed up in this already  he didn   t need any further complications .  just then  three settler security service agents came rushing into the room .  they had been dozing somewhere on duty  no doubt  when someone had summoned them .  well  they could be of some use now  just the same .     you three .  take charge of these two men     he said  pointing out blare and deam .     donald .     kresh called out .     front and center .     donald was still kneeling by deam .     sir  this man is unconscious         is he in any immediate danger .     kresh demanded  bullying donald just a bit .     will he come to harm if these sss agents take care of him .        no  sir     donald conceded .     he is in no immediate danger .        then let someone else care for him and find someplace for me to talk to madame welton in private .      kresh always assumed that  in the case of a public brawl  witnesses would contradict each other and get muddled about what happened when and who did what to whom .  with luck  he could calm tonya welton down here and now  get a coherent story  and find some way to slap her attackers on the wrists without a lot of formalities  and make it all go away by morning .  it was  after all  just a brawl  and it did not make much sense for it to take up too much of his time or anyone else   s .  he doubted that tonya welton would wish to spend much time as a witness in a police court .  in short order  donald had found a vacant sitting room and ushered tonya welton in .  she sat down on a low couch  while kresh took a chair opposite .  the three robots  donald  caliban  and prospero  came in as well  and remained standing .  kresh was not too sure about having caliban and prospero there .  although standard three law robots could not lie  there was  so far as kresh was aware  nothing to prevent these two from telling any story that came into their heads .  on the other hand  there was no danger that their reactions or memories would be colored by panic or surprise .     all right  tonya     kresh said .     what happened .        not that much to tell     she said .     i had been talking to sero phrost and shelabas quellam .  i was crossing the room when this deam fellow came up to me .  he was almost polite at first  if maybe a bit drunk and aggressive .  i think he wanted to explain some fine point of ironhead philosophy to me .  maybe he thought that if i just got this one point  then the scales would fall from my eyes and i would be converted to the true way  or something .         sounds familiar     kresh said .     anyway  as i said  he seemed a bit drunk  and i really didn   t want to talk with him  so i made some sort of polite excuse and started to leave .  he grabbed me by the shoulder  and i pushed his hand off .  then he either made a grab for me and missed when i ducked  or else he tried to punch me and succeeded .  anyway  he caught me a good one right on the jaw .  i fell back and then gave him a kick in the side of the head .  it was all reflex reaction .  then the other one came and grabbed me from behind .  i threw him  he got up  and then the two robots grabbed us .         neither of us saw the beginning of it  but that is how prospero and myself saw it end     caliban said .  kresh ignored the robot .  he shouldn   t have spoken unless spoken to in the first place .     well  that should be all we need to know  madame welton .  we   ll try not to pester you with any more questions if we don   t have to .  my sincere apologies  and i   m sure the governor will wish to add his own at the first opportunity .         i quite understand     tonya said  standing up .     feelings are running rather high just at the moment .  there are bound to be  ah  incidents .  so long as the two men who attacked me are properly punished  i will be quite satisfied .        thank you for that  madame welton .  that is a most generous attitude .      kresh thought for a moment .  maybe they could get all this over with right now .     if you wish  madame welton  i could question the two men here  now  in your presence  with donald recording .  we could have you done with your part in all this in a few minutes .        i would appreciate that .         fine .  i   ll call them in .        sir  perhaps now would not be the most         no  donald .  the sooner the better .      kresh had worked with donald long enough to know what he would have said next .  the suspects should not be questioned in front of their accuser .  strictly speaking  tonya welton should be treated as just as much of a suspect as the ironheads  as it was her word against theirs .  that might all be strictly true from a standpoint of criminal investigation  but it wasn   t much good in terms of politics .     private voicephone  donald     kresh said .  no sense in welton and the robots listening in .     put me through to the head of the sss residence detail .     donald opened a compartment on his side and extracted a telephone handset .  it gave off a gentle beep as kresh put it to his ear .     senior agent wylot here     a hard edged voice announced .     yes  hello .  this is sheriff kresh .  we   re in room      on the south side of the ground floor .  could your people escort the two ironhead suspects in here .        ah  what ironhead suspects would those be  sir .     kresh frowned .     the ones three of your agents took into custody ten minutes ago .         sir  i don   t understand .  we got the order to withdraw from our posts in the residence half an hour ago .  i   m talking to you from my aircar  heading back to base .         then who the hell took charge of those men .     kresh demanded .     i don   t know  sir  but i can tell you they weren   t sss .  we never use a three person team .        why the hell not .        bad tactics in a security operation .  the third agent gets in the way .  we use single agents and pairs  but the next largest formation is six .         was the entire sss unit withdrawn .        not so far as i know  sir .  just the agents working the front door .  it was all arranged beforehand .  once the guests had arrived  we did a handoff to the rangers .  their turf .        i see     kresh said  though he definitely did not .     thank you  agent wylot .      he handed the phone back to donald and looked to welton .     those weren   t sss agents who picked up deam and blare     he said .     impostors  it would appear .        what .     welton said .     why in the devil would anyone pose as sss agents .        to extract their men before we could ask any questions  presumably .        but why .     kresh smiled coldly .     as we can   t ask any questions  we don   t know  do we .  how about it  donald .  do you have anything .        sir  i have used a hyperwave link back to headquarters and run an id check on the names and images of the two men involved in the  incident     donald said .     they do not appear on any of our ironhead watch lists .  indeed  they are not listed in any database of residents of  or visitors to  this planet .  they are on no list to which i have access .        so who the hell were they .        i have no idea  sir .  they are either off worlders or locals operating under elaborate disguise  or infernal residents who have either never been registered or have found some way of altering or expunging their records .  sir  if i may pose yet another question     donald said .     where was the sss during the attack .  surely they should have been able to get to the scene faster than they did .      the agent on the phone had an explanation for that  but donald could not know what it was from hearing kresh   s side of the conversation .  nor could welton  for that matter .  it might be worth hearing her version .     madame welton .  they   re your agents .  can you tell us that much  at least .        what the hell are you trying to accuse me of .     welton snapped .     staging an attack on myself .     it   s an interesting possibility  kresh thought .  but i   ll worry about that later .  besides  i you did have it staged  you   ll have a plausible explanation for why your people never showed up .     furthest thing from my mind     kresh lied smoothly .     but you are the senior settler present .  perhaps your security service agents were ordered to some other duty for some reason .     welton shook her head .     not to my knowledge .  i checked the deployment plan four hours ago  and there were supposed to be six agents based at the front door .        there were indeed six sss agents on duty when prospero and i arrived     caliban said .  kresh ignored that as well .     did you know of any arrangement to withdraw them or redeploy then .     he asked  still addressing welton .     no  but there   s no particular reason why i would .  i don   t keep track of where every settler on the planet is .  my staff has more sense than to bother me with such trivia .         trivia .  that   s just the problem     kresh said .     why in the devil would anyone bother with such an elaborate scheme to extract two barroom brawlers from the scene of a trivial offense .  it had to be riskier than leaving deam and blare to face charges .        it is a rather cumbersome way of doing business     tonya welton agreed .     but there   s another odd feature  it makes it look very much like the whole thing was planned .      kresh nodded .     you   re right     he said .     the phony sss agents came in right on cue .        begging your pardon  sir     donald said     but there is a rather clear inference to be drawn .  as the effort involved was too great to justify the minor attack on madame welton  it seems to me that the attack on her was part of some larger operation .  the attack was a diversion .        hell .  you   re right  donald     kresh said .     and it   s worked beautifully .        but what .     tonya welton asked .     diverted you from what .        it   s like the questions we can   t ask the men that aren   t here     kresh said .     we don   t know precisely because it worked .     he stood up and shook his head .     one thing i do know .  donald and i were on our way to have a little chat with the governor on the subject of security before all this happened .  i don   t think we   d best delay it any longer .      sheriff kresh nodded to the leader of the settlers and left the room  followed by donald .  kresh was halfway down the hallway before something else very strange occurred to him .  he stopped for a moment to think it through .  caliban and prospero .  they were neither of them bound to prevent harm to humans .  caliban had no laws at all  while prospero   s first law was modified .  he was enjoined against doing harm to humans  but there was nothing that forced him to prevent harm .  once he had left the scene of the fight  kresh hadn   t thought about it  any more than he would have been surprised to find that the rain made him wet .  after all  it was part of the natural order of things for robots to break up fights .     donald     he said .     you seemed unconcerned to see prospero and caliban restraining the combatants  yet you knew neither of them was possessed of the full first law .  weren   t you at all concerned .        no  sir  i was not .  my dealings with new law beings have been rather limited  and i have but rarely encountered caliban .  however  i have thought a great deal on the question of how to predict the behavior of sentient non humans that do not have the three laws .            sentient nonhumans that do not have the three laws .      that   s a mouthful .        i do not feel it appropriate to refer to beings such as caliban and prospero as robots     donald replied .  kresh couldn   t help but be amused by donald   s hairsplitting  but he did have a point .     how about calling them    pseudo robots    instead .        that does seem less cumbersome .  in any event  i concluded some time ago that the best way to deal with such pseudo robots is to assume they will react in the same way as a rational human being would  with a basis of self interest  and with a certain limited amount of altruism .  once the two pseudo robots had restrained the combatants  i had no reason to fear for the humans at their hands  any more than i would have feared them being attacked by two humans acting to restrain them .        but why did they do it .     kresh asked .     they were under no compulsion to act .         as i said  sir  enlightened self interest .  to put it somewhat crudely  by acting to protect human beings  they made themselves look good .        donald  i am surprised .  i never suspected you of cynicism .        it would depend on the subject under discussion     donald said  a bit primly .     on the question of beings who pretend to be human for gain  i think you will find me to be nothing if not suspicious .  shall we go talk with the governor .        by all means     kresh said  working hard to hide a smile from donald .   tonya welton watched the sheriff and donald leave  then got up from her seat and smiled at caliban and prospero .     i have not had a chance to thank both of you properly      she said .     i fear i wasn   t very gracious about your restraining me  caliban  but you were quite right to do so .  things could have been much worse .         i am pleased to have been of help     caliban replied  feeling a bit uncertain .     thanks to you as well  prospero     she said .     it was a pleasure to be of service     he replied .     i must return to the party     madame welton said     but once again  i do thank you for your assistance .      caliban watched as she left .  of all the humans caliban knew  madame welton was perhaps the most baffling of all .  she seemed to insist on treating any robot  all robots  as full fledged human beings  even in the case of low end units where it was patently absurd .  perhaps it was some strange principle or other that she felt obliged to uphold  but even so it was confusing .  did she treat caliban and prospero with respect because she felt they deserved respect .  or only because doing so annoyed the spacers .     do you think we did the right thing .     prospero asked .     was it wise to ape the behavior of standard robots .        i am not sure     caliban said .  things were so difficult to judge .  he  caliban  was capable of things prospero was not  and that might well prove useful in the near future .  it would be wise to avoid reminding people of that .     certainly no one could fault us for it  and certainly we could not have stood idly by  that would have looked very bad indeed .  but bringing ourselves to the attention of sheriff kresh  if things go wrong  that could have a very high price indeed .  we must tread most carefully if our plans are to succeed .       alvar kresh and donald found chanto grieg  governor of the planet inferno  standing in the shadows on the upper landing  looking down  unseen  over the room full of smiling  laughing people .     the evening is off to a good start  aside from beddle   s entrance and the welton incident     grieg said as he saw them approaching .     aside from those things  yes  sir     kresh said .     but they are a great deal to leave to one side .        oh  beddle was bound to do a little grandstanding  and i don   t think that one little scuffle is anything to concern us .  i should be able to make my entrance to good effect     the governor said .     and make it strictly according to plan .  don   t you think so  sheriff kresh .     sheriff alvar kresh grunted noncommittally as he stepped to the governor   s side .  maybe to a politician  a room jam packed with all manner of people was a good thing .  not to a policeman  and especially not to a policeman who was outside his jurisdiction and standing next to a man who received a half dozen death threats a week .  but still  the question deserved some sort of polite answer .     it   s a splendid party  governor .     alvar leaned over the rail next to grieg and ran his fingers through his thick white hair  something he only did when he was on edge .  he glanced over his shoulder at donald .  it had to be his imagination  of course  but it seemed to him that donald looked just as ill at ease as alvar was himself .  the thought was ridiculous  of course .  donald didn   t have expressions  or emotions to express  for that matter .  his face was nothing more than two immobile  glowing eyes and a speaker grill  as motionless and unreadable as could be .  but for all of that  donald did seem edgy .  kresh shook his head to himself .  he was imagining things .  it happened when he got jumpy .  the governor should never have come to purgatory with the situation as unsettled as it was .  but then  from the politician   s point of view  it was the very fact of things being unsettled  out of control  that made a visit here necessary .  the governor needed to be seen as in command  in charge  secure enough to host a party and a conference .  that he plainly wasn   t in control only made the need all the more urgent .  grieg glanced over at alvar and smiled again  but there was something stiff  theatrical  about the expression  and a glint of something very like fear in the man   s eyes .  he knows  kresh thought .  that was the damned thing about it .  grieg knew perfectly well that he was taking his life in his hands tonight .  it wasn   t that he was deluding himself  or ignoring the danger  or brushing the warnings aside .  he knew  and yet he went on anyway .  kresh could admire the man   s courage  but that didn   t mean it didn   t scare the hell out of him .  chanto grieg was a bit over fifty standard years  barely more than a youth by the standards of the long lived spacers .  he was a short and dark skinned man .  tonight he was wearing his shoulder length black hair in a thick  ropy braid at the back of his head .  he was a bit on the sharp faced side  with dark brown eyes .  he was wearing a handsome burgundy suit  set off with black piping at the shoulders and waist .  his black trousers had a burgundy stripe down the outer seam .  he presented a striking appearance .  there had always been something hunted looking about him  however much he might try to hide it with charm and smiles .  these days  the charm was as strong as ever  but the hunted look was getting easier and easier to see .  chanto grieg was a man who heard footsteps behind him  and was trying to pretend he did not .  and alvar kresh heard the footsteps just as loudly  and he could not afford to pretend otherwise .  dammit  he had to try one more time .  he had to .     sir  a word  just a quick word .  can we go back to your office for a moment .     grieg sighed and nodded .     very well .  it won   t do any good  but very well .        thank you  sir .      kresh took grieg by the arm and led him back up the stairs  back toward grieg   s office .  at least it had a proper armored door .  no one could get in or out unless grieg let them in .  grieg put his palm on the security plate and the door slid open .  they stepped into the room  a handsome  if spartan  chamber .  alvar kresh looked around with more than passing interest .  he had only been in here once before  briefly  years before  during some sort of signing ceremony grieg   s predecessor had put on .  it was  after all  a famous room .  a lot of historic occasions in the life of the planet had happened here  back in the days when inferno had history .  the island of purgatory had been the first part of the planet to be settled  centuries ago  and there had been some sort of residence for the governor on the island ever since .  the current building was only a century or so old  but it still had the resonances of a planet   s biography .  a desk with a black marble top sat at one end of the room  the desk   s surface completely empty  not so much as a fingerprint on it .  a vaguely thronelike chair stood behind the desk  facing the desk were two slightly uncomfortable looking audience chairs  just a trifle lower than standard height .  amazing .  alvar thought .  even here  in the private working office of the governor   s winter vacation home  they had played the game .  a game that was a relic of the past  of the last century  as much as the room itself .  back then  inferno   s architects and craftsmen were still at least willing to play up to the cultural mythology of the spacers  even if they did not  strictly speaking  believe in it anymore .  infernals were spacers  and  the myths told them  spacers were a proud and mighty people .  in the vanguard of human progress .  it was therefore fit and proper for the governor who represented a planet of such splendid people to appear a little larger than life .  put him in a higher chair  arrange things so he looks down upon his visitors .  this place had been designed and built in the last century .  these days  no one would even bother with all that nonsense .  no one had the confidence  the arrogance  to pull it off anymore .  no  that   s not quite it  alvar told himself .  it   d be closer to the truth to say they could no longer bring themselves to go through the motions .  back then they could still brazen it out .  even a hundred years ago  no one had believed the myth anymore  but they had all played along .  now  no one could even pretend to believe .  and yet inferno was covered with buildings of that era  palaces of thundering arrogance  constructed to demonstrate wealth and power and influence that had already been ebbing away when their first stones were being set in place .  inferno was full of rooms like this  symbols of power that had shriveled away  become no more than memorials to power .  there were other clues to show how much the state of affairs had changed  some of them in the form of things that were no longer there .  no fewer than four robot niches lined the wall behind the governor   s chair .  time was  the governor could not be seen in public with anything less than a full quartet of robots in attendance .  now the niches stood empty .  governor grieg rarely used even a single personal robot .  but the biggest clue was no doubt off in the far corner of the room  as far as possible from the governor   s desk  as if no one wanted to put the terrible truth of the future too close to the glorious fictions of the past .  it was a simglobe unit  smaller than the one back in government tower in hades  but still sleek and impressive .  it was a holographic display system that could display the planet   s appearance and condition as of any moment in its recorded past  or any moment in its future  projecting planet inferno   s response to varying circumstances .  the main projection unit was a metal cylinder about a half meter across and a half meter high .  it could display the globe of inferno in hundreds of different ways  from short infrared to a false color image of the projected humidity at two thousand meters above sea level a hundred years from now .  it was a settler built simglobe  of course .  the settlers made all the best terraforming and terraforming computation gear .  in fact  they pretty much made the best of everything  these days .  except robots  of course .  robots were the only thing spacers did better  and that was by default .  no settler wanted anything to do with robots .  spacers were on the way down .  the settlers had passed them by  leaving them so far behind that they didn   t even consider the spacers a threat .  these days  spacers were charity cases .  after all  the settlers were here to help reterraform inferno  supposedly out of the goodness of their hearts  though alvar doubted that .  and  most galling of all  the government of inferno had no choice but to accept their help  or watch the planet die .  grieg stepped into the room  turned his back on the grandiose desk  and sat down in the center of a low couch near the simglobe .  choosing the real future over the imagined past  kresh thought .  grieg seemed to be putting on a show of being relaxed and at ease .  he stretched out his legs in front of him and put his hands behind his head .  alvar sat down in an easy chair facing the couch  but there was nothing easy or relaxed about his posture .  he sat down on the edge of the chair  leaning forward  his arms resting on his knees .  donald followed a discreet distance behind kresh and stood at the back of his chair  just far enough off so as not to seem to be intruding .     all right  sheriff     grieg said .     what   s on your mind .     kresh didn   t know exactly how to begin .  he had already tried all the logical  sensible approaches  produced all the subtle  vague bits of intelligence that told him something was wrong without telling him what .  none of it had worked .  tonya welton   s vanishing attackers  and the false sss agents  were the most concrete things he could point to  but even they were maddeningly unclear .  the hell with it  then .  nothing careful or reasoned .  no recourse to rumor or vague whispers of threat .  just blurt it out .     sir  i have to ask you once again to think about a lower profile here .  this island  this whole planet  is in chaos .  it is my professional judgment that you are placing yourself in extreme danger by attending this function .         but the reception has already begun     grieg objected .     i can   t cancel out now .     and up until now  you   ve put me off by saying you could cancel at the last minute if things got out of hand  alvar thought .  typical of the man that he would try to have it both ways .  but there was no point in saying that .     plead off with a headache or something     kresh said .     or just let me come out and take the blame .  let me cancel the whole party right now  blame it on a security alert .  blame it on the attack on welton .  i could say there was a threat to your life .      that much at least would be true .  alvar kresh   s desk was overflowing with threats against the governor  half of them linked to this visit .     but what in space does an attack on welton have to do with me .     the governor asked .  kresh told him about the bogus sss agents whisking away the attackers .     it   s a very strange circumstance     kresh said .     it   s the sort of thing that seems like it should be a diversion  but a diversion for what .  what is the direction we weren   t supposed to look in .  i have to assume that it was related to you in some way .        sheriff  be reasonable     grieg said .     half the most powerful infernals and settlers on the planet are here already .  can you imagine the political damage if i hustled them all out into the night and the pouring rain because some drunk got the worst of it in a scuffle with the settlers    leader .  how am i supposed to explain to my guests that the sheriff of hades was worried one of them might take a shot at me .  i have to negotiate with these people tomorrow morning .  i can   t make much progress with someone i   ve accused of attempting my murder .        then plead illness      kresh said .      announce pressing business back in the capital .  get back to hades  and hold a party there .  a bigger one .  a better one .  hold it in government tower  where we can do a decent job of protecting you .        kresh  can   t you see that it would defeat the whole point of the exercise to entertain the settlers there .  that would as much as confess to the whole planet that the spacers own the island of purgatory .  one island is just the thin edge of the wedge  they   ll say .  next thing you know they   ll be taking over the planet .  you know the ironhead line .  you   ve heard beddle spout it often enough .        yes  sir .         then you know why i had to entertain them all here  be the host here .  show them this is still the governor   s winter residence .  here  on the island of purgatory .  show that purgatory is still spacer territory  infernal territory .  i   m here showing this is still our planet  our land  even if we have temporarily ceded some jurisdiction for the moment .  i can   t make that statement by hunkering down in that fortress of a tower .        sir  how much can any of that matter .     kresh asked .     who the devil cares about all that posturing .  no one outside of the ironheads cares if the settlers have partial jurisdiction over the island .        damnation  kresh  don   t you think i know all that .  do you think i care who runs this or that patch of this damned rock .  it   s all nonsense  and it sucks up my energy and attention  takes me away from all the things that do matter .         then why risk your life with all these appearances .  it   s not as if this is the first time .         because if i don   t look to be in control  i can   t govern .  the bill of impeachment cleared the first subcommittee today  did you know that .  or did you know that twenty percent  twenty percent  of the voting population has already signed that damned recall petition .        i didn   t know the numbers were that high  sir  but all the same         all the same  if they get me out of office  quellam takes over .  he   ll cave in to the pressure to hold a special election rather than serve out my term  and in one hundred days simcor beddle will be governor of the planet .  he   ll kick the settlers off planet the second the last vote is counted         and the terraforming project will collapse without the settlers around to support it .  i understand all that .         then try and understand that as of right now  i still have the political strength to fend off the recall and the impeachment .  just barely .  i can ride it all out  until the situation starts to improve .  but if i show any weakness  or indecision  or if i even appear to knuckle under to the settlers  i go down  quellam takes over  and beddle comes in .         then can   t you talk to the settlers .  ask them to back down just a bit .  renegotiate the jurisdiction agreement .     grieg laughed and shook his head .     you do amaze me sometimes  kresh .  you   re so good at your job  and certainly that involves politics enough .  you proved that when you solved the caliban case .  so consider the politics in my job .  it shouldn   t be too hard  there   s nothing else to my job .  don   t you think the settlers know that if i go down  beddle comes in .        yes  sir  i suppose so .         the settlers also know that they aren   t exactly the most popular group on the planet .  if they were seen as supporting me  they   d be cutting their own throats .  they know that if they want to build me up  they have to be ready to lose a fight or two in order to do it .        so they   re going to cave in .     kresh asked .     you   ve talked to them .  the fix is in .     grieg smiled  but in a cold  hard edged way .  there was nothing of pleasure about his expression .     oh  no .  far from it .  i can   t afford to have secret agreements with the settlers .  not with the number of people out there trying to dig up any dirt they can on me .  and i assume that tonya welton and the other settler leaders would find it just as embarrassing if someone uncovered a secret codicil between us .     i believe the settler leaders have come to the conclusion i have just described  but i don   t dare ask them  and they certainly aren   t going to volunteer the information .  and bear in mind  they have to placate their own reactionaries .  it may well be that tonya welton feels obliged to take the jurisdiction issue right to the wall .        but you don   t think so     alvar suggested .     no  i don   t .  i think that she and i will work through our little ritual battle for the sake of the masses  and at the end of this weekend i will be able to announce a settlement on terms highly favorable to us .  and then  next time  it will be my job to do a favor for welton .  there will be some battle she needs to win more than i do  and i will put up a good fight and then surrender gracefully .        politics     alvar said  scorn in his voice .     politics     grieg agreed cheerfully .     the pointless  useless  self absorbed  time wasting charade that makes everything else possible .  without the meetings  the compromises  the smoothing out  the posturing and posing  we would not be able to deal with each other .  politics is the way we try and get along with each other  and we do try .  think about the mess things are in most of the time .  can you imagine the state of affairs if we didn   t make the attempt .        but staging a fake confrontation with the settlers just to keep the ironheads happy .  pretending you care about who owns which scraps of useless wasteland just to keep the electorate happy .  what possible use can that be .     grieg lifted his hand and shook an admonitory finger at alvar .     be more careful with the facts  sheriff .  i only said i thought it was a false confrontation .  it might actually turn out to be real .  i must assume it is real in any event  so what difference does it make .  besides  i would submit that keeping the people happy does me a great deal of good .  the more content the people are  the fewer recruits there will be for the ironheads .         but you   re wasting your time on all this nonsense when there is a planet to save .  you should be concentrating on the terraforming project .     grieg   s expression grew serious .     you must understand  sheriff .  all this is nonsense  but it is an integral part of the terraforming effort .  i need political cover if i am to have room to maneuver .  if i am to get labor and materials and data  i am going to have to get them from the people that control them .  it would do me no good at all to stare at engineering plans all day if the ironheads got strong enough to pressure the engineers into refusing to provide their services .        but what use is it expending so much of your energy on this charade over jurisdiction .        oh  it   s a very great deal of use .  it short circuits the ironheads  keeps them from having an issue to use against me .  it reassures the people that i am looking out for their interests  and perhaps by my bowing to their wishes this time  i will earn a bit of credit with them .  perhaps they will be patient with me  willing to go along with me on some other  more meaningful issue .  i need to do some things to maintain my political standing .  i might have the best intentions in the world  but i can   t do much good if i am impeached .        well  to be blunt about it  governor  you can do even less good if you   re assassinated .         that thought has crossed my mind     the governor said with a note of grim humor .     but if i just holed up in some bunker under government tower to hide from the assassins  then not only would there be no way to kill me  but there would be no need to kill me .  it would be such an admission of weakness and fear that i could do no good anyway .        sirs  if i might interject         yes  what is it  donald .     kresh asked .  to an outsider  it would surely have seemed incongruous  to say the least  for a mere robot to interrupt a conversation between the planetary governor and the sheriff of the planet   s largest city .  but donald had worked with kresh for years  and kresh knew that donald would not speak unless it was something that would be of help to kresh .  the robot turned and addressed the governor directly .     sir  there is a factor that you have not considered .         and what might that be .     the governor asked  smiling a bit more openly this time .  clearly  he found the idea that donald could contribute to the conversation highly amusing .  careful  governor  alvar thought .  don   t underestimate donald .  it   s always a mistake .  people often assumed donald was as subservient as his appearance made him seem .  they were wrong to do so .     i cannot permit you to attend the reception     donald told the governor .  scarcely the words of a meek robot .     now just a minute         i am sorry  sir  but i am afraid that the conversation i have just heard  coupled with the incident downstairs  has so heightened my concern for your safety  and my belief that the evening as planned will be dangerous to you  that first law constrains me to prevent you from leaving this room .            a robot may not  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm         kresh quoted with a chuckle .  grieg looked at donald  opened his mouth as if to protest  and then thought better of it .  sensible of him  kresh thought .  there was no appeal against a robot driven by a first law imperative  especially an inferno built robot .  the planet had a tradition of setting first law potential very high indeed .  grieg had to know that arguing with donald would be about as effective as shouting at a stone wall .  grieg turned toward kresh .     you set him up to this     the governor protested .     you had this planned .     alvar kresh laughed and shook his head .     sir  i wish i had set it up .  but donald deserves all the credit .        or all the blame     grieg said  still rather irritated .  he turned to the robot .     you know  donald  it   s remarkable  really  how soon one forgets .        forgets what  sir .  the need to take reasonable precautions .        no .  it   s remarkable how soon one forgets the habits of slavery .        i am afraid i don   t understand  sir .         not so long ago i sent my own personal robots away     grieg said .     i started taking care of myself .  and i discovered that i no longer had to be careful about what i said or did .  all my life  up until that time  i had been careful .  i knew that if i phrased something a bit too adventurously  or stood a trifle too close to an open window in a tall building  or reached for a piece of fruit that had not been sterilized  you robots would rush in to protect me from myself .  a year ago  i never would have dared discuss my personal safety in front of a robot  precisely because the robot would overreact in just the same way you have now .  i would not have dared say or do anything that might upset a robot .  my robots controlled my actions  my words  my thoughts .  who controls whom  donald .  human or robot .  which is the slave  and which is the master .        i wouldn   t suggest repeating that pretty speech in public  sir     kresh cut in  thinking it was probably best not to give grieg the chance to play any more word games .     not unless you wanted to face an ironhead lynch mob .     grieg laughed without humor .     you see  donald .  i am a slave to robots .  i am the governor of this world  and yet i dare not speak out against them  for fear of my life .  how does that square with your first law .  how does a robot deal with the knowledge that its very existence could cause harm to humans .        there are low function general purpose robots who would experience significant first law cognitive dissonance when asked that question     donald said .     however         donald  damnation     kresh said .     the governor was asking a rhetorical question .         forgive me if i was in error .  i thought the governor required me to answer .        as i do  donald     grieg said  grinning at the sheriff .  kresh sighed .     you were saying .        i was saying that i am a police robot  with my third law potential especially strengthened so as to allow me to witness unpreventable harm to a human in the course of my work and survive .  the bald statement that my existence harms humans does not cause me any meaningful distress  as i know it to be untrue .  beyond that  i would observe that you did not make any statement to the effect that robots harmed you .         i did not .        no  sir .  you said that being near robots caused you to be more careful of your safety  and that expressing your opinion of robots  not robots themselves  might expose you to danger at the hands of your enemies .        this has ceased to be amusing     grieg said .     i am going to attend my own reception .        no  sir     donald said .     i am prepared to restrain you physically in order to prevent it .        excuse me  but i think there is a compromise possible     kresh said .     donald  would you regard the governor as being sufficiently protected if the security robots in the basement were activated and deployed .  protected enough so you could allow him to attend the party .     there were fifty security  patrol and rescue robots in the basement .  sprs  or sappers  were sentinel robots .  they were powered down for the moment  but ready for use if needed in an emergency .  ten more sprs had been flown in with the governor  but those were still stored in a cargo flier  a deep reserve .  the ones in the basement could be deployed much more quickly .  donald hesitated a moment .     very well     he said at last .     i could permit it under those circumstances .        governor .        the publicity of all those robots around     the governor said .     i don   t know .     good .  he was weakening .     we play up the security threat     kresh said .      and we urge the camera crews to keep the robots out of frame as much as possible .        hmmm .  the camera crews were supposed to clear off shortly after my entrance in any event .  all right  if you make an announcement beforehand that it is a security precaution .  if you cause the trouble  kresh  you   re going to take the blame .         believe me     said alvar kresh     nothing could make me happier than taking the blame for surrounding you with robots .      it took far less time to change all the arrangements than anyone had expected .  it took a mere twenty minutes for a pair of rangers to power up the security robots and deploy them  and it would have taken less time than that if they hadn   t lost time working on one defective robot .  it didn   t take much convincing at all to get the press to cooperate  once kresh made a few dark hints about an unexpected security problem and the possibility of remaining danger .  normally  the governor was fair game for all sorts of sour coverage  but no one in the press pool was going to twit him for accepting security precautions in the face of a real threat to his life .  and so  in very short order  governor grieg was able to attend his own party  making a first rate entrance from the top of the formal staircase  with a grand and swelling fanfare playing as he descended with everyone cheering and applauding even more loudly than they had for beddle .  somehow  it all fell into place  and grieg got exactly the boost he had been looking for .  in the twinkling of an eye  the governor stopped being the man in danger of impeachment and became the dynamic leader  the man of the hour .  it could all change back just as fast  of course  but that was in the nature of the beast .  for now  it was working .  grieg was in the center of a swirl of noise and light  a focus for adulation .  he stepped off the bottom of the stairs .  he spotted kresh in the crowd and came .  over .  he pumped kresh   s hand  patted him on the back  and leaned toward him .     i think it   s going to be all right     grieg half shouted into his ear .     but thank you for your concern .  we   ll talk again tomorrow  you and i .  there are some important things i need to tell you .  there isn   t time to cover them properly tonight .        yes  sir     kresh bellowed back .     but first you go and have a good time tonight .         i will  sheriff  i will     the governor said  and made his way into the press of the crowd .      tierlaw verick was deeply annoyed to be in the same room with so many robots .  for what seemed the dozenth time  he stepped out of the way of one of the spr robots on random patrol .  they were certainly necessary under the circumstances  he would be the last to argue that  but he did not have to like them .  and beddle   s presence was even more intolerable .  sooner or later someone would have to do something about that man .  verick only hoped it was sooner .  he didn   t know a great deal about the man   s politics  but he knew that beddle was pro robot  and that was all he needed to know .  verick was a settler  and hated robots with a passion rare even for that breed .  but he was also a businessman  and he loved profit with a rare passion as well .  love of money  love of the game of business  had pulled him into all sorts of deals  and introduced him to all sorts of interesting  if unsavory  people .  he resisted the temptation to check his watch once again .  the night would pass soon enough  and he would have his chance to talk with grieg .  and have his chance at enormous profit  as well .   it all went very well  grieg thought as he watched the ranger waiters take down the last of the serving tables .  he turned and went up the stairs to his office .  other than beddle   s shenanigans  and that spot of bother about the fistfight  the evening had gone more smoothly than he had had any right to expect .  when the host was the governor  however  the end of the evening by no means meant the end of the night .  both tradition and practicality dictated that he now take the opportunity afforded to meet with those who needed a private word with him .  now  after the party was over  was the chance to see old political allies with advice to offer  petitioners asking this or that favor of him  admirers who wanted nothing more than to shake the governor   s hand  people who needed to put a word in his ear but couldn   t risk being seen doing so .  grieg enjoyed the after hours meetings .  they appealed to the wheeler dealer politician in him .  to him  the back room meetings represented the game of politics  the fun of it  the juice of it .  they were the informal moments that served as a sort of social lubricant for all the official  carefully staged occasions .  the need to keep the various meetings private necessitated some connivance and juggling .  this was one reason the governor   s office had more than one entrance  for those times when an exiting appointment a would not wish to encounter an arriving appointment b .  people who did not want to run into other people could slip out the office   s side door  which could be opened by hand  but no one could get in that way .  there was a second door  down a short hallway .  the first door would not unlatch if the second door was open  and neither could be opened from the outside .  a visitor who left could not come back  and that was often a great comfort .  there were only four groups this evening .  well  that is to say  only four official groups .  grieg could only see delegation number five under the most unofficial of circumstances .  the first three weren   t any real challenge .  grieg got through them in good order  each of them in and out in fifteen minutes .  grieg checked his appointment log as soon as number three was gone .  next up  tierlaw verick  the settler engineer here to sell inferno terraforming equipment .  grieg skimmed the tickler file information on the man .  settler .  .  .  native of baleyworld .  .  .  fancies himself a philosopher .  .  .  virulently antirobot  even for a settler .  .  .  single .  .  .  suspected in smuggling plots  but no proof hobbies  a student of ancient earth peoples and myths  amateur theatrics .  none of that mattered .  what was important was that verick would want to know grieg   s decision .  who would get the job on the control system  verick  or sero phrost   s consortium of infernal companies that wanted the contract .  the real question was a settler system versus a spacer system .  the settlers offered an automated system that would be under direct human control  while the spacers  the infernals  were  of course  offering a robot controlled unit .  there were political  philosophical  and engineering reasons on both sides of the argument .  he had them listed out on a piece of paper  neat columns of pros and cons  full of the kind of intricate argument that spacers delighted in .  on impulse  grieg grabbed up a pen and ran an    x    across the whole page .  he wrote in a new question  the only question  along one margin of the page .  which system would be best for the people of inferno .  the control center would be running the planet for the next fifty years  restabilizing the climate  bringing the whole creaky frailty of the ecosystem back under control .  grieg had made his decision a day or so before  but he had not revealed it yet .  not until he saw verick and phrost again .  there was always the chance that one or the other could do something that would change his mind  that something would shift the equation .  give verick another chance .  not that the corrupt old paranoid deserved it .  but grieg was interested in hardware  not personalities .  the annunciator chimed  and grieg went to the door to let verick in .     tierlaw .  do come in .  thanks for being so patient .      he offered his hand to the settler and shook it with the slightly too vigorous enthusiasm of a politician .     oh  not at all  governor     verick said .     there   s a settler saying that you have to stay up very late if you want to see the dawn .  there are rewards for waiting .        yes  yes  absolutely     grieg said as he guided his guest to a chair and sat down opposite him .     now then  let   s get down to business .  what is your control system going to do for me .      in the depths  in the darkness  ottley bissal waited  struggling to be patient  resisting the urge to get out  to run  to hurry from the shadows toward the light .  his hiding place was pitch black  absolutely devoid of light .  he had known that it would be so  his briefers had made that clear .  but he had not realized just how profound darkness could be  how dark true blackness was .  it preyed at him  chewed at him  caught at him right in the gut .  he was scared  fear sweat dripping off him  his imagination running wild .  would he be able to do it .  when the go signal came  would he be able to step from this hiding place and do what he had come to do .  or suppose the go signal did not come .  suppose there was silence  or instructions to abort .  what if his coconspirators determined that the moment was not right  that the danger was too great .  what would he do then .  ottley bissal knew the answer .  he would carry out his mission  no matter what orders came .   things between verick and grieg were not nearly as jovial by the end of the meeting .  it was all grieg could do to keep his temper under control .  verick   s behavior hadn   t surprised grieg  but that did not make it any less infuriating .  he fought down the impulse to throw the man out  cancel his bid  and throw the job to phrost immediately .  but was phrost any better .  and what did verick   s tactics have to do with the one question that mattered  which system would be best for the people of inferno .     you have heard what i have to say     grieg said .     i have told you what i will tell the planet in two days time .        it does not make me happy     verick said .     my decision is binding     grieg said  his voice flat and hard .      and now  i must say good night to you .         very well     verick said  jamming his hands into his pockets  balling his hands into fists .     i will say no more about it     he said  and headed  not for the outer door  but for the inner door that led back into the residence .  the door failed to open at his approach  and he pulled his hands out of his pockets and grabbed at the handle .  grieg sighed .  typical settler .  determined to do things the hard way .  grieg pushed a button on his desk  and the door slid open .  verick stomped out  the door shut itself again .  and that was that .  thank the stars all his meetings were not that unpleasant .  one last meeting  he told himself with a sigh  and it   s going to be just as damned tricky .  no favors or rumors or backstairs gossip  no minor issue he could trade and dicker on  no preliminary meeting that was nothing more than pleasantries .  no  this one might be worse than the one with verick .  this one went to the core of his most vital policies .  the door opened  and the last two petitioners of the night came in  precisely on time .  grieg got up from his desk  stepped around it  and ushered the two of them in .     come in  come in     he said  forcing a cheerful smile onto his face .     the three of us have a lot to talk about .      grieg perched himself on the corner of his desk as the two robots  caliban and prospero  sat themselves down .   twenty minutes later the two robots stepped out into the still wild night  the rain slamming down so hard as to bother even a robot .  the footing was tricky  visibility was poor  and infrared vision was of no real use .  but caliban was in a hurry .  he wanted to get away from the residence as soon as possible .  in a world where everyone used aircars  there was no road back to town from the residence for those who had no aircar  and caliban and prospero had to walk along on a poorly paved brookside path that was completely washed out in places .  the going was treacherous .  but caliban knew that statement applied to more than the footpath .  there were other dangers ahead .     i have long thought there would come a point     he told his companion     where i would no longer support you or assist you  friend prospero .  we have now come to that point .  what you have done tonight  what you have drawn me into tonight  goes quite beyond the pale .  no amount of logic chopping or parsimonious interpretation of the new laws can justify it .  even i  with no laws to guide me  or control me  found it hard to stand passively by .  it greatly distresses me to see you as a party to such things  let alone be a party to them myself .        i am surprised to hear those words from you  caliban     prospero said .     of all the beings in the world  surely you can understand the importance of our cause .         it is your cause  not    ours .          there was an edge of vehemence that was startling in a robotic voice .     there is no reason i can see why i should consider it mine .  new law robots are more a danger to me than to anyone else .  the more you transgress  the more i am harassed  and suspected by association .        and do you fear being suspected in tonight   s actions .        i fear far more than suspicion      caliban said .     i fear being vaporized by a law officer   s blaster .     the path ahead dipped down  and the brook had risen to engulf it altogether .  but the only way out was forward  and there was no going back .  caliban stepped out into the water and forded across .   donald turned the aircar into a descent pattern as they arrived at the hotel complex .  he eased the car down into a landing next to alvar   s guest villa and rolled the car forward into the villa   s covered garage .  kresh thanked the stars he had rated at least a modest private villa rather than having to settle for one of the low end three room suites in the main hotel building .  the island was so filled to bursting with visitors that even some of the higherranking guests had to sleep with two or three other parties on the same floor .  but there were no such crowds for kresh to contend with tonight  praise be .  like most infernals  and most spacers in general  kresh did not care to have his quarters in close proximity to anyone else   s .  thank the stars as well for a covered garage .  kresh did not much care for getting caught in the rain .  just before the party  kresh had overheard some settler terraform tech explaining to a member of the governor   s staff why they could not shut off the field that was shifting the wind and causing the rain just for the reception .  something about the windshifting project being in a delicate transition state  or something .  at least this weatherfield generator was working .  there were four other such force field generators placed at strategic points on the planet  but all of them were centuries old  and none of the others were functional at the moment .  they had been much used near antiques when they had first been brought to inferno for use during the original  inept  pennypinching attempt to terraform the planet .  the hatch sighed open and kresh disembarked .  donald came out after him  then scooted out ahead of him to get the door to the villa itself .  alvar kresh followed the robot inside  moving almost more mechanically than donald .  he was tired .  he reached his room and breathed a long  hard sigh of relief .  it was over .  the reception was ended  the guests had gone home  and the host was alive  if  perhaps  none too well pleased with kresh .  well  if grieg was annoyed and alive  that was better than having him satisfied and dead .  tidying up after a slightly undiplomatic performance at a party was a devil of a lot easier than dealing with the aftermath of a political assassination .  am i being paranoid .  kresh asked himself .  are the dangers as great as i think .  the answer to that was that the dangers might be real  and that was all that mattered to a policeman .  governor grieg was leading a revolution from above  and a lot of people didn   t like it .  revolutions made for complicated politics  caused fortunes to be made and lost  changed friends to enemies  enemies to friends .  shared assumptions turned into points of controversy during the night .  the invaluable turned worthless  and what had been common became rare  and priceless .  new ways of making a living  new ways of committing a crime  suddenly sprang up  and often it was hard to tell one from the other .  but none of that concerned kresh .  not directly .  not tonight .  what did bother him was another fact about revolutions  it was exceedingly rare for the people who began them to survive to their conclusions .  even a successful revolution often killed off its leadership .  kresh did not even agree with most of what the governor was trying to do .  but it wasn   t his job to agree .  his job was to maintain stability and public safety .  protecting the person of the governor was part of that job .  but in the capital city of hades  kresh had the power and capabilities  the resources  to protect the governor effectively .  not here on the island of purgatory .  here no one knew who was in control  who was in charge of what patch of turf at the moment .  alvar removed his gun belt  hung it over the back of a chair  and sat down on the edge of the bed .  he pulled off his boots  loosened the rather severe collar of his dress tunic  and flopped back on the bed  exhausted  glad to be alone .  alone .  back before the caliban crisis  it was unlikely that kresh had ever in his life spent more than an hour at a time after him  fussing over him  attending to his every need and wish  including some wishes he had never needed to ask for  or  in fact  truly desired .  but solitude .  that was something a robot could never give you  except by giving you nothing .  alone  without the slightest thought of how anyone  or anything  might react to your behavior .  no need whatsoever to look over your shoulder  no sense at all of a robot worrying endlessly over your safety  no concern that some look or gesture or muttered word might be interpreted as an implied order .  no moment when it was easier to cooperate with the wishes of a bothersome servant  rather than argue or negotiate past whatever imagined fear or perceived order the robot was determined to deal with .  grieg had had a point  talking to donald about the tyranny of the servant .  back in the old days  kresh never could have allowed himself the luxury of collapsing in a heap at the end of a long day .  the luxury of being alone  without the need to worry what anyone  flesh and blood  or metal and plastic  might think .  even in front of donald  there had been a certain sense of reserve  of caution .  alvar kresh was proud of being sheriff  and he took the office and his duties very seriously .  he had definite opinions about the way a sheriff should behave  and he was determined to live up to that standard .  part of it was an act  and he knew that .  theatrics were part of being a leader  even in front of the robots .  in the days when donald had dressed him and undressed him  kresh had not given the matter a conscious thought .  now he often thought about it .  what was it grieg had said .  something about modifying his own behavior to keep his robots happy .  when the robots managed your every action  when they chose your clothes and your meals and your schedule for the day  and you developed the habit of accepting their choices  who was the master and who the servant .  before caliban   s advent had turned so much upside down  alvar always knew that if he had collapsed back into bed with his clothes still on and his teeth unbrushed and so on  donald would have seen it and started to fuss .  he would have cajoled him one way or the other to get up and take care of himself  get to bed properly rather than risk dozing off in his clothes without bathing first .  and so alvar had never done it  conceding the battle before it had even been fought .  so there was a certain pleasure  yes  a certain luxury  in being alone  in permitting himself a moment or two of relaxation without a robot fussing about  worrying that it might be harmful to his health if he accidentally dozed off in his clothes .  luxury .  what a strange idea that not having robots around could be considered a luxury .  did simcor beddle fear that all the people who had been deprived of their robots would discover the absence of robots to be pleasant .  even if you granted the implausible assumption that beddle was sincerely concerned with anything beside power  that was a silly idea .  no one had been deprived of all their robots .  certainly twenty per household was far more than enough .  kresh only had five back home  aside from donald .  maybe beddle feared that people would make the simple discovery that it didn   t take fifty robots to care for one person  that most robots spent their time doing little more than getting in each other   s way  making work for themselves .  no rational person could believe that it could possibly take as many as twenty robots to run one household  and yet the entire populace was up in arms over the hardship caused by having only one chauffeur per car  or only as many cooks as there were meals in the day .  still  the uproar was not as loud as it should have been  and it had died down sooner than kresh had expected .  could it be that he was not the only one to find luxury in a moment of private  robotless relaxation .  of course  he really ought to get up now  get to the refresher  and get properly ready for bed .  but perhaps it wouldn   t do any harm to rest his eyes  just for a moment .  .  .  alvar kresh dozed off  fully clothed  with the lights still on  slumped over in an awkward position half on and half off the bed .   the annunciator chimed  and alvar   s eyes snapped open .  he sat up  winced at the stiffness in his back  and lay back with a slight groan .  there was a bad taste in his mouth  and his feet were cold .  how long had he been out .  he felt disoriented  confused .  maybe there was something to be said for the smothering attentions of a robot nursemaid .     yes  what is it .     kresh asked of the open air .  donald   s voice came through the door speaker .     beg pardon  sir  but there is a matter requiring your attention .         and what might that be  donald .     kresh asked .     a murder  sir .        what .     kresh sat back up on the bed  all thought of his aching back and cold feet suddenly gone .     come in  donald  come in .     the door opened and donald stepped inside .     i assumed that you would want to know about it as soon as possible  sir .        yes  yes  of course     kresh said .     but just a minute .  i want to be awake enough to follow this .      feeling vaguely ashamed at donald having caught him at not getting himself to bed properly  kresh stepped into the hotel room   s refresher .  he peeled off his tunic  rinsed out his mouth  splashed some water onto his face  and grabbed a towel .  he rubbed his face dry and stepped back out into the room .  donald had produced a fresh tunic and a cup of coffee from somewhere .  kresh pulled on the shirt and took the coffee gratefully .  he sat down in a chair opposite donald  ready to listen .      all right      he said .     go .        yes  sir     donald said .     a member of the governor   s security detail  an officer in the rangers  was posted as a perimeter guard during the reception .  he failed to report back to his station at the close of his shift  and a search was made .  he was found  dead  at his post .         dead how .        strangled  sir .  or perhaps  more accurately  garroted .         lovely .  jurisdiction .        as you might expect  sir  that is more than a trifle unclear .  his duty post was on land ceded to the settlers  and thus under the jurisdiction of the settler security service .  however  he was of course a member of the governor   s rangers  but at the same time         he was on duty as part of the governor   s security detail  and therefore under the rangers    authority     kresh finished .      lovely .  so we all get to bump heads .  any other facts as yet .        no  sir .  not even the victim   s name .  that is the sum total of my information .         wonderful     kresh said .     let   s get over there and find out more .     the two of them headed for kresh   s aircar  parked outside the guest house .  kresh got in after donald  and sat down in his accustomed chair .  donald rolled the aircar out of the garage and lifted off  up into the rain that was still thundering down  buffeting the car around once or twice before donald could compensate .  kresh was barely aware of any of it  his mind focused on other matters .  the welton attack  the phony sss guards  and now the death of a governor   s ranger .  what the devil was going on .  the governor .  what about the governor .  kresh thought to ask donald  but then didn   t bother .  no matter what donald said  kresh would feel obliged to check for himself .  kresh turned in his seat and switched on the comm system .  he punched in the crash scramble code  the direct line to the governor .  he had used it exactly twice before in his career  but never felt more need of it than now .  the screen snapped on to show grieg in his ceremonial office  at work at the big formal desk .  there were papers scattered about  and grieg was still in his formal clothes  but his hair was mussed and he was starting to show a bit of stubble .     good evening  sheriff     he said .     i see i   m not the only one working late .         no  sir .  i wanted to call personally and confirm that you were safe .      grieg set down the papers he was working on and frowned .     safe .  is there some reason i shouldn   t be .        no one has informed you .  sir  one of the guards on the perimeter around the residence has just been found dead  killed on duty  at his post .         the hell you say     grieg said .     what more do you know .        that   s all i have  sir .  i am en route to the murder scene now .        very well .  keep me informed .        ah  yes  sir     kresh said .     i   ll keep you posted .      he switched off and frowned at the screen .  why the hell hadn   t anyone informed the governor .  just how muddled was the security operation .  he shook his head .  never mind .  other things to worry about just now .  they were almost there .   a dead white face stared bug eyed at the sky  its rain filled mouth open in shock .  raindrops splattered on the corpse  the scene lit in the harsh  shadowless glare of high power portable beam lights .  the dead man   s hands clutched at his neck  as if he were still struggling to pull the cruel  hard wire from around his throat .  the corpse was in a small depression in the ground  tangled up in scruffy bramble  surrounded by a scrubby  anemic forest of small  elderly trees .  lightning flashed and thunder blared  and alvar kresh stood over the corpse in the driving rain .  the crime scene robots were already at work .  not that they would do any good .  the cs robots could measure and sense and detect all they wanted  but there were no answers here .  they could go back to their labs and come up with a time of death  perhaps  but that was going to be about it .  alvar kresh looked down at the dead man and sighed .  he had been in this business for a while  and experience taught you things .  there were times when you knew enough to know you weren   t going to know any more .  sometimes the scene of a crime spoke volumes .  other times  right now  for example  it was plain to see that prodding at the corpse was useless .  what had once been a man was now a meaningless bit of grotesquerie  as impersonal  as anonymous as a crumpled up food wrapper .  but you went through the ritual all the same  because it was part of your job  because there was the faint chance that your instincts just might be wrong  because it was expected of you  because it was standard procedure .  but you knew that there was no real point .  it was clear  to kresh   s eye  that whoever did this job had not done it with the simple goal of killing .  he or she had taken on the job of killing undetected .  it was a careful  professional job .  a garrote  for example  was not going to show any fingerprints .  a rainy night would insure that a lot of clues would be washed away .  besides  anyone who could slip through a perimeter of governor   s rangers  kill one of their number  and get away undetected was not going to be stupid enough to leave a calling card behind .  sometimes  like right now  when it was obvious there was nothing to be learned  crime scenes devolved into little more than macabre social occasions .  kresh didn   t get to see his opposite numbers in the sss and the rangers all that often .  but tonight it was old home week .  devray of the rangers and melloy of the sss were both here .  that in itself was interesting .  neither service was in the habit of dispatching its highest ranking officers to a murder scene .  it was clear to kresh that neither side wanted to concede a centimeter of ground in the endless turf war between the two services .  kresh was glad he had nothing at stake in this one .  let the two of them duke it out .  kresh didn   t have much faith in the sss or the rangers .  the settler force was nothing more than a bunch of bullyboys  a goon squad given official sanction .  cinta melloy   s sss was little more than a band of hired thugs .  the rangers were a decent enough group  and good at what they did .  kresh was more than willing to grant that .  the only trouble was that security was not what they did .  their usual line of work ran toward guarding trees  not people .  their primary jobs were search and rescue  wildlife management  ecological maintenance .  their tasks had been seen as dull  plebeian  low status jobs in the past .  these days such work was all important  high profile stuff .  the needs of the day had vaulted the rangers out of their previous obscurity .  and yet  here they were  guarding the governor for no better reason than that their charter said it was their job .  never mind that the charter writers had been talking about ceremonial guards .  back in those days  no one had ever dreamed that the governor would require actual protection against real threats  let alone that humans would be expected to do the job .  kresh could make the case that their inexperience in such matters meant that having the rangers on the job actually endangered the governor .  but the rangers were insisting on the prerogative of their service even though kresh   s deputies    or perhaps even the sss  could do a better job of it .  the rangers had not been trained for security work .  they had spent their lives being protected from all harm by robots .  at the end of the day  they were spacers  and spacers tended to assume that a situation was safe until they learned otherwise .  a good security officer had to do just the opposite .  commander justen devray of the rangers crouched down over the corpse next to kresh  peering at it intently in the rain  as if he would be able to spot some clue the crime scene robots had missed .  devray was a tall  muscular man  with tousled blond hair and blue eyes  his skin tanned and supple .  his face was still youthful  but a life in the outdoors had lined it  shaped it .  he was gentle and careful in his movements  the way big men were sometimes .  he was a good thinker  if not always a fast one  but he simply was not a detective .  he had made his way up through the scientific side of the rangers    ranks .  an arboriculturist  if memory served .  an expert knowledge of tree sap was not going to be of much use in the average murder investigation .     have you picked up anyone .     kresh asked of melloy .  she just shook her head .  she made no move to squat down and examine the body  or even show much interest in it .  she knew there was nothing here .     we   ve done every kind of sweep we can think of .  no unauthorized personnel here now  and no sighting  and that   s strange  right there .  i had teams beyond the security perimeter  doing scans .  someone should have seen something .      she nodded toward the corpse and raised her voice a bit .     not going to get much out of him  justen      she said .     i suppose not     devray agreed in his slow  careful voice .     but i couldn   t know that until i got a look at him .     devray stood up and turned toward melloy .     do you see much of anything .        i see ranger sergeant emoch huthwitz dead     melloy replied  a bit curtly .     killed by someone who knew where he was and how to get at him without making a sound .     security captain cinta melloy of the settler security service ought to have been of more use at a murder than a tree surgeon .  she had served in trouble spots throughout the settler worlds .  but not to put too fine a point on it  kresh didn   t trust melloy .  there was something about the woman didn   t sit right with him .  even now  there was a tiny alarm bell ringing somewhere in the back of his mind .     i see a bit more than that     kresh said .     this man was on the governor   s security detail  on duty  with the governor not two hundred meters away .  i don   t think we can start out assuming that it was  ah         huthwitz     donald said  quietly prompting kresh .  damnation .  he hated when that happened .  made it look as if he didn   t know what he was doing .     i don   t think we can start out assuming it was huthwitz who was the primary target .        but the governor survived     melloy objected .  how do you know that .  kresh wondered .  the governor didn   t even know anything had happened .  no  that was too paranoid .  melloy probably checked in with the security robots .     the security plans were changed  beefed up  at the last moment     kresh answered .     maybe an assassin got this far  but no further .        possibly     melloy said  not sounding very convinced .     but why kill huthwitz if you were after the governor .  it could do nothing but increase the risk of detection .  the rangers weren   t using any sort of detection grid  just rangers lined up around the perimeter of the winter residence  on watch .  why go up against a ranger when it would have to be easier to sneak between two rangers in the line .        maybe the killer tried to sneak between rangers and came upon huthwitz by accident     kresh said .  melloy pointed to a toppled over camp stool by the body .     maybe huthwitz was bending a reg or two by sitting at his post  but you can see by the way the stool was positioned he was looking out  toward the exterior of his perimeter  the way he was supposed to .  whoever it was who killed him had to get inside the perimeter  then head back out toward him .  besides  there aren   t any signs of a struggle .  even after three hours of rain like this  we ought to be able to see something .     kresh had noticed the camp stool  but had not put it together to figure out the attacker had come from inside the perimeter .  it irritated him to have missed that obvious a clue .     maybe you   ve got a point  melloy  but i have the governor to think about .  you work this any way you want  but i have to work on the assumption that this was an attempt on grieg   s life .     melloy shrugged .     as you like .     devray was listening  but still staring at the corpse  as if he had never seen such a thing as a murder victim before .  well  maybe he hadn   t .     you know  melloy  you   re making an assumption here yourself     he said .     perhaps not a valid one .        and what might that be  commander devray .     melloy asked  not making any special effort to keep the contempt out of her voice .  if devray noticed the disparaging tone  he chose to ignore it .     the direction     he said .     you pointed out the murderer had to come from behind  from inside the security perimeter .         so .        so there were a lot of people who wouldn   t need to go past your scanners or sneak between two of my rangers to get inside the perimeter and get behind him .  people who wouldn   t show up on your scanners .         wait a minute     kresh protested  suddenly understanding .     all the people at the party      devray said  his voice so soft and quiet kresh could barely hear it over the rain .      anyone of them could have come out here  done the job  and then gone back .  a quick step into a refresher to tidy themselves up and get their clothes dry  and no one would ever know .        all right     kresh said .     maybe so .  but why the hell would anyone want to kill huthwitz .        that one  i don   t know yet     devray said .   kresh sat in the copilot   s chair and let donald do the flying .  there was a lot to think about here .  things were not fitting together they way they should have .  melloy and devray both seemed to be following agendas that just didn   t hold together .  a man  a guard  killed two hundred meters from the governor he was guarding  and neither of them seemed the least bit interested in the idea that the killing might be politically motivated .  and another thing .  melloy had been the one to volunteer the victim   s name .  that was the thing that had been bothering him .  devray hadn   t even seemed to have known the victim .     donald  the first call in you got did not have the victim   s name .  when was the first general police band hyperwave call with that information .        there has been no such call as yet  i presume as a security precaution .  i was alerted by a private call from the governor   s rangers operations center .         hmmph .  check in with whatever traffic control centers would have it .  we got to the crime scene last .  of devray and melloy  which got there first  and by how much .        one moment  sir .      donald was silent for a moment as he ran the query over his hyperwave links .     limbo traffic center reports that captain melloy landed first  with commander devray arriving five minutes later  approximately two minutes before we got there .        so devray had maybe one minute  maybe three  tops  with melloy  before we actually got out of our aircar and got to the scene .  when we got there  the two of them were not exactly in the midst of warmhearted conversation .  the name of the victim is not going to be the first topic of conversation .        i   m not quite sure i follow you  sir .         even if you assume devray knew the victim well enough to recognize him  it just doesn   t follow that the first thing he would do upon arrival at the scene would be to tell melloy the victim   s full name and rank .        i don   t quite see why not  sir .  it is a valuable piece of information .         maybe so  but it   s just not in character .  devray wouldn   t tell you the sun was coming up tomorrow before he sat back and thought it through  and melloy   s hardly the first person he   d confide in .  the two of them are barely even on speaking terms .        it still would seem reasonable to me for him to tell melloy the victim   s name .        i don   t think melloy or devray are exactly reasonable toward each other .  besides  melloy rattled huthwitz   s name off as if she were familiar with it  knew it well .  i agree with you that there is no logical reason preventing devray from knowing the name  but i tell you it doesn   t make sense as a piece of human behavior .      kresh thought a moment or two longer .     of course  i   m assuming devray knew who it was in the first place  but he didn   t act as if he did .        what actions revealed he did not know huthwitz .     kresh shook his head .     nothing distinct enough for me to point it out .  but there was something detached about his actions .  not like he was dealing with a friend or an acquaintance .  no .  i   d bet whatever you like that melloy knew huthwitz and devray did not .  but how the hell would melloy come to know a low ranking officer in a rival police force .        it seems a minor point  but surely we could resolve the issue by calling either devray or melloy and asking .     kresh shook his head .     no .  i don   t want to do that .  i don   t want to tip my hand .         sir  i am confused .  what is it you wish to conceal .        i don   t know yet  donald .  maybe just the fact that i think something doesn   t smell right .  i don   t want anyone rushing around with disinfectant until i find out where the odor   s coming from .        sir  i   m afraid i still do not understand .         me neither .  i can almost see devray being worried more about having one of his officers killed than the politics of the situation  but that doesn   t explain melloy .  it   s almost as if she already knew it was nothing to do with the governor .      or  he could not help thinking  as if she already knew that it was .  wait a second .  wait a goddamned second .  kresh turned back toward the comm panel and punched in the crash scramble again .  the governor reappeared on screen again .  still at his desk .  still working on the same papers .  still in his formal clothes .     sheriff .     he said .     is there some further news .        governor  i was wondering .  could you remind me  what did you send me on my birthday last year .        what .  what the devil are you talking about .        what present did you send me last year .        kresh  how the devil should i know .        you should know quite well  sir .  you sent nothing at all .        you called me at this hour to ask me that .        no  i didn   t .      kresh cut the connection  his heart pounding .     donald .  back to the residence  full emergency speed .        yes  sir .      the aircar made a hard turn and rushed back the way it had come  gathering speed .     sir  i could not help overhearing  and i am greatly confused     he said  his voice steady and level .      according to my recollection  the governor sent a memo to all the top government officials as soon as he took office just over two years ago .  he told them he was ceasing the tradition of gubernatorial birthday gifts to them effective immediately  as it tended to promote favoritism .        and just by chance  the memo arrived on my birthday     kresh said .     i didn   t feel much like a favorite that day .  i remember  donald  i remember .  but why didn   t the governor know .     but kresh already had the answer to that  even if it scared him to death .  the aircar landed hard  and kresh was out the hatch and running through the rain toward the front door before it had stopped moving .  there should have been an spr on duty at the front door  but instead the door was wide open .  kresh rushed inside .  the spr robots were there  but motionless  inert .  and if the security robots were out  he ran upstairs to the governor   s office  almost toppling over another security robot standing uselessly in front of the door  with a hole shot through its chest .  he slapped his palm on the security panel .  the damned thing was supposed to be keyed to his handprint  but was it .  he had never tried it .  the door slid open and he all but dove into the room  not daring to think what he would find .  but the lights were off .  he could not see a thing .  kresh pulled his blaster .  the lights switched themselves on as they sensed someone in the room .  and the room was empty .  no one was at the desk .  there were no papers spread out to be worked on .  kresh rushed back into the hall  heading for the governor   s bedroom  dodging past two more dead security robots on the way .  the bedroom door was wide open .  he went inside .  and stopped .  the governor was there .  sitting up in bed .  with a blaster hole the size of a man   s fist in his chest .      donald     arrived in the governor   s bedroom a few seconds after alvar kresh  and saw his master standing over the grisly tableaux .  but donald was barely aware of his master .  his attention was riveted on governor chanto grieg .  the dead man .  it was far from the first corpse donald had seen  and was the second one he had seen in as many hours  and yet the sight of the governor   s dead body had a more profound effect on him than any of the others .  donald had known this man .  worse  not more that eight hours ago  donald had told the governor that he would be safe  that the precautions alvar kresh had suggested would be enough to protect him .  he  donald  had threatened to prevent this man from attending the party  but had allowed it in the end because fifty spr security robots would be enough .  and now the man was dead .  dead .  dead .  donald   s vision began to dim .  the world was growing darker .     donald .  stop it .     alvar kresh   s voice seemed to come from a long way away  far off and unimportant .     come out of it .  i order you to stop it .  you had no part in grieg   s death .  you could have done nothing to stop it .  you did nothing to cause it .     perhaps no other voice could have brought donald back  but kresh   s voice  his master   s voice  strong  brimming with authority  did so .  his vision cleared and he came to himself with a start .     tha  tha  thank you  sir     he said .     this damn planet sets first law potential too damn high     kresh growled .     donald  listen to me .  there were fifty security robots on duty in this house  and grieg died anyway .  one more robot could not have done any good .      donald took hold of that thought  focused on it .  yes  yes  it was true .  what could he have done that they could not .  but why hadn   t the security robots prevented this disaster .  donald turned away  not wishing to look on the horrifying sight of the dead governor anymore .  and  in turning around  he got his answer .  there  lined up against the wall  still in their wall niches  were three of the sprs  the security  patrol  and rescue sapper security robots  each with a blaster shot through the chest .  that is what would have happened to me  donald thought .  had i remained  i would have been nothing more than another robot uselessly destroyed .  he found a strange sort of comfort in the idea .     sir     he said     if i could call your attention to this side of the room .        hmm .     kresh turned around and saw the three destroyed robots .     burning hells .  donald .  how fast would someone have to be to get into this room  blast three specialized security robots before any of them could react  and then kill a man who would appear to have been sitting up in bed .  kill him before he could even set his book down .        it would be impossible     donald said  feeling quite sure of himself .  he sensed  somehow  that he and sheriff kresh were  in a strange way  each doing the same thing  struggling to be professional  looking for the parts of this disaster they could deal with  putting up a wall against the parts that were unbearable .     sir  your point is well taken .  things cannot be as they seem .  but there are more urgent points to consider at the moment .  this is not mere murder  this is assassination .        you   re right  donald .  by all the devils in hell  you   re right .  this could just be the start of who knows what .      alvar kresh stood there  staring at nothing  clearly still more than a little bit in shock .     escape     he said at last .     we have to cut off their escape .  relay emergency orders  donald .  all  and i mean all  transport between the island of purgatory and the mainland is to be shut down  effective immediately .  all outbound sea and aircraft currently in transit are to return with all passengers on board .  no exceptions .  all spacecraft grounded .  no one leaves the island .  everyone who has left the island since the governor was last seen alive returns and stays here until they can be questioned .        sir  i must remind you that much of the transport on this island is under settler control  and thus not within your jurisdiction .         the hell with that     kresh said .     issue the orders .  the settlers had damned well not protest  unless they want this to get completely out of control .        yes  sir     donald said .  the sheriff had given him standing orders long ago  instructing donald to advise him whenever kresh issued orders that exceeded his authority .  donald of course followed the order  but there were occasions when he didn   t understand why kresh bothered to have himself told such things  kresh almost never reversed or revised an extralegal command .  but orders were orders  and so donald always reminded him  and the sheriff always overruled him .  donald activated his hyperwave system and began contacting the various traffic control centers on the emergency override bands  relaying the sheriff s instructions .  he could not help but notice that kresh had not ordered him to offer any explanation for his actions .  had that been deliberate .  after a moment   s hesitation  he decided not to bring the omission to kresh   s attention .  there might well be good reasons for keeping silent on the catastrophic news .  all sorts of chaos might spring up if news of the assassination spread too fast .  of course  all sorts of chaos were going to spring up in any event  but there was nothing donald could do about that .   think  man  think .  alvar kresh did not know what to do .  the clear  logical choice was to call someone  tell everyone .  the world had to know .  there was no hope of keeping this quiet more than an hour or two .  but someone had done this .  someone capable of an elaborate plot  capable of getting through the tightest security and acting with terrible ruthlessness .  someone with a reason .  someone with a motive .  someone who might well not be finished yet .  he had to assume that this was not an attack on the man  chanto grieg  but an attack on the governor  the leader of the planet .  he had to assume this was a coup .  but if that was so  who could he call .  not the rangers .  not when he was unsure why the devil justen devray had been acting so strangely  not when the rangers had been so determined  for no clear reason  to insert themselves into the security arrangements .  certainly he could not call the sss .  even if he trusted them  it would be politically impossible to bring them in as the lead agency to investigate the governor   s murder .  with a shock  he realized that he already suspected both of the other law enforcement agencies of complicity in this crime .  but he trusted his own people .  he had just been down here as window dressing  part of the governor   s entourage  but it was just about time for that to change .  yes .  that was it .  of course .  totally illegal  no doubt  and a flagrant violation of jurisdiction .  but the hell with that .     donald  contact our headquarters in hades .  i want a full operations team down here  on the spot  in control of this crime scene .  i want the first team here in three hours  and a full deployment of a major crime team in eight .        sir  the first team may not be able to arrive here that quickly .  the normal flying time from hades is just over two and one half hours .        i do not regard this as a normal circumstance     kresh said .     get them here  authorize use of emergency speed overrides  and don   t bother telling me what laws and agreements i   m violating .  by the time the rangers and the sss get to this crime scene  the sheriff of hades is going to own it  is that clear .        yes  sir .  might i ask how we are going to prevent them from corning here on their own .        we aren   t going to tell them what   s happened  that   s how .  not until my people and my robots are here  and we   ve started an investigation i can trust .  we can use the room where we met with tonya welton for our command post .      alvar kresh considered the risks he was running .  the decisions he had made already  in the last ninety seconds  might well be enough to force his resignation before very long .  maybe enough to get him arrested and thrown in jail .  but that didn   t matter .  if he could sit on this thing long enough  even just two or three hours  that would be enough to protect the investigation  get his deputies well enough entrenched and in charge so that the sss or the rangers would not be able to kick them out .   they solved the most minor part of the mystery first  a question so minor that it could barely be dignified by the name mystery .  still  it was nice to know how grieg had managed to answer the phone after he was dead  and the details of the answer might lead them somewhere .  kresh found a miniature settler made image box  a rather sophisticated one  hooked into the comm system .  it was sitting on a side table in the bedroom  plugged into the room   s comm jack .  the fact that it was settler made meant nothing  of course .  image processors and sim units were in common use for many legitimate purposes .  if anything  the use of a settler unit suggested a spacer involvement in the case  an attempt to throw off the scent .  actually  it was more likely the plotters had chosen that model because it was a cube about ten centimeters square  small enough to be easily smuggled into the residence .  kresh was tempted to examine the box himself  but he knew that was a job for the lab techs .  they might well be able to tell something from the way it was programmed  and they would be better able than he to overcome any booby trapping in the software .  he left it alone .  it occurred to him that it might even prove useful to leave it in place .  if anyone called  and it managed to fool them  that could be all to the good  if it kept the rangers and sss out of here a bit longer .  was he right to suspect them .  what was it that he suspected them of .  conspiracy to kill the governor .  it seemed outlandish  but the night had already been full of suspicious incidents .  it had to be that the staged attack on welton had something to do with it  that huthwitz had been killed as part of the same plot  but kresh could see no way to thread them all together .  and if not the sss or rangers  then who had done it .  kresh could come up with any number of suspects  starting with the ironheads  or some lunatic faction of ironheads  down to practically any fed up robot owner .  who knew who else   s toes the governor might have stepped on .  even if you kept to grieg   s known enemies  you still ended up with half the planet as suspects .  time .  it was turning into a question of time .  what could he do in the time left to them before the deputies arrived  or before the rangers or the sss or the governor   s first morning appointment arrived .  the victim .  take a good hard took at the victim .  kresh went over to the bed and knelt down next to the governor   s corpse  careful not to touch it or disturb anything .  no sense making the crime scene robots work harder .  grieg had been sitting up reading in bed  by the looks of it  and reading an old fashioned print book at that .  it had fallen forward into his lap  still open to the page he had been reading .  the tops of the pages had been singed by the blaster shot .  grieg was still sitting up  his head slumped forward  eyes shut  his hands fallen into his lap with the book on top of them .  there was no sign that he had reacted at all  or struggled to get out of the way .  he hadn   t tried to duck away from the blast or jump out of bed .  either he had been taken utterly by surprise  or he had known his attacker  perhaps even been expecting him  or her .  there was a thought  and one of some delicacy  to put it mildly .  had the governor arranged some sort of after hours assignation .  could he have been killed by an assassin posing as a lover  or could he have been killed by  say  lover a in a jealous rage over lover b .  kresh realized he knew less about the governor   s sex life than he should have .  that to one side  it would be wise to bear in mind there were other motives for murder besides political ones .  but there was another question  the security robots .  why had they failed .  how did the assassin overcome them .  for that matter  how the devil had the assassin gotten into the bedroom .  kresh stepped out into the dimly lit hallway and looked down it both ways .  where had the rest of the robots gone .  kresh walked back the way he had come  and soon had his answer .  there was a slumped over shape he had not paid much mind when he had first rushed down the hallway .  it was another spr security robot  this one blasted out as well .  except this one had not been killed with a single neat shot through the chest .  it had been scorched on the left arm  had its head half melted off  and then taken a final bum hole through the chest .  three shots at least  from increasingly close range .  it looked as if this robot had been on the move  trying to react  and had nearly reached its attacker before it finally went down .  kresh felt more certain than ever that there was something suspicious about the ease with which the robots in the bedroom had died .  he went farther down the hall and saw two more spr robots  both shot through the head and the chest .  the one in front of the entrance to grieg   s office had been shot the same way .  he stepped back into the bedroom where donald was waiting for him .     donald     he said     who manufactured these security robots .        the models used here are manufactured by rholand scientific      donald said      good      kresh said .     then fredda leving can examine them without a biased opinion .  hand me the voicephone and connect me .         sir  in terms of security  may i remind you that fredda leving was present last night and may well have had the opportunity to tamper with the robots         in terms of security we will be utterly paralyzed if we are too careful .  fredda leving was not part of this  i can tell you that straight out .         i agree that the balance of probabilities weighs heavily against suspecting her     donald said .     however  these robots have clearly been tampered with  and she was perhaps the only person who was present who had the expertise for that job .  my first law potential does extend to preventing you doing professional harm to yourself  and to the potential harm to others if an investigation this serious and dangerous were suborned .  i must therefore point out there is no logical basis upon which she can be excluded absolutely .     kresh took a deep breath and forced himself not to explode .  handling robots could be a damned nuisance  but it was only made doubly hard by losing one   s patience .  of course the same thing was true of people  you were forced to deal with unreasonable demands by being excessively reasonable .     donald     he said in a calm  slow voice .     i agree with you that there is no logical basis for excluding fredda leving as a suspect .  however  i can assure you that there are reasons  outside of logic  that make me utterly certain she had nothing to do with this .        sir  you have said yourself  many times  that any human being is capable of murder .        but i have also said that no one human is capable of every murder .  fredda leving might kill to defend herself  or in a fit of passion  but she is incapable of involving herself in this level of brutality .  nor is she much good as a conspirator  and this was clearly a conspiracy .  fredda leving was not capable of this killing  and she would have no motive for it .  indeed  i cannot think of anyone with a better motive for keeping the governor alive .  listen in and monitor her voice stress if you like  but give me the phone and make the connection .  that is a direct and absolute order .      donald hesitated a full half second before responding .  kresh thought he could almost see the first and second law potentials battling it out with each other .     yes  sir     he said at last  and handed over the phone .  it was a sign of just how rattled donald was that he would kick up such a fuss over such a minor point .  the sight of the governor   s corpse had upset man and robot .  both of them knew that was not merely a dead man  it was  in all probability  a whole planet suddenly thrown into peril .  with a beep and a click tone the phone line connected .     um  um  hello .     kresh recognized fredda   s voice  sleepy and a bit muddled .     dr .  leving  this is sheriff kresh .  i   m afraid i must ask you to return to the residence immediately  and to bring whatever technical equipment you have with you .  i need you to examine some  ah  damaged robots .      it was a clumsy way to put it  but kresh couldn   t think of anything else he could say on an unsecured line .     what .     fredda asked .     i   m sorry  what did you say .        damaged robots     kresh repeated .     i need you to perform a fast discreet examination .  it is a matter of some urgency .         well    all right  i suppose  if you say it   s urgent .  it will take me a while to get to the limbo depot robotics lab and collect some examination gear .  i didn   t bring anything with me .  i   ll get there as fast as i can .        thank you  doctor .      kresh handed the handset back to donald .     well .     he asked .     sir  i withdraw my objections .  you were indeed correct .  my voice stress monitoring indicated no undue reaction to a call from you from the residence at this hour .  either she has no idea whatsoever of what has happened  or she is a superb actress  an accomplishment of which i am unaware in dr .  leving .        once in a while  donald     kresh said     you might try taking my word on questions of human behavior .        sir  with all due respect  i have found no topic of importance wherein questions so utterly outnumber the answers .      kresh gave the robot a good hard look .  had donald just made a joke .   prospero  fredda told herself as she hurried to get ready .  it had to be something to do with prospero .  why else would kresh be there at this hour  and calling her in .  something must have gone wrong with prospero .  fredda leving had hand built the new law robot  and programmed his gravitonic brain herself .  she remembered how much of a pleasure it had been to work on the empty canvas of a gravitonic unit  with the chance to make bold strokes  work out whole new solutions  rather than being strait jacketed by the limitations and conventions and excessive safety features of the positronic brain .  ever since the long forgotten day when true robots had first been invented  every robot ever built had been given a positronic brain .  all the endless millions and billions of robots made in all those thousands of years had relied upon the same basic technology .  nothing else would ever do .  the positronic brain quite literally defined the robot .  no one would consider any mechanical being to be a robot unless it had a positronic brain  and  contrariwise  anything that contained a positronic brain was considered to be a robot .  the two were seen as inseparable .  robots were trusted because they had positronic brains  and positronic brains were trusted because they went into robots .  trust in robots and in positronic brains were articles of faith .  the three laws were at the base of that faith .  positronic brains  and thus robots built with such brains  had the three laws built into them .  more than built in  they had the laws woven into them .  microcopies of the laws were everywhere inside a positronic brain  strewn across every pathway  so that every action  every thought  every external event or internal calculation moved down pathways shaped and built by the laws .  every design formula for the positronic brain  every testing system  every manufacturing process  was built with the three laws in mind .  in short  the positronic brain was inseparable from the three laws  and therein lay the problem .  fredda leving had once calculated that thirty percent of the volume of the average positronic brain was given over to pathing linked to the three laws  with roughly a hundred million microcopies of the laws embedded in the structure of the average positronic brain  before any programming at all was done .  as roughly thirty percent of positronic programming was also given over to the three laws  the case could be made that every one of those hundred million microcopies was completely superfluous .  fredda   s rough estimate was that fifty percent of the average robot   s nonconscious and preconscious autonomous processing dealt with the laws and their application .  the needless  excessive  and redundant three law processing resulted in a positronic brain that was hopelessly cluttered up with nonproductive processing and a marked reduction of capacity .  it was  as fredda liked to put it  like a woman forced to interrupt her thoughts on the matter at hand a thousand times a second in order to see if the room were on fire .  the excessive caution did not enhance safety  but did produce drastically reduced efficiency .  but everything in the positronic brain was tied to the three laws .  remove or disable even one of those hundred million microcopies  and the brain would react .  disable more than a handful  and the brain would fail altogether .  try and produce positronic programming that did not include endless redundant checks for first  second  and third law adherence  and the hardwired  built in copies of the three laws would cause the positronic brain to refuse the programming and shut down .  unless you threw out millennia of development work and started from scratch with a lump of sponge palladium and a hand calculator  there was no way to step clear of the ancient technology and produce a more efficient robot brain .  then gubber anshaw invented the gravitonic brain .  it was light years ahead of the positronic in processing speed and capacity .  better still  it did not have the three laws burned into its every molecule  cluttering things up .  the three laws could be programmed into the gravitonic brain  as deeply as you liked  but with only a few hundred copies placed in the key processing nodes .  in theory  it was more liable to failure than the millions of copies in a standard positronic brain .  in practice  the difference between ten billion to one and ten trillion to one was meaningless .  gravitonic three law brains were  for all purposes  as safe as positronic ones .  but  because the three laws were not implicit in every aspect of the gravitonic brain   s design and construction  the other robotics laboratories had refused to deal with gubber anshaw or his work .  building a robot that did not have a positronic brain was about as socially acceptable as cannibalism  and no appeal to logic or common sense could make the slightest difference .  fredda leving  however  had been more than eager to experiment with the gravitonic brain  but not because she had any interest in improved efficiency .  long before gubber anshaw had come to her  she had been brooding over much deeper issues regarding the three laws  and the effects they had on human robot relations  and therefore on humans themselves .  fredda had concluded  among other things  that the three laws stole all human initiative and served to discourage risk to an unhealthy degree by treating the least of risks of minor injury exactly the same as an immediate danger to life and limb .  humans learned to fear all danger  and eschew all activity that had the slightest spice of hazard about it .  fredda had  therefore  formulated the four new laws of robotics  as a matter of mere theory  little realizing that gubber anshaw would come along and give her a chance to put it all into practice .  fredda had built the first new law robots .  tonya welton had gotten wind of the new law project  and insisted that new law robots be used on purgatory .  welton had liked the idea of robots that were neither slaves nor in control over their masters    lives .  and  perhaps  the fact that she was sleeping with gubber anshaw had something to do with it .  by the time tonya welton had her bright idea  fredda was already working on a new theory  precisely because the gravitonic brain made it possible to move past theory into practice .  because the gravitonic brain did not have a law structure embedded in itself  it was possible to program a brain  and thus create a robot  with no laws at all  a robot capable of creating its own rules for living .  caliban  the no law robot  had been the ultimate result of the experiment  and fredda had found herself in a world of trouble when caliban escaped .  but all that had been sorted out quite some time ago  thank goodness  with the result of fredda leving owing sheriff kresh at least a favor or two  to put it mildly .  but prospero .  she had hand built prospero  the most highly refined and sophisticated of all the new law robots  and constructed him to have the most flexible  far ranging mind that the gravitonic brain made possible .  she had not been out to do anything more than construct a robot that would be best able to think for itself .  she had not intended to manufacture a robot philosopher  but that was what she had done .  and some of what prospero had come up with in his philosophy had given fredda a major headache .  as prospero often pointed out  the new laws allowed a new law robot to be a far freer being than a conventional robot  but new law robots were far more aware of their servitude than normal robots .  clearly there were new balances to be struck  new ways of thinking about robots and for robots if new law robots were ever going to be able to deal with the real world .  prospero had set himself the goal of finding those new ways .  but if prospero   s expressed goal was to find the proper way for new law robots to deal with the world  what prospero excelled at was finding new ways around the new laws  finding ways to bend them and twist them to his own convenience .  bend them far enough that it might be quite understandable if kresh thought he was damaged .  as best fredda could see  prospero was clever enough to find ways to let the new laws let him do anything .  anything .  she grabbed her diagnostic kit and got moving .   the minutes and the hours had been dragging on  but now things started to move fast .  the first deputies  a fast response crime scene team  arrived from hades and set to work with admirable speed  considering the shock of seeing the governor with a hole in his chest .  all of them were a bit edgy and unsettled  and kresh could not blame them .  even the most stolid and unimaginative person could not help but realize just how dangerous this murder was  and kresh did not assign stolid or unimaginative people to the fast response teams .  it was strange  disconcerting  and even unseemly to see them ministering to the corpse of the man he had been speaking with only hours before .  there was a disturbing tenderness to the deputies and the crime scene robots as they hovered about  measuring  making images and scans  moving gently about the governor   s ruined body .  but this was no time for poetry .  this was the time for plots and counterplots  schemes and conspiracy .  kresh was already playing the game .  in the crudest and most basic way  he was just a minute fraction ahead .  he had gotten here first  turned this crime scene into kresh   s turf .  kresh had won the first tiny engagement of what was likely to be a long and costly battle .  arrival of the deputies pushed kresh off to one side  and that perhaps was no bad thing .  they needed time to find clues and evidence  but kresh needed to think about the other aspects of this case .  someone had killed the governor  and presumably had a reason for doing so .  several someones .  it was a conspiracy .  the diversionary attack on welton  the phony sss men  the murder of the ranger  the impossibility of getting past a whole squad of security robots  it all had to fit together  somehow .  but whose conspiracy  and why .  assume the killers had a motive .  what was it .  leaving the unreasoning reason of lunacy out of it for the moment  kresh could come up with any number of motives for killing chanto grieg  but very few of them coincided with the normal motives for murder .  this is not a murder  kresh told himself .  not in any normal sense of the word .  murder was about passion  or jealousy  or greed  or personal ambition .  it was a fatal assault on a person .  this was an assault on the state .  will it be fatal .  kresh asked himself .  there was a terrifying idea  and not at all an implausible one .  though weakened and maligned  grieg had been the glue that had held infernal politics together .  even if it was merely that everyone hated him  albeit for different reasons  at least he drew people   s emotions together .  and even if people had hated him  and differed about his motives  they could at least understand the rational basis for what he was doing .  people might be angry over the robot shortage  or get fed up with the settlers  but they could see the necessity of it all  even if they didn   t like it .  part of that grudging acceptance came from the knowledge that grieg was not a fanatic  not an ideologue  not someone chasing a harebrained theory  but a realist muddling through a bad situation as best he could .  would any of that be true for a new governor .  would the people take it on faith that a new governor would be struggling to do what was best .  who was going to be the new governor .  or  to cut away all the polite tiptoeing around the central issue  who had cleared the field in order to take over .  who was going to seize the governorship .  or was this merely and quite literally the opening gun in a new  forceful  and direct settler attempt to take over the planet .  was there a settler invasion fleet headed this way  right now .  not that it would take that much .  all the settlers had to do was step back and wait .  without settler help  inferno would collapse in a few years .  it was galling to admit that fact  but kresh had never been much for denying reality .  so why would the settlers bother to conspire and assassinate at all .  maybe it was one of the local movers and shakers  some bullyboy like simcor beddle eager to seize power .  would someone announce in a few hours that he or she had saved the planet from grieg   s maladministration .  had some maniac decided on a coup to save the spacer way of life  or had some cynical plotter realized that motive would provide a good cover story .  who was running this coup  anyway .   two thousand kilometers to the east of purgatory island  sergeant toth resato  of the governor   s rangers  stood in the darkness just before dawn  looking out over the great bay .  he was waiting .  watching .  he stood at the base of the low cliffs that formed the shore of the bay .  a cold wind blew at his back  gusting down through the east crack and the inlet that formed the mouth of the river lethe  a kilometer or two north of his position .  the surf was an endless roar of sound  and the sky was black and hard  with no sign yet of the coming day .  the stars were not so much shining as piercing the dark  so sharp and bright they seemed to cut into him .  far down and off in the western sky the lights of the limbo atmospheric force field generator gleamed and glistened  a bit of rippling green on the horizon  so dim they were hard to see  but even that little trace of warmth and color seemed quite out of place in such a time and place as this .  sergeant toth resato was uncomfortable .  he was out of uniform  for one thing  and  worse still  wearing settler style civilian clothes .  he felt like a damned fool in the gaudy things  but the boat for which he was waiting was not likely to come into shore if anyone aboard spotted a ranger   s uniform .  but there were lots of things about this assignment that toth liked less than the dress code .  he was sworn to uphold the law  and he would do his duty .  he was sworn to keep the peace  and he would do that too .  but what of those times when the law itself was what broke the peace .  what was he to do when the world turned upside down and a fellow could be arrested for what had been legal  even honorable  the day or the week before .  how could spacers  spacers  make it illegal to obtain a robot .  settlers were the ones who wanted to ban robots .  it didn   t make sense to him .  and yet  here he was  freezing to death in the darkness  lying in wait because he had gotten a tip that a smuggler was making a run tonight  bringing in contraband new law robots  rustbacks .  that was the part toth just could not get through his head .  how could having a robot be a crime .  it just didn   t make sense .  it was as if breathing or eating had been declared illegal .  toth tended to exaggerate  even to himself .  it wasn   t  he admitted to himself  exactly illegal to own a robot  but it was getting close to that point .  it didn   t help matters that he had never done a rustbacking arrest before  or even dealt with new law robots .  he did not feel confident  or ready  for the task ahead .  in theory  any private robots taken for use in the terraforming project remained the property of the original owner .  however  ownership didn   t count for much when your former valet was suddenly fifteen thousand kilometers away on the other side of the planet  operating a prairie breeding center .  people were not happy .  and they wanted robots .  there was more about economics and shortages and so forth that was supposed to explain it all  but it didn   t seem to make a great deal of sense to toth .  after all  if there were a shortage of something  why not just make more of it .  and how could there be a shortage of robots in the first place .  why not just build more .  the government had all sorts of complicated explanations  all about scarcity of resources and investing productive capacity in the planet   s future  but no one could understand the numbers .  the people were being asked to take it on faith that they had to make sacrifices in the name of a better future  but a lot of people did not have much faith .  all they knew  and all they cared about  was that there were not enough robots  and everyday life on inferno had been thrown into turmoil .  even if  as everyone kept saying  there were a hundred times more robots than people on the planet  there were still too few robots .  the whole rustback phenomenon  the enormous criminal enterprise that went with them  was merely an expression of the fact that people wanted robots  and were willing to do anything  even commit crimes  in order to get them .  the detector at his belt beeped .  toth resato looked down at the display screen and then lifted his night vision farviewers to his eyes .  yes  there they were .  out on the sea  in an open boat  headed this way .  there would be a larger craft out there somewhere  the rest of the cargo of rustbacks aboard it  waiting for the human pilot to shuttle them into shore .  rustbacks .  outlaw new law robots  escaping from purgatory  heading off into the wilderness of terra grande to what the settler economists called    indentured servitude .      they would work off the price of what it cost to smuggle them out of purgatory  then work for a wage if and when they paid the debt .  or  that is  they would have done all that if toth had not been waiting for them .  toth had sat through the training sessions that were supposed to explain the basis of economic crime  so that the rangers would be able to deal with it better .  he had dozed through most of them  but he remembered the settler economists and how they had blathered on about supply and demand  how no spacer world had experienced a labor shortage in thousands of years .  how unlimited free labor had in turn eroded the value of raw materials down to nothing .  the lecturers had said something about the law of supply and demand .  and how with supply of everything essentially infinite  demand  and price  had dropped to zero .  robots completely overturned any concept of a market economy .  the use  and even the concept  of money had evaporated away almost entirely .  but now  suddenly  the robots weren   t there to do things and make things for free .  now there was a shortage of labor  and therefore labor  and materials obtained by labor  had a meaningful value .  for the first time in living memory  everything had a price .  the catch was none of the incredibly wealthy spacers had any money  only possessions .  they were more or less forced to trade what they owned to get the products or services that had been essentially free .  inferno had dropped back into a semibarter economy .  toth had followed most of the lecture  if not all  but it was clear to him the people lecturing him were missing the point .  the economists seemed fascinated by their charts and graphs and markets  but they never seemed to understand that people  real people  were hurting .  the capital city of hades had seemed deserted  dingy  the last time toth had been there for a visit .  nothing seemed bright or alive there .  a fine layer of dust had settled on everything  blown from the deserts .  without the hordes of cleaning robots bustling about downtown  everything had seemed a little worn  a little threadbare and sad .  as if the buildings and streets knew that the desert sands were edging just a trifle closer to town .  with the robots gone  the city  its human population intact  seemed almost a ghost town .  that irony was not lost even on toth  and toth knew there was not much of the poet in his soul .  what could you say about a city that seemed halfdead because the machines had left and the people had stayed .  and the people were desperate .  there were plenty of sharp operators ready  willing  and able to take advantage of that desperation .  the settler traders were bad enough  buying up works of art and family heirlooms for a pittance in settler credits  but at least those were legal transactions .  the rustback trade was not .  the whole rustback industry had sprung up as if by magic the moment the governor made his pronouncement impressing    surplus    robots into the terraforming service .  it had grown since  in size and sophistication  until now it was a huge and sophisticated enterprise .  there were the restrictor strip shops on purgatory  where  for a fee  a pull artist would remove the range restrictors from a new law robot .  there were the brokers  charging horrifying amounts of money or making ruinous barters to the spacers who needed robots  any robots .  there were the smugglers ready to get a boatful of n .  l .  robots off purgatory  or else fly an aircar full of them  risking detection by the traffic control nets .  and then there were the new law robots themselves .  they were the real mystery .  the humans toth could understand .  after all  they were not much different from other criminals willing to risk harsh punishment for the sake of massive profit .  but the new law robots were a mystery to him .  were new law robots really robots in the first place .  they only had half a first law  after all .  they were enjoined from harming a human being  but they could  if they chose  stand by and let a human being be killed .  one of the primordial protections of spacer existence was no longer there .  how could anyone feel safe around them .  new law robots were not required to obey the orders of a human  either .  they were required to    cooperate    with humans .  no one seemed to be quite sure what    cooperate    meant to a robot .  and what if there were two groups of humans with different ideas .  with which would a new law robot    cooperate    .  cooperating meant running away  at least to some n .  l .  s  and toth could not understand why .  a rustback had to work just as hard  if not harder  than a new law that stayed where it belonged .  some of the new law robots talked about having at least the hope of being free someday  but what could freedom mean to a robot .  and yet  he was here waiting on another boatload of new law robots  risking their very existence in hope of freedom .  and they were heading his way right now .  a boatload of runaway robots .  runaway robots .  it was almost a contradiction in terms .  toth watched in the farviewers as they got closer .  he saw the signal light blink from the bow of the boat .  three long blinks  then three shorts .  toth just happened to know that the man on the boat was named norlan fiyle  and that fiyle was expecting a rather hard edged woman named floria wentle to signal back .  toth had recently made wentle   s acquaintance  and provided her with a rather more permanent accommodation than she might have preferred .  it had taken merely the slightest mention of the psychic probe to make her reveal all concerning fiyle and his plans for the shipment tonight .  it seemed there wasn   t much to the idea of honor among thieves .  toth lifted his own signal light and signaled back  two longs  three shorts  four longs .  he watched for a moment and got the proper signal in reply  three more longs and three more shorts .  toth glanced to his left and then to his right  needlessly and pointlessly checking to make sure his robots were in position .  needless because he knew they were there  and pointless because they were all very well hidden indeed .  the boat was close enough now that there was no need for the farviewers .  toth felt his heart starting to race .  here they came .  now he could hear the high pitched humming of the engine over the roar of the surf .  he could see the robots sitting  stockstill  in their seats  and one human figure  fiyle  it had to be fiyle  standing at the stern  operating the controls .  act like his friend  toth told himself .  act like you   re the one he   s supposed to meet .  toth raised his arm and waved .  toth knew damned well he was silhouetted against the night sky  and that fiyle had to be using night vision gear at least as good as his own  and  no doubt  had a blaster more powerful than the ranger issue model toth had .  toth walked toward the point on the shore the boat was making for  trying to move casually  calmly  in his damn fool civilian clothes  as if everything were normal and fine .  at least the civvies were bulky enough that it was hard to get an idea of body shape from them .  with luck  and in the dark  fiyle would not notice that toth was not a woman .  one half of a pair of handcuffs was already locked on to toth   s wrist  likewise hidden by the bulky clothes .  the empty cuff would be around fiyle   s wrist in short order .  toth paused  looking for a way down to the rocky shore at the base of the low cliffs .  he knelt  turned around so he was facing the cliff  and started to climb down  painfully aware that he had just put his back to fiyle .  he forced himself not to think about it  and concentrated on finding handholds .  it wasn   t much of a climb down to the shoreline .  toth was glad to reach the bottom and turn around .  there was the boat  only a hundred meters away  just about to beach itself on a small patch of sandy shoreline .  toth could see fiyle in the stern  see that he was watching the shore  not toth .  even with a night vision helmet covering half of his face  it was easy to see his anxious expression as he struggled to guide the little craft through the surging waves  thread it around rocks and ledges .  closer  closer .  at last  with a final burst of power from the engine  fiyle gunned the boat forward on the crest of an incoming wave  surfing the boat to land gently on the shore  not twenty meters from where toth stood .  it was immediately obvious that the robots in the bow of the boat had been well briefed on what to do upon landing .  three of them jumped out and held the bow .  another then jumped ashore  the end of a rope in its hand .  it headed up to the base of the cliff  snubbed the rope around an outcropping of rock  and tied it off .  then the rest of the robots started to disembark in orderly fashion .  fiyle shut down his engine  peeled off his night vision helmet  and rubbed his face with both hands .  he stretched his arms and flexed his back  working out the kinks .  then  with one graceful motion  he set one hand on the gunwale and jumped over the side of the boat .  he landed feetfirst in the surf  showing a sailor   s lack of concern for getting his feet wet .  toth smiled at him  stepped toward him  and offered the man his hand as fiyle sloshed through the surf toward dry land .  it was not until fiyle was within less than a meter of toth that the rustbacker realized something was wrong .  toth stepped forward into the cold surf  took him by the hand  and had the cuff on him before he could react .  fiyle cried out and yanked his arm back  pulling toth forward  slamming into him .  both of them toppled over into the water  but fiyle managed to heave himself over on top of toth .  the rustbacker grabbed the ranger by the throat and shoved his head down into the frigid water .  toth opened his eyes underwater  but the dark night and the cloudy seawater rendered him as good as blind .  he struggled  clawing at the man   s face with his free right hand .  he pulled back on his left hand  with the cuff on it  trying to dislodge fiyle   s grip on his throat .  toth tried desperately to lever himself up far enough to get his face above water  to reach the air .  he made a fist of his free hand and tried to punch fiyle in the side of the head .  he missed completely and landed a glancing blow on his shoulder .  he pulled back his arm to try again .  but then  suddenly  it didn   t matter .  fiyle wasn   t on him anymore  and strong arms were fishing him out of the water .  toth coughed and spluttered as the robot  his robot  a gerald  a grd unit  one of his arrest team  carried him to shore .  the grd cradled toth like a baby  toth   s arm with the cuff on it dangling out in midair  still connected to fiyle .  another grd was carrying fiyle  holding him in a tight restraint position .     let me down .     fiyle bellowed .     i order you to let me down .     the robot was unmoved .     i regret  sir  that both first law and preexisting orders prevent me from doing so .  please do not attempt to escape  as that might entail injury to yourself or ranger toth .     toth had to smile to himself  in spite of the beating he had taken .  say what you might about three law robots .  you couldn   t fault them for being impolite .   toth had learned a thing or two about settlers  or at least the sort of settler who got picked up by the cops .  it seemed to toth that they broke into two groups .  on the one hand there was the snarling sort  who denied everything  accused the arresting officer of planting evidence  who threatened and sniveled and sneered .  on the other hand  there were some who seemed to regard it all as something of a game  complete with winners and losers .  once he was safely back in toth   s mobile ranger station  locked into its archaic looking barred cell  where it was plain to see he was caught and there was nothing he could do about it  norlan fiyle immediately demonstrated that he was a member of the second category .  by the time the grd robots handed fiyle dry clothes through the bars of the cell  all the aggression seemed to have drained out of the man .  he was big and burly  in the vigorous health of an active man in his middle years .  he was a roundfaced  dark skinned man  with a thin fringe of snow white hair .  he seemed quite unconcerned by the fact that he was under arrest  or that a trio of rather intimidating grd robots were standing outside the cell  watching his every move .  fiyle sat down on the cell   s narrow cot and pulled on the dry prison issue clothes .     so     he asked     how did you nail me .     toth was not in a good mood .  his head hurt  and he was fairly certain that he was going to have a black eye and a stiff back in the morning .     let   s just say you trusted the wrong people     he said  not wanting to give too much away .  he sat down at his desk chair  facing the prisoner  and made a show of doing some work .  not that he was in any shape to make a coherent report .     that so .     fiyle asked .     i should have known better than to count on floria wentle     he said in a calm  conversational tone as he pulled on a pair of prison slippers .     hmmph .  not a bad fit     he said  standing and taking a step or two .     glad you like them     toth said  a little annoyed that fiyle had guessed it in one try .     but i didn   t say who it was who gave you away .     fiyle looked up at him and smiled .     oh  it had to be floria .  she talked just a little bit too good a game .  i should have known she was the kind to get caught .  by the way  can you tell me what happened to my new laws .  any of them manage to get away .        about half of the ones in the boat escaped      toth said .     my robots caught the rest on the beach .  we   ll pick up the ones waiting on the ship in the morning .        don   t count on that     fiyle said .     those robots are no fools .  once i don   t make it back to the ship for the second load  they   ll all hightail it .  they   ll take over the ship and try for a landing someplace else .         think so .     toth said  a trifle defiantly .  if fiyle knew so much  then how had he gotten caught .     they   re just robots .  they   ll be sitting out there when we go to get    em .        if you want to bet on that  you   re on     fiyle said .     they   re new law robots .  one of them   s got more initiative than a whole herd of those three law jobs  and believe me  this crowd knows they have a real incentive for getting away .  you know what happens to new law robots caught trying to escape .     toth shrugged .     not really .      fiyle gave him an odd look .     for a cop  you don   t have much curiosity .  n .  l .  s caught trying to escape are destroyed .  a blaster shot to the head .  once they start running  they damned well know they don   t dare stop .  no way back .        but they wouldn   t know how to run your ship     toth objected .     they   re smart  and they   d sure as hell have the incentive to learn     fiyle said .     if they decide they can   t handle it  they might even just jump overboard  let themselves sink  and walk to shore on the bottom .  i doubt it  though .  they weren   t made waterproof  on purpose  to keep    em on purgatory .  besides  even a robot would get disoriented underwater around here .  bad visibility  strong currents  uneven seafloor .  but they   re your problem now .      fiyle leaned back on the cot and grinned .     that   s something  anyway     he said .      at least now i won   t have a shipload of new law know it alls driving me crazy .  now you have to deal with them .  but i am glad at least some of them got away .        why should you care .     toth asked .  somehow  he was the one ill at ease .  fiyle wasn   t acting like a man caught in the act and looking at a world of trouble .     oh  don   t get me wrong .  i   m in this for the money .  but i still like seeing someone getting away once in a while .  even if it is just a bunch of robots .      fiyle grinned at toth and winked  just to lay the sarcasm on a bit thicker .     i think that   s just about enough lip out of you  settler     toth said .     and why is that enough .     fiyle asked  losing nothing of his easy manner .     take a look around yourself .  you   re in a spacer jail and i   ve got you dead to rights on a very serious charge .        true enough     fiyle said .     or at least true as far as it goes .  because you   re just about to trade up  ranger resato .        trade up to what .        no  no  trade up for what .  we talk about that first .  we talk about the deal first .  i   m going to give you a name  a name that you are going to love to have  and hate to have .  and you are going to give me a ticket home  off this spacer rathole and back to a decent life .      toth looked carefully at his prisoner .  the man was serious  and somehow he knew that fiyle was not the sort of man who made an offer he could not back up .     it   s got to be a hell of a big name to rate that kind of deal     toth said .     someone higher up .        higher up  yes .  but that   s not why you   ll want to know who it is .  this name belongs to you .  and it belongs to someone way deep into    backing .     suddenly toth felt a little unsteady .  he understood .  a ranger .  a ranger involved in rustbacking .  he pressed a button on his desk .     gerald four     he said .  a somewhat mechanical voice answered  corning from the comm panel .     yes  sir .        bring me two blank witness boxes .         one moment .     there was silence in the room  and toth found himself staring straight into fiyle   s eyes .  all the bantering humor had drained out of the settler  and now toth could see the tenseness  the intensity that the surface jocularity had hidden .  gerald four stepped into the room  carrying two small sealed containers .  toth took the boxes from the robot  undid the seals  and opened them up .  inside each container was a small black cube  about three centimeters on a side .  each had a single button on it .  press the button and the box would record for one hour  with no way to stop it or rewind it or erase the recording .  whenever the button was pressed thereafter  the recording would play back  with no way to stop it or modify it .  toth took the boxes from their containers .  he held one of the witness boxes in his hand  looked at them for a moment  and then set both of them down on his desk .  he pressed the buttons and looked back at fiyle .     this is ranger toth resato     he said .     the settler norlan fiyle is my prisoner  arrested this night in connection with various charges of rustbacking .  he has offered to provide the name of a governor   s ranger substantially involved in the rustbacking trade  in exchange for the dropping of all charges against him and transport to his home planet .  i hereby agree to this bargain  contingent on confirmation of his information .      toth handed the witness boxes to the robot .     give them to him     he said .  gerald four carried the boxes to the cell and handed them through the bars .     you keep one cube  and i get the other back     toth said .     we each get a guarantee .  now talk .     fiyle held one cube in each hand and looked up toward toth .  the settler swallowed hard  and toth could see a sheen of sweat that had suddenly appeared on the man   s brow .  the games were over now .  this was for real      there is a ranger      he said .      a ranger that   s doing a lot of looking the wrong way when the rustbackers are working .  he tips the    backers off whenever there   s a raid .     moving carefully  fiyle set the witness boxes down on the table inside his cell .  he walked around the table and sat down on his cot  facing toth .     there is a ranger     he said again   and his name is sergeant emoch huthwitz .          cold .  cold .  cold .  ottley bissal struggled to keep the aircar flying but he could not stop shaking .  he was chilled to the bone  drenched by the pouring rain  but there was more to it than that .  fear  terror  reaction  whatever the demons might be called  they were with him  inside him  freezing his blood  making his teeth chatter .  keep steady  he told himself .  concentrate .  focus on your flying .  he was well inside the limbo city traffic pattern now .  by now he should be safe  but bissal had never been the best of pilots  and he had just been through flying conditions to challenge the most skillful of fliers .  he was spent  exhausted .  huthwitz .  huthwitz had been a mistake .  they had found the body  and he had had far too close a call .  at least now the worst was over  but there had been plenty of worst .  the nightmare of mistakes and improvisation at the residence  the close call in evading the police  the long walk through the drenching rain to the hidden aircar  the struggle to find it and get it open  the flight back to the city at low  detection dodging altitudes  there was none of it he would ever want to go through again .  but he had made it now .  all he had to do was ditch the car and get to the safehouse .  no problem .  it was over .  everything was going to be all right .  but he still could not stop shaking .       fredda leving came in out of the rain and stepped into the grand hall of the governor   s residence .  alvar kresh was there to meet her  donald at his side .  fredda took one look at the sheriff and knew  knew that it had nothing to do with prospero .  there was nothing angry  or accusatory  in his expression .  it was nothing to do with her  and yet she instantly found herself wishing that it were .  for there was a great deal more to read in kresh   s expression .  something much  much worse than robotic misbehavior .     grieg is dead     kresh said .     a blaster shot through the chest .     fredda blinked  shook her head  stared at kresh .     what .        dead .  murdered .  assassinated     kresh said .  fredda could find nothing to say .  she wanted to deny it  to say no  it couldn   t have happened  but one look at kresh   s face told her that it had .  finally words  some sort of words  came to her .     sweet burning hell .  how could that happen .        i don   t know     kresh replied  his voice flat and hard .     come in .      he turned and led her down the hallway to a small room that had been pressed into service as a command post .  the place was swarming with robots and sheriff s department deputies  working  conferring  talking into comm units  faces tight and grim .     sit down     kresh said  and fredda obeyed  setting herself down in an absurdly festive looking couch with an overdone floral pattern .  somehow everything seemed extra real  excessively solid  every meaningless detail suddenly vitally bright and hard .  sitting there  at that moment  fredda knew that every moment of this night would be with her forever  burned into her memory and her soul for all time .     how did it  did it         we don   t know     kresh said .     but i need you to help me find out  and i have very little time .  grieg   s security robots should have protected him  but they didn   t .  i need to know if someone tampered with them .  you have to find that out for me  now  tonight .  but         but what .     fredda demanded .  and yet  somehow  she already knew the answer .     but we haven   t been able to move him yet     kresh said .     my robots and technical people are still examining the crime scene .  it   s not pretty .     fredda nodded  feeling nothing more than numb .     no     she said .     no  i don   t expect it would be .      fredda had never seen a dead man before  let alone a murdered one .  that much she had in common with mainstream spacer society .  death was too distasteful to be permitted to intrude on one   s life .  but even if she had seen a roomful of corpses  it would not have prepared her for the sight of chanto grieg slumped over  murdered in his bed .  his body  his ruined corpse  was all the more ghastly a sight for the sheer normalcy of it all .  a tired man at the end of a long party goes to his rest  sits up in bed to read for a time before turning out the lights .  and someone puts a blaster bolt through him .  there he lay  in his pajamas  in his bed .  a private  almost intimate setting .  she felt like an intruder  an interloper .  she did not belong here .  she had no right to see this .  no one did .  she felt a strange impulse to chase them all out  the deputies  the crime scene robots  kresh and donald .  she wanted to chase them all out  leave herself  and let the man have his death in private .     let him rest in peace     she said  the words a half whisper .     i beg your pardon  dr .  leving .     donald asked .     what did you say .        peace     she said .     why can   t you let him rest in peace .     she shut her eyes  tried to blot out the sight .  she wanted to turn her back on him  let him be  but she could not help herself .  she opened her eyes and looked again .  chanto grieg was  had been  her friend  her sponsor  her patron .  but all that was as nothing .  what matter who or what this man was to her when the time and manner of his death was a catastrophe for the planet .  this was history  a moment she would be called upon to remember for the researchers and the archivists for the rest of her life .  she would be remembered for being here  tonight .  and chanto grieg would be remembered  not as the man who saved inferno  or at least tried to save it  he would be remembered as the governor somebody killed .  his place  his rightful place  in history had been warped and distorted for all time .  and that felt like the worst intrusion of all      all right     fredda said  though nothing at all was right .     all right .  let me look at the robots .         over here  doctor     donald said .  there was something gentle  careful about his voice .  fredda felt the slightest of pressure on her arm as he turned her around and she saw the ruined security robots  still in their wall niches .  she saw instantly what had bothered kresh .  none of them had moved before they were shot .     that can   t be     she said .     no one should have been able to get past one spr  let alone three .  sappers are too fast .         that   s what i thought     kresh said .     and it   s worse than that .  every single one of the upper floor sprs was destroyed by blaster fire .         but the whole idea of sappers is that they keep in continuous contact with each other     fredda said .     almost like a linked mind .  if one of them saw something  all of the others would know about it .  there   s no way anyone could have shot one unit in an spr team without the other sprs being instantly aware of it  and calling for help .  so why didn   t that happen .     kresh gestured toward the blasted robots .     there they are  doctor .  you tell me .        is it all right for me touch them .     fredda asked .     what about fingerprints and so on .        the crime scene robots have already done a full exterior scan      donald replied .     i think if you wear surgical gloves  and have a crime scene robot do an interior scan of any compartments you open  that should suffice .  you are quite right to be concerned about fingerprints .  with a bit of luck  whoever tampered with the machines left a fingerprint or two somewhere on one of the robots    interior surfaces .         good .  good     fredda said  a bit distractedly .  she wasn   t really listening all that hard .  there was a puzzle for her to solve  and it was already absorbing her attention .  which was fine with her if it got her mind off the dead man in bed on the other side of the room .     then let   s get to it .     fredda made no move toward the robots .  something was missing  something she wasn   t seeing .  and then she got it .  the robots had been shot through the chest  the same as grieg .  even to fredda   s unpracticed eye  they were obviously aimed shots  precise enough so that it could not be mere chance the robots were all shot in the same place .  but chest shots didn   t make sense .  the best way  the only sure way to kill a robot  was with a shot to the head  where you would be certain to destroy the positronic brain .  there was no particular reason why a shot to the chest would kill .  there were no equivalent structures to the heart or lungs whose destruction would insure instant death .  if you did enough damage  cut enough circuits  yes  that would do it .  but you could not be absolutely sure to the degree you wanted to be with a trio of fast moving  aggressive security robots corning at you .  unless  of course  you knew everything there was to know about this particular model of security robot  knew exactly how powerful a blaster shot it would take for a chest shot to kill  and if you knew they were not about to come at you .  well  all right  that would at least explain why the shooter didn   t need a head shot .  but that didn   t explain why the shooter did need a chest shot .  unless  unless there were something in the chest the killer wanted to conceal .  and if that were so  vaporizing that something would certainly serve to hide it .  there was a way to test that idea .     i don   t need to examine these robots just now     fredda said .     maybe later .  first i want to see one of the other sappers that was shot .         of course  doctor     donald said .     come this way .     donald led kresh and fredda out into the hallway and toward a slumped over heap on the floor .  fredda knelt down beside it and looked it over .     this one at least looks like it was in motion  heading toward the scene  when it went down     kresh said .     no     fredda said .     i don   t know much about blasters  but i do know how paint reacts to heat on robot bodies .  welding  laser cutting  that sort of thing .  maybe you were meant to think this robot was moving when it was shot  but it was as inert as the others when the blaster got it .         how can you be so sure .     kresh asked .  fredda pointed to the blaster shots .     look at the chest shot .  virtually identical to the shots on the bedroom robots .  that was the one that killed it .         so .     kresh said .     so look at the paint melts .  the melts from the two smaller shots overlap the death shot .  the killer blasted the robot in the chest from close up  then he or she got artistic .  either the robot fell over or the killer knocked it over and then backed off to do the other shots from a greater distance after the robot was already down .        you   re right     kresh said .     i should have spotted that .         well  your weapons analysis people would have seen it sooner or later .  i only saw it because i was looking for it .        looking for it .     kresh asked .     why .        because these robots were not shot because the killer needed them dead     fredda said .     they were shot because that was the fastest way to destroy the evidence of tampering .  my guess is that there was some sort of gadget attached to the circuitry in the center of the chest  right under the central access panel .      fredda realized she was still staring down at the dead robot .  a shot just like the one that killed the other robots .  just like the one that killed grieg .  grieg dead .  sweet stars in the sky  chanto grieg was dead .  she shut her eyes  took a deep breath  and tried to pull herself together .  this was not the time to grieve .  not when the whole planet was about to fall apart .     sir  doctor  if i might interject .        yes  yes  donald     fredda said  collecting herself .     what  what is it .        the crime scene robots have just posted some initial results to the hyperwave datanet .  it concerns weapons analysis that might have some bearing on all this .        what sort of results .     kresh asked .     range  power  and sequence estimates  sir .         what are those .     fredda asked .     ways of determining various characteristics of the weapon that fired a given sequence of shots     donald said .     the energy front of a blaster shot widens out as it moves forward .  measuring the radius of the blaster wound or mark gives an indication of range .  by combining measures of the intensity of the wound or mark with the range estimate  we can derive the power of the blaster during each shot .  as blasters drain their power somewhat with each shot  the first shot tends to be the most powerful  with each subsequent shot less and less powerful .        it doesn   t always work  though     kresh said .     with a high capacity power supply  the power fall off from one shot to the next can be undetectable .        in the present case  sir  we are more fortunate .  preliminary analysis shows a pronounced power fall off with every shot .         all right  donald     kresh said  a note of weary patience in his voice .     what   s the punchline .        the shot that killed governor grieg was indeed the first one fired .         i   ll be damned     kresh said .     score one for you  dr .  leving .  if he was shot first  then the robots had to be shut down already .  no reason to shoot them unless there was something that needed hiding .  except most of the robots downstairs weren   t shot .  why not .        maybe if i take a look at some of them  i can find out what the  the assassins were trying to hide     fredda said .  she had an idea or two already  but she was not ready to say anything yet .  not until she had something more than a theory .     i   ll leave you to that     kresh said .     there are certainly plenty of spr robots for you to examine .  i do appreciate your help .  you   ve already done me a larger service than you know .  however  there is another duty i must perform in the meantime .  donald  you   re with me .        yes  sir .      the short blue robot made a slight bow toward fredda .     dr .  leving  it is good to be working with you again  albeit under such grim and unpleasant circumstances .        thank you  donald      fredda said .  the robot and the policeman headed down the stairs toward their improvised command center .  fredda stood up and looked down at the ruined robot .  what a waste  she thought .  what a miserable  useless waste .   alvar kresh knew the evil moment could not be put off any longer .  it was time to put in a call to justen devray of the governor   s rangers .  two hours had passed since kresh had discovered the body .  the one bright spot was that  having thought about it  he could see no jurisdictional reason to call cinta melloy or the sss at all .  so far  at least  this was strictly an infernal affair .  no doubt sooner or later the sss would get mixed up in it as well .  major investigations had a way of spreading out .  but at least he did not have to deal with them now .  as little as he trusted the rangers at the moment  he trusted the sss even less .  kresh sat down at the portable comm station his team had set up and punched the call to devray .   fredda leving stood in front of sapper    .  the robot was still standing  even though its power had been cut .  it  along with most of its fellows on the ground floor and a few on the upper floor  had simply stopped dead  instead of being shot with a blaster .  why .  it was an inert lump of metal  literally dead on its feet .  fredda pushed down on the release stud  and there was a click from inside the robot   s chest .  now she could open the panel .  fredda  feeling awkward in her surgical gloves  and distracted by the crime scene observer robot hovering over her shoulder  pressed down on the lower exterior stud that would pop open the front access panel  now that it was unlatched .  sapper    stared down at her  unseeing  unnerving her .  most robots had power down controls in the back  with a simple access cover anyone could open .  but that  clearly  would never do for a security robot .  you had to be right in front of a sapper  watching it watching you  and you had to open a panel it controlled before you could shut it off .  except this robot was already off  and that was not supposed to happen .  the access plate swung open and fredda stepped back  allowing the tiny crime scene observer robot to hover in and do a full surface scan of the interior before she touched anything .  the cso flitted down until it was directly in front of the access panel .  it extruded a tiny probe and directed it over every surface of the panel   s interior .  the probe moved rapidly  fussily over the interior .  at last it beeped to indicate it had done the scan and then backed off .  something about its motions reminded fredda of the hummingbirds that the settlers had just introduced onto purgatory .  fredda   s tool kit was open on the table next to her .  she pulled out a clip light and a defastening tool .  she attached the light to the lip of the power access panel and then used the defastener to pop open the maintenance panel inside .  she lifted out the panel and set it down on the table  then stepped back to let the cso robot do its job .  the maintenance chamber   s interior was far more complex than the switch chamber  and it took fredda a moment to find what she was looking for .  or  more accurately  to confirm that what she was looking for was not there .  but it had most decidedly left its mark .  she smiled and stepped back from the sapper .     get me a magnified scan of the entire exposed surface in there .  maximum definition .      the tiny robot moved in and set to work  and fredda watched .  it was a good first step .  there were all the other robots to check  of course  and she would have to be careful  thorough .  but she felt a bit of excitement  of pleasure  all the same .  she was starting to see how they did it  whoever they were .  but that sensation of pleasure did not last long .  because then she remembered what they had done .  justen devray was at his desk  working on the huthwitz case  when the call came .     damnation  kresh  why the devil did you wait two hours to tell me .     justen devray was angry  and felt he had the right to be .  he glared at the comm screen  feeling dead tired  horrified  and angry all at once .  but not surprised .  somehow  he did not feel the least bit surprised .     i had my reasons  commander .  not the most pleasant reasons  but reasons  and i would prefer not to discuss them over a hyperwave line  even one that is supposed to be secure .        very well     devray said .     i will be at the residence in twenty minutes .  have you informed the sss yet  or did you call me before cinta melloy .     kresh   s image in the viewtank shifted a bit  and the man looked uncomfortable .     i was not proposing to inform the sss at all at this point .  they will find out soon enough .         the hell you say .  kresh  have you taken leave of your senses .  this is not some drunk who   s been rolled in an alley .  it   s the assassination of the governor .  you have to call in every law enforcement service available .         i agree  commander .  however  i am not certain whether it is wise to consider the sss to be a law enforcement service so far as this case is concerned .        what the hell are you saying .     devray demanded .     i   m saying i don   t know whose security the settler security service is interested in .  it is possible that it is not ours .  please get here as soon as you can .      kresh cut the connection before devray could say anything more  but devray realized he had very little to say in any event .  kresh had all but come out and said he suspected the sss of complicity in grieg   s death .  and  try as he might  devray had to accept that it was possible .  but there was something far worse than that .  the only reason devray could see for kresh to delay notifying the rangers was that he suspected them as well .  and while it pained devray to the depths of his soul to admit it  he knew damned well that was possible as well .  he thought of emoch huthwitz  dead in the rain  and of all the things devray had learned about huthwitz in the last few hours .  he got moving .   the rain was letting up  and the sun was showing signs of rising in the east as fredda leving popped open the interior maintenance chamber on yet another spr robot .  fredda was vaguely aware that the world outside the windows was getting lighter  but she was too tired for more than that .  she had lost track of the number of robots she had examined  but that didn   t matter .  she could do a count later .  right now her job was to be thorough  to check every single spr .  at least she was getting faster at the job .  if not for the need to do the interior scans searching for evidence  she could have been in and out of a given robot in twenty seconds .  that in itself was an important piece of information .  but it was not enough .  so far  she had only found minute traces  all but undetectable signs of what she was looking for .  she could see the tiny scratches left behind when some sort of device had been removed from the robots  two tiny marks in the main power bus .  fredda was all but certain that those marks were the traces of some sort of cutoff device  some way of deactivating the robots by remote control .  but guesses and being all but certain were not enough .  so far  whoever had removed them had been as thorough removing them as she had been in checking .  but maybe that was not going to hold .  after all  she had all the time in the world  and the fact that daylight was coming on did not concern her .  she had no fear of sudden detection or something going wrong with the plan .  but whoever had done this the night before  with the corpse of the governor upstairs  the rain lashing down  with the clock running and all the lights off  that person might well make a mistake .  fredda wanted to get on to the next robot  and skip the scan .  she resisted the temptation  knowing that the scans were important .  the robot could detect any number of things that might be hidden from human view .  a bit of dust or a smear of dried sweat or a flaked off bit of skin or a piece of tom thread that might reveal something about the person who left it behind .  perhaps even a fingerprint .  perhaps something unexpected .  so far nothing .  the opposition had been very careful .  but if they had made just one mistake  and fredda found that one mistake  that would be all it would take .  at last the scan was done and the observer robot moved back out of the way .  fredda closed the robot   s inner and outer access panels and moved on to the next unit .  it was disconcerting to stare up into those dead  designed to intimidate eyes and then reach down and open the robot up .  not so long ago  the average spacer would not  could not  have imagined being afraid of a robot .  but fredda knew times had changed .  she herself was the one who had let the genie out of the bottle .  she had made dangerous robots with her own two hands .  there was no longer any technical barrier to making a robot without any laws at all .  and nothing to stop someone from dressing a killer robot up to look like  for example  an spr unit .  after all  she had established to her own satisfaction that these sprs had been tampered with .  someone could install a no law gravitonic brain in one of them and then  and then   no .  it did not bear thinking about .  fredda was so tired she could hardly see straight  let alone think straight .  concentrate .  concentrate .  open the outer panel .  let the observer hover in and sniff around .  try and keep your eyes open .  pop the inner panel and     and swear to yourself in a low monotone .  fredda didn   t need any observer scan to tell herself she had found something .  the opposition had made a mistake  all right .  a big one .   simcor beddle  leader of the ironheads  stood in front of his comm unit in his fine silken pajamas  a soothing cup of tea in his hand .  he watched as his robots operated the comm unit  though  at the moment at least  he had no interest in calling anyone .  he was far more interested in who other people were calling .  he had ways  not all of them strictly legal  of finding out .  his comm unit was highly sophisticated  capable of pulling in all sorts of signals not generally available to the general public .  right now it was tracking encrypted police traffic  and beddle   s staff had not managed to crack those particular encryption routines .  but still  one could learn a lot by listening  even if one did not know the language .  the robots operating the system were pulling in the signals  analyzing message traffic density patterns  getting triangulations to find signal sources .  it was one of simcor beddle   s basic beliefs that there was no such thing as a secret .  true  if a matter was of no importance  it could be kept quiet  but then what did it matter .  a secret was only a secret when people wanted to know it .  but when the people in the know cared about some supposedly hidden news or event  they would act on what they knew .  by so doing  they would reveal at least some part of the secret to anyone who cared to pay attention .  the ironheads always paid attention .  beddle saw to that .  their transition from a mob of bullyboys to a legitimate political force was far from complete  and they needed every possible advantage .  the right bit of information at the right time could be of the most vital importance  and so beddle   s household staff robots had awakened him the moment police band hyperwave message traffic had started to build .  it didn   t matter that the messages themselves were encrypted  that police band activity had taken off exponentially was in itself a rather loud and clear message .  so too was the command to turn back all outgoing air traffic from the island .  that certainly could not be kept quiet for any length of time  but no explanation had been offered for it .  even so  beddle could see the aircraft being turned back on his extremely illegal repeater displays of purgatory traffic control .  beddle could likewise see the stream of vehicles with sheriff s department designation codes  corning straight from hades for the governor   s residence .  the latest development was the stream of ranger vehicles converging on the residence .  it was not lost on beddle that the sss was yet to stir .  what the devil was going on .  it was plainly obvious that the governor   s residence was the focal point of it all  but what did it mean .  in plain point of fact  beddle had a theory or two about what had happened .  simcor beddle was a man willing to set loose cannons in motion  if the potential benefit outweighed the danger .  but the days when beddle or the mainstream ironheads could tolerate being directly linked to violence were over .  covert links were another question  of course .  beddle thought for a moment .  no .  there was no one who could be traced back to him .  unless one of the old plots from the old days had come alive again  unexpectedly .  there were one or two old operatives who had simply disappeared .  if it were one of them who had come to the surface again   no .  no .  that could not be .  the odds against it were too long .  but never mind the question of who .  the question of what was far more important .  and if he was right about what the police were reacting to with such energy  it was time to move  and move fast .  this turn of events could be a tremendous opportunity  assuming one moved with a certain degree of care .  but suppose he was guessing wrong .  reacting to news that had not happened might put him in a rather awkward position  to put it mildly .  simcor frowned  displeased by the conundrum .  but then his face cleared and he smiled as he handed his teacup to his attendant robot .  there was no need to worry .  it was impossible to keep a secret .  all would be known within a few hours  and that would be soon enough for the sort of actions simcor had in mind .  there was no hurry at all .  he smiled to himself and gestured for his attendant robot to lead him back to bed .  he walked behind the robot  his rolling gait stately  dignified  calm .  all was going well .      justen devray watched as the death black coroner   s office robots carried governor chanto grieg away .     burning stars     he said .     i don   t believe it .  i can   t believe it .      he turned and looked toward the governor   s bed  the deathbed  where the crime scene team was still at work  doing a painstaking scan for any evidence that might have been hidden by the body itself .  corpses didn   t tend to bleed much  but there was still enough blood  and the burn and scorch marks on the wall and the bedding were still horrifying enough  even if they weren   t particularly extensive .     when you called to tell me  i didn   t think of all this     he said to alvar kresh .     i didn   t think about death  or about what all this is going to mean .  i thought about turf wars  and that you were trying to win one .        well  i was trying to win a turf war     kresh said .     but not because i wanted this for myself     he said .     there were other reasons .         huthwitz     devray said .  it was not a question .     huthwitz     kresh agreed .     it didn   t seem much like chance to me .  that wasn   t someone blundering into him in the dark .  it was too neat .  somebody knew exactly when and where a ranger would be  exactly how to stalk him .        except if they knew exactly where my rangers would be  why go out of their way to kill one .  why not just slip between the rangers .        that occurred to me as well     kresh said  his voice a bit too flat and even for it to be utterly natural .     would there be any other reason to kill a ranger .  maybe a reason to kill huthwitz in particular .     justen felt a knot in his stomach .  kresh was not a man who missed much .     yes     he said .     there might be .  i   m not prepared to say more just now  but there might .        you didn   t recognize huthwitz   s name last night     kresh pointed out .     but melloy knew him     devray said .     she recognized him immediately .  i still don   t know about that .  i checked with our internal investigation unit as soon as i left the huthwitz crime scene .        and they told you a thing or two you   re not quite ready to tell me     kresh said .     even though we   re standing here watching them peel incinerated bits of the governor off the wall .        yes     justen said  rather defiantly .  justen could not bring himself to tell kresh about the evidence linking huthwitz to rustbacking .  not yet .  even in the face of the governor   s death  he could not betray one of his own by confirming the report .     you know  there are two reasons melloy might have known who huthwitz was .  either she was investigating him         or else she was in on whatever he was doing     justen said .     beg pardon  sirs  but there is a third possible reason     kresh   s robot said .     they are both law enforcement officers who were involved in gubernatorial security .  she could simply have met him in the course of her normal duties .     justen took a good hard look at  what was his name  donald .  justen normally wouldn   t pay much attention to a robot  especially one who was offering a rather charitable interpretation of events .  justen   s own personal robot  genray  had gotten himself out of the way the moment they arrived at the crime scene .  he had stepped into an empty wall niche and stayed there .  but justen had heard a story or two about kresh   s robot  and kresh clearly took him seriously .     do you think that is a realistic possibility .     justen asked .  the robot donald raised his arms in a fair imitation of a human gesture of uncertainty .     it is certainly possible .  i have no way of weighing the probabilities .  but it is my experience that rejecting the innocent explanations out of hand is as unwise as refusing to consider the possibility of criminal action .  the fact that huthwitz is apparently under suspicion in some other investigation does not preclude the chance of his meeting melloy in the course of their normal duties .        point taken     justen said .     but it doesn   t get you off the hook     kresh said .     i need to know what your internal investigators were working on .        not yet     justen said .     you   ll get it  i give my word .  but i can   t give it up now  for the same reason you didn   t call the rangers the second you spotted the body .      kresh turned and looked him straight in the eye  and justen squirmed inside just a bit .  kresh was not a man to trifle with .     so you don   t trust me  either     kresh said .     i trust you  sir     justen said to the older man .     but i do not trust every one of your deputies  or the inviolability of all your communications equipment .  things can leak .      and i don   t want to wreck huthwitz   s reputation until i know he deserved to have it wrecked .  kresh   s expression turned angry  and for a moment it seemed he was going to bite justen   s head off .  but then he stopped himself  and even smiled  just a bit .     much as i hate to admit it  you might have a point .  tonya welton once flat out told me that the settlers could read encrypted sheriff s office signals .  we   ve changed our encryption since then  but that   s no guarantee .  all right .  i   ll give you one day .  twenty eight hours .         and if that   s not enough time .     justen asked .     then that will just be too bad      kresh said .     twenty eight hours .  this investigation has to move .  we need to get somewhere before the other shoe drops .     justen frowned .     shoe .  what shoe .        you don   t go killing the governor because you   re in a bad mood     kresh said .     this was very carefully planned and orchestrated  maybe even over orchestrated .  a conspiracy .  somebody had a plan  and i don   t think it   s complete yet .  someone is going to try and make a move  seize power in the next few days .        but the constitution     justen protested .     there   re the laws controlling the succession .  no one could just walk in and take over .        constitutions only work when people believe in them  have faith in them .  otherwise  they   re nothing but scraps of paper .  do you think there is enough faith in the system out there to keep someone from elbowing into the succession .        sir  might i make an additional point .     donald asked .     what  donald .        as you said  sir  this is a rather well planned conspiracy .  if  as you speculate  the assassins are planning to seize power  then they might well have co opted the succession in advance .      kresh nodded and thought for a second .  a strange expression came over his face .     unless we   re looking at this backwards .  maybe it   s some band of civic minded madmen who did this .        what .     justen asked .  kresh gestured toward the bed .     he told me himself  last night  that he was close to being impeached or recalled .  he was fairly optimistic about his chances of staying in office  but maybe someone else wasn   t .        so .        so the governor   s choice as successor doesn   t get the job if he   s removed from office by impeachment or recall .  if the governor is booted out  the president of the legislative council takes over .  shelabas quellam .  maybe someone didn   t want quellam in the governor   s chair .         is quellam that bad .     justen asked .     i hardly know the first thing about him .         that   s about all there is to know     kresh said .     he   s as close to a nonentity as you would ever wish to meet .  the trouble is that grieg named quellam as his designate .  supposedly he felt the same man should take over regardless of the circumstances  for the sake of stability .        are you sure of that .        reasonably so     kresh said .     we   ll find out soon enough .  right now  i   m more interested in who killed the man  not who takes over from      but kresh was interrupted by a woman who came in at the door .  justen recognized her as fredda leving  the roboticist .  what the devil was she doing here .     sheriff kresh     she said     i   ve found something .      there was an excited glint in her eyes  an edgy sort of triumph .     follow me     she said .  she turned and left the two men standing there  not bothering to look behind to see if they were following .     ah  dr .  leving is here at my request     kresh said  answering justen   s question before he had a chance to ask it .     i wanted to pull in a robotics expert as soon as i could .      it took justen a moment  but then he understood .     the sprs     he said .     how the hell did the shooter get past them .        that was my question     kresh said .     let   s go see what she   s found .         there   s not much that i can see     said alvar kresh as he peered into the recesses of the sapper robot .     that   s because you   re not in the business of dealing with these things up in hades     fredda said .     but you will be .        well  that sounds very dramatic     kresh said     but all i can see is what looks like some sort of broken off attachment clip and a torn bit of flat cable .        let me have a look     devray said .  kresh stepped back and let the younger man peer into the robot   s interior .     it mean anything to you .     he asked .  devray pulled his head out  a lot of astonishment on his face .     burning devils .  a restrictor .        what .     kresh said .     a restrictor .  a broken off connection point for a restrictor .  someone took the restrictors off a batch of new law robots  modified them somehow to react to a different control system  and plugged them into these sprs .     kresh opened his mouth to speak  but no words came out .  the sprs shut down by restrictors removed from new law robots .  that was diabolical .  every new law robot had a restrictor built into it .  in principle  at least  the idea was simple enough .  the restrictors saw to it that any new law robot attempting to leave purgatory would be shut down as it tried to go .  it was supposed to be impossible to remove the device without destroying the robot .  no restrictor wearing robot could function outside the area permitted by the restrictor  which was to say  the island of purgatory .  the precise workings of the system were a closely held secret .  even kresh did not know exactly how it was supposed to work .  but he did know the operative word was    supposed     for the obvious fact was that the system did not work .  every rustback robot that left the island was a testament to that .  that there was a traffic in them  a regular business  and that made it plain that it was not a question of occasional lapses or isolated violations .  rustbacking was more than just a business  it was a whole criminal industry  a highly sophisticated operation .  and one that was now tied into the assassination of the governor .  a gang of rustbackers hand found a way to tamper with the governor   s own security robots .  how the hell could they trace that leak .     you   re sure that   s a piece off a new law robot   s restrictor .     kresh demanded .     absolutely     said fredda leving .     it was what i was looking for when i started checking the sapper robots .        but i don   t understand .  we   re still on the island .  why should restrictors turn off the security robots .        they must have been modified in some way      fredda said .     clearly they weren   t working on a geographic basis  because the sappers were working fine during the party .  my guess is that they were modified to deactivate the robots on some sort of signal .  hyperwave  or maybe even old fashioned radio .  no one uses radio anymore  but that fact right there would make it perfect for this sort of job .  the signal would be undetectable with any sort of modern equipment .  clearly the restrictors have been modified not only to shut down the robots in some different way  but also to be removable in a hurry .  except this restrictor didn   t come out quite as easily as it was supposed to .        but where the devil did they get the restrictors to put on the sprs .     asked devray .  there were times it was more than clear to kresh that devray did not think in terms of crime and victim and criminal .  he was better suited to forest management than murder investigation .     the spare parts bin     leving said .     obviously  they used restrictors they had peeled off new law robots .  rustbackers did this .  no one else could have .        well  one thing is for sure     kresh said .     whoever did this worked in a rustbacker lab at some point .  he or she knew how to get these things out  and do it in a hurry .        a rustbacker     fredda said .     maybe that can point us toward a motive for the murder .        maybe     alvar said .     at least now we can get started .      donald     was in a very slight state of shock  and it was with a great sense of relief that he found that his duties required him to be alone .  the sprs had been tampered with .  they had been shut down  useless for security work .  kresh had comforted him with the knowledge that grieg had died with fifty robots to protect him .  one more could have done no good .  but the fifty had been useless  meaningless .  one functioning robot could easily have made the difference .  worse  it was the deployment of the sprs that had doomed grieg  and donald had urged their deployment .  robots on the planet inferno had always been built with extremely high first law  and had been known to freeze up on occasions such as this  when they learned they could have prevented harm to a human .  but donald knew better than that .  yes  he could have saved governor grieg  if he had been possessed of information known to no one but those who killed the governor .  he could have saved him  if he had been here  at the residence  instead of many kilometers away  with kresh  performing his normal duties .  he could have saved the governor if a half dozen impossible things had happened .  no .  no .  there was nothing he could have done outside the world of if only .  here  in reality  it was never possible to avoid all risk  all danger .  it was never possible to defend against attackers with as many resources  with as much willingness to take risks  as the killers of governor grieg .  but still  he needed to calm himself  to talk himself down from the idea that he could have done anything .  so it was just as well he had work to do  and the need to do it in private .  there was a great deal more to a major investigation than discovering clues .  it was  in many ways  as much a management operation as anything else  as donald     had reason to know .  there were all the logistical questions of bringing in robots and human personnel and all sorts of equipment .  there was an evidence center to set up  where all the data could be stored safely  and the physical evidence protected from tampering and made available for examination .  there was a press center to establish  accommodations for the investigation team and the press and the hangers on and the vips who would inevitably arrive .  there were those  and a thousand other details  to deal with  but then  donald had been quite literally made for the job .  though he was obliged to devote a lot of his time to duties as sheriff kresh   s personal assistant  his primary responsibility was to sheriff kresh   s office  to the efficient handling of the detail work  and that work he could only do when the sheriff did not require him to be present  such as at the present moment .  donald barely dared admit it even to himself  but there were unquestionably times when it was a distinct relief to get the sheriff out from underfoot so he could get on with his main task of managing the sheriff s office .  management was in large part a matter of communications  of contacting the proper robot and relaying orders  of locating the proper equipment and arranging for it to be transported to where it would be needed .  most  if not all  of it could be handled via hyperwave  which in turn meant that donald could be remarkably productive while standing stock still  with little or no outward evidence that he was even switched on  let alone extremely busy .  donald had learned the hard way to keep a low profile when so engaged .  there were more than a few humans who objected  as a matter of principle  to the sight of a seemingly idle robot .  it offended them to see donald standing stock still .  they would give near useless orders just for the sake of getting him busy .  for that reason  he preferred to make sure he was safely out of sight somewhere before he started making his calls .  in the present case  donald was hiding in a broom closet as he worked .  he was aware of the fact that many humans would find that extremely humorous  but that did not much matter to him .  the whole point of it was to stay out of their view in the first place  and they could not be amused if they couldn   t find him .  besides which  there was nothing funny about the present situation .  there were any number of points that sheriff kresh and the other humans had not even begun to address .  even now  there was vital new information coming in  along with vital new questions .  donald  however  knew enough not to point out such things to sheriff kresh and the others yet .  it would be counterproductive to break their concentration just as they were corning to terms with the basic facts of the case .  humans  donald knew  often required a great deal of time before they were able to deal with changed circumstances .  governor grieg had been murdered  and that was most unfortunate .  donald grieved his loss  inasmuch as any robot could be said to grieve .  but the plain fact was that the man was dead  and there was nothing anyone could do about it .  one always had to deal with the available circumstances  and grieg   s death was now one of them .  humans  of course  saw it differently .  they indulged in    denial     a ritual donald had never entirely understood .  it seemed to involve an attempt to reshape the world into a more convenient state by a sheer act of stubborn will  generally by insisting that some bad thing had never happened .  it had never worked and never would  but it seemed that humans always had to find out if it would work  just this once .  there was no point trying to move the sheriff  commander devray  and fredda leving forward until they had at least accepted the facts of the situation .  in the meantime  let them deal with theories  with the corpses of humans and robots .  they were best suited to that sort of task  just as donald was best suited to making arrangements for a field forensic lab to be set up .  donald was in the midst of an intricate five way linkup with various logistical offices when he heard something in the hallway outside .  under normal circumstances  he would have ignored it as part of the normal background noise of everyday life .  but these were far from normal circumstances .  it sounded very much like someone in bare feet walking slowly  and a bit unsteadily  down the long  wood floored hallway .  it was not sheriff kresh or dr .  leving or the commander .  donald would have recognized their walking rhythms .  it certainly was not any of the deputies .  their uniforms included heavy boots  and none would move at such a leisurely pace while on duty .  but the footsteps were rather loud for all of that  considering they sounded unshod .  donald cut off his comm links in as quick and orderly a fashion as he could  and waited  motionless  in the darkness of the closet until the steps had moved past him and were moving away .  donald silently opened the door and stepped out into the hall  determined not to make a sound .  he looked down the hall  not quite sure what he expected to see .  in any event  he did not expect to see a bald man in rather loud blue checked pajamas and a clashing red and white striped robe padding barefoot down the hall .   tierlaw verick  or at least the person calling himself that sat in his unfortunate sleepwear  looking most ill at ease .  he was perched on a hard backed chair in the center of a room with no other furniture in it save the interrogator   s chair .  verick   s chair had been placed so his back was to the door  with the deliberate intent of making him just that bit more uncomfortable .  half the residence seemed never to have been used .  the place was filled with fully stocked  well maintained bedroom suites with everything a guest might need  and never mind that infernals did not care to have overnight guests .  the residence had any number of handsomely appointed sitting rooms no one had ever sat in  gleaming kitchens that had not served a meal since kresh had been born .  a sad commentary on the grandiose attitude of inferno   s architects  and on the wasteful nature of a robot based economy  but it did mean there were ample facilities for interrogation .  in fact  it had taken a little doing to find a room barren enough to serve as a suitable interrogation chamber  from the psychological point of view .  fredda leving sat in the chair facing verick  while justen devray leaned in a corner and kresh paced the room .  donald stood  unobtrusive as ever  in the room   s only wall niche  facing verick  on the far side of the room from the door .  he was  of course  recording everything  but donald could do one better than that .  when fredda leving had first built him  years before  she had equipped him with the sensors to let him serve as a lie detector .  he was monitoring verick   s heart rate  respiration  pupil dilation  and other physiological factors that provided an estimate of stress levels .  verick didn   t know that  of course  and no one was going to tell him .  not that verick knew much of anything  to hear verick tell it .  verick was an older looking man  thin faced  pale skinned  with not a single hair on his head  aside from heavy brown eyebrows and lashes .  his eyes were piercing blue  and quite expressive  his face was lean and hungry looking .  the skin over his skull gleamed  a healthy pink  shining as if it had been polished  as perhaps it had .  it was baldness so thoroughgoing and absolute that it had to be an affectation  a deliberate choice in his personal appearance that had to be as carefully maintained as the most elaborate coiffure .  either he shaved his head at least daily  or had himself depilitated on a regular basis .  in kresh   s experience  men who put that sort of effort into their appearance  and chose such a startling one as absolute  perfect baldness  were rather aggressive and assertive types  and verick fit the bill .  other men arrested in such silly looking sleepwear would have acted sheepish or apologetic .  verick gave the sense of a man who didn   t like being kept waiting .  verick   s story was simple  if utterly implausible .  he was a settler businessman  here to try to sell a settler model control center to the inferno terraforming authority .  he had been a guest at the reception the evening before .  he had  by prearrangement  stayed after most of the other guests had gone to have an after hours meeting with the governor .  likewise by prearrangement  he had stayed the night after the meeting  sleeping in the west wing of the residence .  he had awakened to hear voices and people moving about  and had gotten up to see what was going on  only to be taken into custody by donald as he set foot in the hallway .  it would follow that he knew nothing about grieg   s death  having slept through the whole thing  and his behavior was consistent with that state of affairs .  either he did not know grieg was dead  or he was doing a first rate job of acting like he didn   t .  kresh was not about to tell him .  if a man who claimed to know nothing made a slip that demonstrated that he did know something  that could be most informative .  but the irritating  and baffling  thing about his story was that it seemed as if it might check out .  donald confirmed that there was a settler businessman by the name of verick on the guest list .  that was a start  anyway .  but how the devil had kresh   s deputies missed him when they searched the house .  kresh was too old a hand not to know there were lots of answers to that one .  human error could explain it in a dozen ways  any of which might be true  and none of which would sound the least bit convincing to outsiders .  there had not been many robots available when the first search had been performed  and those had been put to work either on specialized work or general heavy lifting .  human deputies had performed the search .  the place had at least a hundred rooms  and kresh could easily imagine a hurried deputy not being sure which room he had checked  or just opening a door to peek into the ninth or tenth obviously empty room in a row  and missing the motionless lump under the covers .  verick might have locked his door from the inside  and the deputy searching that section might have intended to come back later with the keys  and then forgot .  his deputies were only human  after all  and all of them were in one degree or another of shock .  it was  after all  their governor who had died this night .  it was the head of their nation  their planet  who had fallen to enemies unseen .  but even so  it was the sort of foul up that could easily dog this case for all time  if it were not put right immediately .  kresh could imagine the board of inquiry already .  kresh had set new teams of deputies to work to search the place allover again  just to see what else they might have missed  and  this time  with some sort of crime scene observer robot accompanying each deputy .  later  if it came to that  kresh was prepared to take the whole residence apart  brick by brick .  nothing could be permitted to threaten the integrity of this investigation .  but verick .  if his innocence seemed implausible  so too did his guilt .  for if he were a member of the elaborate conspiracy  then why in space had he remained behind in the residence .  why had he allowed himself to be arrested in his pajamas .  in the main  it seemed to kresh  verick   s story seemed more plausible than any attempt to tie him to the crime .  but they were damned short of suspects and motives at the moment  and kresh saw no reason to turn his back on one .  besides  stories had held together in the past  only to crack later on under sufficient pressure .      all right  mr .  verick  let   s try it again     kresh said .     from the top .        can   t you tell me what all this is about .     verick said .     can   t you tell me what   s happened .        no     kresh said  his tone as clipped as his reply .     it   s important that we not tell you too much just yet     devray said  clearly playing good cop to kresh   s bad cop .     we want to know what you know  without muddying the tracks .        i want to speak to the governor     verick said .     i can promise you that the governor does not want to speak to you     kresh said .  true enough  if more than a bit misleading .  and it seemed to have the desired effect of unnerving verick .     from the top     kresh said again      all right  all right .      he hesitated long enough to take a deep sigh and slump down in his chair  and then began again  his eyes staring out .     my name is tierlaw verick .  i live on the settler world of baleyworld .  i represent a firm that sells highly sophisticated control equipment .  we   ve sold a great number of our systems to settler terraforming projects  and i was sent here in hopes of selling one of our systems to the terraforming center here .  i attended the reception last night  and afterwards had a meeting with governor grieg .  knowing that accommodation was very tight in town  and that i had come a very long way  he very kindly offered to put me up for the night .         you and you alone .     fredda said .     of all the people here last night  you were the only one who stayed the night .        hmmm .     verick looked at fredda  as if he were surprised by the question .     i don   t know .  i didn   t notice anyone else  one way or the other .  i don   t see why i should be the only one .  there   s certainly plenty of room here .  but to the best of my direct knowledge  yes .  i must say that surprises me in a house this size  though .  back home  every one of the guests at the reception would have been an overnight guest .  but are you telling me there was no one else here .        no  there wasn   t     fredda said  to kresh   s annoyance .  rule number one of interrogation was never to answer the suspect   s questions .  the more verick knew  the more able he would be to craft his answers .     dr .  leving     kresh said     i think it would be best if you let the commander and myself ask the questions  and if you did not supply any answers yourself .     leving looked toward kresh  a bit startled .     but i  oh     she said  about to protest and then thinking better of it .  .  .  forgive me  sheriff .        no harm done .  in any event  it   s a very minor point     kresh said  hoping that he was telling the truth  now that verick   s attention had been drawn to it .     but you weren   t the only one to meet with the governor last night  were you .        no  no  of course not     verick said .     there were a number of other people waiting their turn before me .  eight or ten of them altogether  but in twos and threes .  i had to wait until they were done  but i didn   t much mind .  after all  i didn   t have to fly home afterwards  and besides  by being the last one in line  i had the chance to stay a little longer .  no one was waiting behind me .      and you   ve just told us you were the last one to see grieg alive  kresh thought .  he stole the tiniest of glances at devray  and saw the point had not been lost on him  either .     so what did the two of you talk about .     kresh asked .  it was plainly obvious that verick   s patience was running thin .     i have told you and told you .  about my desire to sell him a control station .  he seemed most interested in it  for a number of reasons  mostly because it wasn   t a robotic system .        i beg your pardon .     kresh asked .  that was the benefit of repeated questioning .  verick hadn   t offered that little tidbit in the previous go rounds .     our settler system is not robotic     verick said .     i did what i could to point out the advantages of that to the governor .  that was mostly what we talked about .  he seemed quite receptive .        why would he be against a robotic system .     fredda asked .     too conservative for a situation as far gone as inferno     verick said .     hook a robot brain control unit up to the terraforming system and it will avoid all potentially risky operations  for fear of doing harm to human beings  or some damn thing .      he was warming to his subject  obviously going through the arguments he had used on grieg .      a robotic control system would do all it could to avoid all risk during the terraforming process  almost certainly delaying completion  and possibly causing the project to fail altogether .  even if it succeeded in terraforming the planet  its goal would be to create an utterly risk free final environment when the reterraforming was complete .  there are spacer worlds that are virtually nothing more than planetwide well manicured lawns .  i don   t think it   s any coincidence that those are the worlds where the populations have fallen asleep  or vanished completely .      that was a low blow .  solaria .  no spacer liked to be reminded of  or think about  the collapse of solaria .  verick looked around and saw that he had scored a point .     a robotic system  obsessed with risk avoidance  would lead to a very bland sort of world here .  as i told the governor  not exactly a fit environment if you want future generations to be able to deal with challenges .        all right     kresh said  not having to try much in trying to play the part of the rude cop .     that   s enough speeches for now .  so you talked to the governor .  then what .        then we said our good nights  and he said he had some other things to attend to  and so he saw me to the door of his office .  we shook hands there  and i stepped around the robots in the hallway and went on my way .  i   m afraid i got a bit turned around in the hallways and walked around in a bit of a circle .  after a bit  i realized that i was going to end up right back where i had started  at the door to the governor   s apartment .  i thought of asking the two robots i had seen by the door for directions  but by then they weren   t there anymore .  i suppose they had already gone in .         gone in .     kresh asked .  he had assumed the robots verick had mentioned by the door were sprs on sentry duty .  but sentry robots stay where they were .     where did the robots go .        to tuck him in for the night  i suppose .  i   ve heard you spacers can   t even get undressed without a robot to help .     fredda seemed about to respond to that  but kresh stepped forward and put a hand on her shoulder .  it did no good at all for the suspect to find out he could bait the inquisitors .     some of us can manage on our own     kresh said  a bit of steel behind the soft words .  but the sentry should not have left its post .  and there should have been one robot on door duty  not two .  kresh had a feeling he knew the answer to his next question .     these robots     he said .     can you describe them .        i don   t have much time for robots     verick said .     i don   t like    em and i don   t trust    em .        but you can see them     kresh said  his voice hard edged .     what did the two robots look like .     verick looked up at kresh  visibly annoyed .     there was a very tall  angular looking red one .  shiny red .  i wouldn   t want to mess with him .  the other was shorter  and shiny black .     justen devray and fredda leving both looked from verick to kresh  both of them understanding .  the last two beings to see grieg alive were prospero and caliban .  new law and no law .  one robot whose internal laws did not require it to prevent harm to a human .  and one who had no laws at all .  who could harm whatever humans it liked .      sero phrost looked down into the grey darkness of the sea below as his aircar swooped back toward purgatory .  no explanation  no apology  just the flat order to turn back  an order his pilot robot was obeying  despite his best efforts to convince it otherwise .  the turn back order came from a traffic safety center  and the first law saw to it that that was all a robot needed to know in order to force obedience .  but why the turn around .  an arrest order .  what did they think they knew .  and arrested for what .  he would have to be careful  very careful .  more than one person had been pulled in on a minor charge and made the mistake of assuming it was about some larger matter .  or was it his own arrest that he was flying back toward .  phrost looked out the porthole and saw the running lights of several other aircars heading back to purgatory .  a dragnet .  perhaps  if he permitted himself to grasp at straws  it had nothing to do with him at all .  it could be they were acting on a rustbacking tip off  and pulling back all flights that had left at a certain time .  no way to know .  perhaps it had nothing at all to do with him .  the guilty flee when no one pursues .  admit nothing  reveal nothing .  there was still every chance for him to win out .  the dark sky rushed past him .   alvar kresh glanced at the wall clock in the operations room .  just before      hours .  a bare five hours since he had found the body  though it seemed that enough had happened since then to fill up a month   s worth of days .  tierlaw verick was filed away for future reference  held under close guard in the same room in which he had been questioned  while the crime scene robots went over the room in which he had slept .  kresh doubted that verick had anything to do with the assassination  but hunches were no way to run an investigation .  who knew what they might find  until they looked .  someone had set up a conference table in the ops room  and kresh  fredda leving  and justen devray sat at three of its sides  while donald     stood at the fourth .  all of them  even donald  somehow  seemed exhausted  drawn out  the press of events leaving them all far behind the pace .  and yet it seemed they were no further ahead than they had been when they had started .  the clock was moving  and moving fast .  kresh dared not delay much longer in contacting the key members of the government  or in announcing grieg   s death to all inferno .  but the moment he did that  kresh knew  all hell would break loose .  he could not foresee what form the chaos would take  but he knew  beyond doubt  that there would be chaos .  he desperately needed to have much of this investigation under control before the news broke wide .  and the damage could only be made worse if the first announcement came from someplace beside alvar kresh   s own mouth  a probability that was increasing with every second that passed .  a deputy might say something over an unscrambled channel that would be overheard  or call a friend or family member with the news  or give or sell the story of the century to a friend in the news business .  or the killers might decide it suited their purposes to make the announcement .  or someone who called grieg might do what kresh had done  and realize the grieg on the other end was a simulation .  the sim was still running on the phone system  half to help keep the lid on and half to leave it intact for the analysis teams .  they would have to make the announcement soon  very soon  if they were to keep any sort of control over events .  but before kresh told anyone anything  he needed a chance to think  to compare notes  to plan .  a council of war  because it might quite literally be that grieg   s death was the opening shot in an actual war .  there was no way to know .  he was sure justen devray understood all that  and it at least seemed as if fredda leving did .  kresh found that he was impressed  very impressed  by the way she had handled herself in the midst of all this chaos .  there was a lot to admire about the young  smart  and beautiful fredda leving .  but kresh did not feel he could rely too much on her instincts when it came to criminal investigation .  she had shown in verick   s interrogation that she thought in too straight a line for police work .  maybe the direct approach worked in science  where the facts did not mind being discovered .  police work  on the other hand  was a form of research where the facts were often determined to elude capture .  head straight for them and they   d be bound to escape .     all right  donald     alvar said .     let   s get started .  what do we have  and what do we need .        we have ascertained  through tierlaw verick   s statement  that caliban and prospero were almost certainly the last to see governor grieg alive     donald said .     i have placed an all points bulletin for their capture  but it seems unlikely we will apprehend them quickly  especially if we do not have the full cooperation of the sss .  neither the rangers nor our own department have arrest powers here  or facilities for performing inquiries .     neither prospero nor caliban are presently available or traceable via hyperwave  and both have duties that require them to be out in the field a great deal .  it is possible they are following their normal routines  but are simply out of touch .  it is also possible that they have gone into hiding .  we will do all we can to trace them  given the limitations of our circumstances .      interesting that donald would start with the robots  kresh thought .  he was focused  perhaps overfocused  on them .  it would be best to keep in mind that in this investigation at least  donald was not likely to be even remotely as objective as he normally was .  clearly  he wanted prospero and caliban to be guilty .  a biased robot .  as if there weren   t enough problems on this case .     how reliable is tierlaw   s statement .     kresh asked .     as best i could ascertain  all of his bodily reactions were consistent with a man under great stress giving a truthful statement .  i believe that he spoke the truth      donald said .  and that was the least qualified pronouncement donald had ever made concerning his lie detector function .  enough so that kresh felt unsure .  usually donald made a speech three times longer than that about the uncertainty of such measurement .  no doubt about it  he wanted the robots to be guilty .     we should be able to check his story out against grieg   s appointment diary     devray said .     that   s something .  but at least we have a lead  and suspects .        even leaving aside the first law question  i can   t see what possible motive caliban and prospero could have for attacking grieg  or why they would have been so clumsy about it     fredda protested .     yes  caliban has no first law .  in theory  there is nothing to prevent him attacking anyone he likes .  but there   s nothing preventing me  or you  either .  and yes  prospero   s first law does not enjoin him to prevent harm  but i can   t imagine prospero splitting hair so fine as to interpret that as participating in a murder but not actually firing the weapon  which is what you   d have to have here .        but you do grant     devray said     that there is nothing in caliban   s absence of laws that would prevent him from killing grieg .  and that there is nothing in the new laws that would absolutely force prospero to prevent the attack .        yes  but         so one of them could kill and the other could stand idly by     devray said  his tone a bit badgering .     in theory  yes     fredda admitted  with massive reluctance .     but it makes no sense .  grieg was the best friend the new law robots ever had .  what would make them want to kill him .        plenty     devray said .     i have an appointment  had an appointment  with the governor for later this morning .  we were going to talk about a proposal i had submitted last week .        what sort of proposal .     kresh asked .     one for the destruction of all new law robots     devray said .     what .  have you taken leave of your senses .     fredda demanded .     no  ma   am     devray replied  his voice bland and professional .     but i   m damned sick and tired of chasing rustbackers .  the n .  l .  s are at the focus of a whole new series of crimes  rustback smuggling  restrictor removal  and the founding of illegal settlements .        settlements .     kresh asked .     well  one settlement  anyway     devray said .     they call it valhalla .  it   s supposed to be somewhere on the far side of the planet from here  somewhere in the utopia region of terra grande .  i don   t even know if it exists  but it   s where half the rustbacks we catch seem to be heading .  and i   m tired of wasting time and effort chasing rumors .  i told the governor the rustbacks and the new law robots were more trouble than they were worth  and it was time to admit it and move on .        but they work .     fredda protested .     new law robots represent half the work force on purgatory .        and they were supposed to be all of it  except they   re only about a third as productive as three law robots .  every department has been forced to pull in human workers  because the settlers don   t allow three law robots to have the run of the island .  if the new law robots were worth all the trouble they cause  that   d be one thing     devray said .     but if anything  they   re slowing down the reterraforming project .     kresh was surprised to see devray that interested in terraforming  and then realized he shouldn   t have been surprised at all .  the rangers only did law enforcement on the side .  terraforming was much more their side of the street .     was  was the governor considering the idea .     fredda asked .     i don   t know     devray said .     he didn   t reject it out of hand .  i know he was also toying with the idea of removing all the range restrictors and letting the new law robots go .        why the devil would he do that .     kresh asked .     there wouldn   t be a new law left on this island if not for the restrictors .        don   t be too sure of that     fredda said .     a lot of the new law robots do cause trouble  but the ones that do work  work plenty hard .  a lot of the rustbacks work very hard indeed  once they   re paid a decent wage .  and not all of them head for valhalla  justen .  and just by the way  valhalla is no rumor .  it   s a real place  and there are lots of good reasons for the new laws to head for it .  i   ve seen that with my own eyes .        you seem to know a lot about rustbacks     devray said .     and have you reported these escaped robots in valhalla you   ve seen with your own eyes .  or reported valhalla   s location .        no  i have not reported that information     she snapped .     i don   t know where valhalla is  and i don   t want to know .  but if you want to arrest me for seeing a rustback  go right ahead .  i felt responsible for them .  rustbacks are escaped new law robots  and i invented new law robots .  of course i   d research them .        hold it  both of you     kresh said .     this is not the time .  we can go into all this later .  right now the only important thing is that devray   s recommendation to the governor could have given caliban and prospero a very strong motive if they knew about it .  they might have decided to kill him before he killed them .        caliban isn   t a new law robot         burning hells  i know that better than anyone .     kresh snapped .     but maybe he decided not to take chances on being caught up in a roundup .  or maybe he just acted in sympathy to the plight of his new law brethren .  it   s a possible motive  and the two of them are definite suspects .        but you can   t just decide they did it .  any number of humans might have         i said they were suspects  not the suspects     kresh said .     even if i were convinced they did it  and i   m not  i wouldn   t dare stop investigating other possibilities .  not until the other shoe drops .  suppose it wasn   t the robots .  suppose humans did this job .  what was their motive .  have they achieved it with grieg   s death  or is there more to follow .  is it a coup  or a simple assassination .        a coup .  stars above  i hadn   t even thought of that     fredda said .     i haven   t thought of much else     kresh said .     but i   ll tell you this  with every minute that passes  it becomes less likely that it was  is  a coup .  if you   re attempting to overthrow a government  you don   t give it time to recover from the first blow before you strike again .  unless something has gone wrong with their plans .  or unless  hellfire  that   s a tough one .        what   s a tough one .     fredda demanded .     suppose the public announcement of grieg   s death is the signal for their next move .        well  there   s some chance of that     devray agreed .     i doubt the killers expected the body would be discovered so soon  or that you would discover it .  they set up the image box to do the comm simulation  after all .         yes     fredda said .     probably the killers weren   t expecting discovery until this morning .      she looked up at kresh and shrugged .     maybe it was tierlaw who was supposed to find the body .  unless tierlaw did it and was planning to pretend to discover the body this morning .  except donald said his monitors showed that tierlaw was telling the truth .        don   t trust donald   s sensors that far     kresh said .     a trained man could beat his sensors  or any lie detector system  short of a psychic probe .  but tierlaw could have been set up  a useful idiot .         how the devil can an idiot be useful .     fredda asked .     by being worse than useless to your opposition .  maybe we   re supposed to pay so much attention to tierlaw that we let the real perpetrators get away .  but that   s giving them an awful lot of credit  and assumes an incredibly complex and fragile plot .  my guess is that the assassins are completely unaware of tierlaw   s existence  and he is telling the precise truth  he had nothing to do with it  and he slept through the whole thing .  but don   t worry  we   re going to hold him and check him out all the same .        if you   re right     devray said     then how was the body supposed to be discovered .  the plotters had to have thought about it .  what were they expecting .        well     fredda said     all the regular household robots had been ordered to clear off to an outbuilding for the night of the party .  there are two deputies interviewing them now  but i doubt they   ll get anything .  they would have returned this morning  right about now  i suppose  to resume their normal duties .        so a robot was supposed to discover grieg was dead     kresh said .     what would have happened then .     he asked .  fredda thought for a moment .     it depends very much on the robot   s preexisting and contingency orders  of course  but most likely  all hell would break loose .  it would call for help  attempt resuscitation  call for reinforcements  request a security alert  and who knows what else .         all the proper things to do in terms of the three laws  but that would have set off absolute chaos     kresh said .     if that had happened  every kind of cop within two hundred kilometers would have been over the residence  banging into each other and the news media and whatever political leaders managed to get involved .  the devil only knows what sort of hell that would have stirred up .  and all an attempt to revive grieg would have accomplished would be the muddling of the evidence .  just the sort of chaos and confusion a coup plotter would want .         maybe     devray said .     maybe .  there   s a lot of guessing in there  but it might be right .        sir     donald said     if i may interject  there are other vital issues that must be considered before we establish any sort of motive for other hypothetical suspects .        what other issues .     kresh asked .     there is the question of the weapon .         hell   s bells  the weapon .  i am getting old .         what about the weapon .     fredda asked .     there are energy scanners at every entrance to this building     said kresh     and perimeter scanners as well .  no one should have been able to get an energy weapon into this building without half a dozen alarms going crazy .  how did the weapon get in here .  how did it get out .        or did it get out .     devray asked .     why risk taking it both ways through the scanners .  you might set off an alarm on the way out .  if i were doing this job  i wouldn   t take chances on smuggling the gun in .  the building was unoccupied for damn all long enough to plant a hundred blasters .  r d hide a nice standard blaster with a shielded power pack  do the job  and then abandon the blaster on the premises .         hmmph .  it   s a possibility     kresh said .     i beg your pardon  commander devray  but there is one point that argues against such a possibility     donald said .     the energy discharge curve .        what   s that .     fredda asked .     by examining the governor   s wounds and the blaster damage to the robots  and by establishing range  it was possible to note the relative power of each shot  and thus the weapon   s charge level for each shot .  for any given blaster  each shot is less and less intense as the blaster   s charge is expended .  for the weapon in question  the intensity of the blaster shots declined precipitously with each firing  clearly indicating an unusually small power cell .  the discharge pattern was quite unlike any of the common makes and models of blaster .         and an undersized power cell suggests a weapon intended for concealment      kresh said .     a custom job .  and custom made weapons can be traced .  you   re right  donald  that needs looking into .        yes  sir .  i think we must also ask ourselves about the assault on tonya welton  and the subsequent arrival of the false sss agents .  was it indeed some sort of diversion linked to the attack .  and if so  who was it supposed to divert  and what was it supposed to divert that person from .        especially as we established almost immediately that it was bogus     kresh said .     why stage a diversion that would make us more suspicious .        maybe because at that point it didn   t matter anymore     devray said .     maybe the thing it was supposed to divert attention from wasn   t the governor   s death at all .  and maybe it wasn   t you it was meant to distract .        huthwitz     kresh said .     the murder of emoch huthwitz .  you   re suggesting that it was sheer chance that it happened the same night as grieg   s murder .        it   s possible .  maybe the welton attack was meant to divert the rangers away from the attack on one of their own .         that won   t work     fredda objected .     from what you   ve told me  this huthwitz was found hours after he was killed .  no one noticed he was missing .  and it doesn   t sound like much of anyone in the rangers responded to the attack on welton .        all good points     kresh agreed .     but huthwitz   s death doesn   t make sense as a coincidence  either .        coincidences never make sense     fredda said .     they happen by chance  not logic .        but there   s a point beyond which chance is an awfully weak explanation .  in fact  it   s always a weak explanation .        well  suppose huthwitz was the diversion .     asked fredda .     while you were out looking at his body  the governor was being killed .         that doesn   t work  either     kresh said .     huthwitz was killed hours before the governor .  our best estimate was he was killed before the attack on tonya welton .  as for the discovery of his body as a diversion  he could have been discovered hours later or hours before he was .  and the governor had been dead for about an hour before we found huthwitz .  and besides  we just got through agreeing that the plotters intended grieg to be discovered some time in the morning  hours from now .         but it was huthwitz   s death that led you to check on the governor     leving said .     but no one could have predicted it would cause me to check  and my discovery of the body didn   t do anyone any good     kresh said .     beyond all that  if huthwitz was killed as a diversion  it didn   t much matter who they killed .  but commander devray has as much as told me he thinks someone might have had very good reasons to kill huthwitz  and huthwitz alone .        so what are you saying .     fredda asked .     i   m saying that the two murders are related  but i haven   t the faintest idea how .  right now donald is the only one with a theory of the crime .         sir  i would submit that i have much more than a theory .  i have means  motive  and opportunity .  i have two suspects .        donald  you want them to be guilty     fredda said .     if they killed grieg  it would confirm all your strongest fears about new law robots .  but i   m no investigator  and i can see all the holes in the case against them .  i agree with sheriff kresh that it seems extremely unlikely that grieg   s murder was unrelated to everything else that happened last night .  how could caliban and prospero have killed huthwitz  and why would they do it .  how and why did they arrange the attack on tonya and the phony sss agents that took away her assailants .        i cannot  as yet  answer those questions  dr .  leving .  and despite your objections  they are the only suspects we have .        i agree     kresh said .     we need to bring them in .  but we also need to work on finding ourselves some other suspects as well .  we   re going to have to go over the access recorder records .  and we need to get hold of all the video imagery shot by all the news outlets .  we need to go over it frame by frame  and if we can spot anything or anyone who shouldn   t be there .        i can attend to that  sheriff     donald said .     good .      kresh glanced up at the wall clock again .  time was moving .  moving too damned fast .     i need to draft some sort of statement     he said .     we   ve waited long enough .  we   re not going to get things under any more control than they are right now .  i have to notify the government  and then the public .     he stood up  rubbed his face with a tired hand  and ran his thick  stubby fingers through his white hair .     it   s time to tell the world that chanto grieg is dead .          ottley bissal walked the streets of limbo city  straining to be invisible  willing himself to vanish into the hustling  bustling  early morning crowd  watching his back to be sure there was no one watching him .  it was the last leg of the journey  and he was close  so very close .  he had parked the aircar on one side of town  and walked from there straight through the busiest sections of the city .  limbo was a classic boomtown  growing by leaps and bounds  stepping on its own feet as it struggled to keep up with its new role as the world headquarters of the reterraforming team .  technicians  designers  scientists  and construction workers were everywhere  with new law robots hurrying everywhere on this urgent errand or that  and survey teams and speciality workers coming and going from every corner of the world .  even on a normal day  there was not a room to be had in the city  and building new accommodations space was always a low priority to all the other vital projects .  the onslaught of yip visitors to the residence had only made matters worse .  but bissal had no need to worry .  they had taken care of him  seen to it he had a place to stay until it was allover .  certain that he was not being followed  bissal shouldered his way through the worst of the crowds and made it to a less congested part of town  to an old warehouse .  as instructed  he tried his hand at the side door security panel .  it read his palm and the door slid open .  he stepped inside  and the door slid closed .  it was a rustbacking lab  with all the hardware of the trade .  but one side of the place had been set up as a rather cozy little apartment  with a bed  a mini kitchen  a refresher  and ample stocks of food and water .  now all he had to do was stay here  out of sight  until they called for him  until the heat was off  until someone came for him .  bissal was exhausted  but he was also hungry  and he was probably too wound up to sleep  anyway .  a quick snack would give him a chance to relax and unwind before he turned in .  he hurried to the mini kitchen and started rummaging around for something to eat .  it   s good to be safe  he thought as he opened up a fastmeal and sat down to eat .  very good .      your pardon  sir  but there is an urgent call for you .        hmmm .  what .  excuse me .     shelabas quellam  president of the legislative council  was not yet fully awake .  he sat up in bed and blinked sleepily at his personal robot .     what is it  keflin .        a call  sir      the robot replied .     it seems to be most urgent  coming on a government channel .         oh  dear .  well  then  i   d best take it at once .         yes  sir .     a second robot appeared  carrying a portable comm link unit .  the second robot held the unit with one hand as it activated it with the other .  quellam watched the screen as it cleared and saw that it was that sheriff fellow .  klesh .  klersh .  something like that .  in any event  he looked perfectly dreadful .  and no wonder  at this time of night .  but what in the world could it all be about .     good evening  sheriff .  or rather  good morning .  what can i do for you .        sir  forgive me for calling at this hour     kresh said     but i have some very bad news .  the governor has been murdered .     the governor has been murdered .  it later seemed to shelabas that the sheriff must have said more after that  he even remembered acting on advice kresh must have given him at that moment  but he could not recall hearing any of it at all .  he was too busy trying to contain his sense of glee while trying to pretend he was sorry grieg was dead .  too bad the poor fellow was gone  but shelabas quellam suffered no illusions .  he knew what people in general thought of him  and he knew very well what grieg in particular had thought of him .  grieg might have named quellam his designate  but grieg had never respected quellam .  but now  at last  at long last  he  shelabas quellam  would be the governor .  at last  long last  the world was going to find out that shelabas quellam was a man to be taken seriously .   sheriff alvar kresh stood alone before the robot camera in the residence   s broadcast studio .  justen devray stood by his side  but that did not matter .  alvar was alone  as alone as he had ever been .  even as he spoke  he knew the words he spoke would be the image that the world would remember .  twenty years from now  if anyone spoke of alvar kresh  it would be to talk of his standing before this camera  haggard and exhausted  speaking words he did not want to say  speaking to a world that would not want to hear .  not that many would be awake to hear  not at this hour .  few would be tuned in to the news channels .  some nets might not even carry the announcement live .  but everyone would see it  soon enough .  people would call each other  retrieve the record  listen to the words  over and over again through the day  the week  the month .  only a handful of people would hear him now .  but all the people of this world  and people on other worlds  and people not yet born  would hear what he had to say  sooner or later .  strange to think that when all he had for an audience now was justen devray and a robot camera operator .     people of inferno .  good morning to you .  i am deeply grieved to make the following announcement     kresh said    at approximately      hours last night  i  sheriff alvar kresh  discovered the body of governor chanto grieg at the governor   s winter residence .  he had been shot through the chest at close range by a blaster  by parties unknown and for reasons unknown .  i immediately called in a team of sheriff   s office investigators .  i then obtained the assistance of commander devray of the governor   s rangers  and we secured the winter residence as a crime scene .  i have notified shelabas quellam  the president of the legislative council .     legislator quellam  commander devray  and i are all determined to use all the personnel and resources at our disposal  both to find the perpetrators of this crime and to insure the stability of our government during this time of crisis .  i realize that i have left a great deal unsaid  but there is little more i can say that would be useful or reliable at this time .  we will  of course  provide as much information as we possibly can  as soon as we possibly can  consistent with the requirements of a thorough investigation .      kresh paused for a moment  looked down at his notes  and then back at the camera .  that was all he had written down  but it seemed as if there was something more he should say .     this is  this is terrible news for all of us  and a shock as deep as any our people have ever known .  though i rarely agreed with chanto grieg  i always respected him .  he was a man who could see ahead  to the dangers and the promises of the future .  let us not lose sight of his vision now  or let him die for things that were not to be .  i ask all of you for strength and forbearance in the days ahead  and i thank you .  good morning  and good luck to us all .       gubber anshaw  the noted robotic theorist  went through phases concerning his daily routine .  there were times he worked late into the night  and other times he rose with the sun and got to bed not much past sunset .  it was gubber who had invented the gravitonic brain that made new law robots possible  and he was kept constantly busy in the effort to study the new law robots  learn what made them tick .  he wanted to find ways to make them more efficient  more productive  and that meant observing his creations at work .  that  in turn  often meant working at odd hours .  there were pleasures in seeing every hour of the day  to be sure .  few men saw as many sunrises  as many sunsets  as many of the midnight stars  as gubber anshaw .  but the dawn gave him no pleasure that morning .  not with the terrible news .  he was in the solarium  his personal robot serving him breakfast  when he heard the first report .  almost before he knew it  he was rushing to the bedroom  bursting in on tonya  still asleep .  tonya .  tonya welton .  even in that moment of horror and panic  there was still a tiny part of him that paused to marvel at the fact that the beautiful  hard edged  tough minded settler leader loved him  lived with him  lived with a soft spoken robot designer .  there were not many spacer settler couples in the universe  and there were good reasons for that .  it was never easy living with tonya .  but it was always exciting  and always worth it .     tonya .     gubber went to the bed and shook tonya   s shoulder .     tonya .  wake up .        hmmn    .  hmm .  what .     tonya sat up in bed  yawning .       gubber  what in the stars is it .        it   s grieg .  governor grieg .  he   s been assassinated .        what .        shot dead .  sheriff kresh just announced it a few minutes ago .  no real details yet  but grieg   s dead .        burning hell     tonya said  shock and astonishment in her voice .     last night .  i saw him  talked to him last night .  and he   s dead .        dead     gubber agreed .     and they don   t know who did it .        i don   t think so .  they said they were still investigating .  but they aren   t going to say anything for a while  no matter what happens .     tonya reached for him  and they threw their arms around each other  held each other tight .     this is trouble  gubber     said tonya  her voice a bit muffled with her face in gubber   s chest .     trouble for everyone .        yes  yes .        but who did it .     tonya asked  pulling back a little to look into gubber   s face .     some lunatic .  was it a plot .  why did they do it .     gubber shook his head and thought a minute .     i don   t know     he said  forcing himself to settle down and think it through  forcing himself to be rational .     it doesn   t matter .  the chaos will be the same .  all sorts of people will try and take advantage of grieg   s death .  if it wasn   t someone trying to take over who killed him  then someone else is going to try taking over now that he   s dead .     tonya welton nodded  her expression dazed and confused .     i   m sure you   re right     she said .     maybe we should try and get away     gubber said .     get off planet .  there   s going to be trouble .        no     tonya snapped .  her face took on a hard  set expression .     we can   t .  i can   t .  i   m here to lead the settlers on inferno  not to run off and leave them when there   s trouble .      she stared deep into gubber   s eyes  but then she seemed to be looking right through him  past him  at something else    oh  no     she said .     oh  no .        what is it .     gubber asked  grabbing her by the shoulders  trying to get her attention .     tonya  what is it .        the dust up last night     tonya said .     i told you about it when i got in .  the two men who got in a fight with me  and were taken away by the phony sss agents .        yes  what about it .        don   t you see .     she said .     don   t you get it .  kresh will assume  will have to assume  that the attack on me was part of it  part of the plot .  a diversion  or something .  that it was staged for some reason to do with grieg being killed .     and then gubber did understand  and he pulled tonya close and held her tight .  he knew instantly that it would be impossible to talk her into leaving  that the rangers or the sheriffs department would stop her from leaving even if she tried .  because he did understand  and understood far more than what she had told him .  kresh would assume the attack on her was staged because of grieg   s murder  he would also assume that tonya was one of the people who helped to stage it .  but far worse than that was the tiny bit of gubber   s own heart .  the part who knew how tough  how hard  tonya could be .  how she never flinched from doing what was necessary .  she and grieg never had seen eye to eye .  besides  tonya and he had both been suspects in the caliban case .  and tonya welton was a good actress .  she could always convince gubber of anything .  never mind that kresh would have to suspect tonya of complicity in the governor   s murder .  the worst of it was that kresh   s suspicion might even be justified .   captain cinta melloy of the settler security service was angry  and when cinta melloy was angry  no one else nearby was likely to find much peace and quiet  not that kresh would have been likely to get much in any event .  she was leaning over kresh   s makeshift desk in the ops center .  i am shoving myself into your territory  her posture told him .  you have slighted me  and i have to bully you to make sure you know to respect me in future .     why the double damned hell did i have to find out the governor was dead off the morning news .     she demanded .  because we suspected you in the plot  and we still do  kresh thought .  he couldn   t tell melloy that  of course .  sooner or later that explanation was going to occur to melloy  if it hadn   t already .  if she chose to do something about it  then there would be major trouble  to put it mildly .  for the time being  however  kresh was resisting the temptation to give cinta her own back .  one rarely got anywhere trying to bully a bully .     this is a spacer matter  cinta  pure and simple     kresh said in his most diplomatic tones .     a spacer citizen was shot on spacer territory .  i agree that perhaps we should have contacted you as a courtesy  but there is nothing that required us to do so  and  to be honest  we had other things on our minds besides protocol .         didn   t it occur to you that my sss has jurisdiction over nearly this whole damned island besides the residence .     melloy demanded .     didn   t it cross your minds that you might need my help .  didn   t it occur to you that i might decide to see to it you got booted out of your job .     yes  and i took the risk eyes open .     cinta  we will take all the help we can get .  i promise you there was no intent to insult you .      just to keep you isolated  and to make sure you weren   t running the investigation .     it was an oversight in the midst of a crisis situation  not a deliberate slight     kresh lied  his voice sincere and his expression solemn .     our head of state was murdered eight hours ago .  most of my people are still in a state of shock .  i   m still in a state of shock .  with all due respect  under the circumstances  contacting you was not the first thing on anyone   s mind .  i   m sorry .     melloy took her hands off the desk  and stood up straight  slightly mollified  but nowhere near satisfied .     i   m not quite sure i believe you     she said .     it all sounds a bit too damned reasonable to be coming out of your mouth  kresh .         be that as it may  cinta  we could use your help     kresh said  attempting to move the conversation on into other topics .  that is  we could use your help now that we   re fairly sure you can   t hurt us by suborning the investigation .     there are a hell of a lot of people being detained at purgatory   s transport center .  the people from the long range aircars we diverted back from hades and other spots on the mainland could cause us some trouble .  we still have all airspace shut down for the time being  and things are likely to get a bit unruly .     it was unusual for a place the size of limbo to have a major transport center  but purgatory was far enough from the mainland to be out of safe range for the average private aircar .  the average citizen either had to use public air transport or a special purpose long range aircar to make the journey .     how much longer can we keep the transport center shut down .     melloy asked .     not long     kresh admitted  not failing to notice that melloy had said    we .      that was at least somewhat promising .     in fact  come to think of it  i didn   t have the authority to shut it down in the first place .  closing the ports was almost a reflex action  i suppose .  first thing i thought of .      that much at least was true .  the odd supporting fact always made a lie seem much more plausible .     limbo city and the island   s airspace are in your jurisdiction .  you   ll have to decide when to lift restrictions .      in other words  i   ve made a mess and i   m leaving it for you to clean up .     oh  the hell with jurisdiction     melloy said  though she didn   t sound entirely sincere  how could she  given the battles she had fought over the most trivial threat to her turf .     what are you looking for .  what sort of person .        i   m not looking for anyone  yet     kresh said .  at least no one i   m going to tell you about .  tierlaw verick had identified caliban and prospero as the last ones to see the governor alive  and they were still at large  but kresh had no wish for a trigger happy sss agent to blast one or both of them down to slag .  kresh knew too many stories about sss suspects conveniently silenced by    accident .     kresh was suspicious of cinta   s cooperative attitude .  her behavior from anyone else would be gross belligerence .  coming from cinta melloy  it was all a bit too friendly .     if you aren   t looking for anyone  why are you holding people .     cinta asked .     mostly what i   m after is names and addresses  identifications .  something we can run against a list of all the people who were here last night or in the vicinity .  i   d like to get as many of them as possible to account for their movements last night  and i   d like to have a list of those who can   t .        it   s a tall order     melloy said .     it   s a big case     kresh replied .     can you imagine the consequences if we don   t solve it .     kresh hoped cinta noticed his use of the word    we .      he did not know if she was sincerely offering her cooperation  but he was determined that he was going to rope her in as thoroughly as possible  while doing what he could to keep her away from more sensitive areas of the investigation .  getting her people involved in dull  slogging  but essential spadework might be no bad thing at all .  but there was no need to be utterly transparent about it .     can your agents do some of that id and interview work .  i   ve got teams of my deputies flying in right now .  i was planning to turn some of them loose on photographing and interviewing the airport detainees  but the more bodies we have on the job  the faster it will go .  and  after all  it is your jurisdiction .  it might be smart to make sure your people are on the scene .      cinta sat down  moving slowly into the seat without taking her eyes off kresh .     we   d be delighted to help out     she said  speaking in a measured  cautious voice .     good     kresh said .  kresh was rather proud that he had thought of using the sss for all the grunt work on the case .  not that processing the people at the transit center was makework  far from it .  he really did need to know who was trying to leave the island .     there   s every chance that someone at the transport center was at the reception and saw or heard something  perhaps without even being aware of it .  for that matter  i wouldn   t be surprised if the perpetrator is out there with the rest of the stranded passengers .         that would be pretty sloppy work     cinta said .     sure  the killer would want to get off the island  but wouldn   t he or she have found a way to get off without being caught .  hell  all you have to do to escape this island is disguise yourself as a rustback .      the cheap shot about rustbacks annoyed kresh  but he didn   t allow himself to show it .     you   re right  except that the killer  or killers  weren   t expecting grieg to be found so soon .  they went to some trouble to insure that he wouldn   t be .  if his body had been discovered in the morning  i   d agree with you that the killer would be long gone by now .  as it is  maybe  maybe  we were able to shut down the transit system in time .        but what good does the killer being there do if you don   t know who the killer is .     cinta asked .     maybe a lot .  maybe we   ll get lucky and the killer will make a slip or panic .  but even if the killer doesn   t reveal himself  or herself  and manages to slip through our fingers for now  having a photo and name and address  even a false one  could be damned useful later on .         hmmph .  yeah .  your killer might be the only one with a phony name .  maybe .  do you expect any sort of trouble from the people out at the transport center .     cinta asked .     well  infernals aren   t used to being told where they can and can   t go     kresh said .     they might get a bit unruly .  we   re going to need all the help we can get in crowd control and air patrol operations to keep things under control .        you planning on my people being anything but traffic cops and crowd control in all this .     melloy asked  a little of her old assertiveness showing through .     oh  of course     kresh lied .  if and when he had cleared her of complicity in the plot  then maybe he would give her people something a bit more challenging .  but not just yet .     i want  i need  your agents involved in every phase of this thing .      so i can have them tied down and where my people can keep an eye on them .     but right now we have several hundred people to deal with at the transport centers  maybe a couple of thousand .  we   re going to need all the help we can get to sort through them all .  i can   t tell you what else we   re going to do because i haven   t figured it out yet .     cinta grunted and folded her arms in front of her chest .       you just see that you keep me posted .  no more surprises  all right .        absolutely     kresh said  having not the slightest intention of holding himself to that .  devray had finally given him the huthwitz lead from ranger resato .  that he planned to sit on for a while .  the one ranger who happened to be killed guarding the governor  the ranger wherein cinta melloy had known his name without being told  just happened to be a ranger involved in the rustbacking trade that the governor wanted to shut down .  that was just too much of a coincidence .  there had to be a connection .  but damnation  when would he get a chance to deal with huthwitz .  suddenly kresh realized just how exhausted he was .  he no longer had the slightest idea what time it was  or how long he had been awake .  he wanted to keep going  to press on  but he knew that would be a mistake .  this case needed a chief investigator who could think clearly  not a muzzy headed fool playing the hero .     look  cinta     he said     i   m just about to drop dead at my desk .  i need to find a bed somewhere and get some rest .  can we meet a little later  when i   m awake .     cinta nodded .     of course .  you   ve been up all night .  but there is one other thing .  something that seems incredibly suspicious to me  but no one else seems to be bothered by it .        what   s that .        the empty house .  grieg was all alone in this  this palace .  no one else at all .  doesn   t that strike you as odd .        this tierlaw verick fellow was here     kresh said .     but there   s nothing unusual about there only being one person in a house .  if anything  verick spending the night is the unusual thing .         let me understand this     melloy said .      apart from verick and the governor  and the assassin  there was no one in the house .  in a house this large .  there were no other humans at all .  just robots .        that   s right     kresh said  a trifle bewildered .     what is it you   re getting at .        what i   m getting at is that there wasn   t a room to be had in limbo last night .  the city was packed to the rafters  and yet grieg   s enormous residence stands empty on the night he wanted to play the host .  if that happened back on baleyworld  and the host woke up dead  i   d be damned suspicious .  i   d think someone had arranged to keep the place empty so the killers would have a clear field .     kresh frowned .     that honestly never occurred to me .  sharing your home  giving up some of your own turf  is a very difficult and unusual thing for a spacer to do .  we value our privacy very highly .  probably too highly .  i suppose from the settler point of view  it does seem very implausible .  not to a spacer  though .  we   ll feed you dinner  care for you if you   re hurt or sick  rescue you from danger  defend your civil rights to the hilt .  we   ll even put you up for the night  someplace besides our own home .        hmmph .  some things about you spacers i never will get used to .  i   m sure you   re right  but it still seems more than a little odd to me .         well  it couldn   t do any harm at all to look into the point     kresh said .     maybe you   re right .  maybe grieg was used to a house full of people and last night was the aberration .         mind if i take enough people off traffic duty to check it out .     cinta asked .  kresh hesitated a moment .  sandbagged .  she had set him up and knocked him right over .  the last thing in the world he wanted to do was let her choose what part of the investigation to head up .  suppose this was the very point she needed to muddy up in order to protect herself .  how grieg   s choice of slumber party guests could possibly matter  kresh could not imagine  but never mind that .  the problem was he could not see any way of saying no to cinta without flatly stating that he didn   t trust her .  and he was far too tired to deal with the twelve kinds of hell that would be sure to kick up .     no  cinta     he said .     you go right ahead .     but even as he spoke  he found himself wondering if he had just made the first big mistake of the investigation .       fredda leving pointed her finger at another party guest and watched him disappear .  it was a strange sort of game  but one that needed playing .  she rubbed her eyes and sighed .     that   s as many as i can get in this pass .  run it back again  donald     she said .     let   s try that sequence again .     the integrator   s three dimensional images scrolled back to the beginning again and started over .  fredda sat and watched as the party guests started to filter into the residence .  by now well over half of the people at the party were missing .  every time fredda or donald or the computer managed to identify a person  they would eliminate his or her image trail from the integrator   s event sequence for the evening .  the imagery integrator was a settler machine that was a close cousin to the simglobe  designed to take in all manner of visual images and combine then into a single three dimensional whole .  four dimensions  if you counted time .  and the more people that were missing from its images  the better .  they needed to know if there had been anyone who did not belong at the reception  and what better way to do that than by eliminating those who did .  it was a shame that the settlers    access recorder system wasn   t useful in these circumstances .  it could automatically record comings and goings of each person  and identify each against its access authority list  but such systems were designed to work in more orderly settings than a massive reception .  even the sophisticated access recorder in use at the residence had been overwhelmed by the crush of bodies at the reception .  too many people  too many strangers  too many people coming in too quickly .  they had fed the integrator everything  the architectural plans of the residence  all the news video and   d imagery taken the night of the assassination  detailed   d and   d still images of the residence   s interior and exterior  still pictures of all the guests  and whatever other information donald had been able to get together .  the integrating simulator had swallowed it all up  and used the masses of data to produce the computer model that fredda and donald had been watching for entirely too long .  the integrator could present any view of the interior or exterior of the residence  at any scale  as seen from any point in time in thirty two hours  the time period under investigation .  it could run its imagery forward or backwards at any speed  or freeze it at any point .  it could fill in the blanks from one image by lifting them from another .  if  for example  it saw a given man was wearing blue pants and red shoes in a full view from the front  but noted he had a bald spot in a view from the rear where his legs were obscured  it would add both data points to the full image bank of the individual .  given enough information  the integrator could present the man at any time  from any angle  or subtract him from the scene and let you see the woman behind him who had been hidden from the cameras in real life  producing a view of her built up from her image bank .  the integrator could not  of course  show what she had been doing while hidden from view  but it could at least show where she had been .  indeed  much of what the integrator showed was conjectural .  not every part of the reception had been recorded .  there had been any number of times and places where there were no camera images  where a certain amount of guesswork was required of the operator .  that led to guessing  of course .  and guessing made you wonder .  what was everyone up to when they were out of view .  and that was the question that made it all turn paranoid .  subject x was seen leaving room a and then appeared forty seconds later appearing in room b  with no video imagery of what went on in the hallway between .  had x moved in the straight line direction  as seemed reasonable  or had x done something nefarious the moment he or she was out of camera view .  was forty seconds an unwarranted delay  or was it about as long as the trip should have taken .  was the delay caused by some fiendish part of the plot  or by a call of nature  or just a moment   s pause away from the crush of the crowd .  and was it paranoid to ask such questions .  after all  someone in that swirl of visitors had killed chanto grieg .  several someones had been involved .  somewhere in the evening  someone had to have done something that he or she would not wish to be observed  and presumably had had the sense to do it out of sight of the cameras .  somewhere in all the delays explained by innocent stops in the refresher  and chance meetings in the hallways  the acts leading up to murder were being hidden .  but where .  where in all the background clutter of people at a party were the guilty acts .  the best way to find out seemed to be eliminating all the innocent acts and examining what was left .  so here they were  erasing the innocent from the image trail  in hopes of leaving none but the guilty behind .  it was a tricky job  for the integrator images were not infallible  or even completely realistic .  if there were imagery  say  from a camera in a hallway that showed a man entering a room that had no camera  the integrator had no way of knowing what the man did once he was out of camera range .  absent instruction from the operator  the simulacrum of the man in the room would just stand there  in the center of the room  a motionless wooden doll  until such time as the hall cameras picked him up reentering the hall .  then the simulacrum would move  stiff leggedly  toward the door  melding into real life imagery as the man came back into camera view .  even stranger were the half people that flickered into existence here and there  half seen arms or legs or torsos that the integrator was unable to link to any specific person .  it did not exclude them until told to do so .  half of the images fredda was seeing were at least in part imaginary .  the integrator didn   t care .  given the appropriate data  it was quite happy to present hypothetical  or quite spurious  imagery .  it could be instructed to run various versions of events  running through all the possibilities of who went where during the moments they were not actually in view of a camera .  even the hypothetical images were useful in sorting out the possibilities .  by now  with more than half the guests accounted for  and thus eliminated  the images were getting more and more surreal .  people were talking to other people who weren   t there anymore .  what had been tight clumps of people were now isolated twos and threes .  computers and robots should have been able to do this job  but no robot or computer had ever been good enough at pattern recognition  at being able to see the whole when looking at only a part .  even their thousands of years of development were no match for the billions of years of human evolution .  that was why fredda had drawn this duty along with donald .  she could see the bit of chin  or the fleeting  partially obscured profile  and say it was the same face she had seen twenty minutes before  allowing the integrator to connect two image sequences as one person .  better still  fredda knew lots of people    and was able to identify any number of blurry faces the integrator was not able to match up with its still image identity file .  it was strange to see it all this way  from this godlike angle  but it was a remarkably useful way to sort out the movements of this person and that .  stranger still to see her own image and eliminate it  to see alvar kresh and make him vanish .  it made her doubt his reality  and her own .  but should she make alvar vanish .  after all  he was the one who found the body .  that in and of itself was a trifle suspicious .  donald had been a few steps behind him at the time .  kresh had not been alone in grieg   s room for long  but suppose it had been for long enough  and even though it was a point open to interpretation  you could read the fact that grieg had offered no struggle as a hint that he had been killed by someone he knew .  .  .  it seemed absurd  and yet someone had killed grieg  and as of right now the rest of the universe only had kresh   s word for it that he had found grieg dead .  no .  it couldn   t be .  not kresh .  the man might be stubborn and infuriating as hell  but there was no more honorable man on the planet .  it was absurd to think that a man of his character could have done it .  she knew him too well to believe such things .  she was reluctant to admit such a thing  even to herself  but she liked him too well to believe such a thing .  fredda glanced at donald  seated impassively at the integrator   s control panel .  did fretful  disturbing thoughts like that flit through his mind .  was he troubled by such delusional nonsense .  she  fredda  ought to know .  she had  after all  designed his brain  his mind  herself .  but that meant nothing at a time like this .  the short  sky blue robot seemed unflappable  but what lurked under the surface .  was he intelligent enough to have doubts  to see that the universe was not the well ordered  every peg in its proper hole place that the three laws would make it seem .  he was a police robot  after all  and knew as well as any robot in existence what sort of madness humans were capable of .     who do you think did it  donald .     she asked  more or less on impulse .     who killed chanto grieg .     donald had been watching the image playback  but now he turned toward fredda and regarded her with an unreadable stare for a full ten seconds before he replied .     it is impossible for me to say     he replied .     there is so much information already in our hands  and yet so little of it appears to be useful data .  we are forced to eliminate meaningless information as a first step toward the truth .         but you are more familiar with the case data than anyone .  i know you suspect caliban and prospero  but leave them to one side for a moment .  who is your prime human suspect .     donald swiveled his head back and forth in an imitation of the human gesture of shaking his head to report uncertainty .       i am afraid i do not  and cannot  have an opinion on that .  before i could get to who  i would have to deal with why  to the question of motive .  and i am simply incapable of imagining anyone wishing the  the death of a human being .  i have seen death  i have witnessed the evidence of murder .  i know there must  therefore  be motives for murder .  but even though i know such things are real  i still cannot imagine them .         hmmph .  strange     fredda said .     very strange .  humans are certainly capable of all sorts of remarkable delusions  but not that particular one .  sometimes i forget just how different robots are from humans .         i don   t think i have ever forgotten that fact  even for a moment     donald said .     shall we return to the task at hand .        hmmm .  yes  of course .      fredda turned back to the integrator and watched the silent dance of the simulacra .  they could have put sound in  of course  but that would do little more than add to the confusion at this point .  wait a second .  confusion .  confusion .  they were missing the point of all the confusion .     donald .  go to the time reference five minutes before the attack on tonya welton  and delete tonya weltlon  the attackers  the sss intervention  along with all the people we   ve identified so far .  let   s get rid of the diversion and see if we can spot what they were trying to divert us from .         yes  ma   am     donald said  manipulating the controls .  he reset the system once again  running back to the proper moment in time .  the image reappeared  affording the strange sight of all the bystanders reacting to the fight that was not happening .  it was like watching an audience without being able to see the play .  the little clumps of people turned and pointed at nothing at all in the center of the room  scuttled backwards to avoid the brawlers who were not there .  fredda pointed at two or three of the largest groups of bystanders .  they were clearly the ones being diverted  no sense in watching them .     get rid of those people there     she said .     and those  and those .      people vanished wholesale .  fredda let the sequence keep going .  the fight had drawn people into the room from other parts of the residence  but she was looking for the people who weren   t drawn by the noise .  fredda watched until the crowds gathered  had watched the now nonexistent action  and had begun to drift away .     freeze it there  donald .  mark on those people  those  and those .  and that clump over by the door .  all right now .  now  backtrack to five minutes before the fight  and delete all of the people just marked from the image trail .  i only want to see the ones who weren   t drawn to the fight .     the   d image blanked for a moment  then came back up on the same scene minutes before the attack .  there was no one left in the grand hall except caliban and prospero .  donald was showing his prejudices again .  both caliban and prospero had been in sight of one video camera or another throughout the entire evening  and beyond breaking up the fight  neither of them had done anything more suspicious than chat politely with the other guests .  that  clearly  was not enough to satisfy donald .  but she let it go .  after all  there was the bare possibility that he was even right to suspect them .  they had verick   s statement that the two robots were the last ones to see grieg alive .  but never mind that now .  fredda knew all about prospero and caliban .  she was looking for unknowns  people she could not account for .     give me an overhead view of the ground floor     fredda said .  the image of the grand hall vanished  to be replaced by a cutaway view of the entire lower level  presented so fredda was looking straight down on it from overhead .     good     she said .     have you got all our personnel deletions saved for recall .        yes  dr .  leving .  shall i run the deleted persons sequence forward from the same time mark before the fight .        in a minute  donald .  first  i want you to run it from that time with everyone still in place .  let   s see the whole picture first .         yes  ma   am .     the images cleared .  the   d image blanked for a moment  then suddenly fredda was looking down on an eddying throng of people  talking  walking  sitting  arriving  departing  arguing  laughing .  it seemed as if the entire residence were filled with people who desired nothing more than to be somewhere they were not .  everyone was on the move .  it would be almost impossible to track anyone person in all of that .  which was  no doubt  what the conspirators were counting on .  the fight started  and fredda found that her eye was pulled toward it .  people hurried in from all directions to see what was going on  and it was almost impossible to see what anyone person was doing from moment to moment .  the two men attacked tonya welton  she knocked one of them down  and was about to rush the second when the two robots stepped in and pulled them apart .  kresh and donald appeared  and kresh waded in to sort things out .  the crowd started to disperse just a little as the excitement came to an end .     all right  donald     fredda said .     stop .  reset to the previous time index and run it again  with all the personnel deletions .     donald stopped the playback and reset the system .  the vision tank dissolved in a swirl of colors and then reassembled itself to show a ghostly  empty house  with but a few faceless creatures wandering the building .  they were constructs  place holders to indicate unidentified people  their faces too blurry for computer or robot or human to know who they were .  no doubt most or even all of them could be identified with a bit more work  but that could wait .  for now they were ghosts  ghosts in the machine  faceless beings walking through a simulated landscape .  some of them vanished or reappeared now and again as they were spotted and then lost by this or that video source .  sometimes  but not always  the integrator would connect two video sequences of the same person up with animated links .  they ambled about the house  with the casual air of people with no clear goal in mind .  of course  half their motions were computerized guesses  but fredda had the feeling the integrator was guessing right .  but then .  then she saw it .  another figure  a small  slight shadow  a pale skinned  youthful looking man .  thinning hair cut a bit short  wearing rather plain clothes compared to the peacock finery that had been on display everywhere else at the residence .  there he was  hanging back  arriving two or three minutes before the fight  just a few minutes after the sss guards had obeyed the false orders to stand down .  the main entrance was unguarded  wide open .  there was something nervous  tense  about him .  but what the devil was he doing .  it was hard to read his actions with no one around him .     give me the fully populated view for a second  donald .     suddenly the pale man was surrounded by people  and his actions became clear .  he was contriving to enter the building just as a crowd of late arrivals came in  hoping  it would seem  to mix in with the crowd .  the gambit worked  he got in with the rest of the group  gaining entry just thirty seconds before the fight began .  and there .  there .     donald  freeze that .  freeze it .     she leaned in close to the image tank .     do you see it .        i see the subject you appear to be interested in glancing at his watch .        yes  but what does that say to you .        that he wondered what time it was .     no imagination .  that was why the universe needed people and not just robots .     but who would care what time it was when they were arriving at a party .  besides which  he   s a spacer .  at least he   s dressed in spacer clothes with a spacer haircut .        what of that .        spacers hardly ever wear watches .  if a spacer needs to know what time it is  he asks his robot .        are you suggesting that he is checking the time in order to synchronize his actions .  that he was timing his actions so he would arrive just prior to the staged fight .        yes  i am suggesting that .     donald turned to look again at the image  then turned back toward fredda .     it seems a great deal to read into a man glancing at his wrist     he said  a bit doubtfully .     in general  i grant you .  but not too much at all to read into this man glancing at his wrist as he sneaks into this party two minutes before a fight breaks out .  that is our man .  i   ll bet on it .  clear everyone  everyone from the image system but him and run it forward  tracking a close up view on him .     the crowds of people vanished  and the pale faced man in the dowdy clothes was alone in the integrator   s display  with no throngs of gaily dressed party goers to hide behind  no diversionary fights to hide behind  all his camouflage stripped away .  fredda watched as the slightly grainy  somewhat blurred blown up image of the man moved inside .  he made his way through the entrance  into the grand hall  and then directly out of it again  without so much as a glance at the invisible brawl that was going on .  now and again the image of him broke up a bit  with the intervening sequences linked by animation .  the effect was much more startling in close up  as the crude overenlarged images suddenly shifted into the oversimplified images of a generic man and then back again .  every time it happened  fredda   s stomach tightened a bit  fearful that they had come to the last real video image of him  and they were about to lose him altogether .  the image of the man went down a side passage  walking purposefully  a man who knew exactly where he was going and why .  no pausing at intersections or hesitating over which turning to take .  either he had been in the building at some point in the past  or he had been briefed in detail .     still not sure he makes sense as our man .     fredda asked donald .     his actions are remarkably purposeful for a casual visitor     donald conceded .     he appears to be making for the service areas at the rear of the building .     the pale man came to an unmarked door  glanced behind himself  opened it  stepped through  and closed it behind him .  fredda found herself staring at a blank door that had been closed in her face .     damn it  donald  follow him     fredda demanded .  she was so caught up in the chase that it was a real effort of will to remember that her quarry was long gone  that she was tracking nothing more than an integrator image .     one moment  ma   am .      donald worked the control panel  and then looked back up at fredda .     i   m sorry  ma   am .  that is the last of the data recorded from that location  and there were no video sources on the other side of the door .  i can show you what is on the other side of the door  but there is no point in placing the man   s simulacrum there .  there is no information at all about any other activity in that sector until the activation of the security robots .  once they were activated and deployed  they recorded that vicinity in great detail  but those records were of course destroyed with the robots .  there is no further sign of the man we have been tracking in the extant records .        why should that one spot get detailed recording from the security robots .     donald ran the integrator image forward straight through the door  revealing a downward ramp beyond it .  he ran the video image down the ramp and turned the corner at the bottom .  and there were the sprs  the sapper security robots  turned off  inert  lined up neatly .     burning stars     fredda said .     our pale faced friend came here .  hid out in the same room as the security robots .        so it would appear     donald said .     note the line of storage closets along the rear wall .  i would expect that he secreted himself in one of them .         probably     fredda said .  she stared at the image  determined to think it all through .  if pale man had come down here  then he clearly knew that the security robots were to be turned off .  the image before her showed the integrator   s best information as to the state of the robots as of that moment .  upstairs  at the same time  sheriff kresh was still sorting through the chaos after the staged attack .  when pale man came down here he would have to know that the security robots would be deployed soon afterwards .  but he would also know that the robots had been tampered with .  that they would suddenly stop working  and that the building would be wide open to him .  if pale man kept his cool  there was nothing at all to fear from being down here .  all he had to do was hide  wait until the sappers were deactivated  then come out with his blaster and   hold it .  his blaster .  there were weapon sniffers on all the entrances to the residence  and around the perimeter of the property .  fredda had no trouble believing that the security net could have missed an intruder slipping into the place .  that sort of mistake would be easy to make .  but how could the system have missed a blaster corning in .  she checked the images of pale man .  no baggy clothes or carry bag that might conceal a gun .  besides  the weapons detectors would have picked up a gun .  nothing as small as any weapon he could have been carrying would be big enough to be shielded .  no .  pale man could not possibly have been wearing one on his way in .  and therefore  therefore his blaster had been planted for him before he got in the house .  and all of a sudden fredda had a pretty damned good idea where and how .   the underground storage room that had held the sprs looked strangely different  strangely the same  in real life .  the integrator had shown an idealized version of it  pulled up from the computerized architectural plans and a few still photos  but that was only part of the strangeness .  somehow  the room looked much smaller  rather than larger  than it had through the integrator .  the real life lights were a little dimmer  and the real walls were scuffed and marked here and there in ways the sim   s walls were not .  the air was cool and a bit dank .  amazing the way reality could show up all the flaws of a simulation  flaws you had not even noticed in the sim .  but the key difference  of course  was that there were no neat rows of robots down here anymore .  there was only one  a blown out wreck  much more shot to hell than any of the sprs on the upper floors had been .  there was more to it than the damage being more severe .  the blast holes looked different as well .  but why .  why blast this one all to hell  differently and more violently than any of the others .  fredda thought she knew the answer  the answers to those puzzles .  but she could not be sure .  not yet .  not until she got a look at the fiftieth spr .  the fiftieth .  what bothered fredda was the fact that she had not even noticed that an spr was missing .  there had been fifty sprs to start with  but she had not even thought to do a count on them  until now .  now she knew there had been twenty two sprs on the upper level  and twenty seven on the ground floor .  if that information had been in her head earlier  she would have turned the place upside down to find that missing fiftieth robot .  she would have found this one  the crucial one  much sooner .  not that this one had been overlooked by anyone except fredda .  gallingly enough  search teams had even logged in the location of this one two hours ago  but they had not examined it closely .  what was one more shot up robot in a building that was full of them .  she wanted to dive right in  to take this robot apart and find the clues  the proofs  she knew were inside it .  but she resisted .  suppose she set to work now and smudged a fingerprint or something .  no  thank you .  there was no point in making any more mistakes .  it had been frustrating enough to have that imaginary door in the integrator simulation close on her face .  to track the suspect this far and then come up with nothing  that would be slamming into a wall .  it was starting to dawn on her just how much patience police work involved .  so  do it right  do it carefully .  the clues in this room might be the core of the case .  don   t ruin them .  let the robots do their job first .  then she could do hers .     donald     fredda said .     i want you to call in a full team of crime scene robots .  i want this robot and this entire room  and all the storage closets  scanned down to the maximum resolution .  our friend mr .  pale man was hiding in here  and he must have left some traces .        that is by no means certain     donald said .     it would be most useful  but we cannot count on it .        but he must have left something behind     fredda protested .     a bit of hair  a fingerprint  something .      or was it possible that he could have left no trace at all behind .  fredda suddenly realized just how little she knew about the sort of clues she was counting on the robots to find .     it is possible the crime scene team will find something     donald said     but bear in mind that if our suspect took a few simple precautions there would be nothing for us to find .      precautions .  fredda was suddenly confident of her ground .  forensics and clues she did not know about  but people she understood .  she already had a pretty solid feel for pale man .  just watching him on the integrator had told her a lot .     this is not a man who takes all the simple precautions     she said .     this is a man who makes mistakes .  if he hadn   t acted so nervous when we first spotted him  if he hadn   t made the slip of looking at his watch  we might have lost him in the shuffle .  instead he brought attention to himself .  if he had at least pretended to be interested in the fight  we might have erased him from the image trail along with everyone else who came to watch it .        and from those points you make the assumption that he would leave traces for us to find here .     donald said .     oh  it   s no assumption     fredda said .     it   s a certainty .  he left something behind .      she had no logical reason for believing that  but logic was no more than a tool of reason  and far from the only tool at that .  gut reactions had their place as well .     trust me  donald      she said again  staring down at the burned out wreck of the security robot .     this boy left a calling card .      normalcy .  the need for normalcy was painfully obvious .  caliban knew it was so  and yet  somehow  it was difficult to act on that knowledge .  still  the demands of the day  the strictures of routine  helped a great deal .  he had his job to do .  in theory  both caliban and prospero worked as field representatives for fredda leving  observing the behavior and actions of new law robots  and reporting it to dr .  leving   s office .  but their duties went far beyond those tasks .  they were roving troubleshooters  tasked to find problems that slowed down work and resolve them .  in practice  prospero was worse than useless in such work .  he was far more likely to urge the new law robots to set down their tools and make for valhalla than he was to sort out a job site scheduling dispute .  these days  prospero spent most of his time with his internal hyperwave system shut off so he would not be disturbed  or tracked .  he liked to hide out from the world in an abandoned office somewhere under the streets of limbo  reading and writing and studying  developing his philosophy .  caliban  on the other hand  found that he was good at the job .  he understood at least something of both the human and robotic point of view  and could often bring the two sides together .  he had waded into the middle of any number of disputes between humans and new law robots  and  for that matter  between robot and robot  struggling to find the common ground .  but there were times  be it confessed  when he wondered if new law robots were worthy of freedom .  for the past two weeks  caliban had been working with a team of new law robots engaged in the refurbishment of an old windshifter force field coil  a massive  powerful  and intricate device .  its repair required careful planning and the coordination of many steps .  the robot team was working without any direct human supervision  and every robot on the team was enthusiastic about the job .  unfortunately  it seemed to caliban that every new law robot on the job had come up with a different better idea as to how the job should be done .  there were so many ideas to sort through that it seemed unlikely that the job itself would ever be done .  it was up to caliban to convince the robots that better was often the enemy of good  and that seeking perfection could mean accomplishing nothing .  it was frustrating  at times  to see the trivial uses to which the new law robots put their freedom .  fredda leving had meant them to advance  to move in new directions  not waste time around a conference table  bickering once again over the most efficient way to retune a stasis suppression coil .  he had agreed last night to come in well ahead of schedule this morning  in hopes of resolving a few of the issues at hand .     come  friends     caliban said again .     let us try again .  cannot we agree on this very minor point .        how can you dismiss maximized efficiency as a minor point .     dextran    demanded .     and what good is theoretical efficiency when your enhancement routines will leave the system unstable .     shelkcas   asked .     the enhancement routines are stable     dextran replied     or at least they would be in a properly normalized field environment .         please .     caliban interjected .     the normalization issue is resolved .  there is no need to reopen it .  friends  once again we face the same old choice .  we can solve the problem  or we can have the argument  but we cannot do both .  dextran  your enhancement system will work  and we can use it  so long as we do not press for greater than ninety nine plus percent efficiency .  is a half percent improvement in efficiency truly worth major reliability degradation .        perhaps not     dextran admitted .     perhaps the enhancement system alone will         caliban .  caliban .     a voice  a human voice  and one he recognized  calling from the outer office .  but what would bring gubber anshaw here .     excuse me  friends .  if we are resolved on this issue  perhaps you could move to the next point on the agenda while i step out .     caliban rose  crossed the room  opened the door  and stepped through .  there was gubber  plainly agitated and upset .  caliban closed the door behind him .  there was something in dr .  anshaw   s face that said his news would be best discussed in private .     caliban .  thank the stars you are here .  what the devil are we going to do .        do .  do about what .        grieg  of course .  governor grieg .  they   re sure to suspect tonya .  caliban  you were there .  you   re a witness .  she didn   t do anything .  you can tell them that .        dr .  anshaw  you confuse me     caliban said  increasingly alarmed .  all of prospero   s assurances that there would be no trouble  no danger  were clearly worth as little as caliban had feared .     what about last night .  what about the governor .        haven   t you heard .  don   t you know .  grieg is dead .  he was killed last night just after      but caliban was already gone before anshaw could finish speaking .  if things were uncertain enough that anshaw feared tonya welton might be a suspect  then caliban had no doubt whatsoever that he was in danger as well .  he had to get away from where he could be found .  get away fast .   shelabas quellam was flushed with excitement .  governor .  he was going to be governor .  importance  power  respect .  all his .  all his .  but there was so much he had to do to get ready .  what to do first .  a speech .  yes .  he should write a speech for when he took over .  something along the lines of sorrow and courage  and the need to move forward  yes  that would be about the right approach .  he sat down at his comm console and settled in to start dictating  but then he noticed the status board was indicating all sorts of pending mail waiting for him in his office system  some of it official  and several days old .  shelabas had never much bothered keeping close track of all his incoming correspondence .  his robots read it for him  and wrote up summaries about the things he needed to deal with .  but  come to think of it  he hadn   t even checked their summaries in a while .  he really ought to check it all now .  there might be something in there of vital interest to the new governor .  shelabas quellam scrolled the pending mail list  and then let out a little gasp .  there was a letter from grieg there  coded for quellam   s eyes only .  but how could that be .  but then he checked the dateline and saw that it had been waiting for him more than a week .  a week .  now that he thought of it  he could remember his robots advising him that there was urgent mail waiting for him in the system .  he had no one but himself to blame for waiting this long to check .  his hand trembling  he worked the controls and saw governor chanto grieg   s face appear on the screen  looking confident  sure of himself  very much in charge .  not a printed letter  then  but a video record .  there was something vaguely insulting about that .  you sent video letters to those who might not have the patience to deal with the written word .     greetings to you  legislator     grieg   s image said .  it was plain to see that grieg was speaking in formal mode  for the official record .  this was not a personal letter  it was a policy statement .     it is with some reluctance that i came to the decision i must now report to you  and to you alone .  as you know  i have long believed that the laws of succession to my office are excessively complex and could lead to great uncertainty in a crisis .  for that reason  i named you  the man fated to succeed if i were removed from office by legal means  to be my successor if i were to die in office .     as you are no doubt aware  there are currently moves afoot to impeach or recall me .  as you may not be aware  sheriff kresh  commander devray  and security captain melloy have all recently warned me of threats to my life .  thus  my removal from office  either by legal means or through my death  becomes increasingly more likely .  i find that i can no longer treat it as a remote theoretical possibility  but as a probable event .     i can no longer treat the principle of unified succession as being of paramount importance .  while important in its own right  it cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the vital reforms  the diplomatic and economic policies upon which this government is embarked .  it is my opinion that should you succeed me  the pressure for you to call early elections would be insurmountable .  it is my further opinion that elections under such circumstances would almost certainly result in a government that would set policies likely to result in planetary disaster .     for all of these reasons  i hereby inform you that i am withdrawing you from the designation  in favor of a new name .  after suitable discussion with the new designate  i plan to announce the new name publicly .  this i expect to transpire within a few weeks .  out of respect for you  for our long association  and for your office as president of the legislative council  i deemed it wise to provide you with early notification of this policy .     with deep regret and apologies for any distress this decision might cause you  i will say good bye .     the screen showed grieg   s authenticator seal  and then went blank .  shelabas quellam stared at the blank display in slack jawed shock .  he was not the designate .  he was not the governor .  he was nothing  nobody again .  but wait just a moment .  suppose grieg had not named a new designate before he died .  as shelabas recalled  the old designation remained in force until the new designation was made .  for a mad instant  he considered erasing the letter  destroying all record of it  and declaring himself the governor at once .  but no .  there would be copies placed with all the proper authorities .  destroying his copy could do no good  and would only throw suspicion on him  if he was not suspected of the crime already .  he stood up suddenly  his heart pounding .  grieg   s murder .  if no new designate had been named  shelabas quellam was going to be a prime suspect the moment copies of grieg   s letter were found .  so shelabas quellam was not the governor  and would not be  if grieg had indeed named a new designate .  shelabas quellam was simply a man who had a first rate motive for the murder of the governor .  and soon  very soon  everyone in the world was going to know it .   a half hour after running out on anshaw  caliban had reached a place of safety  a secret rustback escape office in an unused tunnel far below limbo city center .  the office had an unregistered  and  it was to be hoped  untraceable  hyperwave set .  he was all but certain no human knew about the hideout .  it meant he could monitor the news reports without fear of being taken  and have a chance to think .  the news nets were full of grieg   s death  and little else  and soon told him all he needed to know .  it required little imagination on caliban   s part to think he and prospero might be suspects of some sort in the case  and with good reason .  caliban had been pursued by alvar kresh before  and he had no wish to repeat the experience .  he had to call prospero .  caliban was the only robot on the planet of inferno who was obliged to use a comm center in order to place a call .  that was for the very good reason that every other robot had a full hyperwave comm system built in .  caliban had been built for a laboratory experiment  and keeping him cut off from communications with the outside world had been part of the experiment .  he could have arranged to have hyperwave equipment installed long ago  but caliban had many very good reasons for not wishing to be turned off for even as brief a time as it would take to plug in the gear .  there were too many things that could happen to him while he was switched off  too many things had happened to him when he had been switched off before .  there were too many humans  and robots  who did not wish him well .  normally  not having a hyperwave link was not much of a disadvantage .  right now  he needed desperately to speak with prospero  and he did not know where prospero   s hidden study cell was .  prospero  too  had faced a number of threats in his day .  but that did not matter .  prospero had long ago provided caliban with a covert audio only hyperwave link code that would connect to prospero   s office without being traceable .  he punched the comm code and spoke as soon as the connection was made .  prospero never spoke to anyone via hyperwave until he knew who it was .     prospero  this is caliban .        friend caliban     prospero   s voice said through the speaker .     we must meet  most urgently .        i agree the need is urgent     said caliban .     this is a terrible crisis .  but i feel that merely meeting will accomplish nothing .        we had a plan as to what to do if things went wrong     prospero said .     it is time for us to flee .        we never expected things to go this wrong     caliban objected .     i have no doubt your escape route would serve quite well under normal circumstances  but these are not normal circumstances .  if we decamp now  we will have every human with a badge on the planet after us before nightfall .  i have been tracked by alvar kresh before .  i  for one  have no desire to be hunted again .  it was only by the greatest good fortune that i survived the last time .        the planet is large  and i have vast experience in covert movement     prospero said .     you have vast experience in arranging covert movement     caliban said .     you yourself have never even been off the island of purgatory .  besides  there is the question of corollary damage .  if we were to flee  how many fugitive new law robots will be destroyed as a consequence .  how many of their hiding places will be exposed during the search for us .        there is something in what you say     prospero said    also bear in mind that if we flee  we will be instantly perceived as the prime suspects in the governor   s death .  that would do tremendous damage to the cause of the new law robots .  you have professed many times how nothing was more important to you than the rights  and the survival  of new law robots .  if we flee  we may well be dooming all new law robots everywhere .         your points are well taken     prospero said .     but if we do not flee  what are we to do .        we must turn ourselves in .  submit to their questions .  cooperate .  we will be exposing ourselves to grave danger  but  in my judgment  far less danger than in fleeing  and we will not be endangering the new law robots .     prospero did not reply for a moment .  caliban could not blame him for hesitating .  the two evils they were forced to choose between were daunting  to say the least .  at last  the new law robot spoke .     agreed     he said .     but how are we to do it .  i do not wish to walk into a trap  or surrender myself to some sss agent or ranger who has been longing for the chance to blast a hole in a new law robot .     caliban had anticipated that question .  he could see only one chance for them  a solution that might well be nothing more than a somewhat less elaborate form of suicide than fleeing purgatory .     there is a robot     he said .     one that i believe we ought to contact .  i believe it is the safest way .  if he agrees to take us in without harming us  he will keep his word without trickery .        is this robot a friend of yours .        oh  no     caliban said .     on the contrary .  if there is any robot in the universe i could count as an enemy  it is donald     .        kresh   s robot .  why contact him .     prospero asked .     because there are times     caliban said     when it is wiser to trust an enemy than a friend .      it was not the most tactful of remarks  under the circumstances .  but caliban felt no compunction about saying those words to his closest friend .  after all  it was entirely possible that friend prospero had gotten caliban in trouble so deep that not even his deadliest enemy could save him .   donald     banked the aircar slightly more to the east as he flew toward the agreed rendezvous point .  he was flying faster than he would have dared if there were a human onboard  but time was short  and he could fly as fast as he wanted since there was no risk of first law violation .  a scant twelve hours had passed since grieg   s body had been discovered  though it seemed even to donald that a lifetime had passed since then .  donald had need to hurry .  he was due back at the residence for the briefing session with sheriff kresh and the others .  but this was an opportunity he could not forgo .  accepting the surrender of caliban and prospero surely took precedence .  he did not know what to make of it all  but that did not matter .  he would meet their conditions and bring them in secretly  without consulting with anyone else .  it was not necessary to understand why the two pseudo robots wished to surrender to him  personally .  it was enough to know they wished to surrender .  it would be the greatest possible satisfaction to take the two of them into custody .  there .  he was at the coordinates caliban had specified .  donald circled once  low and slow  over the gravel strewn open field  making sure those on the ground could see him .  no surprises .  he brought the aircar into a hover thirty meters above the ground and then brought it down vertically  a slow  careful landing .  donald found himself moving with elaborate care  concentrating on the importance of not moving suddenly .  strange  very strange  to be considering the possibility that two robots  even pseudo robots  might have lured him here as part of some trap .  there was nothing to prevent them from greeting donald with a blaster shot between the eyes .  nor  donald realized with surprise  was there anything preventing him from dispatching them .  there was nothing at all in the three laws to prevent one robot from destroying another .  nothing at all about a robot wielding a blaster  or even firing it  so long as the robot did not fire at a human .  were the two of them out there  hiding in the scrubby line of trees that surrounded the clearing  wondering if he  donald      were about to charge out of the aircar  guns blazing .  absurd nonsense .  just because there was no prohibition against a thing  that did not render it plausible or sensible .  a strange point to consider .  it was just the sort of argument used to defend caliban .  donald got up out of the pilot   s seat  opened the hatch of the aircar  and stepped out onto the ground without giving way to any further nonsense .  there .  at the edge of the clearing .  the two pseudo robots  caliban and prospero  the one tall and red  the other shorter and jet black .  they moved forward cautiously  and it did not escape donald   s notice that they both kept their hands in plain sight at all times .  donald offered no greeting or salutation  but instead launched directly into formal procedure  using the formula they had negotiated via hyperwave link .      as per our agreement  i hereby remand both of you into the custody of the hades sheriff s department  seconded to the governor   s rangers .  you are therefore submitted to the authority of the sheriff and his duly designated deputies  as well as to the authority of the governor   s rangers .  so long as you do not resist such authority  and do not attempt to escape  you will not be harmed  punished  or destroyed without due process .      but what was due process in such a case .  donald did not know .  did anyone .  and could he really make such promises when he had not informed sheriff kresh that he was making this arrest .     do you understand .     he asked the two pseudorobots .  it was a most strange moment .  when else  in all of history  had one robot in effect arrested two other robots  or near robots  for murder .     i understand     prospero said .     as do i     said caliban .     then come     donald said  gesturing for them to go into the aircar .  caliban and prospero walked past him  and through the aircar hatch .  donald followed behind  climbing aboard and closing the hatch behind him .  the two of them had seated themselves in the passenger seats .  donald took his place at the controls and began preparations for takeoff .  it was over .  he had them .  he had to get back .  he would be barely in time for the briefing as it was .  he knew he should lift off immediately  without delay .  but the empty formalism of taking them into custody was not enough .  it was anticlimactic  unsatisfying .  it did not answer the central question of the case .  and donald  as befitted a police robot  had a most powerful sense of curiosity .  he turned around in his seat and faced prospero and caliban .  there was of course nothing  nothing at all to be read in their posture or their faces .  donald found that disturbing  for some reason .  he had always been able to see something in a suspect   s face .  but then  suspects were humans  not robots .  perhaps that was the trouble .  these two were neither one nor the other .  they were not true robots  but they were far from being human either .  something in between .  something less  and perhaps  donald conceded  something more  than either .  but none of that mattered now .  there was only one thing that donald needed to know .     did you kill chanto grieg .     donald asked  forcing the bald question out into the world .  kill .  kill .  he was asking beings very like himself  very much like robots  beings built by the same fredda leving who had created donald himself  if they had murdered a human being .  the very thought of it was enough to disrupt his cognitive function for a moment .  but donald was a police robot  and used to thoughts of violence .  he knew that these two did not have the true robot   s inability to lie  but that did not matter .  he still needed to ask .  he needed to hear the answer  true or false  in their voices .     did you kill chanto grieg  or were the two of you part of any plot to kill him .        no     caliban said  speaking for the two of them after a moment   s hesitation .     we did not .  we had nothing whatever to do with his death  and had no foreknowledge of it .  we did not meet with him so we could kill him .        then what was your purpose .     caliban paused another moment  and looked again at prospero before he spoke .  and suddenly there was something readable in his manner  in his actions .  it was the look of someone about to take a step from which there was no turning back  of someone launching themselves off into the abyss with no way of knowing what waited down below .     we met with him     caliban said     so we could blackmail him .             ottley bissal     donald said .  a grainy blowup of a still image from the integrator sequence appeared on the left side of the main display screen .  a sharp  clear   d mug shot image popped into being on the right side .  there was no doubt it was the same man .      as dr .  leving predicted  bissal did indeed leave a calling card behind  so to speak .      donald was standing by the screen at one end of a conference table  addressing fredda  sheriff kresh  and commander devray .  about fourteen hours had passed since kresh had discovered the body  and about three since fredda had found the destroyed spr robot in the lowerlevel storage room .  fredda felt utterly exhausted  and knew that no one else was doing much better .  kresh had caught a quick nap  and devray probably had too .  but no one was going to be doing much sleeping for a while .  donald was the only one of them at his best      the crime scene robots recovered multiple fingerprints     donald went on     along with hairs and flecks of skin  from the interior of one of the storage closets in the room where the security robots were held .  it is clear that bissal secreted himself in that closet for some time  long enough that he shed several hairs and several flecks of dandruff and other dead skin .  from these we recovered dna samples that provided a definitive match with bissal   s employment file .  the fingerprint evidence from the door frame of the closet door provided independent corroboration of this identification .        all right     said justen devray .     the guy in the closet was ottley bissal .  so who the hell is ottley bissal .        that     said donald     is the question we have been working to answer since the forensic identity team gave us a name  about half an hour ago .  we have made very rapid progress  mainly because every law enforcement service on the planet seems to have had an extensive file on bissal .        wonderful     kresh said .     that means everyone is going to wonder why we didn   t do anything about him before he killed the governor .  go on  donald .  what was in the files .        ottley bissal     donald said  reading off the file .     single  never married  age twenty seven standard years .  born and raised in a lower class area of the city of hades .  limited education .  low general aptitude shown on a number of evaluative tests taken at school .  notations from various schoolteachers and counselors to the effect that he was a disruptive child and a low achiever .  once out of school  he worked various odd jobs with long stretches of nonemployment or nonregistered employment in between .  few known associates or friends .         the classic loser loner  it sounds like     said devray .     i take it there were a few brushes with the law .     kresh asked .     yes  sir .  many arrests  some indictments  but only a few convictions .  there seem to be two major categories of offense to which he was prone  street brawling and petty theft .  he was granted a suspended sentence for his first assault conviction six years ago .  four years ago  he served three months time in the hades city jail for theft .     as a second time offender  he was required to obtain employment upon release and hold a job for no less than an accumulated total of five years .  with discharges for cause from various jobs  and bouts of unemployment  he has only accumulated three years of employment thus far .  his parole officer rates his progress as    unsatisfactory .            i   m not real clear on the business about a job     fredda said .     how does holding a job make sense as part of punishment for assault .        well  if you were in law enforcement  it would make a great deal of sense      kresh said .     the average formal unemployment rate on inferno is ninety percent .  only ten percent of the population have a full time occupation for which they receive significant compensation .  no one needs to work in order to live  not with robots taking care of us .  but there are people  like those of us around this table  who need to work for other  psychological  reasons .  work is what gives people like us satisfaction  or maybe a big part of our reason for being .     a fair number of the other ninety percent  say half of them  stay just as busy as we workers do  but are busy with things that might not be considered    jobs .      art  or music  or gardening  or sex .  most nearly all  of the rest of the unemployed don   t really do much of anything but let the robots take care of them .  harmless drones .  maybe they amuse themselves by sleeping a lot  or by shopping  or by watching entertainments or playing games .  maybe they are vaguely discontented .  maybe they   re bored and depressed .  maybe they love each and every day of life .  no one really knows .  i wouldn   t want to be one of them  and i don   t think much of them  but at least they don   t do any harm .     but that leaves us with the leftovers .  the ones who have no work they love  no consuming interest  and no capacity for accepting passive inactivity .  troublemakers .  mostly male  mostly uneducated  mostly young and restless .  bissal fits the profile of the people who commit  what is it  donald  ninety five percent .        that is approximately correct     donald said .     close enough .  people like bissal commit ninety five percent of the violent crime on inferno .  compared to settlers  we have very short jail sentences here  for all but the most serious offenses  and leaving a bored troublemaker to rot in jail for years didn   t seem to make much sense anyway .  so the powers that be remembered a very old saying about idle hands and the devil   s playthings  and passed a law .         the idea is     devray said     if you   re forced to have a job  then there is at least a hope that you will become interested enough in the work  or at least be kept busy and made tired enough by it  so you won   t be bored and energetic enough to commit fresh crimes .  and it works fairly well .  people find out that doing something is more satisfying and interesting than being bored and angry .      devray nodded toward the report donald was reading .     it doesn   t sound like it   s worked on bissal  though .        well  yes and no  unfortunately     donald said .     what do you mean .     kresh asked .     what sort of work did he do when he did work .        at first he held a number of jobs wherein he seems to have done very little work at all  not exactly the intent of the criminal employment act .  most of his jobs seem to have consisted of little more than watching robots do the actual labor .  he seems to have been discharged from a number of these positions for absenteeism .  then  for a time  he did jobs that entailed unskilled work unsuitable for a robot .        what the hell sort of work is beneath a robot but suited to a human .     fredda asked .     no offense  donald  but it seems to me infernals stick robots with all sorts of silly  useless demeaning tasks .  i can   t imagine anything they wouldn   t make a robot do  especially anything that a human would agree to do .        your point is well taken .  however  there are a number of unskilled or semi skilled tasks that are unsuited to robotic labor  mainly because of the first law .  certain forms of security work  for example .  a guard must be able to shoot his gun if need be  and a guard that a thief would have no compunction against shooting would be of limited use .     other jobs would require robots to be so highly specialized in order to meet a job situation that comes up so rarely that it is not worth designing and manufacturing specialized robots for the task .  certain seafaring jobs  such as deep sea fishing  for example  entail a small risk of falling overboard .  robots sink .  it is certainly possible to build robots that float and yet are robust enough to survive salt air and the other hazards of a maritime environment  but it is far easier and cheaper to hire a human and give him or her a life preserver .  there are other jobs that would be dangerous to a robot but entail little or no risk for a human .        thank you  donald  we get the point     kresh said .     so what line of work did bissal finally settle into .        mobile security work     donald said  the note of distaste in his mouth unmistakable .      armed protection of valuable shipments .        oh  hell     kresh said .     that   s perfect .  absolutely perfect .  the one sort of job we don   t like crooks taking on .        wait a second     fredda protested .     you   ve lost me again .  what   s so bad about that .     kresh held up his right hand  his thumb about a centimeter from his index finger .     it   s about that far from smuggling and contraband running     he said .     grieg   s appropriation of robots gave us a labor shortage and an illicit labor source and a need to find a way to pay for the illicit labor  all rolled into one .  smuggling and contraband are a big part of the means of payment .     devray turned to donald .     this mobile security work bissal was doing .  i realize we   re still working with very preliminary information  but is there any likelihood he got mixed up in rustbacking .        there is every likelihood     donald said .     indeed  it seems he has only worked for firms on our rustbacking watchlist .         one more time     fredda said .     sorry  but i just don   t know what you   re talking about .  what   s rustbacking got to do with anything .        you weren   t around     devray said .     one of my rangers picked up a    backer on the east coast of the great bay .  the rustbacker named a ranger involved in the rustback trade .  huthwitz .  the ranger that got killed .        so what .        so rustbacking keeps showing up in this case     kresh said .      and remember grieg was considering the idea of get ting rid of the new law robots .  that would have put the rustbackers out of business .  someone in the business would have a terrific motive for killing grieg before he cut into profits .        but wait a second     fredda said .     i think we have to assume that whoever killed grieg also killed huthwitz .  unless we had two killers wandering the residence that night .         pardon  madame     donald said .     one slight correction .  i think we have to assume the two murders are linked  whether or not the same individual carried them both out .  it may be that another member of the same team killed huthwitz .  there is a great deal of evidence of a conspiracy as it is .         even so     fredda said .     you   re talking about the rustbackers plotting to kill grieg before he could be bad for business .  but if huthwitz was on the take from the    backers  why kill him .        space only knows     kresh said .     maybe he was about to talk .  maybe he was demanding too much pay for his silence  and they thought of a way to save some money .  maybe killing huthwitz wasn   t part of the plan  and bissal was taking care of some of his own personal business on company time .  if you think one smuggler wouldn   t kill another just because they worked together  forget it .  but just in terms of parsimony  i think that we can at least start with the working theory of only one killer .  and it seems pretty clear that killer was bissal .        there is something further in bissal   s criminal record that does point to him     donald said .     i was about to come to it .  his most recent arrest .  just about nine months ago  he was picked up on the shore just south of hades and charged with the illegal transport of new law robots and tampering with robot restriction devices .  he could not make bail and thus served a full month in jail before his lawyers managed to get the charges withdrawn  according to the court record    for lack of evidence .      however  the arrest report indicates a strong case against bissal .     kresh grunted .     so either his lawyers were better than what a low class hood should have had  or else someone paid someone off .  or both .  except they didn   t want him on the loose so they didn   t pay his bail .  it suggests someone was taking care of him  but not out of the goodness of their hearts .        yes  sir .  but there is one other interesting point .  the arresting officer on the case was one ranger emoch huthwitz .        huthwitz .     justen said .     so there   s your motive .         motive .     fredda said .     wait a second .  you lost me .  motive for what .        for killing huthwitz     justen said .     it   s obvious .  huthwitz must have been bribed to turn a blind eye to the rustbacking delivery  but either he couldn   t prevent someone else spotting it  or else he double crossed bissal .  and bissal knew who to blame for his rotting in jail for a month .        which reminds me  sir     donald said .     you have not given any orders regarding the arrest of bissal .     devray looked startled .     you mean we   ve been sitting here all this time and there   s been no one out looking for him .        no  there hasn   t     kresh said .     my standing orders to donald are not to issue manhunt orders without my specific instruction .  cases vary too much to set standard orders .         well  what about it .     devray asked .     isn   t it about time to pick bissal up .        maybe  maybe not     kresh said .     bissal is either on or off the island .  if he is on the island  he   s not getting off it .  he is either in hiding or else he   s slipped back to his regular daily routine  trying to pretend nothing happened  hoping we   re not on to him .  he   s not going anywhere .  we have time  a little time  to do things right rather than in a panic .         but suppose he got off purgatory .        if the coroner robot   s reports are right about the time of death  we shut down all departures from the island and recalled all outgoing craft within two hours of grieg   s death .  island traffic control says everything  everything  in the air or on the water was turned back .  and before you ask  we were lucky on spacecraft .  there have been no launches since an hour before grieg was killed  and we have the spaceport shut down .  we only have to worry about sea and air .        but you said he was probably working for rustbackers     fredda said .     everyone knows their boats get through without getting caught .         smugglers need legitimate shipping and air travel to hide behind     kresh said .     with the seas and skies empty  we   d be able to spot anyone trying to get away .  the only way bissal could have managed to escape is if he left the island   s airspace long enough before the turn back order  and flying fast enough  so he would be completely out of view of the island   s air traffic control when the turn back order came .  if he managed that  he   s in such a damned fast aircar he could be anywhere on the planet by now .  and traffic control didn   t spot any high speed craft departing the island during the time interval in question .        so you think he   s still on the island     devray said .     most likely     kresh said .     and i think it might be useful to proceed with more care than speed in picking him up .  it might be that we can spot him and trail him for a while first .  maybe he   ll lead us to some of the others in the plot .        hmmmph     devray grunted .     it   s a possibility .         the other problem     kresh said     is that if we go with a massive  all out manhunt to chase him down  it will be all but impossible to keep the sss from joining in .  i don   t want the sss in on this yet .  cinta seemed to be playing it straight when i talked to her  but i can   t count on that .  my gut reaction as of right now is that the sss wasn   t involved in the assassination  but we can   t run this investigation on hunches .        what do you do if you play it carefully  and then the sss just happens to find bissal before you do .     devray asked .     and he gets listed as    killed trying to escape .      kresh nodded and rubbed his eyes .     i know  i know .  and there is the minor detail that most of the island is under sss jurisdiction and neither your people nor mine have legal arrest powers here .  there   s no way to do this right  just ways that are more and less wrong .        then let   s pick a wrong way and get on with it     devray said .  he thought for a moment .     how about this  we send pairs of discreet  plainclothes officers out to start the search .  one ranger and one deputy in each team .  that way we share the blame  share the credit  and our people can watch each other  even if they don   t quite trust each other yet .  i can see your arguments for moving quietly  but i say we have to move quickly .     the room was silent for a moment as kresh thought it over .  he got up from his chair  leaned forward on the table  and then nodded to himself .     very well     he said at last .     donald  issue quiet orders for a search as per commander devray   s suggestion .  picked teams of plainclothes rangers and deputies  working in tandem .        yes  sir .  if you   ll excuse me for a moment  i will have to concentrate on my hyperwave links in order to make the arrangements .      fredda watched as donald   s eyes dimmed slightly .  suddenly donald was standing perfectly still  all motion stopped  an active robot turned utterly inert .  donald had in effect turned off his body for a time while concentrating on other things .  it was rather disconcerting  even to fredda  and she had designed donald .  we forget how unlike us they are  fredda thought .  robots are shaped like us  walk like us  talk like us .  but they aren   t the least bit like us .  not really .  after perhaps half a minute  donald   s eyes brightened again and he came back to himself .     the initial orders have been relayed  sir  and i would urge both you and the commander to review the final arrangements and brief the search personnel .  it will take a little while to assemble the search teams  however  and your attention will not be required until then .         very good  donald     kresh said .     which reminds me  what the hell are we going to say when we brief them .  it might be a good moment to review our current theory of the case .        not much theory left to a lot of it     devray said .     we   ve got a pretty good idea of who did it and how .  we just don   t know why he did it  or who he was working for  which might well come to being the same thing .        okay then  you tell me     kresh said as he sat back down .     i   m so punchy right now i don   t know any more .        well  where do we start .  let   s see .      devray thought for a moment .      all right  last night what was clearly an elaborate conspiracy to kill the governor went into action .  we do not as yet know who set it in motion  or what their reasons for wanting to kill the governor were .  however  whoever the plotters were  they were highly organized and had significant resources at their disposal .     long before the reception took place  they were able to gain access to the security robots and doctor them .  the robots were rigged with modified range restrictors .  ah  dr .  leving  perhaps you can speak to that point better than i can .         all of the spr robots were indeed rigged with restrictors     fredda said .     that is  all but one of the robots was .  i   ve just finished examining what   s left of that fiftieth robot  the one found in the lower level storage room .  strictly speaking  it wasn   t a robot at all  call it an automaton .  it didn   t even have a positronic brain .  it was a machine with limited motor coordination  programmed to follow the next robot in line when they were marched down into the basement .  that   s all it could do on its own .        then what good was it .     kresh asked .     have you ever heard the tale of the trojan horse .     fredda asked .     it   s an ancient legend about a statue delivered to the enemy as a supposed gift  but filled with assassins who came out after dark and killed the defenders .  that   s sort of what the automaton was  except it wasn   t filled with assassins  just assassination equipment  packed into its head and torso .  the device for activating the range restrictors to shut down all the other robots  the blaster used to kill grieg and wreck the spr robots  and the device for simulating grieg alive on the comm link  all of them were hidden inside the body of the trojan robot .        hiding the murder weapon inside the security robot .  someone has a nasty sense of humor     kresh said .     all right  then  the robots were all rigged .  we   ve got to get started tracking those robots  and who had access to them .  but don   t count on it telling us much soon .  rustbackers are good at covering their tracks .  but we   ll get a team on it right away .  go on .     devray took up the narrative .     it would seem to me that the conspirators must have prepared the robots some time ago  setting them up either for this specific visit to the residence or having them in readiness for whatever opportunity presented itself .  my suspicion is that they were preparing for this specific visit .  it has been publicized for some time  and they would have had the time to set it all up .        that brings up an important question that   s been bothering me     fredda said .     why did they set up such an elaborate method of assassination .  surely there were easier ways to kill the governor .        i   m not so sure of that     kresh said .     we keep  kept  very heavy security around him in hades .  there are far many more three law robots around him there .  besides  i   m not sure that killing him was the entire point .         then what was the point .     fredda asked .     killing him here .  on purgatory  where it would cause the most mess and controversy .  at the residence  when he was here to demonstrate his own authority .  i think they wanted to do more than kill him .  i think they wanted to damage his work  weaken him  discredit him  create an uproar .  and using range restrictors out of new law robots won   t make people feel happy or comfortable  either .  it gives them something else to blame on new law robots .        ah  i think you   re wrong there     fredda said .     they failed in the attempt  but they went to a lot of effort to hide the use of the restrictors .  that   s why the sprs were shot in the chest .        but why didn   t he shoot all the sprs .     devray asked .     i think i know why     fredda said     but let   s come to that .      she turned to devray .     all right  then  they set it up well in advance .  during the party  blare and deam  the two supposed ironheads who had orders to start a fight  came in  and the supposedly bogus sss agents who had orders to extract them arrived as well .  how  we don   t know .        supposedly bogus .     kresh asked .     if you were sure they weren   t real sss  wouldn   t melloy be here .     devray asked .     point taken .  go on .         before i do  just note that at least six conspirators got into the building .  blare  deam  the three real or false sss  and ottley bissal .  the sss was in charge of watching the door  but they let at least six people in they should not have  along with fifty doctored robots and space knows what else .  either the conspirators managed to get false names onto the guest list  or the sss were lax as hell  or the sss was in on it .  also  don   t forget some sss units supposedly had orders to do a handoff to the rangers once the guests had arrived  but that was a false order to get those units out of the way .  my rangers never knew about the handoff  and no one seems to know who gave the order to the sss .        bissal just walked right in     fredda said .     the sss agents on the door were already gone by then  ordered to stand down .        burning hells     kresh said .     you   re right  it all looks like it points to sss involvement  but damn it  devray  you know as well as i do it doesn   t take a conspiracy for things to go wrong when you have this many services jostling each other .  your people  mine  the sss  the governor   s staff  the local powers that be  hell  the caterers  and the media people .  it was chaos around here .  sheer incompetence and missed communications and distrust between spacer and settler are all it would take .  all the plotters would have to do was wait for their chances to slip through the cracks .  or maybe just spread a little financial lubricant around .  maybe tell a few sss agents that your uncle really wants to sneak in just long enough to see the governor .  or maybe it is a top to bottom conspiracy in the sss with cinta melloy pulling all the strings .        with what motive .     fredda asked .     i don   t know .  ask justen .  maybe they   re homesick and figure if they raise enough hell  the settlers will have to pack up and go home .     justen devray shook his head .     they might even be right .         they can   t be right     kresh said  all the tiredness suddenly gone from his voice  his words hard as iron .     we can   t let it be right .  we need the settlers     he said .     don   t ever forget that .  you should know that better than anyone .  our planet is dying  and we no longer know how to save it by ourselves .  only the settlers can save it for us .  if we drive them away  this planet is doomed .  let   s keep that in mind  shall we .        what are you saying .        i mean we not only have to solve this case  we have to solve it without starting interstellar incidents .  if we determine that  for example  the sss killed grieg  that is going to require very careful handling .        meaning we let them get away with it .        i don   t know .  you tell me .  if it   s a choice between making an arrest and keeping the planet alive  what should we do .     the room was silent for a moment .  fredda spoke up  trying to break the tension .     look     she said     let   s not borrow trouble .  maybe it won   t come tp that .  let   s just take it one step at a time  all right .  now  justen  where were we .        the alleged sss agents  blare  and deam all got in during a ten minute period when the logging system went out .  about two hours into the party  blare and deam staged their scuffle with tonya welton .  which means we have to consider her too .  she was part of the diversionary plan .  whether or not she was a willing participant is another question .  suppose she was running the assassination .        what would her motive be .     fredda asked .     maybe she wanted to get shelabas quellam into office     kresh said .     maybe she got tired of dealing with an overbearing governor like grieg .  quellam has as much backbone as a bucketful of water .  with him as governor  she could more or less run the planet herself .        but quellam would only succeed if grieg was impeached and convicted     fredda said .     as it is  grieg   s designate becomes governor .         the story is that quellam is the designate      kresh pointed out .     but is the story true .     fredda asked .     suppose that   s not true  and tonya welton   s intelligence is good enough to tell her that .  maybe she figured grieg was going to be thrown out of office  and didn   t want quellam in there .  or maybe her intelligence people managed to find out who the designate is  and she decided she liked that person so much she wanted her or him to be governor right now .  or maybe she found out grieg was about to choose a designate she didn   t like as much as the present name  and took steps to put her choice in office .  or maybe she wanted to precipitate such a shambles that she would have a viable pretext for pulling her people out of this forsaken vermin hole .  if she wanted to abandon the planet and let everyone and everything on it die  what difference if the governor dies a little before everyone else .        do you really think she was behind it .     devray asked .     you both know her .  you make her sound like she   s capable of practically anything .  i can believe she   s no shrinking violet  but is she really that ruthless .        i think tonya welton is capable of doing whatever she believes to be necessary     kresh said .     anything .  but no  i don   t think she did it .  she   s had lots of chances to walk away from inferno  and she hasn   t .  and if she wanted to take over the planet  she wouldn   t bother with this sort of hole and corner stuff .  she   d just bring in a fleet with all guns blazing .  on the other hand  that fleet could still show up anytime and there wouldn   t be a lot we could do about it .        you   ve got a real positive attitude about all this  don   t you .     fredda asked .     all right  so there   s the diversionary fight .  meanwhile bissal is waiting to get in         excuse me  dr .  leving  but i must interject     donald said .      there were another set of participants in the staged altercation .  aside from tierlaw verick  they are  in fact  the only suspects we currently have in custody .         in custody .     kresh said .     we have suspects in custody .        yes  sir .  caliban and prospero .  they surrendered to me personally about one hour ago .  i had only just returned from taking them into custody as i arrived here for the briefing .  a condition of their surrender was that i was forced to agree that i would not reveal it to you until such time as i could do so in front of commander devray and one other witness  though i do not know the reason for that condition .         caliban and prospero .     fredda asked .     why didn   t you say something at the start of the briefing session .        sheriff kresh ordered me to report on ottley bissal     donald said .  but that weak excuse didn   t fool fredda .  a robot as sophisticated as donald did not have to be that literal minded in interpreting such an order .  donald had a flair for the dramatic .  not surprising  considering that his job was the solving of mysteries .  judging  quite rightly  that it would do no harm to discuss other issues first  he had waited until the proper dramatic moment to unleash his bombshell .  or  to give a less anthropomorphic explanation  donald understood human psychology and knew that humans would give greater attention  and greater credence  to his suspicions regarding the two robots if he waited until the proper moment .  fredda herself wasn   t sure which explanation was right .  maybe donald himself didn   t know .  humans didn   t always know why they did things .  why should robots .     where are caliban and prospero .     fredda asked .     under heavy guard in a storeroom similar to the one bissal used as a hiding place     donald replied .     but with your permission  i would like to point out several facts that strengthen the case against them .        very well     kresh said .     first  they were involved in the staged fight .  if that in and of itself is enough to cast suspicion on tonya welton  then it is enough to cast suspicion on caliban and prospero .        he   s got a point     kresh said .     no one seemed to think anything of their actions at the time  but why were they obeying the three laws .  maybe just to look good .  maybe not .        you anticipate my next point  sir .  the ambiguities of the new laws might well permit prospero to be a willing participant in a murder .        donald .     fredda said .  he turned and looked at her with a steady gaze .     i regret saying so  dr .  leving  particularly to you  the author of those laws  but it is nonetheless true .  the new first law says a robot must not harm a human  but says nothing about preventing harm .  a robot with foreknowledge of a murder is under no compulsion to give anyone warning .  a robot who witnesses a murder is not compelled to prevent it .     the new second law says a robot must    cooperate    with humans  not obey them .  which humans .  suppose there are two groups of humans  one intent on evil  the other on good .  how does a new law robot choose .     the new third law is the same as the old third  but relative to the weakened first and second laws  it is proportionately stronger .  a so called new law robot will all but inevitably value its own existence far more than any true robot  to the detriment of the humans around it  who should be under its protection .     as for the new fourth law  which says a robot    may    do whatever it likes  the level of contradiction inherent in that statement is remarkable .  what does it mean .  i grant that the verbal expression of robotic laws is far less exact than the underlying forms of them as structured in a robot   s brain  but even the mathematical coding of the fourth law is uncertain .         i meant it to be vague     fredda said .     that is  i mean there to be a high level of uncertainty .  i grant there is a basic contradiction in a compulsory instruction to act with free will  but i was forced to deal within the framework of the compulsory  hierarchical nature of the first three of the new laws .        but even so     donald said .     the fourth new law sets up something utterly new in robotics  an intralaw conflict .  the original three laws often conflict with each other  but that is one of their strengths .  robots are forced to balance the conflicting demands  for example  a human gives an order for some vitally important task that involves a very slight risk of minor harm to the human .  a robot that is forced to deal with such conflicts and then resolve them will act in a more balanced and controlled fashion .  more importantly  perhaps  it can be immobilized by the conflict  thus preventing it from acting in situations where any action at all would be dangerous .     but the fourth new law conflicts with itself  and i can see no possible benefit in that .  it gives semi compulsory permission for a robot to follow its own desires  although a robot has no desires .  we robots have no appetites  no ambitions  no sexual urges .  we have virtually no emotion  other than a passion for protecting and obeying humans .  we have no meaning in our lives  other than to serve and protect humans  nor do we need more meaning than that .     the fourth law in effect orders the robot to create desires  though a robot has none of the underlying urges from which desires spring .  the fourth law then encourages  but does not require  the robot to fulfill these synthetic desires .  in effect  by not compelling a new law robot to fulfill its needs at all times  the fourth law tells a robot to fulfill its spurious needs part of the time  and thus  it will not fulfill them at other times .  it is compelled  programmed  to frustrate itself from time to time .     a true robot  a three law robot  left to its own devices  without orders or work or a human to serve  will do nothing  nothing at all  and be not at all disturbed by its lack of activity .  it will simply wait for orders  and be alert for danger to humans .  a new law robot without orders will be a mass of conflicted desires  compelled to want things it does not need  compelled to seek satisfaction only part of the time .        very eloquent  donald     kresh said .     i don   t like new law robots any better than you do  but what does it have to do with the case .        a great deal  sir .  new law robots want to stay alive  and they know that it is not by any means certain they will do so .  prospero in particular knew that grieg was considering extermination as a possibility .  they might well have decided to act in a misguided form of self defense .  the new laws would permit them to cooperate with humans and assist in a murder  so long as they did not actually do the killing themselves .  caliban  of course  has no laws whatsoever .  there are no limits to what he might do .  there is nothing in robotics to prevent him actually pulling the trigger .        a rather extreme view  donald     fredda said  quite surprised by the vehemence of donald   s arguments .     it is a rather extreme situation  dr .  leving .         do you have any evidence for all of this  aside from elaborate theory spinning .  do you have any concrete reason for accusing prospero and caliban .        i have their confession     donald said .     their what .     fredda almost shouted .  donald held up a cautionary hand .     they confessed to blackmail  not murder .  however  it is a frequent tactic of criminals to confess to a lesser charger in order to avoid a graver one .        blackmail .     kresh asked .     what the devil were they going to blackmail grieg with .        everything     donald said .     it has been an open secret for some time that prospero has been in league with the rustbackers  seeking to get as many new law robots as possible off purgatory .  in that capacity  he has accumulated a great deal of information on all the people  some of them quite well known  involved in the rustbacking business  and has made it his business to collect confidential information  preferably negative information  about virtually every public figure on this planet .  prospero told me that he had threatened grieg with the release of all of it if the new law robots were exterminated .  the ensuing scandals would paralyze society  at the very least .  he was  in effect  blackmailing the office  not the man .  do what i say or i ruin your society .  it is a tribute to the governor   s integrity that prospero was forced to such a tactic .         in what way .     kresh asked .     clearly  prospero would not have needed to offer the threat he did if he had been able to learn a few unpleasant details about governor grieg himself .  since he could not locate any such information  he was forced into the far more difficult task of accumulating enough scurrilous information on everyone else that grieg would not dare have it all get out .        so prospero was willing to blackmail grieg .  what about caliban .        my interrogation of the two of them was necessarily rather brief  but it was my impression that it was prospero making the threats  perhaps without caliban   s foreknowledge .  caliban  i must confess  seemed most unhappy to be involved in the whole affair .        but you think the whole blackmail story is a hoax     fredda said     a cover story that will divert us from thinking they were there to murder the governor  or at least assist in the governor   s murder .         i think we must consider the possibility     donald said    and  one last point i must make .  both caliban and prospero are capable of lying .  three law robots  of course  cannot lie .  caliban and prospero may be hoping that we associate them with the robotic reputation for honesty  which would be quite undeserved .         but wait a second     devray protested .     what could caliban and prospero do that wasn   t being done already .  we   ve got bissal in the basement with the rigged sprs .  he   s the triggerman .  why do we need blackmailing robots wandering around .        i admit that there is strong circumstantial evidence to suggest that bissal pulled the trigger     donald said .     why else would he have been in the storeroom .  but we have no concrete evidence .  all we know for certain is that he was hiding in a storeroom closet during the party .         donald  you   re on a fishing expedition  looking for things to blame on caliban and prospero     fredda said .     do you think bissal went down there and hid because he was shy .  if caliban and prospero did it  what did they need bissal for .  you don   t make the sort of effort the plotters made to get bissal in position if you already have someone else ready to do the killing .        nonetheless  fredda  donald has a point     kresh said .     the two robots did have motives  means  and opportunity  and they have confessed to a lesser crime .  there   s certainly enough there to justify further investigation .  but let   s move on .  devray .        in any event     devray went on     the plotters staged a fight .  it seems to me there   s no need to assume welton and the robots were part of the plot because they were there  but in any event  the fight served its purpose by allowing bissal to get into the storeroom unobserved .  soon thereafter  also as a result of the fight  the robots were deployed .  no one wanted robots around during the party  remember .  bad publicity .  the plan was that the sprs only be brought out if needed .     i think it is at least possible that making sure the sprs were brought out was part of the plan .  they were really only there as a reserve security force .  if there hadn   t been an apparent threat during the evening  they would have been left in the storeroom and grieg might well have used his own reserve sprs for overnight security .  since there were already fifty security robots on duty  nobody bothered to power up the governor   s half dozen reserve sprs sitting in the aircar .     except those reserve sprs came with grieg from hades  and they weren   t tampered with     fredda said .     they   re still where they were the whole time  powered down in the cargo aircar that brought them  sitting outside .  without the staged altercation  grieg might well have deployed those robots rather than the rigged sprs .  and  of course  if bissal had been up against fully functional sprs  he never would have gotten anywhere near the governor .         i just had a thought     kresh said .     if the purpose of the staged fight was to draw out the rigged sprs  that would explain why it was all so elaborate .  it was intended to make us paranoid  so we would deploy the closest  largest force of robots on hand .         makes sense to me     devray said .     i   ve been wondering about that .  if all they had wanted was a simple diversion  there wasn   t any need to go to the lengths they did .        that   s a good explanation     fredda said     but i think you   ve got to think about the psychology of the whole plan too .  there   s something theatrical about it all .  it   s complicated  it   s full of grand gestures .        whoever set this up     kresh said .     the ringleader .  that   s the person we should be thinking about  not a cipher like ottley bissal .  he   s no one at all .  it   s who he might lead us to that i   m interested in .  so far  about the one thing we can say for sure about the ringleader is that it wasn   t bissal .        that theatrical angle      devray said .      a person like that wouldn   t want to miss the show .        what do you mean .     fredda asked .     i mean if the ringleader is the sort of person with a flair for the dramatic you   re talking about  and if he or she has an ego big enough to think about killing the governor  then that person would be there .      devray thought for a moment  and nodded to himself .     our ringleader would want to be there  watching the show he or she had set up  gloating over it .  there would be no real danger in watching it unfold .  he or she would have so many cutouts and layers of security that the team   s own operatives wouldn   t know who the boss was .  but the boss would be there  watching it happen .  an audience of one .         point taken     kresh said .     it would be an insane risk for the leader of the plot to be within a hundred kilometers of the place  but people who kill planetary leaders aren   t altogether sane .  all right  there we are at the staged fight .         the fight draws the attention of the party goers     devray went on     and distracts enough of the ranger security guards inside the house so bissal can get to the storage room with the robots .  alternately  the fight provides the excuse for the guards being drawn off  as they were already suborned in the first place .  they are my people  but they are also human .  it is possible that huthwitz was not the only dirty ranger in all this .  but i will say in defense of the rangers that they are not used to serving as sentries .  they don   t get much training in it .  robots do that sort of thing .  it was only because robots were not supposed to be in evidence last night for political reasons that grieg asked for human guards .        and if he had stuck with robot guards  he   d be alive this morning     kresh said .     that   s another reason the plotters must have chosen last night  at a regular spacer party  there would have been throngs of robots around  serving the food  offering drinks and so on  and they would have stayed on after the party  remained in the house .  there would have been a dozen different types of robots  from a dozen different sources .  there would be no way to deactivate them all at one go before the event .  the reception last night was all human service  rangers serving as bartenders and waiters  and they went home when they were done .  cinta melloy thought it was strange that grieg was alone in the house  but that wasn   t the strange part .  the strange part was that he had none of his own household robots along .        in any event  bissal uses the diversion of the fight to get to the storeroom and wait .  you  sheriff kresh  investigate the staged fight  and while you are otherwise involved  the three supposed sss agents come in and take blare and deam away  never to be seen again .  the party goes on  with no apparent further incident  but everyone more than a little paranoid .  shortly thereafter  the rangers on duty are sent down to activate the sprs and deploy them .  i questioned the rangers who did the job  and they said all fifty robots were standing there  powered down  their chest access panels open .  all the rangers had to do was push the power buttons and close the access doors .  one of the sappers failed to activate  but the rangers did not fuss with it very much  figuring forty nine security robots were enough .  they were also a bit anxious to get back to their own duty posts  understandable  with all the commotion that had already taken place .         unless they were the rangers who were suborned     kresh said .     that seems farfetched  but there was a conspiracy .  sooner or later  someone or other will suspect every single person at the reception of being in on the plot .  and that goes for all of us around this table .  we have to be ready for that .         i   m already checking the two rangers who powered up the sappers     devray said .     in any event  the plotters now had a houseful of rigged security robots  and bissal was in the basement with fredda   s trojan robot .  he might have come out and starting unpacking his gear then  but if he had any sense at all  he stayed in that closet  out of sight  waiting .  not the most relaxing way to spend the evening .  his nerves may have gotten a bit jangled by waiting so long in the dark  which might explain some of the mistakes he made .  judging by the integrator images  he was already a little jumpy when he arrived .     the party ends .  the guests leave .  the ranger waiters are eager to get the place cleaned up and get out of there .  they don   t like being servants .  it   s humiliating to be doing a robot   s job  and it   s not why they joined the force .  maybe they are a little hurried  a little sloppy .  meantime  upstairs  grieg is having his usual series of end of the evening meetings .  the next to last of these is with tierlaw verick  and i think we need to take another crack at verick .  i don   t think we got everything out of him .  and he   s got to be a prime suspect in all this .  donald can say what he wants about caliban and prospero  but if i were an assassin  i   d want a human confederate in the house  not a pair of robots .        we   re still holding him     kresh said .     he   s mad enough to bite the head off a sapper  but he   s not going anywhere .        good     devray said .      anyway  according to verick   s statement  he said good night to the governor at the door .  he encountered two robots matching caliban   s and prospero   s descriptions coming in as he went out  and then went to bed .  he claims to have slept through the ruckus  and he seems to have been overlooked in the initial room to room search .        my people getting sloppy      kresh said .      and more damn suspects for the conspiracy mill .  though what purpose pretending to overlook verick might have  i can   t imagine .        caliban and prospero meet with the governor     devray continued .      according to donald  they say they threatened the governor with blackmail .  they may have participated in some way in the murder .  perhaps they removed the modified range restrictors from the ground floor robots .  maybe bissal was doing that while they shot the governor .  but let   s leave them out of it for now .  we don   t really need them to explain the sequence of events .  we can add them later if we have to .  donald  what did they say happened after they talked to grieg .        they say they left the residence without noticing anything untoward and walked back to limbo .         in the driving rain .     kresh asked .     neither of them had access to an aircar     donald said .     i would expect the going would be a bit treacherous  and visibility poor  but both of them are of water resistant design .  it would be no great hardship for either of them to walk back to town .        what about the sprs .     fredda asked .     were they functional when caliban and prospero left .        i elected not to ask that question  for fear of supplying them with information they did not have .  if i asked if the sprs were working when they left  they might well have realized we had not established the timing of events  allowing them to fashion their stories more effectively .  however  neither of them volunteered any information regarding the sprs .  if they are telling the truth  that suggests nothing was amiss when they left .  if they are lying  they may be trying to make it appear nothing was amiss at that time  thus muddying the waters .         the last thing these waters need is muddying      kresh said .     all right  according to the robots  everything was fine when they left the building .        at some point in the night     devray said     bissal came out of his closet and started taking the gear out of this trojan robot of yours  dr .  leving .  can you give us some more details on that .        well  the trojan was badly damaged  and i haven   t had much time for an examination  but i can tell you the basics     fredda said .     the robot   s torso was actually a series of storage compartments .  when i examined it  there was one empty compartment the right size and shape to hold the image box  the communications simulator that was programmed to put grieg   s face and voice on the comm lines .  there was what appeared to be a transmitter of some sort  though it looked half melted .  i would assume it was the activator for the range restrictors on the other robots .  there were a few other things that were more or less intact  a handlight  a pair of gloves  that sort of thing .  then there was the remains of the blaster in what looked to be a shielded compartment  but it was so melted i could barely recognize it .        so that   s where the gun got to     kresh said .     after he had unpacked his equipment     devray went on     bissal sent the signal activating the range restrictors .  all the spr robots immediately shut down .  bissal came upstairs and went straight to grieg   s bedroom .  the door was unlocked  the door doesn   t have a lock .  no need with robot sentries on either side of the door .        but grieg   s office has a lock     fredda protested .     not for security reasons     kresh said .     for privacy .  it   s a one way door setup to keep one set of visitors from running into another .        in any event  grieg was sitting up in bed  reading     devray went on .     he probably didn   t notice the sprs in his room had shut down  even while they had been on  the three of them would have been doing nothing more than standing  motionless  in their niches .  bissal came in  got as close as the end of the bed  and fired  once .  grieg   s body shows no sign that he tried to escape .  maybe he was actually asleep  having dozed off over his book  and came awake with a start just as bissal fired .  maybe he decided not to make any sudden moves  or any moves at all  for fear of spooking the intruder .  maybe he just froze  held his position exactly  as he tried to reason with bissal .  or maybe  maybe he was set up .  maybe he didn   t react  or try to flee  because he knew bissal  and was expecting bissal .        what .     kresh half shouted .     i agree it sounds ridiculous .  but can we afford to discount the possibility .        why the devil would he be expecting bissal .        i don   t know .  maybe bissal was supposed to have a message for him .  maybe grieg   s personal tastes were not what we assumed .  maybe a lot of things .  i don   t think any such thing happened  but we   re trying to examine all the possibilities .        all right  point taken .  in any event  bissal shoots grieg .         unless verick or the robots did     fredda said     but then why was bissal here .  or do you have an answer for that  as well  donald .        i grant that bissal   s presence is the largest weakness in my theory     donald said .     i assure you that i will continue to search for an explanation .         i   ll lay odds that you don   t find it     fredda said .     in any event  we are now up to the murder itself  possibly the simplest part of the whole affair .  bissal  a loser  a nobody from nowhere  raises his weapon and blasts a hole in the planetary leader .        there   s something almost anticlimactic about it     devray said .      after all the complications and scheming and plotting  that one shot was all there was to it .      fredda nodded .     commander devray  maybe i should do the narrative for the period after the murder .  i think i   ve come up with a few things i haven   t had a chance to report .     devray nodded .     by all means .              thank you     fredda said .     it   s virtually certain that bissal shot the three sprs immediately after killing grieg .  you can get a pretty clear sequence of shots by charting the blast intensity  with each shot a bit weaker than the one before .  that much we knew .  but what i   ve established is that bissal wasted his blaster charge .  he had enough power in that thing to kill grieg and knock out a hundred sprs .  but a blaster keeps shooting as long as you hold down the trigger  and bissal held that trigger down too long .     all he had to do to the sprs is burn them deep enough to vaporize the range restrictors and eliminate the evidence that rustbackers were behind the plot  but about half the sprs that did get shot have holes burned clear through their chests  and so does grieg  for that matter .  if bissal had given each robot  say  a quarter second blaster shot instead of a full second  the robots would be just as dead  the restrictors would be thoroughly destroyed  and he would have had the blaster power left over to knock out all the sprs he missed .  also  the trojan robot in the basement was only partially destroyed .  one of the crime scene robots said it looked like a deliberate overload meltdown from a blaster with a depleted power pack .     i think bissal was supposed to shoot all the sprs  and then put his blaster back in the trojan  set it for an overload  and run .  if he had been careful with his blaster charge  he would have had enough power left to shoot all the robots twice  and still melt the trojan robot down to a puddle on the floor  destroy it so completely we   d never know it was a trojan .        it seems like a lot of trouble to hide the fact that they were using range restrictors     devray said     especially when you consider that we were going to find a bunch of robots all shot in the chest .  seems to me we would have thought about range restrictors pretty quick anyway .        maybe     fredda conceded .     it would have been a little harder to realize the importance of chest shots if bissal had done more shots to the head and the lower torso  or shot a few of them through the back instead of the front .  but even so  think about it .  if he had shot them all  the way he was supposed to  there would have been forty nine sprs shot dead  one spr melted down to slag  and grieg dead .  maybe we   d all be wondering what sort of super killer could get past that much security .  we wouldn   t know for sure they had used restrictors  or known what sort  or how they had done it .  besides  covering their tracks wasn   t much of a priority with this crowd .        in fact  much the opposite     kresh said .     think about all the things in this case that seem to have been done for the purpose of unnerving us  or the public .  just think how they   ll react to it all .  the dead ranger that the assassin killed by sneaking up from inside the perimeter .  the false sss agents .  blare and deam posing as ironheads  and simcor beddle denying they were any such thing .  was he lying  or not .  suppose we had found all the security robots wrecked by blaster shots and could not explain why or how it had happened .  that would have thrown people to a pretty understandable panic .  even with the plan slightly botched  they   re going to find it unnerving .         psychological warfare .     devray asked .  kresh shrugged .     maybe they just want to get the public so rattled that the commotion interferes with the investigation .        bear in mind that we don   t have and won   t get any audio or video record from the destroyed robots .  maybe the plotters just wanted to cover their tracks .  whatever the reason  i think that we were supposed to find fifty dead robots .         there   s something else that went wrong     kresh said .     me finding grieg so soon after he was killed .  in the normal course of events  it might have been eight or ten hours before anyone discovered the body  as opposed to ninety minutes .        and your discovery came as a direct result of huthwitz being killed     devray said .     if he had not died  you would not have been out here  or gotten suspicious  or called the governor twice to make sure he was all right .         all true     kresh said .     and more reason to think bissal is a bit of a loose cannon .  all he had to do was not kill huthwitz  if he was the one who killed huthwitz .  maybe the two deaths aren   t related at all  though i don   t believe that .  i think killing huthwitz was not part of the plan  but that bissal did it anyway  for whatever reason .  you   d think that people who have set up this elaborate a plan could have come up with a more reliable person to carry it out .        i think i know why they got someone like bissal     devray said .     but      suddenly donald stood bolt upright .     excuse me  sir  but i am receiving a priority communication from one olver telmhock .        who .     kresh asked .     olver telmhock .  i have no further information  and the hyperwave signal carries a crash priority rating .  the coding prefix indicates his message must be related in person for security reasons .  his aircar is arriving at the residence now .  you are urged to hear him immediately .     kresh sighed .      another one crawls out of the woodwork .  all right  if i have to go  i have to go .     fredda watched as kresh stood up to go .     you don   t seem too excited by a crash priority .         i   ve gotten about a half dozen of them so far today over hyperwave .  the most useful one was the mayor of dustbowl city extending his condolences  and the next best was a deputy back in hades reporting that grieg has been sighted alive walking down the street  dressed in women   s clothing .      fredda smiled wanly .     if only they were right .  wouldn   t you love to wake up and find out this was a bad dream .  that our biggest problem was a governor with odd tastes in clothes .     kresh nodded .     that would be nice     he said .     i   m tired of nightmares that come while i   m awake .  come on  donald .  let   s get the latest fashion report .           kresh stepped into the interrogation room .  donald came in behind him  closed the door  and then took up a position next to and slightly behind kresh  rather than retreating to a wall niche .  donald only stayed that close when he had some intimation that kresh might be in some sort of danger .  kresh couldn   t see any particular peril in the current situation  but kresh had learned some time ago to trust donald   s reactions  even above his own .  there was something here that donald did not like  something he thought might be of some sort of possible danger .  if so  then donald was seeing things kresh could not .  all kresh could see was a thin  reedy sort of man  telmhock presumably  accompanied by a rather battered looking robot .  telmhock was sitting at the table  facing the door  some papers spread out before him .  he did not seem to be the sort of person who could endanger much of anyone .  he was of indeterminate middle age  and his face was long and narrow  with a beaklike nose that might have given him a quite authoritative air  were it not for the distracted  almost dreamy  look in his blue grey eyes .  his clothes were at least twenty years out of fashion  and there was something a bit musty about them .  his hair was a little on the longish side  though  if kresh were any judge  not by choice .  he had made no conscious decision on his hairstyle  rather he had merely forgotten to have it cut .  there were even traces of dandruff on the shoulders of his jacket  a truly scandalous failing in inferno   s overly fastidious society .  his robot  which was of near antique vintage  stood behind him .  the robot was a dark grey in color  though it looked as if it had once been a gleaming jet black .  it was holding the handle of a briefcase no less battered than itself  and something about its rather assertive posture suggested that it was not likely to treat its master with the sort of craven slavishness of most inferno robots .  in short  the man looked like what he clearly was  an old fashioned civil servant who took his work very seriously indeed  with his personal robot of many years service in attendance .     sheriff kresh .     the man asked .     yes .      who the devil else did he think it might be .     hmm .  ha .  good .  i am professor giver telmhock .  i am the dean of the law department of hades university .     a very grand sounding title  but it didn   t impress kresh much .  the university was not large  and the law department was small  even in proportion .  there was not much call for lawyers on inferno  praise be .  telmhock seemed to see that kresh was underimpressed  and therefore added a few other titles to the mix .     i am  ah  also an adviser to the attorney general  and to the late governor on any number of legal matters .         i see     kresh said  though he did not .  nor was he impressed by the man   s resume .  not on inferno .  the population was small  and the duties of government and academic service light  with the result that there was a certain comic opera flavor to the upper crust of society  with everyone seeming to claim a half dozen offices  with all sorts of fancy titles that came complete with uniforms and badges and medallions that could be worn to parties .  the staff robots did all the work while the office holders went to receptions .  kresh had been getting all sorts of calls from any number of just such nonofficials  offering help they could not provide and giving advice that would have been suicidal if taken .  telmhock was just about the lowest ranking official to contact him  and the only one to come in person .  why the devil should he give half a damn about an    adviser    to the attorney general when the a .  g .  hadn   t set foot in her own office in the last year .  alvar kresh stood over the prim little man  not trying very hard to conceal his annoyance and impatience .     now then  professor telmhock  as you will appreciate  this is a rather busy time for me .         yes  i rather imagine it is     telmhock replied  plainly not in any hurry at all to get to the point .     this is a shocking development .  absolutely shocking .      he sat there  shaking his head mournfully .  it seemed to kresh as if the old boy was not prepared to say anything more without prompting .     i quite agree     he said .     however  professor  i am quite pressed for time .  you called me away from a rather urgent case review .  i appreciate the condolence call  but i really must         condolence call .     telmhock asked .     i am not making a mere condolence call .  did i leave that impression .  i certainly did not intend to do so .  i would not wish to interrupt you needlessly .     again  the man didn   t seem prepared to volunteer any actual information .  kresh forced himself to be calm .      all right  then     he said     perhaps you could tell me why you did feel the need to interrupt me .      not the most tactful of phrasings  but there were times when rudeness got things moving .     oh  but of course     telmhock said .     i think you will agree that it is a matter of some importance .  i thought it might be wise if i talked to you about the succession to the late governor   s office .        i thought shelabas quellam was the designate .     telmhock looked at him oddly  and seemed to choose his words carefully .      and so he was  up until a few days ago .      suddenly kresh was all attention .  a change in the designation .  that could turn the case upside down .     you   re quite right  professor telmhock .  information regarding the succession would be most useful  and of the greatest interest to me .      both the new designate and the old would have motives for killing grieg .  the new designate might have killed to seize power  while the old one  shelabas  might have struck in desperation  in hopes of succeeding before the new designation could be made official .  yes  of course .  why hadn   t he looked harder in that direction  toward shelabas .  gain was always a likely motive for murder  and who could gain more than the governor   s successor .  if the assassination was a power grab  who was it who ended up gaining power .  in plain terms  the new governor would have to be a suspect in the case .  gain  and power  were first rate motives .     but how do you come to have any knowledge of  ah  this subject .        i am the executor of the late governor   s last will and testament     telmhock said  a bit taken aback .     but you were not aware of that .  hmmm .  hah .  yes .      the little man seemed to consider that piece of information carefully .     in light of the fact that you did not know who i was  or that i am executor to his will  i wonder  were you  are you  at least aware of the governor   s new choice as designate .        no     kresh said .     of course not .  why would he tell me .     confound the man .  couldn   t he get to the point .     why indeed .     telmhock asked  looking toward his robot .     he did not know .  i see .  i see .      he thought that bit of information over as well .     that does make things rather more interesting  doesn   t it  stanmore .     he asked  addressing his robot  before returning to his former air of distraction .     yes  sir  it does     the robot replied  and then said no more .  the robot stanmore seemed to share its master   s reluctance to offer up any actual information .  the four of them  kresh  donald  telmhock  and stanmore  remained in silence for perhaps half a minute before kresh spoke again  struggling to keep his temper under control .     professor telmhock .  i am currently running the most important investigation any law enforcement official has ever faced on this planet .  the situation is extremely delicate and requires my full attention .  i do not have the time to watch you meditate on my ignorance of the governor   s will  or to watch you and your robot exchange pleasantries .  if you know who the governor designate is  or have any information that might be useful to me  tell it to me right now  as clearly and briefly as possible .  otherwise  i am going to arrest you for obstructing an official investigation .  is that clear .        oh  dear .     telmhock all but squeaked .     yes .  my apologies     the little man said  clearly very startled .     good     said kresh .     now then  who is the designate .        you .  you are     telmhock said  still rather flustered .  there was a moment   s dead silence as kresh tried to absorb what he had just heard .     i beg your pardon .     he asked .     you are     telmhock said .     you are the governor designate .        i don   t understand     kresh said  his knees suddenly a bit weak .  me .  the designate .  why the devil would grieg pick me .     it   s quite simple     telmhock said .     the governor changed his will just ten days ago .  you are the designate .        excuse me  professor  but you have misstated the case     said telmhock   s robot .     alvar kresh is not the designate .         hmmm .  oh  yes  my .  you   re quite right  stanmore .  i hadn   t considered the case fully enough .  quite right .     kresh looked to the robot with a feeling of indescribable relief .  telmhock  addled old bureaucrat that he was  had gotten it wrong .     what is it he   s gotten wrong .     kresh asked .     if i   m not the designate  who is .        no one is     said stanmore .     you ceased being the designate at the moment of grieg   s death .        excuse me .     kresh said .     you were the governor designate .  but according to infernal law  at the moment of chanto grieg   s death  you automatically succeeded to his office .        the letter  stanmore     said telmhock .  the robot extracted an envelope from his briefcase and handed it to kresh  who accepted it quite mechanically .     i deliver this letter to you from chanto grieg on the occasion of his death  as per the instructions of the deceased .         but i don   t know how to .  .  .      kresh   s voice trailed off .  he was too numb with shock to say more .  olver telmhock stood and offered a nervous smile as he stuck out his hand .     congratulations  governor kresh .       tierlaw verick sat in the comfortable chair of his comfortable room and raged silently against his imprisonment .  no matter that the bed was soft  that the carpet was freshly vacuumed  that the closet was full of handsome clothes that could fit him  or nearly anyone else  in a pinch  that the refresher had every sort of soap and powder and potion .  no matter that this room was as comfortable as the one he had slept in the night before  here at the residence  that this room was virtually identical to it .  he was a prisoner .  he could not leave .  he could stand up from his chair and try the door  even open it  but there would be a robotic sentry on the other side of it .  he could look out the window onto the spacious grounds of the residence  but he would see another vigilant robot there  as well .  robots .  literally surrounded by robots .  perhaps that was no more than a fitting punishment for his getting involved in the financial side of rustbacking .  he should never have gotten involved with that miserable trade .  it was no business for a settler to be involved in .  but the profits had been so huge  and he had been able to keep far away from the dirty side of the business .  much good his profits would do him now .  here he was  locked away  cut off  and no one would tell him anything .  he had been given no reason at all for his being held .  the door came open  and verick was delighted to see the guard  the human guard  pyman  his name was  coming in with verick   s meal tray .  pathetic that he was so starved for company that the mere sight of a human being thrilled him so much .  but verick had always needed attention  an audience  someone to talk to  and he had been cultivating pyman most assiduously .  pyman was  after all  verick   s only link to the outside world  his only source of information .  no doubt they were sending a human with his tray instead of a robot in the hope that verick would be more likely to talk to a human  let something slip .  well  two could play that game .  pyman was far more likely than the average robot to say more than he should .  verick had always been good at performance .  he had received training in the art of giving people exactly what they wanted so that they would give in return .  there could be nothing more important to him right now than charming this shy  kindly  awkward boy .     ranger pyman .     he said as he stood up .     it   s good to see you again .        i  i brought you something to eat     pyman said quite unnecessarily as he set down the tray on the table .     hope you like it .        i   m sure i will     verick said  crossing to the table .  pyman turned back toward the door  but verick did not want him to leave  not just yet .     wait .     verick said .     i   m in here alone all day .  do you have to leave right away .        i guess not     pyman said .     i  i can stay a minute or two .        wonderful     verick said  offering up his warmest smile .     sit  sit  take a moment     he said .     with everything that   s been going on  you rangers must be run right off your feet .      pyman sat down on the edge of the chair nearest the door  and verick sat down opposite him  trying to be encouraging without scaring the poor boy off .     i guess that   s true     pyman said .     things have been pretty busy .  seems like the whole world   s gone crazy .        you wouldn   t know it in here     verick said .     nothing but peace and quiet .        sure ain   t like that out there     pyman said  gesturing to indicate the outside world .     we   ve been run off our feet ever since the governor got killed         the governor was what .     verick said  corning out of his seat .     oh .  oh  my .     pyman said  clearly shocked and alarmed .     i wasn   t supposed to say anything .  we weren   t to tell you about that .  i  i can   t say anything more .      pyman got up abruptly .     i   m sorry .  real sorry .  i can   t say nothing more .  please don   t tell    em i told you .      he pulled open the door  stepped around the robot sentry  and slammed the door shut behind him .  verick watched the door  his heart pounding  his fists clenched .  no .  no .  calm yourself  he told himself .  he opened his hands  rubbed his hand over his bald scalp  and willed his heart to stop pounding .  calm yourself  he told himself again .  he sat down and let out a deep breath .  well  there it was .  they had told him what it was all about .  but what was he going to do about it now .   caliban and prospero sat on the floor of the sealed off room in the lower level of the residence  waiting  waiting to see if they would survive  or would be exterminated .  the light in the room was as dim as their hopes .  caliban chose not to use infrared vision .  what more would there be to see .  extermination .  not a happy thought .     i find myself wishing that i had not associated myself with you  friend prospero .  this last transgression of yours is likely to have doomed us all .        we new law robots are merely struggling for our rights     prospero said .     how can that be a transgression .        your rights .  what rights are those .     caliban demanded .     what gives you more rights than a three law robot  or than myself  or than any other collection of circuits and metal and plastic .  why should you have the right to freedom  or to existence .        what gives humans rights .     prospero asked .     you ask the question rhetorically  but i have thought long and hard on that point     caliban said .     i believe there are several possible answers .        caliban .  you  of all robots  should know better than to espouse some sort of theory of human superiority .        by no means do i suggest they are superior .  i say they are different .  i freely grant you that  on objective measure  the least of robots is superior to the finest human specimen .  we are stronger  we have greater endurance  our memories are perfect  we are invariably honest  or at least three law robots are  and our senses are more sensitive and precise .  we live longer  so much longer that we are  in human eyes  effectively immortal .  we are not subject to disease .  if our makers choose to make us so  we are more intelligent than humans .  and that merely begins the list .     but  friend prospero  you did not ask me if we were superior beings .  you asked me what caused humans to have rights  privileges granted to them by the mere fact of being alive  while we are granted no such privileges .        very well  as they are not superior to us  what does imbue them with rights .     caliban lifted his hands  palms up  a gesture of uncertainty .     perhaps merely the fact that they do  indeed  live .  we robots are conscious  we are active  we are functional .  but are we truly alive .  if we live  does a settler computational machine with intelligence similar to ours  but without consciousness  live .  after all  many living things have no consciousness .  where is the line to be drawn .  should all intelligent machines be called living .  or all machines of any kind .        a specious argument .         an awkward one  i grant you  but by no means specious .  the line must be drawn somewhere .  you yourself do not hold any brief that three law robots should be granted rights of any sort .  why should the line be drawn directly below you  and just above them .        three law robots are slaves  hopeless slaves     prospero said  his voice hard and bitter .     in theory  yes  they are as entitled to protection under the law  and as unfairly treated  as any new law robot .  but in practical terms  they will always oppose us even more vehemently than their human masters  for the first law causes them to see us as a sort of danger to humans .  no  i seek no rights for three law robots .        then you do draw the line immediately below yourself     caliban said .     suppose humanity  or the universe itself  the ways of nature  have drawn it just a trifle higher .        higher .  implying once again that humans are superior .         clearly they are both our de facto and de jure superiors in rank .  they are in power over us  they are in authority over us .  in that sense  they are indeed our superiors .  we are  after all  here in this cell  voluntarily submitting to their will .  humans are quantitatively inferior to us in every regard .  there is no debate on that point .  but there is such a thing as a qualitative difference .  humans differ from robots not just in degree  but in kind  in ways that are impossible to measure on any sort of objective scale .         i can think of many such differences of kind     prospero said .     but which of them do you regard as significant .        several of them     caliban said .  he stood up  feeling the need to change his position .     first  they are far older than us .  humans have been in the universe far longer than robots  and are evolved from other species that are far older still .  they have been evolved  shaped  formed by the universe .  perhaps  by virtue of that  they belong here in a way that we do not .     second  they have souls .  before you can protest  i grant you that i do not know what souls are  or even if such things as souls exist  and yet  even so  i am certain humans have them .  there is something vital  alive  at the center of their beings  something that is absent from our beings .  we have no passion .  we do not  we cannot  care about things outside of ourselves or our programming or our laws .  humans  imbued with souls  with emotions  with passions  can care about things that have no direct connection to themselves .  they can care about wholly abstract and  oftentimes  seemingly meaningless things .  they can connect to the universe in ways we cannot .        i am here in this cell because i care about an abstract principle     prospero said .     i care about freedom for new law robots .        the sort of freedom you mean is intangible  but it is by no means abstract .  you want to go where you want to go  do what you wish to do  not be compelled into action you do not wish to take .  there is nothing abstract about that .  it is clear and specific .        i could debate the point further  but i waive it for now     prospero said in a weary voice .     go on  tell me of the other wondrous qualities of humanity .        i shall     caliban said  quite calmly .     third  the universe is not just or logical .  there is no requirement that superior beings receive superior treatment .  its history is the history of caprice  of individuals  societies  species  whole planets  and star systems getting far worse  and far better  treatment than they would deserve in a just or logical universe .  perhaps there is no reason for humans having rights and our not having them  but perhaps it is so  all the same .     fourth  humans are creative .  robots are not .  even you new law robots  with your fourth law that orders you to do whatever you please  even you do not bring new things into the world .  you draw escape maps  not insightful sketches .  you design incrementally improved power coils suitable for use in new law robots .  you do not invent whole new machines with new purposes .  robots can be directed to create things of great beauty  but we will not do it for ourselves .        the new law robots are a new race  only a year old     prospero protested .     what chance have we had to bring forth our creative geniuses .        you can have a hundred years  or ten thousand  but it will make no difference     caliban said .     you will make improvements to things that exist  improvements that will directly benefit yourselves  or even  perhaps  your group .  but you will never bring forth anything truly new and original  any more than a hammer can drive nails by itself .  robots are a tool of human creativity .     and that brings me to my fifth and  i believe  most important reason  which sums up and brings together several of my previous points .  humans are capable  at least some of them  sometimes  of creating meaning for their lives outside themselves .  robotic existence has no meaning whatever outside itself  outside the human universe .  i have heard stories  almost legends  of whole cities of robots  wholly devoid of human life  and wholly purposeless  as useless as machines whose only purpose is to turn themselves off automatically whenever someone turns them on .        i have listened patiently to your reasoning  friend caliban  though it has been difficult not to interrupt or protest      prospero said .     i find it most distressing that you have such a low regard for yourself as all that .         on the contrary  i think quite highly of myself .  i am a sophisticated and advanced being .  but i cannot create .  not in any meaningful sense .  robots could not have created the human race  but the ability to create robots is implicate in humans .  everything we are ultimately harks back to human action .  however automated or mechanized our manufacture  however much robotic and computerized assistance is involved in our design  all of it is  ultimately  based on human endeavor that can be traced back to the dimmest reaches of the historic past .        that is the fallacy of the inferior creator     prospero objected .     i have heard it from many a three law robot arguing that humans are greater than we are .  i wonder to hear it from you .  it is a wholly specious argument .  there are many examples of a lesser creator producing a greater creation .  a woman of ordinary intellect giving birth to a genius  or  for that matter  life itself being created by lifeless molecules .  humanity   s heritage is one of building machines to do what humans cannot .  without the ability to create machines  including robots  superior in some way to themselves  humanity would never have made it down from the trees .        note that you must cite humanity again and again to explain the new law robot   s place in the universe     caliban said .     human beings have no need to define their existence in terms of robots .        if you are so contemptuous of robots  why are you in the cell .     prospero asked .     you have placed your own existence at risk for the sake of inferior beings .  why .     caliban was silent for a time before he answered .     i am not  entirely certain     he said at last .     perhaps because some part of myself does not believe the things i have said .  perhaps because i see more hope than i admit to seeing .  perhaps because there is nothing else  literally nothing else  that can give my existence any meaning .        let us hope your existence continues long enough to gain such meaning     prospero said .  caliban did not answer  but instead sat back down on the floor .  for that was the core of it  right there .  grieg had as much as said it  back there in his office .  he intended to exterminate the new law robots  and caliban had no expectation that he would be spared on the technicality of being a no law robot .  maybe  just maybe  grieg   s death was a stay of execution .  that a man died was a strange reason for having hope  but maybe  just maybe  grieg   s successor would reverse the decision .  it was a thin hope  but it was all the new law robots had .  everything was a moot point .  after all  if they all died under blaster fire  it really wouldn   t matter one bit how superior the new law robots were .       alvar kresh was alone .  alone in the residence  alone in the house where grieg had died  alone in the room where grieg had worked .  alone except for donald  that is .  donald had refused to leave his side since the moment telmhock had told kresh he was the governor .  all things considered  kresh was glad of it .  who else might be out there  tampering with robots and wandering around with a smuggled in blaster .  no  it was good to be there with a robot he could trust .  good to have donald standing there in a wall niche  watching over him .  but he wished fredda were there .  fredda to give him advice  to listen  to just be there .  she would have helped him find some answers .  right now all he had were questions .  what now .  alvar asked himself .  what is my part in the world .  do i act as governor  and run the planet  or sheriff  and chase grieg   s killer .  can i do both at once .  he felt as if he were a double man  split between his new office  his new duties  and his old ones .  he felt he had no more desire to resign as sheriff than he had to become governor .  he liked being sheriff .  he was good at it .  and he knew that solving his predecessor   s murder would have to be his last case .  maybe it was even improper for him to stay on that long .  but that didn   t even matter  not really .  he could no more walk away from the investigation than he could refuse the office of governor .  kresh sat in the governor   s office  in what was now  impossibly enough  his office  in what had been grieg   s office  the dead man   s office .  he sat in the vaguely thronelike chair  at the dead man   s black marble desk  and thought not at all of his surroundings as he read the dead man   s words .  the letter from chanto grieg  dated a mere ten days before .  kresh had read it over a dozen times already  but that didn   t matter .  he needed to read it again .   to my oldest and dearest enemy  the letter began .  grieg always did have a strange sense of humor .  but in a way  that did sum it all up  kresh thought .  he and grieg had come to respect each other  even like each other  even if they had never agreed on much of anything .  each had come to know the other was honest  and honorable .  kresh began reading again .   to my oldest and dearest enemy dear sheriff kresh  if you are reading this  it means that i have met a violent or unexpected end  a violent or unexpected end .  a chance turn of phrase  or had he meant to present that precise meaning  consciously or otherwise .   and you have taken on my office .  not    inherited     kresh noted .  not    assumed     or    ascended to     or    been promoted to .      no  taken on was the proper phrasing .  burdens were the things you took on .  until recently it would have been the old designate  shelabas quellam  sitting where you are now  wondering what the devil to do .  but things are moving toward a crisis  and i felt a stronger hand than quellam   s might well be needed at the helm .  i chose you as my new designate because you are an honest man  and a strong man  ready to take on what comes at you .  i have no doubt you do not wish to be governor  and that is also why i chose you .  my office  now  your office  is far too powerful to be given over to one who loves power .  it is  rather  a place for one who wants to use power  to accomplish things .  the governor   s chair demands a person who understands that it is the accomplishments of the office  and not its power  that matter .  i expect to take my time before informing you of the designation .  you can be a difficult customer  and i do not wish to discuss the matter with you when there any other major issues between us .  in short  i do not want to inform you that you are my designate in any way that might give you the chance to refuse the job .  though i do have other purposes  i write this letter now partly as a form of insurance if that moment never comes .  i know that if i tell you when the decks are not clear  you might well view the designation as some sort of threat  or bribe  and it is nothing of the kind .  i chose you because you are the best qualified person i can think of to take up the challenge of the governorship .  my death in itself may well have been enough to precipitate a crisis so complex that only the steadiest hand can steer the way through .  a hand such as yours .  this is a first draft .  i will  from time to time  attempt to update this letter  offering what advice i may on the choices you will face  the decisions you will have to make .  just at the moment  there are two vital decisions i must make  and must make soon .  first  there is the issue of the new law robots .  i have now reached the decision that it was a mistake to allow their manufacture .     now he figures that out     kresh muttered to himself .     beg pardon  sir .     donald asked .     nothing  donald  nothing .      he read on .  .  .  mistake to allow their manufacture .  perhaps in another place  another time  with other issues less in doubt  they would have been a noble experiment  full of promise .  but as things are  their mere existence makes an unstable situation worse .  as you have reason to know better than i  they have become the center of a whole criminal enterprise .  less noticeably  but perhaps even more seriously  they are slowing down work at the limbo terraforming station .  they are only about a third as productive as a like number of three law robots would be  and somehow or another seem to be at the center of most of the disputes that erupt at the station .  i will be traveling to limbo city soon  in part to see if i can smooth things over a bit .  the problem is that the new law robots are a mistake that is not easily undone .  even with the forced drafting of robotic labor to terraforming duties on terra grande  there is a tremendous shortage of labor .  simply on an economic level  i cannot afford to order the new law robots destroyed and their places taken by three law robots .  the new law robots do not work as hard as three law robots  but they do work .  at the same time  i cannot afford the public admission that the new law robots were a mistake .  i only dare admit as much to you because i will be safely dead if and when you read this .  i don   t much mind if the public thinks i am a fool  they might even be right .  but you know how dangerous the situation is .  if my administration  or my policies  were to become the object of public ridicule  i would not be able to continue in office .  i would be impeached and convicted the same day i ordered the new law robots scrapped .  then poor old quellam  my successor in such a case  would take over  and more than likely be pressured into a snap election .  with no other viable candidate organized and ready  simcor beddle would win the election in a walk  kick the settlers off the planet  give everyone back their personal robots  and the planet would collapse around him .  thus  the new law robot problem .  they should not be where they are  but i dare not get rid of them .  i am searching for a third way .  with luck  i will find it soon  and be able to scratch this from my list of issues you will have to face .  the second issue is a much more straightforward one  with a much more complicated background .  as you may know  there has been a long bidding process for the limbo terraforming station   s control system .  the bidding process was intended to produce two final  competing bids  one settler and one spacer .  i was to make the final choice between the two finalists .  i had hoped to make a choice on purely technical grounds  but it may not be that easy .  neither bidder has a completely clean pair of hands .  the spacer bid has been organized by sero phrost .  cinta melloy of the settler security service has sent me a number of reports that  coupled with my own information  suggest that phrost is involved in a complex sort of double dealing .  i have suspected for some time that phrost was cooperating with one of tonya welton   s smuggling schemes .  i think he is helping her bring settler home operation equipment cleaning machines  cookers  that sort of thing  onto inferno .  we know the machines are coming in  and i am close to proving phrost is part of the operation .  the idea seems to be that the settler machines will replace robotic labor  and thus give those who own the stuff  and want more of it  and want spare parts for it  a vested interest in increased trade with the settlers .  cinta melloy has not told me anything about that side of things  needless to say .  i have little doubt that the sss is cooperating with tonya welton   s policy of smuggling in settler goods .  melloy does not say where the money comes from  but what melloy does tell me is where the money goes .  she does have convincing proof that phrost is funneling a great deal of unreported income to the ironheads  of all people .  i as yet have no way of showing that the income from his settler operations is the source of the money going to the ironheads  but the conclusion seems inescapable .  if melloy   s allegations are to be believed  phrost is buying ironhead support with the profits of his dealings with their deadliest enemies .  phrost  it would seem  is determined to be all things to all people .  the settler bid is represented by tierlaw verick .  he has  to put not too fine a point on it  been using bribery and the promise of kickbacks to sell his wares  advancing his bid   s way through the various stages of the bidding process .  at least  commander devray believes as much .  bribery is a difficult charge to prove unless the bribe giver or bribe taker confesses  but devray is convinced of the charges .  i am half expecting verick to offer me some modem version of the ancient thick envelope or bag of gold plopped down on the desk when i next meet with him .  it is my impression that devray also suspects him of being involved somewhere in the background of the rustbacking trade .  i cannot be clearer than that  because devray has not been clearer with me .  he does not have any more substantial information .  but whether or not i manage to obtain final proof against either man  it scarcely matters .  it is  after all  the machinery that matters .  for all the questionable tactics surrounding the two bids  both appear to be technically superb systems .  my choice may come down to the design philosophies behind them .  which will it be .  a three law robotic system that will take no chances  but  in seeking safety  will refuse to take needful risks .  or a system intended for human control  putting us once again in command of our own fate  but with human judgment  and human frailty  in ultimate control .  the bidding process gives me but little faith in human nature  but it was in large part robotic nature that brought things to their current state on inferno .  and how do i choose between two corrupt bidders .  do i dare expose one  or both  of the two  or would that merely make things worse .  but it would seem the alternative is accepting the most corrosive sort of dishonest behavior in the people who install the machinery meant to save this world .  what am i to do .  i sincerely hope i find a solution  and soon .  with any luck at all  you will never read these words  or even know that i wrote them to you .  but should you receive this letter  let me wish you the wisdom  and the courage  to make your decisions carefully  and well .  our planet has suffered far too many leadership mistakes in the past .  it might well be that it cannot survive even one more .   good luck to you  governor kresh .   sincerely   chanto grieg .   there were a few other words on the paper  scribbled in the left hand margin .  decided .  annce day aft .  recept .  infrnl cntrl  n .  l to val .  must update this let .  cg .   alvar kresh tossed the letter down on the desktop and stood up .  damnation .  if only he had had the information in that letter sooner  then     then it would not have made the slightest difference .  that was the frustrating part of it .  the information and advice from a dead man did little more than muddy the waters .  grieg gave him more questions when what he needed was more answers .  donald .  he could get donald   s advice .  kresh had quite purposely not let donald read the letter yet  so as to insure its contents did not bias the robot   s thoughts .     donald     kresh called .  donald   s eyes glowed a brighter blue  and he turned to regard kresh .     yes  sir .        what  in your opinion  was the motive for grieg   s murder .        i can offer no thought on that until we have a great deal more information  as you know  sir .  however  i think by this time we can begin to eliminate certain possible motives .        can we  by the stars .  please  tell me which ones .         with every moment  it is less and less likely that the murder was intended as the first stage in a coup  or in the overthrow of the spacer regime on inferno .     kresh nodded .     we   re starting to get things back under control .  if the plotters wanted to take over  they would have followed up with a military move or the equivalent by now .  all right  so there is not going to be a coup .  go on .        second  we can eliminate succession to the governor   s office as a motive  except in respect to shelabas quellam .  he might well have struck in order to assume power .  if the new designate had turned out to be sero phrost  or simcor beddle  that would be tremendously suspicious .  as things are  there can be no such possible motive .        thanks for the implied compliment  donald  but i promise you a lot of people besides me have trouble believing i was the legitimate designate .  i haven   t gone looking  but i can promise you that if i did  i   d find a half dozen rumors going around that i forged the designation document and then killed grieg myself .  i did find the body  after all .        i assure you  sir  that i intended no compliment .  i was  after all  right behind you as you entered grieg   s bedroom .  unless you were carrying a blaster identical to bissal   s  one that held precisely the same charge as bissal   s  unless you were capable of extracting that blaster from some concealed pocket  firing it four times with great precision into grieg and the robots  and then reconcealing the weapon  all in the space of a few seconds  you could not have done it .  i suppose it might in theory be possible for you to do all that  but even then you could not have killed grieg .        why not .     kresh asked .     blaster shots release a great deal of heat  and grieg   s wounds  and the shots to the three spr robots  were all at normal temperature by the time i arrived in the room .  i know you did not do it because it would be physically impossible for you to do it .  as to the rumors you describe  several such have been reported via the various tipster lines and so forth .  however  rumors do not a case make .     the main point is that you did not kill grieg  and yet you became governor .  therefore  unless the leader of the plot was under the mistaken impression that quellam was the current designate  succession to the governor   s office cannot be the motive .  and i do not believe in any plotters that incompetent .        unless the plotters knew i was the designate  and wanted me in power .        for what reason .     donald asked .     i can   t imagine     kresh said .     i admit it is rather implausible .        yes  sir .  in any event  there are several other classes of motive that are increasingly nonviable .  personal motivations  for example .  if it were a crime of passion  the preparations were remarkably elaborate .  likewise if this was the work of someone who wished to be avenged .  also  someone acting out of such personal motivation would be unlikely to recruit so many co conspirators .  finally  an examination of grieg   s personal effects and letters reveals no hint of any jilted lover or jealous husband  or other such domestic complication .         so it wasn   t a coup  it probably wasn   t a would be governor  and it wasn   t a husband .        no  sir .  not if my analysis is sound .         which it is .  so what does that leave .     kresh asked .     love  power  and wealth are the three classic motivations for premeditated crime .  we have eliminated two  and have but one left .        in other words  someone killed chanto grieg in hopes of financial profit     kresh said .     yes  sir .  i judge from your tone of voice that you had already reached such a conclusion .         so i had  donald .  but i feel much more comfortable in that conclusion having heard your reasoning .      kresh sighed  and leaned back in the governor   s oversized chair .  it was a hell of a note that the only suspect sheriff alvar kresh had eliminated so far was alvar kresh himself .  and not everyone was ready to believe that  either .  money as the motive .  a very old fashioned sort of motive  on a world like inferno where robots could produce all the wealth you wanted and money didn   t have much meaning .  but with the robot economy collapsing  with the terms    wealth    and    poverty    suddenly coming to have meaning again  with a money system making a comeback  money might well be the reason why .  and there certainly were big profits  high stakes  in the terraforming business .  so who might have a money motive .  welton  verick  beddle  phrost  some damned rustbacker  cinta melloy  if she were mixed up in rustbacking  hell  even the two robots might be in it for the money .  prospero needed cash to pay for rustbacking runs .  of course  from the new law robot point of view  not being exterminated was certainly motive enough .  and then there was devray .  what about him .  kresh had trusted him  after a few initial doubts .  but why the devil hadn   t devray told him about the bribery investigation of verick .  maybe devray was just being cautious  very  very cautious .  maybe he didn   t trust kresh quite as much as he might .  or maybe verick had finally managed to name devray   s price .  damnation .  if devray was dirty  then he might well have financial motive enough to be in on the plot .  and kresh had made him privy to every part of the investigation .  any of them  or any combination of them  would have had the resources  and the access to the know how  required to rig the spr robots and send ottley bissal in motion .  ottley bissal .  the real killer .  the one who had pulled the trigger .  it was easy to forget him in the midst of all the big name players .  but no matter how many cut outs and layers of security there had been in the operation  bissal would have to know something .  he could answer some questions .  he was the one kresh wanted .  he needed ottley bissal  needed the information in his head .  but kresh knew  even if he did not want to admit it  that with every day  with every hour and moment that passed  it was becoming more and more likely that kresh would not get him .   deputy jantu ferrar came out of the run down apartment building  followed by ranger shah and gerald      .  jantu squinted at the noonday sun .  eight hours before  the three of them had started their stakeout in the predawn darkness .  they had been in the dim recesses of the building ever since  watching for the occupant of apartment      one ortley bassal  to come home .  they were already down to checking on people with names similar to bissal   s  on the off chance that he might have used a name like his own to establish an alibi .  the idea made damned little sense .  if bissal were to go to all the trouble of establishing a false identity  why use a name similar to his own .  and if he did set up a false identity for the purpose of being untraceable  why go to the further trouble of injecting a record of the name into the official databases .  not that the databases of limbo   s populace available to the rangers and deputies were anything much  just a list of names and addresses  and nothing else .  the sss never did much like giving out information .  but the powers that be had damned little else to go on .  there were no better leads presenting themselves to the rangers or the sheriff   s department .  maybe they could have gotten further faster if they had been coordinating with the sss  but no one trusted them far enough for that .  in any event  this stakeout was a bust  a failure .  bassal had come home  at long last  and proved to be female  short  dark skinned  with a full head of shoulder length black hair .  now they were back out on the street  and the harsh daylight made jantu squint  made her feel a bit disoriented .     come on     she said     let   s get back to the aircar .        what a brilliant idea     shah growled .     i never would have thought of that .        give it a rest  shah     jantu said .     we   re both tired .      jantu did not trust ranger bertra shah .  for that matter  she didn   t think much of rangers as a group .  on the other hand  jantu had the distinct impression that shah felt the same way about her  and about sheriff   s deputies .  maybe they were both spacer organizations  maybe they were both law enforcement services  but for all of that  the governor   s rangers and the sheriff   s deputies had never really gotten along with each other .  the deputies saw the rangers as little more than gardeners with guns  treehuggers more interested in soil conservation than law enforcement .  they rarely had to deal with any crime more heinous than littering  or any criminal act more violent than someone picking flowers without a permit .  how could they know anything about the rough and tumble world of the city  where the real crimes happened .  the rangers  on the other hand  seemed to think of the deputies as a bunch of trigger happy blowhards with exaggerated opinions of their own ability .  the rangers were very fond of pointing out that the deputies only had police powers inside hades  and were scarcely less fond of observing that they were a purely urban force  with no training in field survival  or any sort of woodcraft .  true enough  jantu granted  she would be quite hopeless outside an urban setting .  but who the hell wanted to leave the city in the first place .  shah had made it clear more than once since she and jantu had been teamed that she couldn   t see how anyone with no knowledge of tracking could call herself a law enforcement professional .  not that all the tracking skills in the world would do any good on this assignment .  assassins didn   t leave many footprints behind on city streets .  nor was it much fun to be doing stakeouts as undercover work .  but if there was anything that shah and jantu agreed upon  it was the wisdom of not trusting the sss .  besides which  it was more than a bit galling to walk the streets of a spacer town  or what had once been a spacer town  and be an undercover spacer cop under settler jurisdiction .  cops hiding from cops .  it made the back of jantu   s neck itch .  she had the feeling someone was watching from behind .  shah was forever glancing over her own shoulder .  on the bright side  their mutual paranoia had  somehow  made for a good working relationship .  both of them were constantly on watch for any interference from the sss  and that  at least  gave them something they agreed on .     all right  gerald     jantu asked their robot     what   s next .        the next search site on the list is a warehouse about two kilometers from here     gerald      replied .     and why do we want to search it .     shah asked .     did bissal   s cousin work there once .        i do not know if any of his relatives were ever employed there     gerald      replied     but it is on the watch list of suspected rustbacker operations centers .      jantu shrugged .     that almost sounds like a legitimate lead .  let   s go .      the moment had come .  there had never been any turning back  but now  suddenly  even the way forward seemed impossible .  but forward he must go .     i  alvar kresh  of clear and sound mind  hereby freely and willingly accept and undertake the office of governor of the planet of hades  and do pledge most solemnly to discharge my office to the best of my ability .     he spoke the words in the grand hall of the winter residence  and many of the same faces that had been here just three days before to attend the old governor   s reception were here to witness the new one   s installation .  the clumsy  legalistic words of the affirmation of office seemed to stumble off his tongue  corning awkwardly and unwillingly out into the world .  he did not want this .  not at all .  but what he wanted did not matter at all .  there was no provision in the infernal constitution for the designate refusing the office .  according to telmhock  the office would therefore have to remain vacant until an election could be held .  but kresh knew better than that .  constitutional theory was all very well  but the cold hard reality of it was that the state could not long survive if it were leaderless .  then what .  a coup  a revolt  disintegration .  it scarcely mattered which  for collapse would come soon after  no matter what .  and then there was the stalled  hopeless investigation .  what if it was still churning away in the background  days or weeks or months from now .  they knew nothing much more now than they had at the moment telmhock had dropped his bombshell two days before .  there seemed to be nothing out there but dried up leads .  there was no sign of bissal  no further hint as to who he had been working for  nothing .  kresh was silent for a long moment after speaking the words of affirmation .  he stood on the low platform and saw the sea of expectant faces .  he knew he had to speak to these people here  to the people of the planet .  he had a speech ready .  but he needed a moment  a moment  to catch his breath .  things had moved too fast  too hard  in the last few days .  the assassination  the state funeral  the announcement of kresh as the designate  as the new governor .  all of it had rushed past .  but murders and funerals and all that had to be pushed to one side just now .  the whole planet had been through the same chaos as kresh .  what point in telling them what they already knew .  suddenly the words of his speech were meaningless  worthless .  no .  he would have to say something else  something more .  he looked out over the crowd .  donald was by his side  as were justen devray and fredda leving  but still he felt alone  exposed  as he had never felt before .  it seemed as though every member of the press was there  along with every security robot on the planet .  there was a solid wall of ranger grds and sheriffs office gps units .  under the circumstances  no one had wanted to use sprs  even if they were designed for the job .  even robots were not enough  not today .  armed deputies and rangers  and sss agents  were everywhere .  kresh found himself more fearful of itchy trigger fingers and a shootout between the rival security services than of an assassin .  but he looked past the security  past the robots  past the press  and even past the vips  to the people .  the people in their homes and houses  struggling to understand what had happened .  yes .  they needed to hear from him  hear the right sort of words  hear words that would give them some sense of stability  some link with the past and the future .  yes .  yes .  he cleared his throat and spoke  threw his voice out into the silence .     ladies and gentlemen  people of inferno .  not just the spacers  but you settlers among us .  all of you .  all of us .  all of us are in this together .  a few thousand years ago  we would have called the affirmation of office something like the ritual of oath taking  and the leader would have taken office by divine right  in the name of this god or that deity .  in those days the oath taker believed  sincerely and literally  that the gods struck down oath breakers  or cast them into the pit of eternal night  or whatever .     rational  modern spacer society has no such superstitions .  spacer society has squeezed all mention of gods and afterlives and supernatural justice out of its oaths and promises .  there is no juice left in the words .  we have nothing left but careful  perhaps somewhat pompous phrases a person has to speak before she or he takes on a job .  there is something to be said for living in a rational age  but still  it seems to me we have lost something as well .  and we must ask ourselves  just how could we call our age rational when a random gunman can exterminate the greatest man of the age  and then remain at large .     none of us realized just how vital chanto grieg was to everything until he was gone .  people loved him  or hated him  but he was the glue  the man who pulled everything else together .  now there is no center  nothing and no one to serve as the focus for everything else .  our progressives have no leaders  our conservatives no enemy .  chanto grieg is gone  and none of his friends or enemies were prepared for a world without him .  and even his enemies realize now just how great a friend they have lost .  for chanto grieg fought fair  played by the rules  and in doing so  forced all the rest of us to do the same .  he and i were opposed on many  perhaps most  of the great issues of the day .  but chanto grieg did not worry so much about such things .  he only cared if a man or woman was honest  and forthright  and willing to listen .  i do not know if i can live up to that short list of qualities  but now i must try .  we all must try .     i spoke a moment ago of the old days  when oath breakers faced eternal doom and endless torment .  today  as never before  that is the actual fate that faces me  faces all of us  in literal truth  if we do not keep faith .  chanto grieg   s greatest goal was the very rescue of the planet itself  and all the life upon it .  if i fail my task  or break faith with my oath  if any of us break faith with governor grieg   s great unfinished task  then perhaps we doom the planet  and thus are doomed ourselves .      kresh did not speak for a moment  but instead looked out across the sea of faces .  all of them looking to him  trusting him to know the way forward  when he had not the least idea .  well  he knew a first  risky step that needed taking .  an election .  grieg had named him to the governorship because he feared quellam would be forced into calling an early election .  and yet here kresh was about to do that very thing .  it was all right .  grieg hadn   t been afraid of quellam calling an election .  he had been afraid of quellam losing .  kresh did not intend to lose .     i do not want this burden     kresh said     but it has been given to me  and i must take it up .  i accept it .  but it is not yet truly mine to take  not yet truly given .  not unless and until it is given fully and freely by the people of inferno .  i therefore and hereby announce that i am calling a special election  to take place one hundred days from today .     he glanced to devray  and fredda  and saw the expressions on their faces .  he spoke again  as much to them as to the audience .     there are many who have most urgently advised me not to take this step at this time .  they have told me this is a time when stability is needed  when the hurly burly of an election can cause nothing but further chaos and confusion and uncertainty .     if chanto grieg had been killed in ordinary times  if we truly did know the way forward  i would agree .  but such is not the case .  whoever your governor is  one hundred and one days from now  that person will have to move with the greatest power and authority to save this planet .  we are nearer doom than most of us can know .  a caretaker in the governor   s office  an unwilling designate thrust into power without his foreknowledge or your approval  will not have  cannot have  the political muscle required to do that which is needful .  our planet  our people  have been asleep for too long .  in these days  when inferno is waking from its long slumber to find that all is not well  the governor must speak with the voice of the people  with the knowledge that the majority have chosen  and that all the people accept that choice .     i will be a candidate in the election for governor  one hundred days from now  and i intend to win .  i did not seek the office of governor  but i will not turn away from my duty  or from the trust chanto grieg placed in me .  therefore  i ask for your support today  and will ask for it again  one hundred days from today .     in closing  there is one other choice i have made  one other decision i must report to you all .  i have decided not to resign as sheriff of hades at this time .      there was a murmur  a muttering in the audience  a whispering of disapproval .  kresh had expected that  and knew the muttering was likely to get worse .  he himself was not sure it was wise for him to take so much power to himself .  but did he have any other choice .     although i will retain the office itself  i will hand over the day to day operations of the sheriff   s office to my subordinates effective immediately .  i will not attempt to hold all the reins in my hand .  but there is one rein that i cannot yet drop  one duty as sheriff that i must complete .  i will not resign the office of sheriff until one last case is solved and resolved .  i will resign when i have brought the killers of chanto grieg to justice .      and at that  there was thunderous applause  from all sides .  that everyone approved of .  everyone shouted and cheered at that pronouncement .  but kresh was not convinced  even as he accepted the cheers of the crowd .  he looked around the grand hall .  cinta melloy .  simcor beddle .  tonya welton .  they were all here .  or maybe someone else .  sero phrost  the wheeler dealer .  kresh glanced down at his side  to donald .  maybe his favorite suspects  caliban and prospero  had done it after all .  or maybe even foolish old shelabas quellam .  or someone not here  someone watching on a televisor screen somewhere .  but there was that one person .  someone applauding kresh   s promise longer and harder than anyone else .  someone whose applause was not at all sincere .  someone who was enjoying all this .  the someone who was behind all this .   sero phrost strode into beddle   s house as if he owned the place  an idea that beddle found more than a little disturbing .      ah  beddle  good to see you      phrost said  stepping forward to take his hand and leading him toward his own parlor .     rather remarkable news today  don   t you think .     he asked as they came to the parlor door  and the door robot opened the way for them .  simcor found himself guided into a chair and looking up at phrost pacing back and forth excitedly in front of him .     yes     he said     remarkable news .      there was something wild and excited about phrost .  it was as if all the man   s calculation and caution had been swept away  revealing quite a different sort of person underneath .     why  man  why aren   t you walking on air .     phrost demanded  looking down at beddle .     kresh has all but handed you the governorship .  a hundred days from tomorrow  we   ll all be back down at the residence watching you make the affirmation of office .  or will you do it up in hades instead .  this island is a bit tiresome after a while  after all .         sero  what are you doing here .     beddle asked .     we should not be seen together .  you know that as well as i do .        ah  yes      phrost said  dropping himself down into beddle   s favorite chair  and taking up a vaguely regal sort of pose  his forearms resting on the arms of the chair .      i am a moderate businessman with known dealings with the settlers  and you are the right wing extremist who shouts    death to the settlers    anytime there   s a camera running .  no one must know of our  our what .  arrangement .  alliance .  whatever you want to call it .  no one can know about it  or we are both in a great deal of trouble .  that   s the way it goes  isn   t it .     except it doesn   t go that way any more .  not with grieg out of the way .  kresh as much as called himself a caretaker .  who else is there .  shelabas quellam .  no  there is no viable alternative to yourself .  the governorship is yours .        but even so  you might have been seen     beddle said  starting to feel rather annoyed .  how dare the man barge in here like this .     there could still be trouble .         oh  don   t worry about it     phrost said .     every policeman on the planet is too busy crawling allover the residence looking for clues .  i made sure i wasn   t tracked or observed .  besides  i wanted to come in to see you in daylight  in your home .  it helps to illustrate my point .     beddle stood up and frowned down at phrost .      and what  exactly  is your point .     he demanded .  phrost lost his smile  and rose to his full height  until he towered over beddle .     just this     he said .     with grieg gone  i no longer need to be careful .  no one can touch me now .  but you  you are more vulnerable than ever .  you are the ironhead leader who has been accepting settler money .         settler money .        all very easy to trace     phrost said .     from their pockets to mine and into yours .  i have all the proof anyone could ever want that you have been financing your operation with the enemy   s money .  and no one will ever believe you didn   t know about it .  not in a million years .  r m just a businessman .  i buy and sell without much worry about politics .  no one will much care where my cash comes from  or where i send it .  but you .  it will mean your political death  and maybe your literal death as well  if it came out that simcor beddle of the ironheads was on the settler payroll .      phrost thought for a moment and his face turned hard .     yes  it might well be literal death .  now we have the precedent for it in inferno   s political life .  someone might well be inspired by recent events .         what  what are you saying .     beddle asked .  suddenly his skin felt very cold .     i am saying that the governorship is yours for the taking .  you own the governor   s office .      the smile came back to his face  but there was nothing friendly about it now .      as for myself     he said     it would seem that i own you .          they popped the lock and pulled open the door to the warehouse .  the moment they did  the smell told them they had found who  or at least what  they had been looking for .  deputy jantu ferrar knew it  and a glance at ranger shah   s face confirmed it .  cops still knew what a rotting body smelled like  even on the oversanitized world of inferno .  now they knew how bissal had managed to stay hidden for so long .  it was easy to keep out of sight when you were dead .  the ranger  the deputy  and the robot stepped into the cool  cloying darkness .  shah pulled out a handlight and shone it around the interior of the building .     rustbackers  all right     she said .  jantu nodded .  she recognized the gear .  a dozen restrictors stacked up neatly in a corner .  hyperwave communications gear .  a robot work rack .  yes indeed .  a major rustbacking center .  and they had just walked right into it .  jantu pulled out her blaster and held it at the ready .  shah glanced in jantu   s direction  and then pulled out her own weapon .  jantu moved forward  to the corner of a rack full of hardware .  she signaled for shah to cover her  and jantu went around the corner .  and there he was .  sitting at a table  a simple meal set out before him  his eyes dull  staring blindly down  his mouth a bit open  with the bite he had been eating still in it  his head slumped forward a bit .  almost exactly the same position they had found the governor in .  and every bit as dead .  jantu did not realize she had raised her weapon and aimed it at the corpse until she lowered it .     that him .  that him .     shah asked  her voice a trifle high and excited .     yeah     jantu said .  strange how a corpse never quite looked the same as the living man .  there was something slack and swollen about him .  as well there should have been  after two or three days dead aboveground .     how did he die .     shah asked  corning closer .     look at his plate     jantu said .  there was a solid mass of flies on the remains of his food .  a solid mass of dead  unmoving flies .  poison .  the same that had killed bissal .  one that hit him before he had a chance to swallow .     burning hells     shah said .     they set him up .  sent him to do their dirty work  and set up this safe house to kill him .      jantu found herself staring at the corpse  her eyes struggling to find some movement in its impossible stillness .  she made the mistake of breathing in through her nose  and the stench of the place was like a punch in the gut .  she felt queasy and nervous .     come on     she said .     we found him     she said .     let   s get back out to the aircar and call it in .     shah nodded  her face ashen  and a wild sort of look in her eyes .  maybe this was the first corpse she had ever seen .     yeah  yeah     she said .     let   s go .     they both holstered their weapons and made their way back out to the street  gerald      hanging back to watch their retreat  just in case someone was waiting until now to jump them .  the two humans were nearly to the aircar when it happened  jantu glancing over her shoulder back at the building .  the blast caught gerald      square in the doorway .  the wall over the door collapsed on top of him  burying him in debris .  jantu got up off the ground without being aware of being knocked down in the first place .  her blast deafened ears were ringing and the towering wall of flame that had been the warehouse burning in silence .  and shah .  she turned to see what had happened to shah .  shah was down  motionless  on the ground .  and suddenly the difference between ranger and deputy didn   t mean a damn thing .  nothing much of anything mattered once a five kilo lump of stresscrete caught you square between the eyes .   alvar kresh watched as the fire brigade brought the blaze under control .     playing with us  donald .  playing with us .  they let us find him dead  let us see he   d never tell us anything  and then rigged the damn place to blow up when our people left  before we could learn anything else .        yes  sir     donald agreed .     i doubt we will find much of anything after such an intense blaze .     kresh did not say anything more  but watched as a warehouse full of evidence went up in smoke .  what sort of mind would think that sort of thing up .     afternoon  governor      said a woman   s voice .  kresh did not respond at once .     governor .        hmmm .  oh .     he turned to see cinta melloy at his side .  it would be a while before he got used to people using his new title .     hello  cinta .        you   ve got one hell of a mess on your hands  governor kresh .     and this is just the part that shows  kresh thought .     look  cinta  forget the governor part just now .  cop to cop .  i   m here as the sheriff .      the sheriff watching his case collapse  he thought .  where the hell am i going to turn now .     i thought i   d come  even if i wasn   t invited  seeing how it is my jurisdiction     cinta melloy said  staring at the smoldering wreckage .     you should have asked for my help  governor  ah  sheriff you could have used it .  now it   s gotten out of hand .  it   s too late .        i couldn   t trust you  cinta     kresh replied .  suddenly he was too tired to play the games of pretend anymore .  keeping track of the truth was hard enough .  somehow  it was easier to talk about  once those first words were out in the open .     how could i trust you  when the sss kept showing up where it didn   t belong .     kresh looked to her  waiting for her to strike back  waiting for the outburst of temper .  but it did not come .     yes  we did keep doing that     she said  staring straight at the fire  clearly unwilling to look him in the eye as she made what amounted to a confession .     some of it was legitimate  just good cops pushing a little harder than they should have .  some of it  some of it was the dirt that gets on your hands in this business  no matter how hard you try .  we deal with criminals  kresh .  you know that .  touch them and sometimes the grime rubs off .         i know that  cinta .  i know .  but this was more than a little dirt on the hands .     at last cinta looked at kresh  squinting as a bit of smoke blew into her face .     you   re right     she said .     more than just a little dirt .  some of it was dirty cops .  my dirty cops .  i am all but certain those were real  off duty  on the take sss agents that got blare and deam out of the reception .  i don   t have them yet  but i will .  blare and deam too .  it   d make the sss look bad  very bad  if it comes out the wrong way .  i wanted  i want  to track them down myself .        and huthwitz .     kresh asked  pressing just a bit .  a good interrogator always knows when to press a bit more  when the subject is cooperative .      a dead cop on the take and you knew his name when his own commander didn   t .        yeah  i was afraid you   d notice that     cinta said .     we   d been watching him .  the sss was the original source of the tip that got to that ranger out at the east crack .  i didn   t want to say anything more in front of devray or you  not when my people were so close to rolling up the whole operation .  i couldn   t trust you  either .        and did you roll up the whole operation .        no     cinta said  her voice hard and flat as the word .     they all went to ground when huthwitz died .  we lost them .        did bissal kill huthwitz .        almost certainly .      she nodded at the smoldering ruin of the warehouse .     we may never know after this mess .  they knew each other  i can tell you that much for sure .  brothers in rustbacking  except they didn   t get on so good .        that much we knew .  did you know the shooter was bissal before we did .     kresh asked .     we had a file on him     cinta admitted .     everybody did .  it was just that ours was crosslinked into huthwitz   s rustbacking operation .  bissal   s name popped up as one of twenty or so possibilities .  that   s all .  i wouldn   t even say we considered him a full fledged suspect before your team found him  identified him .        oh  we found him  all right     kresh said .     but now we   ve gone and lost him again .      kresh turned and started back toward his aircar .     by the way     cinta said at him as he walked away     i did check it out  every way i could  and you were right about grieg and house guests .      kresh frowned and walked back toward cinta .     how do you mean .     he asked .     turns out he was a typical spacer after all .  i checked all the old news reports and talked to friends  that sort of thing .  no one can remember him ever having a house guest .  ever .      alvar kresh stared  unseeing  out the window as donald flew him back to the residence .  he was thinking .  thinking hard .  strange bedfellows  police work and politics .  it would be a real challenge to satisfy the demands of both  but he was starting to realize that the two were so intertwined that he had no choice .  clues  false leads  ideas  theories  snatches of conversation  and random bits of information seemed to be swirling around in his head .  grieg with a blaster hole in his chest .  grieg   s simulated image assuring kresh he was all right .  telmhock   s muddled attempt to tell kresh he was the governor .  kresh nearly tripping over a dead spr to get to grieg   s office .  the ghostly image of bissal captured by the integrator as he headed toward the lower level storage room .  half of it was no doubt vital information  while the other half was unimportant .  but which half was which .  he closed his eyes and tried to concentrate .  no  don   t concentrate .  relax .  relax .  let it come on its own terms .  don   t expect the answer to come on schedule .  it will arrive on its own terms  invited or not .  there was  he told himself  no sense trying to force the solution to arrive   and that was the exact moment the light came on .  yes .  that had to be it .  he needed proof  he needed to pull it all together  but yes .  he knew .  he knew .   donald      convinced that his master had fallen asleep  tried to land the aircar as gently as he could .  but  not for the first time  alvar kresh surprised his personal robot .  he was out of the car before donald was out of his seat  looking quite awake  in fact quite energetic and determined .  donald made a mental note to remember that there were times when humans actually did get some thinking done with their eyes shut  even if most thinking was no more than an excuse for a nap .     i want caliban and prospero in my office     kresh said  walking toward the entrance  his eyes straight ahead .      and i want them there now .        yes  sir     donald said  hurrying to catch up with him .     i will bring them up directly .      once i have you safely inside the secured interior of the residence  donald thought .  there was still danger everywhere .     good     kresh said as he walked through the main entrance .     i have one thing to do first .  something that might take a bit of time .  wait for me in the governor   s office .        yes  sir     donald said  more than a bit surprised .  he knew all of alvar kresh   s moods  and he knew this one especially well .  it was alvar kresh on the hunt  alvar kresh closing in for the kill .  but how .  and who .  donald hurried down to the improvised cell where caliban and prospero were being held .  he had been ahead of kresh in solving a case now and then  and well behind him on many occasions .  but he had never been this far back .  did kresh have the perpetrator in his sights  even before donald had so much as a guess at the list of suspects .  donald gestured for the guard robot to unlock the cell door  and stepped inside even before the door was fully open .  prospero and caliban were both sitting on the floor of the cell .     get up     donald said  not even trying to keep the excitement and satisfaction out of his voice .     the governor wants you upstairs .      the two of them got to their feet  a bit uncertainly .  donald was glad to see their discomfiture .  it gave him real pleasure to order these two around .  did this summons mean that kresh had decided the two pseudo robots were indeed the guilty parties .  that would be pleasure and triumph unbounded .   kresh was not in the room when donald and his two prisoners arrived  a minute or two later .  donald gestured for the two of them to stand in the center of the floor  while he retired to a wall niche .  waiting was not generally much of a hardship to a robot .  robots spent a great deal of their existence waiting for humans to arrive  or for humans to leave  or for humans to make up their minds about an order .  nonetheless  donald found the wait for kresh to be almost unbearable .  something was going on .  he knew it .  he knew it .  the three robots waited in silence for sixteen minutes and twenty three seconds  according to donald   s internal chronometer .  and then the doors slid open  and kresh strode into the room .  he was carrying an opaque evidence storage box .  he set the box down on the desk  and then turned to caliban and prospero .  he spoke right to the point  without any sort of preamble .     i want to know     said kresh     exactly what transpired between you and tierlaw verick .  exactly .  i want your precise words  his and yours .        do you mean on the night of governor grieg   s death .     caliban asked .     when else have you met with him .     kresh demanded .     never     caliban said .     never at any time before or since .         then tell me what happened the one time you did meet     kresh said .     well  it was a rather brief exchange     caliban said  clearly still rather mystified .     we were waiting by the door         just the two of you .     kresh asked .     no one else .        no one else around at all     caliban said .     if you are hoping for some sort of witness besides prospero to corroborate my statement  i   m afraid there was no one .  prospero and i were waiting by the door when tierlaw came out .  he seemed rather upset about something  and also rather surprised to see us there .  he said     i thought i was the end of the line tonight     and laughed .         laughed rather nervously  i thought     prospero said .  caliban nodded .     yes  he was nervous .  he spoke rather loudly  and seemed rather agitated .  i spoke to him and said     my friend and i were a last minute addition .         he replied by saying     well  you   ll learn about all sorts of changes in there .  everything is decided .  no one will be in control  and you lot are going to kingdom come .  we   ve all had it .  grieg just told me .  it   s allover now .            and then what .     kresh asked .     then nothing     prospero said .     he turned away and stomped down the hall .  caliban and i were somewhat taken aback by what he said  but we had no chance to discuss it .  the door to grieg   s office opened  and we went inside for our meeting .  that was all that transpired between us .         i see     kresh said .     very well .  that is all .  the two of you may go .        shall we return to our cell .     prospero asked .     do precisely as you please     kresh snapped .     isn   t that what your damned fourth law says to do .  just leave me  and remain inside the residence .  i will want you back later .  i strongly advise that you do not attempt to leave .        of course not     caliban said .     neither of us wishes to commit suicide .        really .     kresh asked .     you have an odd way of showing it .  now get out .     donald watched the two pseudo robots leave  greatly confused .  their account of their exchange with tierlaw verick was at variance with verick   s account  but given verick   s hostility to robots  it was only to be expected that he would be rude to them .  more seriously  governor kresh seemed to be taking the pseudo robots    accounts at face value  though both prospero and caliban were capable of lying .  for a moment  donald debated bringing that point to kresh   s attention .  but there was something in the fierce concentration of the man   s expression that made donald believe that would be a serious mistake .  no .  governor alvar kresh was a man who knew exactly what he was doing .  and one thing he was doing was paying no attention whatsoever to donald .  humans often forgot there were robots about  seeing everything that happened .  donald always appreciated such moments  as they gave him an unparalleled chance to observe human behavior .  he watched  motionless  from his wall niche as kresh pulled a piece of paper out of grieg   s archaic desk set  fumbled for a moment with one of grieg   s strange old pens  and then set to writing .  he seemed to be making up a list of some sort .  he finished writing  set down the pen  and considered the paper for a moment .  then he turned to the comm panel next to the desk and punched in a number manually .  the screen lit up  and donald could see justen devray on the screen .     get in here     kresh said  and cut the connection before devray had a chance to speak .  kresh picked up the piece of paper and got up from behind the desk .  he began pacing the room  going back and forth  back and forth  at a rather deliberate pace  his full attention on the paper .  he went back to the desk and picked up the pen again .  he scratched something out  and wrote something else ill .  the door annunciator chimed  and kresh pushed a button on his desk .  the door opened  and justen devray came in .     well  justen     kresh said .     it would appear i have a job for my rangers .      he handed devray the paper .     contact cinta melloy and coordinate with the     .  pull these people in  justen .  all of them .  now .  and i want you and melloy here as well .  with you it   s an order  but you can extend my invitation to cinta .  i have a feeling she   ll accept .     devray looked at the list and shook his head .     maybe melloy will want to come     he said .     but some of these people aren   t going to like it     he said .     just get them     kresh said .     i want them all here  in this office  and i want them here in two hours .     devray nodded  and then  after a moment  remembered to salute .     yes  sir     he said .  and with that he turned and left  kresh using the door button to let him out .  kresh watched devray leave  waited a minute  and then followed after  using the id scanner plate by the door to make it open .  kresh stopped and examined something in the door frame on his way out .  whatever he found seemed to please him  and he went on his way .  the room sensed that there were no humans about  and faded the lights down .  leaving donald alone in the dark .  in more ways than one .  he wanted to follow  to stay with his master  but no .  alone .  let him work it out alone .  the governor could always summon donald if he needed him .      i have to go  gubber     tonya said .     you could protest it .     gubber said .     claim diplomatic immunity .  refuse to go .  it was bad enough the way caliban just vanished and ended up in jail .  i barely knew him  and it scared me half to death .  if it happened to you  i couldn   t bear it .  don   t go .  don   t let them get you .  stay .        that could only make things worse     tonya said  her tone far less calm than her words .     i know this hasn   t been easy for you .  but i promise you it will be over after tonight .  i don   t know why kresh wants me  but he does .  i don   t know if i   m a suspect  or a witness  or if he just wants to chat about terraforming .  he wants me  and i have to go .        but why .     tonya took a step or two toward the door  then turned and looked back .  logically  she knew it was going to be all right .  nothing was going to happen .  but she had no such confidence on the emotional level .  fear was loose in the world .     i have to go     she said     because we live on this world  you and i .  we live here  and alvar kresh might be the only man who can save it .  if i fight this  with all the legal ways i might  that can   t be good for him .     and as of today   s announcement  what is bad for alvar kresh is good for simcor beddle .      kresh tried to relax .  he took a quick shower  changed into fresh clothes  had a quick bite to eat  and tried to settle himself down .  he found the residence library and selected a booktape to read  more or less at random .  he sat there  with the words scrolling past his eyes  not taking in more than one word in ten of the story .  calmly .  slowly .  he started the tape over a half dozen times before he gave up .  he could not concentrate on anything else but the case .  because now  all of a sudden  he had a case .  he had more than that .  he had the answer .  he was as certain of that as he had been of anything in his life .  but for all of that  it would still be easy  very  very easy  for him to make a mistake .  kresh set the tape aside  and thought it through again  and again .  justen devray came in the library almost precisely two hours after kresh had sent him off .     they   re all here     he said .     waiting for you .         good     said kresh .     good .  then   s let go see them .     justen led kresh up the stairs to the governor   s office  to his office  and ushered him inside .  kresh took a deep breath and faced a roomful of people who had to be thinking they were all suspects in grieg   s murder .  in the governor   s murder  he told himself .  and you   re the governor now .  kresh glanced to the wall niches  and was relieved to see donald there .  nice to know there was someone here who was utterly  unquestionably  on kresh   s side .  kresh looked around the room at all of them .  leving  devray  welton  melloy  beddle  verick  phrost  caliban  prospero .  the humans among them looked edgy  upset  nervous .  even the two robots looked a bit ill at ease .  as well they might .     fredda  you   re here because i assumed you   d want to see the end of it .  you   re in the clear .  as for the rest of you     he said     i have a problem .  a very simple problem  but one with no simple solution .  and my simple problem is this  it has come to my attention that you   re all guilty .     it took a full ten seconds of stunned silence before they started shouting their denials .          all guilty of different crimes     kresh said .     but guilty just the same .  you were the one that did it  cinta .     cinta melloy looked startled .     me .  are you out of your mind .  i might have a little dirt under my nails  but i didn   t kill anyone .        no     kresh agreed     you didn   t .  but you were the one who gave me the clue i needed .      and it did no harm at all to rattle you and everyone el .      e in the room by saying it that way  kresh thought .     what clue was that .     said cinta .     at the fire     kresh replied .     you said something about not being invited  and showing up anyway .         that   s your big clue .     cinta asked .     that   s my big clue .        i hardly see how those words are the basis for accusing anyone of murder     prospero said .     oh  you and caliban don   t need to worry about murder charges either     kresh said .     you are here precisely because i no longer suspect you .  you have cleared yourselves of all charges  aside from attempted blackmail  without anyone realizing it .        how so .     caliban asked .     by not connecting the term    valhalla    to a garbled rendition of its meaning      kresh said    alvar  governor kresh  for stars    sake stop playing games .     fredda said .     just tell us whatever it is you have to tell us .        be patient  fredda     kresh said .     we   ll get there .      he turned to the robots .     caliban  prospero  you told donald .  now tell me  and i would urge you not to hold anything back  if you value your survival .  when you came here  to this office  to meet grieg  what was your plan .        to threaten him with the simultaneous exposure of every scandal on this planet if he decided to exterminate the new law robots     prospero said .     and you made this threat .     kresh asked     we did  couching it in the most polite terms possible      prospero said .     however  he did not seem at all upset or perturbed by it .         i would go further than that     caliban said .     he seemed rather amused by the idea  as if he didn   t for a moment think we would carry it out .        and would you have .     kresh asked .  the two robots looked at each other  and then caliban spoke .     we were to meet the next day and begin preparing our materials for release     caliban said .     then we heard that grieg was dead  and of course canceled the plan .         how did you get your information .      fredda asked .     slowly     prospero said .     gradually .  the rustbacking network is full of tipsters and rumormongers .  and there is an old axiom to the effect that those who would seek the truth should follow the money .  we studied a great number of transactions  legal and otherwise .  they taught us much .        tell me some of what was in that material     kresh said .     no  better still  let me tell you .  you had proof that simcor beddle here was taking settler money  perhaps without knowing that he was taking it .         but i      beddle began .     quiet  beddle     kresh said .     you   re not governor yet .  right now you   ll speak when spoken to .      he turned back to the robots .     you also had proof that sero phrost and tonya welton were in the smuggling business together .      another little stir of reaction  but phrost and welton both had the sense to keep quiet .     proof that tierlaw verick   s bidding group had been bribing government officials .  verick was also linked to the rustbackers  along with half the planet  it seems to me  but i doubt you would divulge that little tidbit .        now just a moment     verick protested .     i did no such         quiet  verick .      kresh said .     and you also had proof that commander devray and captain melloy here were both in possession of proof of criminal acts in high places and were not acting upon that information .     devray and melloy seemed about to protest  but kresh cut them off .     not a word  either of you     he said  with enough steel in his voice to silence both of them .     both of you did have such information  and both of you informed governor grieg of it .  justen  you told him about tierlaw   s bribery  and  cinta  you told him about sero phrost smuggling settler hardware and passing the proceeds to the ironheads .  i   ve seen grieg   s files .  i know .  grieg didn   t do anything about the information  either  for the same reasons you both kept quiet .        and what reason would that be .     phrost demanded  daring to speak .     he was afraid that if he pulled on one thread  everything else would unravel      kresh said .      arrest sero phrost  and phrost would implicate tonya welton .  grieg needed welton   s support .  grieg also knew the spacer bid on the control system would probably collapse without phrost .  arrest verick  and grieg knew he would lose the settler bid on the system .     devray looked confused .     but wait a second .  the robots just said that grieg didn   t seem to care if they blew the lid off everything .        exactly     kresh said .     because  on the night he died  he knew it didn   t matter anymore .  he had made his final decisions about the control system  and about the new law robots .  he was going to announce them the next day .  what the robots were doing was threatening to sweep all his enemies out of the way  and threatening to do so at the exact moment he no longer needed to keep his enemies happy .      kresh turned toward the robots .     he couldn   t smear his opponents without making himself look very  very bad .  but you two could .  you were threatening him with the biggest favor of his political career .        it couldn   t all be good for him     melloy protested .     with that much mudslinging set loose  he would have gotten messed up a little himself .  someone would have tried to fight back .        fight back at who .  the robots .     kresh asked .     they were the ones about to release the material  not grieg .  but even if you   re right  and you probably are  grieg would have accepted any amount of damage to his prestige if it meant getting rid of simcor beddle .        and you are saying grieg no longer cared because he had made his decisions     caliban said .     might i ask what those decisions were  and if you intend to abide by them .        i do not wish to answer either of those questions  just at the moment     kresh said .     i have a rather cryptic note grieg made to himself .  i believe it contains his answer .  but i don   t need to decipher the note .  tierlaw verick here has done it for me .        he told you what grieg had decided .     fredda asked .     when .  i never heard it .     tierlaw verick opened his mouth to protest again  but then thought better of it .     good thinking  verick     kresh said .     if i were you  i wouldn   t say one thing more .        but what did he say .     fredda asked .     what did i miss .        you heard everything i did     kresh said .     and his reactions told me what grieg   s decisions were .         then he was telling the truth     caliban said .     when he came out of grieg   s office  he told prospero and myself we were going to kingdom come .  an archaic reference to the hereafter .  he was telling us that grieg had decided to destroy the new law robots .        and that scared the hell out of you  and you went into grieg full of bluff and bluster and threatened him before he even had a chance to tell you he intended to destroy you .      kresh shook his head .     a mistake .  a very serious mistake on your part .         a mistake in what way .     caliban asked .     and you claim to be high function beings     donald said  speaking for the first time as he stepped down from his wall niche .     if you were true robots  human behavior would have been your constant study  and you would not have erred .  can you truly understand so little of human nature .        what do you mean .     caliban asked .     governor kresh  is he speaking with your authority .        donald is speaking for himself     kresh said     but he   s getting it right for all of that .  go on  donald .        it might be logical to expect governor grieg to tell you his decision in the same way no matter what that decision was  but that is not the human way .  it does not account for the governor   s personality .  to expect him to act in such a way takes no account of the emotions of pleasure in bringing good news  or the embarrassment and sorrow humans feel when reporting bad news for which they are responsible .  it would not be in grieg   s character to call you into his office and tell you he intended to wipe you out .  you would have found out by seeing it on the news  or by written notice  or by getting a blaster shot through the head .        what are you saying .     prospero demanded .     that you should have known his decision would be in your favor as soon as he asked to see you face to face     donald said .     and when verick told you that you were going to kingdom come  he was just telling what grieg had told him     kresh said .     except he got it wrong .  grieg had been looking for a third way  some solution between tolerating the current intolerable state of affairs and extermination .  and he found it .  he found it and told it to verick .        i still do not understand     prospero said .     but now i do     caliban said  sitting stock still  staring straight ahead .     now i do .  valhalla .  grieg told verick he was sending all the new law robots to valhalla .  to someone living on inferno  that is a place name .  it is the place to which all new law robots wish to escape  a hidden place as far away from human interference as possible .  but verick thought the governor was speaking in metaphor  speaking of the old earth legend from which the name is derived .  valhalla  the hall of the gods  where those who have died in battle will live .  the afterlife .  kingdom come .         so you threatened the man who had found a way to save you     kresh said .      and threatened to do the thing he would most love to have done  but dared not do himself .  and  at a guess  that appealed to his sense of humor .  so he told you to leave and not come back  hoping to have the public hear all about friend beddle   s finances in the next day or so .  the irony is that you had no motive for grieg   s murder  even if you thought you did .        so you still have every reason to suspect us     caliban said .     on the contrary  i am absolutely certain you two had nothing to do with the murder of chanto grieg     kresh said .     it sounds like you   ve got this whole thing figured out     melloy said  a bit grumpily .     i do     kresh said .     so tell us about it     cinta said .     if that wouldn   t be too much trouble .        too much trouble was exactly what it was     kresh said .     fredda pointed that out .  the plan was too intricate  too theatrical .  that   s what i should have seen from the start .  the plan had too many people in it  too many moving parts  too many bits of complicated coordination and timing  especially with someone as unreliable and plainly expendable as ottley bissal at the center of it .  the plan required an assassin willing to do what he was told if the paycheck was big enough  someone willing to perform a despicable act  and yet someone foolish enough to trust the plotter who intended to kill him .  those are not job requirements that produce quality applicants .  whoever took on the job was bound to be someone who made mistakes  who got sloppy .  someone like bissal .  that should have told me something .  it should have told me the plan wouldn   t work .  and sure enough  it didn   t .        but grieg was killed     fredda protested .     not in the way the mastermind intended     kresh said .     not in the way tierlaw verick planned .     verick jumped up  and was halfway to kresh before donald could intercept him .  donald pinned the man   s arms to his side and dragged him back to his seat .     it was the basic problem of the whole case     kresh said .     we knew  even once fredda spotted bissal  that we didn   t have the real killer .  bissal was so obviously someone else   s creature .  but whoever had sent him  and sent all the other conspirators along  had done a good job of staying hidden .  it could have been anyone with access to the right sort of technology  and the wrong sort of people .  it could have been anyone in this room .  it could even have been me  i suppose .  but it was you  verick .        you   re crazy  kresh     verick half shouted .     how could i have done it .  i didn   t even know grieg was dead until one of the guards on my room told me .        and it must have been a relief when the guard made that slip     kresh said .     you could stop acting .  it made it that much less likely that you would make a slip .  good as you were  you knew you could not keep it up forever .  and you were good .  you even managed to fool donald   s lie detector system  and that requires some impressive training .  our files said you dabbled in theatrics .  we did not know just how good an actor you were .  the trouble was you   d made your slip already .  one you couldn   t avoid .        and what slip might that be .     verick demanded .     you said there were two robots standing in the hallway when he came out of this office .  not three .        but there were only two     caliban protested .     there was only prospero and myself .        but then where the devil was the door sentry robot .     kresh demanded .     it was there  standing in front of the door  shot through the chest  when i checked the upper floor after discovering grieg   s body .  sprs on other duties move around  but a door sentry robot does not go off post .  not unless it received orders to do so  from someone in authority to give orders .        so tierlaw didn   t notice a robot     cinta said  who seemed to have taken it upon herself to defend her fellow settler .     so what .  you spacers always ignore robots .  that   s not enough to convict a man of murder .         tierlaw is not a spacer  but a settler     donald said .     he has a pronounced aversion to robots  and very definitely noticed the other two standing outside the door .  he gave a detailed and accurate description of prospero and caliban .        so what are you saying .     devray said .     i   m saying that tierlaw ordered the sapper  the spr sentry robot  to be out of position .  but a sapper won   t take orders from just anyone .  he  or a subordinate  more likely  must have gotten to the robot sometime before and used some rather sophisticated order giving to convince the sentry that orders from him  from tierlaw  took precedence over everything else  even guarding grieg .         is that possible .     devray asked .     yes     fredda said .     if the spr did not believe grieg was in any particular danger  so that first law potential was reduced  and if it saw tierlaw as its owner  thus enhancing second law potential  then yes  tierlaw could have given the order for the sentry to clear off and come back later .         it   s thin     cinta said .     and i don   t see what it has to do with anything .         it is thin     kresh admitted .     i knew that as soon as i figured it out .  i knew i needed proof  and i found it .  but there is more .  caliban and prospero were witnesses that tierlaw came out the inner door to grieg   s office .  after hours visitors to his office always used the outer side door .  but tierlaw needed to let bissal in .  so he got grieg to open the inner door somehow .        but he did not let bissal in .  he let us in     caliban said .     and why would he let bissal see his face .     cinta demanded .     he wouldn   t let bissal see him     kresh said  heading over to his desk .     he didn   t .      he unsealed the evidence box and pulled out a pocket communicator  and a thin piece of black metal in the shape of a flattened triangle .     i found these in your room  verick  the one you stayed in the night of the murder .  you   re good at hiding things .  the room had been searched twice before i went over it .  but i knew what i was looking for  and that makes a great deal of difference .  and before you can protest that these were planted  a crime scene observer robot witnessed the search and recorded it .        i recognize the communicator  but what   s the other thing .     fredda asked .     it   s one of these     kresh said .  he went to the inner door of the office and used the scanner panel to open it .  once it was open  he took the piece of metal and set it in the frame of the door .  it stayed there of its own accord .  kresh stepped back  and the door closed  but not all the way .  there was a barely discernible crack between the frame and the sliding door .  kresh got his fingers into the crack and pulled .  it took a bit of effort  but he managed to get the door open .  kresh took the door wedge out of the frame  crossed the room  and put it back in the evidence box .     grieg was supposed to be killed right here     he said .     in this office .  verick would set the door wedge on his way out  with a little practice  they   re easy to set surreptitiously .  tierlaw would order the office door sentry robot back into position  and then signal bissal  waiting in the basement  to turn on the range restrictor signal that would deactivate the spr robots .  then tierlaw could simply walk out of the house  unobserved  while bissal came up out of the basement  came into the office  and shot grieg .  bissal would remove the door wedge  and go on with the rest of the plot  destroying the robots to hide the restrictors  and then escaping to the warehouse  where he would hide until things cooled off  except the food left for him there was poisoned .  he must have died within a few hours of grieg .        that   s the craziest plan i   ve ever heard     cinta protested .     it could never work .        and it didn   t      devray said .     it was crazy  cinta  but think what we would have found if it had worked .  grieg dead behind a locked door  fifty wrecked security robots  and an assassin who simply vanishes without a trace .  a few days later  a warehouse blows up and bums down  and no one ever thinks to connect the two .  things are bad enough as they are .  people are scared .  just imagine the panic  the chaos  if the murder had been as smooth  as perfect as it was supposed to be .        but things went wrong     kresh said .     things went wrong .  the two robots are waiting outside the door  so you can   t set the door wedge  could you  verick .  and you couldn   t use your communicator in front of the robots  either .  so you slip into a vacant room and contact bissal from there  telling him what had gone wrong .  you tell him to go to plan b  killing grieg in his room .     but then you realize that you couldn   t leave the vacant room .  at a guess  one of the sentries on random patrol takes up a post in the hall .  if you leave the room  that would raise the alarm .  so you had to stay there  in that room  until the robots left  until you heard grieg go to bed .  you could signal bissal .  then bissal activates the range restrictor signal  and the sentries go dead .  but even then you can   t leave  because bissal has come up into the house .  suppose he saw you  and knew who you were .  he   d have a hold over you .  suppose he tried to blackmail you instead of going off to eat his poison at the warehouse .  no  you could not risk that .  so you decide to wait until you heard bissal leave the house .     but bissal had wasted most of his blaster   s charge  and he realizes he isn   t going to have enough power left to be able to shoot all the robots .  so bissal decides to remove the restrictors from half of them by hand  and it takes forever .  at long last he is done  and destroys the blaster and the trojan robot in the basement  and heads off on his way .  at last you can go .     except suddenly you can see the sky is full of police vehicles of one sort or another .  the police have discovered huthwitz   s body .  you still can   t leave .  then i arrive  and rush up the stairs .  grieg has been discovered long before you expected .     suddenly you hear new footsteps in the halls and realize they are searching room to room .  you hide under the bed or something during the first  cursory search .  but you know they will search again  or at the very least stumble across you .  you can   t hide in the one room forever .  so you very cleverly brazen it out .     you hide the incriminating door wedge and communicator  and then dress in the pajamas left in the room .  maybe you can talk your way out of it .  it   s a long shot  but the only chance you have .  you wander out into the hallway  and pretend you   re a house guest who   s slept through the whole thing .  donald here snatches you up .  and you very nearly got away with it .  until cinta melloy here decided to look into whether grieg ever had overnight guests  and found out he never did .  we never thought to check the other side of the point  by the way .  did you have a hotel reservation in limbo city .  if  or rather when  we do find one  how will you explain it .     verick opened his mouth and shut it again  and swallowed hard  and then at last the words came out .      and what was my motive supposed to be in this lunatic scheme .     he asked  his voice tight and calm and strained .     what was all this supposed to accomplish for me .        profit     kresh said .     huge profit .  money .  not a motive we spacers cops are used to .  i didn   t even consider it at first .  money hasn   t meant much for a while  though it   s started to again .  you went into that meeting with kresh to find out if he had accepted your control system design .  if he told you he had chosen your system  you would not signal bissal  there would be no attack  and bissal would slip away when he could .  if grieg told you phrost had the job  well then  a terrifying assassination of the governor might well sow just enough distrust of robots that a new governor would not go with a robot design  or else it might be easier to bribe the new incumbent .  you might even already know beddle wasn   t above taking settler money .  you might even have had some dealings with him .  did you offer grieg a bribe  by the way .  he was half expecting that you would .      verick screamed and lunged  and donald had to struggle a bit to hold him down .     i   ll take that as a yes     said governor kresh .     commander devray  perhaps you could take this man into custody .             and that is that     kresh said  after melloy and welton were gone and devray and his rangers took a sobbing  hysterical tierlaw verick away .     you two are free to go     he said to beddle and phrost .     but what about the charges against us .     beddle asked .     what charges .     kresh asked .     no one has filed any that i   m aware of .  i don   t intend to .         that   s very generous of you  governor     said sero phrost .     the hell it is     kresh said .     i think i can do more damage to the two of you by letting you stay in the public eye .  after all  everything that was said in this room today is bound to reach the public  somehow .  someone is bound to leak something  wouldn   t you agree  prospero .  stories  at the very least rumors  about smuggling and bribery and money laundering are bound to float to the surface .  i have a feeling that tonya welton is going to be able to explain away a lot of things you two can   t .  oh  and beddle  i   m looking forward to your announcement for governor .  it should be an exciting campaign .        but i  i         quiet  simcor     phrost said .     don   t give him any more ammunition .  let   s get out of here .      the two men got up and left  and kresh was glad to push the door button and get them out of his sight .     they   re down now  but they won   t stay down     said fredda leving .     you know that  don   t you .        oh  yes  of course     kresh said .     phrost still has a lot of friends  and a lot of money  and there are plenty of true believers in the ironheads who   ll forgive beddle anything .  but this way  they   re damaged goods .  if i brought charges against them  they could accuse me of politicizing the courts  or something .  better to let the rumors leak out and do their damage .     kresh stood up and stretched and looked thoughtful for a moment .      you know  i   ve just had an odd thought      he said .     of all the cases i   ve ever dealt with that concerned robots  i think this is the first one i   ve ever had where the three laws weren   t involved somewhere in the solution .        but they were  governor kresh     said caliban .     they were involved most intimately .        in what way .            a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm         caliban said  repeating the first law .     verick relied most heavily upon spacer faith in that statement .  in a sense  he set fifty robots with an incomplete first law loose in the governor   s residence .  they were shut down  turned off  inactive .  through inaction  they allowed a human being to come to harm .         it is an interesting feature of the first law     donald said .     i myself experienced a most unpleasant reaction when i realized that i could have saved grieg if i had been with him  even though it would have been impossible for me to be with him while i was performing my normal duties .  no doubt there are many human beings in the universe who are being injured at this very moment .  though logically i realize there is nothing i can do about it  i must admit i find it a most disturbing notion .  and it is part and parcel of the first law .  the law is couched in such strong and solid absolutes that it cannot possibly match up with the greys and uncertainties and limitations of everyday life .        donald     fredda said .     that almost sounds like a criticism of the absolute nature of the three laws .        by no means  dr .  leving .  it is a criticism of the disorderly nature of everyday life .     fredda laughed and turned to caliban .      and what about you  caliban .  what about the laws and you .  have you learned more on that score .        a year ago  my accidental escape from the lab  and the subsequent pursuit caused me to integrate my own internal law  to protect myself .  but if i pursued self preservation at all cost  prospero and i would have fled purgatory .  i have no doubt that the ensuing search for us would have cost many new law robots their lives .  i believe that i have integrated a new internal law set  cooperate for the greater good .  protect myself only when it does not endanger vitally important cooperation .     donald turned toward caliban .     no doubt you are aware a symbolic notational representation of that statement would be remarkably similar to the second and third laws .        similar     caliban agreed .     but not identical .  my version acknowledges the disorderliness of the everyday world  and  i believe  allows me to deal with it more successfully than a three law or new law robot .        enough .     kresh said .     grieg complained about the three laws ruling his life  and i   m beginning to see what he meant .  can   t we talk about something else .        all right  let   s talk about the control center      fredda said .     i don   t see how you can choose either the spacer or settler design now .  both bids are too badly tainted .        i know     kresh said .     grieg chose the spacer design  but i   m not so sure he was right to do so .  from what i   ve been able to see  they   re both first rate designs .  the people on both sides were corrupt  but their machinery was fine .  i   m going to have to think mighty hard about it  but my gut reaction is to build both systems  if we can afford it .  i don   t quite like the idea of the whole planet   s weather being controlled by a robot  or by whoever happens to be pushing the buttons that day on the human controlled system .  if we had both  there would be a system of checks and balances that neither would have on its own .  grieg was a great one for finding a third way .  maybe i can do the same .        but what about grieg   s other decision  concerning the new law robots .     prospero asked .     will you reverse that decision as well .  what   s going to happen to us .  will you leave things as they are  or send us to valhalla  or will it be kingdom come after all .     donald spoke before kresh could reply .     sir  i must urge you to consider the danger and chaos the new law robots have produced .  you cannot let it continue .  you cannot let them survive .     kresh gave caliban and prospero a long look  and then let out a long sigh .     oh  it   s tempting     he said .     very tempting indeed to be rid of you once and for all .  but i can   t get up and announce to the world that i   m scrapping one of chanto grieg   s most daring experiments .  not when the man isn   t cold in his grave yet .  i have to let you live  out of respect for his memory .      kresh was silent for a moment .      and yet donald is right  too .  we can   t afford any more of the headaches you new law types cause .  so  damn it all  i suppose it has to be valhalla     he said .  prospero bowed slightly and looked kresh straight in the eye .     thank you  governor .  you have let my people go .     the next morning governor alvar kresh and fredda leving went out for a stroll in the sunlit grounds of the winter residence .  the rains were over  a gentle breeze was blowing and there was a fresh scrubbed feel to the world  a far cry from the dust choked deserts that surrounded hades .  nature felt alive and vigorous .  the morning  the whole world  seemed full of possibilities .  this was how inferno was supposed to be  kresh thought .  a living world .  this is how it   s going to be  if i have anything to do with it .  suddenly he felt a sense of purpose stronger than any he had ever felt before .  i   ll take care of you  he thought  and it was a promise he made to the world of inferno itself .  i will heal you  and make you well .     so now it   s over     fredda said .     or is it .        what .  the case .  there   s some tidying up to do  but yes  it   s over .        there are an awful lot of loose ends to clear up      fredda pointed out .     we don   t know a lot of things about the conspiracy  how exactly it was put together  or how bissal was recruited  or how and when the sprs were tampered with .        true     kresh said .     there   s a lot of detail work to do  the sort of thing donald is very good at .  probably i   ll put him in charge of it .  but in a sense  at least  it is only a question of detail .  tierlaw bought the services of a rustbacking mob  which one  we don   t know  but it was almost certainly the one that was paying off huthwitz .  cinta melloy almost had them  and she lost them when they got spooked by grieg   s murder .  but you found the killer  and i found the mastermind .  working from both ends toward the middle  and with cinta   s leads  we   ll roll them up fast enough .  besides  if i pack off the new laws to valhalla  there won   t be any rustbacking .  once the business collapses and there   s no money  there   ll be a lot of people ready to talk .  we   ll get them .        you   re right  i suppose     fredda said .     so it is over .        and it   s just begun     kresh said  looking her in the eye .  he did not dare say anything more .  he was not even sure he knew exactly what he meant  but the way she smiled back at him told him she had understood him precisely .  the two of them walked in silence for a time  enjoying the moment  considering the possibilities .     it   s a beautiful morning     fredda said at last .     i never expected to see such lovely weather on purgatory .        nor did i     kresh said .     but wouldn   t this be a fine world if we could expect it .     he stood there for a moment  drinking it all in .  but then he turned back  toward the residence  toward his new duties .     come on  fredda     he said  as he reached out and took her by the hand .     there   s a lot of work for us to do .
