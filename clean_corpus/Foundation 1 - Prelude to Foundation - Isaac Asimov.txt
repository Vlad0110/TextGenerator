prelude  to  foundation  by isaac asimov      author   s note    when i wrote    foundation      which appeared in the may      issue of astounding science faction  i had no idea that i had begun a series of stories that would eventually grow into six volumes and a total of          words  so far  .  nor did i have any idea that it would be unified with my series of short stories and novels involving robots and my novels involving the galactic empire for a grand total  so far  of fourteen volumes and a total of about             words .   you will see  if you study the publication dates of these books  that there was a twenty five year hiatus between      and       during which i did not add to this series .  this was not because i had stopped writing .  indeed  i wrote full speed throughout the quarter century  but i wrote other things .  that i returned to the series in      was not my own notion but was the result of a combination of pressures from readers and publishers that eventually became overwhelming .   in any case  the situation has become sufficiently complicated for me to feel that the readers might welcome a kind of guide to the series  since they were not written in the order in which  perhaps  they should be read .   the fourteen books  all published by doubleday  offer a kind of history of the future  which is  perhaps  not completely consistent  since i did not plan consistency to begin with .  the chronological order of the books  in terms of future history  and not of publication date   is as follows       .  the complete robot        .  this is a collection of thirty one robot short stories published between      and      and includes every story in my earlier collection   .  robot        .  only one robot short story has been written since this collection appeared .  that is    robot dreams      which has not yet appeared in any doubleday collection .     .  the caves of steel        .  this is the first of my robot novels .     .  the naked sun        .  the second robot novel .     .  the robots of dawn         .  the third robot novel .     .  robots and empire        .  the fourth robot novel .     .  the currents of space        .  this is the first of my empire novels .     .  the stars  like dust        .  the second empire novel .     .  pebble in the sky        .  the third empire novel .     .  prelude to foundation        .  this is the first foundation novel  although it is the latest written  so far  .      .  foundation        .  the second foundation novel .  actually  it is a collection of four stories  originally published between      and       plus an introductory section written for the book in      .      .  foundation and empire        .  the third foundation novel  made up of two stories  originally published in      .      .  second foundation        .  the fourth foundation novel  made up of two stories  originally published in      and      .      .  foundations edge        .  the fifth foundation novel .      .  foundation and earth        .  the sixth foundation novel .     will i add additional books to the series .  i might .  there is room for a book between robots and empire     and the currents of space     and between prelude to foundation     and foundation      and of course between others as well .  and then i can follow foundation and earth      with additional volumes    as many as i like .   naturally  there   s got to be some limit  for i don   t expect to live forever  but i do intend to hang on as long as possible .     mathematician    cleon i     .   .   .  the last galactic emperor of the entun dynasty .  he was born in the year         of the galactic era  the same year in which hari seldon was born .   it is thought that seldon   s birthdate  which some consider doubtful  may have been adjusted to match that of cleon  whom seldon  soon after his arrival on trantor  is supposed to have encountered .    having succeeded to the imperial throne in         at the age of twenty two  cleon i   s reign represented a curious interval of quiet in those troubled times .  this is undoubtedly due to the skills of his chief of staff  eto demerzel  who so carefully obscured himself from public record that little is known about him .   cleon himself  .   .   .   encylopedia galactica     all quotations from the encyclopedia galactica here reproduced are taken from the    th edition  published        fe by the encyclopedia galactica publishing co .   terminus  with permission of the publishers .        .     suppressing a small yawn  cleon said     demerzel  have you by any chance ever heard of a man named hari seldon .      cleon had been emperor for just over ten years and there were times at state occasions when  dressed in the necessary robes and regalia  he could manage to look stately .  he did so  for instance  in the holograph of himself that stood in the niche in the wall behind him .  it was placed so that it clearly dominated the other niches holding the holographs of several of his ancestors .   the holograph was not a totally honest one  for though cleon   s hair was light brown in hologram and reality alike  it was a bit thicker in the holograph .  there was a certain asymmetry to his real face  for the left side of his upper lip raised itself a bit higher than the right side  and this was somehow not evident in the holograph .  and if he had stood up and placed himself beside the holograph  he would have been seen to be   centimeters under the   .    meter height that the image portrayed    and perhaps a bit stouter .   of course  the holograph was the official coronation portrait and he had been younger then .  he still looked young and rather handsome  too  and when he was not in the pitiless grip of official ceremony  there was a kind of vague good nature about his face .   demerzel said  with the tone of respect that he carefully cultivated     hari seldon .  it is an unfamiliar name to me  sire .  ought i to know of him .         the minister of science mentioned him to me last night .  i thought you might .      demerzel frowned slightly  but only very slightly  for one does not frown in the imperial presence .     the minister of science  sire  should have spoken of this man to me as chief of staff .  if you are to be bombarded from every side       cleon raised his hand and demerzel stopped at once .     please  demerzel  one can   t stand on formality at all times .  when i passed the minister at last night   s reception and exchanged a few words with him  he bubbled over .  i could not refuse to listen and i was glad i had  for it was interesting .         in what way interesting  sire .         well  these are not the old days when science and mathematics were all the rage .  that sort of thing seems to have died down somehow  perhaps because all the discoveries have been made  don   t you think .  apparently  however  interesting things can still happen .  at least i was told it was interesting .         by the minister of science  sire .         yes .  he said that this hari seldon had attended a convention of mathematicians held here in trantor    they do this every ten years  for some reason    and he said that he had proved that one could foretell the future mathematically .      demerzel permitted himself a small smile .     either the minister of science  a man of little acumen  is mistaken or the mathematician is .  surely  the matter of foretelling the future is a children   s dream of magic .         is it  demerzel .  people believe in such things .         people believe in many things  sire .         but they believe in such things .  therefore   . it doesn   t matter whether the forecast of the future is true or not .  if a mathematician should predict a long and happy reign for me  a time of peace and prosperity for the empire    eh  would that not be well .         it would be pleasant to hear  certainly  but what would it accomplish  sire .         but surely if people believe this  they would act on that belief .  many a prophecy  by the mere force of its being believed  is transmuted to fact .  these are    self fulfilling prophecies .     indeed  now that i think of it  it was you who once explained this to me .      demerzel said     i believe i did  sire .     his eyes were watching the emperor carefully  as though to see how far he might go on his own .     still  if that be so  one could have any person make the prophecy .          not all persons would be equally believed  demerzel .  a mathematician  however  who could back his prophecy with mathematical formulas and terminology  might be understood by no one and yet believed by everyone .      demerzel said     as usual  sire  you make good sense .  we live in troubled times and it would be worthwhile to calm them in a way that would require neither money nor military effort  which  in recent history  have done little good and much harm .         exactly  demerzel      said the emperor with excitement .     reel in this hari seldon .  you tell me you have your strings stretching to every part of this turbulent world  even where my forces dare not go .  pull on one of those strings  then  and bring in this mathematician .  let me see him .         i will do so  sire      said demerzel  who had already located seldon and who made a mental note to commend the minister of science for a job well done .       .     hari seldon did not make an impressive appearance at this time .  like the emperor cleon i  he was thirty two years old  but he was only   .    meters tall .  his face was smooth and cheerful  his hair dark brown  almost black  and his clothing had the unmistakable touch of provinciality about it .   to anyone in later times who knew of hari seldon only as a legendary demigod  it would seem almost sacrilegious for him not to have white hair  not to have an old lined face  a quiet smile radiating wisdom  not to be seated in a wheelchair .  even then  in advanced old age  his eyes had been cheerful  however .  there was that .   and his eyes were particularly cheerful now  for his paper had been given at the decennial convention .  it had even aroused some interest in a distant sort of way and old osterfith had nodded his head at him and had said     ingenious  young man .  most ingenious .     which  coming from osterfith  was satisfactory .  most satisfactory .   but now there was a new  and quite unexpected  development and seldon wasn   t sure whether it should increase his cheer and intensify his satisfaction or not .   he stared at the tall young man in uniform  the spaceship and sun neatly placed on the left side of his tunic .      lieutenant alban wellis      said the officer of the emperor   s guard before putting away his identification .     will you come with me now  sir .      wellis was armed  of course .  there were two other guardsmen waiting outside his door .  seldon knew he had no choice  for all the other   s careful politeness  but there was no reason he could not seek information .  he said     to see the emperor .         to be brought to the palace  sir .  that   s the extent of my instructions .          but why .         i was not told why  sir .  and i have my strict instructions that you must come with me  one way or another .         but this seems as though i am being arrested .  i have done nothing to warrant that .         say  rather  that it seems you are being given an escort of honor  if you delay me no further .      seldon delayed no further .  he pressed his lips together  as though to block of further questions  nodded his head  and stepped forward .  even if he was going to meet the emperor and to receive imperial commendation  he found no joy in it .  he was for the empire  that is  for the worlds of humanity in peace and union but he was not for the emperor .   the lieutenant walked ahead  the other two behind .  seldon smiled at those he passed and managed to look unconcerned .  outside the hotel they climbed into an official ground car .   seldon ran his hand over the upholstery  he had never been in anything so ornate .     they were in one of the wealthiest sections of trantor .  the dome was high enough here to give a sensation of being in the open and one could swear  even one such as hari seldon  who had been born and brought up on an open world  that they were in sunlight .  you could see no sun and no shadows  but the air was light and fragrant .   and then it passed and the dome curved down and the walls narrowed in and soon they were moving along an enclosed tunnel  marked periodically with the spaceship and sun and so clearly reserved  seldon thought  for official vehicles .   a door opened and the ground car sped through .  when the door closed behind them  they were in the open  the true  the real open .  there were     square kilometers of the only stretch of open land on trantor and on it stood the imperial palace .  seldon would have liked a chance to wander through that open land  not because of the palace  but because it also contained the galactic university and  most intriguing of all  the galactic library .   and yet  in passing from the enclosed world of trantor into the open patch of wood and parkland  he had passed into a world in which clouds dimmed the sky and a chill wind rued his shirt .  he pressed the contact that closed the ground car   s window .   it was a dismal day outside .       .     seldon was not at all sure he would meet the emperor .  at best  he would meet some official in the fourth or fifth echelon who would claim to speak for the emperor .   how many people ever did see the emperor .  in person  rather than on holovision .  how many people saw the real  tangible emperor  an emperor who never left the imperial grounds that he  seldon  was now rolling over .   the number was vanishingly small .  twentyfive million inhabited worlds  each with its cargo of a billion human beings or more  and among all those quadrillions of human beings  how many had  or would ever  lay eyes on the living emperor .  a thousand .   and did anyone care .  the emperor was no more than a symbol of empire  like the spaceship and sun but far less pervasive  far less real .  it was his soldiers and his officials  crawling everywhere  that now represented an empire that had become a dead weight upon its people  not the emperor .   so it was that when seldon was ushered into a moderately sized  lavishly furnished room and found a young looking man sitting on the edge of a table in a windowed alcove  one foot on the ground and one swinging over the edge  he found himself wondering that any official should be looking at him in so blandly good natured a way .  he had already experienced the fact  over and over  that government officials  and particularly those in the imperial service looked grave at all times  as though bearing the weight of the entire galaxy on their shoulders .  and it seemed the lower in importance they were  the graver and more threatening their expression .   this  then  might be an official so high in the scale  with the sun of power so bright upon him  that he felt no need of countering it with clouds of frowning .   seldon wasn   t sure how impressed he ought to be  but he felt that it would be best to remain silent and let the other speak first .   the official said     you are hari seldon  i believe .  the mathematician .       seldon responded with a minimal    yes  sir      and waited again .   the young man waved an arm .     it should be    sire      but i hate ceremony .  it   s all i get and i weary of it .  we are alone  so i will pamper myself and eschew ceremony .  sit down  professor .      halfway through the speech  seldon realized that he was speaking to the emperor cleon  first of that name  and he felt the wind go out of him .  there was a faint resemblance  now that he looked  to the official holograph that appeared constantly in the news  but in that holograph  cleon was always dressed imposingly  seemed taller  nobler  frozen faced .   and here he was  the original of the holograph  and somehow he appeared to be quite ordinary .   seldon did not budge .   the emperor frowned slightly and  with the habit of command present even in the attempt to abolish it  at least temporarily  said peremptorily     i said     sit down      man .  that chair .  quickly .      seldon sat down  quite speechless .  he could not even bring himself to say     yes  sire .      cleon smiled .     that   s better .  now we can talk like two fellow human beings  which  after all  is what we are once ceremony is removed .  eh  my man .      seldon said cautiously     if your imperial majesty is content to say so  then it is so .         oh  come  why are you so cautious .  i want to talk to you on equal terms .  it is my pleasure to do so .  humor me .         yes  sire .         a simple    yes      man .  is there no way i can reach you .      cleon stared at seldon and seldon thought it was a lively and interested stare .   finally the emperor said     you don   t look like a mathematician .      at last  seldon found himself able to smile .     i don   t know what a mathematician is suppose to look like  your imp       cleon raised a cautioning hand and seldon choked off the honorific .   cleon said     white haired  i suppose .  bearded  perhaps .  old  certainly .         yet even mathematicians must be young to begin with .         but they are then without reputation .  by the time they obtrude themselves on the notice of the galaxy  they are as i have described .         i am without reputation  i   m afraid .         yet you spoke at this convention they held here .         a great many of us did .  some were younger than myself .  few of us were granted any attention whatever .         your talk apparently attracted the attention of some of my officials .  i am given to understand that you believe it possible to predict the future .      seldon suddenly felt weary .  it seemed as though this misinterpretation of his theory was constantly going to occur .  perhaps he should not have presented his paper .   he said     not quite  actually .  what i have done is much more limited than that .  in many systems  the situation is such that under some conditions chaotic events take place .  that means that  given a particular starting point  it is impossible to predict outcomes .  this is true even in some quite simple systems  but the more complex a system  the more likely it is to become chaotic .  it has always been assumed that anything as complicated as human society would quickly become chaotic and  therefore  unpredictable .  what i have done  however  is to show that  in studying human society  it is possible to choose a starting point and to make appropriate assumptions that will suppress the chaos .  that will make it possible to predict the future  not in full detail  of course  but in broad sweeps  not with certainty  but with calculable probabilities .      the emperor  who had listened carefully  said     but doesn   t that mean that you have shown how to predict the future .         again  not quite .  i have showed that it is theoretically possible  but no more .  to do more  we would actually have to choose a correct starting point  make correct assumptions  and then find ways of carrying through calculations in a finite time .  nothing in my mathematical argument tells us how to do any of this .  and even if we could do it all  we would  at best  only assess probabilities .  that is not the same as predicting the future  it is merely a guess at what is likely to happen .  every successful politician  businessman  or human being of any calling must make these estimates of the future and do it fairly well or he or she would not be successful .         they do it without mathematics .         true .  they do it by intuition .         with the proper mathematics  anyone would be able to assess the probabilities .  it wouldn   t take the rare human being who is successful because of a remarkable intuitive sense .         true again  but i have merely shown that mathematical analysis is possible  i have not shown it to be practical .         how can something be possible  yet not practical .         it is theoretically possible for me to visit each world of the galaxy and greet each person on each world .  however  it would take far longer to do this than i have years to live and  even if i was immortal  the rate at which new human beings are being born is greater than the rate at which i could interview the old and  even more to the point  old human beings would die in great numbers before i could ever get to them .         and is this sort of thing true of your mathematics of the future .      seldon hesitated  then went on .     it might be that the mathematics would take too long to work out  even if one had a computer the size of the universe working at hyperspatial velocities .  by the time any answer had been received  enough years would have elapsed to alter the situation so grossly as to make the answer meaningless .         why cannot the process be simplified .     cleon asked sharply .      your imperial majesty      seldon felt the emperor growing more formal as the answers grew less to his liking and responded with greater formality of his own    consider the manner in which scientists have dealt with subatomic particles .  there are enormous numbers of these  each moving or vibrating in random and unpredictable manner  but this chaos turns out to have an underlying order  so that we can work out a quantum mechanics that answers all the questions we know how to ask .  in studying society  we place human beings in the place of subatomic particles  but now there is the added factor of the human mind .  particles move mindlessly  human beings do not .  to take into account the various attitudes and impulses of mind adds so much complexity that there lacks time to take care of all of it .         could not mind  as well as mindless motion  have an underlying order .         perhaps .  my mathematical analysis implies that order must underlie everything  however disorderly it may appear to be  but it does not give any hint as to how this underlying order may be found .  consider twenty five million worlds  each with its overall characteristics and culture  each being significantly different from all the rest  each containing a billion or more human beings who each have an individual mind  and all the worlds interacting in innumerable ways and combinations .  however theoretically possible a psychohistorical analysis may be  it is not likely that it can be done in any practical sense .         what do you mean    psychohistorical    .         i refer to the theoretical assessment of probabilities concerning the future as    psychohistory .          the emperor rose to his feet suddenly  strode to the other end of the room  turned  strode back  and stopped before the still sitting seldon .      stand up .     he commanded .   seldon rose and looked up at the somewhat taller emperor .  he strove to keep his gaze steady .   cleon finally said     this psychohistory of yours  .   .   .  if it could be made practical  it would be of great use  would it not .         of enormous use  obviously .  to know what the future holds  in even the most general and probabilistic way  would serve as a new and marvelous guide for our actions  one that humanity has never before had .  but  of course      he paused .      well .     said cleon impatiently .      well  it would seem that  except for a few decision makers  the results of psychohistorical analysis would have to remain unknown to the public .         unknown .     exclaimed cleon with surprise .      it   s clear .  let me try to explain .  if a psychohistorical analysis is made and the results are then given to the public  the various emotions and reactions of humanity would at once be distorted .  the psychohistorical analysis  based on emotions and reactions that take place without knowledge of the future  become meaningless .  do you understand .      the emperor   s eyes brightened and he laughed aloud .     wonderful .      he clapped his hand on seldon   s shoulder and seldon staggered slightly under the blow .      don   t you see  man .     said cleon .     don   t you see .  there   s your use .  you don   t need to predict the future .  just choose a future  a good future  a useful future  and make the kind of prediction that will alter human emotions and reactions in such a way that the future you predicted will be brought about .  better to make a good future than predict a bad one .      seldon frowned .     i see what you mean  sire  but that is equally impossible .         impossible .         well  at any rate  impractical .  don   t you see .  if you can   t start with human emotions and reactions and predict the future they will bring about  you can   t do the reverse either .  you can   t start with a future and predict the human emotions and reactions that will bring it about .      cleon looked frustrated .  his lips tightened .     and your paper  then .   .   .   .  is that what you call it  a paper .   .   .   .  of what use is it .         it was merely a mathematical demonstration .  it made a point of interest to mathematicians  but there was no thought in my mind of its being useful in any way .         i find that disgusting      said cleon angrily .   seldon shrugged slightly .  more than ever  he knew he should never have given the paper .  what would become of him if the emperor took it into his head that he had been made to play the fool .   and indeed  cleon did not look as though he was very far from believing that .      nevertheless      he said     what if you were to make predictions of the future  mathematically justified or not  predictions that government officials  human beings whose expertise it is to know what the public is likely to do  will judge to be the kind that will bring about useful reactions .         why would you need me to do that .  the government officials could make those predictions themselves and spare the middleman .         the government officials could not do so as effectively .  government officials do make statements of the sort now and then .  they are not necessarily believed .         why would i be .         you are a mathematician .  you would have calculated the future  not  .   .   .  not intuited it  if that is a word .         but i would not have done so .         who would know that .     cleon watched him out of narrowed eyes .   there was a pause .  seldon felt trapped .  if given a direct order by the emperor  would it be safe to refuse .  if he refused  he might be imprisoned or executed .  not without trial  of course  but it is only with great difficulty that a trial can be made to go against the wishes of a heavy handed officialdom  particularly one under the command of the emperor of the vast galactic empire .   he said finally     it wouldn   t work .         why not .         if i were asked to predict vague generalities that could not possibly come to pass until long after this generation and  perhaps  the next were dead  we might get away with it  but  on the other hand  the public would pay little attention .  they would not care about a glowing eventuality a century or two in the future .      to attain results      seldon went on     i would have to predict matters of sharper consequence  more immediate eventualities .  only to these would the public respond .  sooner or later  though and probably sooner one of the eventualities would not come to pass and my usefulness would be ended at once .  with that  your popularity might be gone  too  and  worst of all  there would be no further support for the development of psychohistory so that there would be no chance for any good to come of it if future improvements in mathematical insights help to make it move closer to the realm of practicality .      cleon threw himself into a chair and frowned at seldon .     is that all you mathematicians can do .  insist on impossibilities .      seldon said with desperate softness     it is you  sire  who insist on impossibilities .         let me test you  man .  suppose i asked you to use your mathematics to tell me whether i would some day be assassinated .  what would you say .         my mathematical system would not give an answer to so specific a question  even if psychohistory worked at its best .  all the quantum mechanics in the world cannot make it possible to predict the behavior of one lone electron  only the average behavior of many .         you know your mathematics better than i do .  make an educated guess based on it .  will i someday be assassinated .      seldon said softly     you lay a trap for me  sire .  either tell me what answer you wish and i will give it to you or else give me free right to make what answer i wish without punishment .         speak as you will .         your word of honor .         do you want it an writing .     cleon was sarcastic .      your spoken word of honor will be sufficient      said seldon  his heart sinking  for he was not certain it would be .      you have my word of honor .         then i can tell you that in the past four centuries nearly half the emperors have been assassinated  from which i conclude that the chances of your assassination are roughly one in two .         any fool can give that answer      said cleon with contempt .     it takes no mathematician .         yet i have told you several times that my mathematics is useless for practical problems .         can   t you even suppose that i learn the lessons that have been given me by my unfortunate predecessors .      seldon took a deep breath and plunged in .     no  sire .  all history shows that we do not learn from the lessons of the past .  for instance  you have allowed me here in a private audience .  what if it were in my mind to assassinate you .    which it isn   t  sire      he added hastily .   cleon smiled without humor .     my man  you don   t take into account our thoroughness  or advances in technology .  we have studied your history  your complete record .  when you arrived  you were scanned .  your expression and voiceprints were analyzed .  we knew your emotional state in detail  we practically knew your thoughts .  had there been the slightest doubt of your harmlessness  you would not have been allowed near me .  in fact  you would not now be alive .      a wave of nausea swept through seldon  but he continued .     outsiders have always found it difficult to get at emperors  even with technology less advanced .  however  almost every assassination has been a palace coup .  it is those nearest the emperor who are the greatest danger to him .  against that danger  the careful screening of outsiders is irrelevant .  and as for your own officials  your own guardsmen  your own intimates  you cannot treat them as you treat me .      cleon said     i know that  too  and at least as well as you do .  the answer is that i treat those about me fairly and i give them no cause for resentment .         a foolish      began seldon  who then stopped in confusion .      go on      said cleon angrily .     i have given you permission to speak freely .  how am i foolish .         the word slipped out  sire .  i meant    irrelevant .     your treatment of your intimates is irrelevant .  you must be suspicious  it would be inhuman not to be .  a careless word  such as the one i used  a careless gesture  a doubtful expression and you must withdraw a bit with narrowed eyes .  and any touch of suspicion sets in motion a vicious cycle .  the intimate will sense and resent the suspicion and will develop a changed behavior  try as he might to avoid it .  you sense that and grow more suspicious and  in the end  either he is executed or you are assassinated .  it is a process that has proved unavoidable for the emperors of the past four centuries and it is but one sign of the increasing difficulty of conducting the affairs of the empire .         then nothing i can do will avoid assassination .         no  sire      said seldon     but  on the other hand  you may prove fortunate .      cleon   s fingers were drumming on the arm of his chair .  he said harshly     you are useless  man  and so is your psychohistory .  leave me .     and with those words  the emperor looked away  suddenly seeming much older than his thirty two years .      i have said my mathematics would be useless to you  sire .  my profound apologies .      seldon tried to bow but at some signal he did not see  two guards entered and took him away .  cleon   s voice came after him from the royal chamber .     return that man to the place from which he was brought earlier .          .     eto demerzel emerged and glanced at the emperor with a hint of proper deference .  he said     sire  you have almost lost your temper .      cleon looked up and  with an obvious effort  managed to smile .     well  so i did .  the man was very disappointing .         and yet he promised no more than he offered .         he offered nothing .         and promised nothing  sire .         it was disappointing .      demerzel said     more than disappointing  perhaps .  the man is a loose cannon  sire .         a loose what  demerzel .  you are always so full of strange expressions .  what is a cannon .      demerzel said gravely     it is simply an expression i heard in my youth  sire .  the empire is full of strange expressions and some are unknown on trantor  as those of trantor are sometimes unknown elsewhere .         do you come to teach me the empire is large .  what do you mean by saying that the man is a loose cannon .         only that he can do much harm without necessarily intending it .  he does not know his own strength .  or importance .         you deduce that  do you  demerzel .         yes  sire .  he is a provincial .  he does not know trantor or its ways .  he has never been on our planet before and he cannot behave like a man of breeding  like a courtier .  yet he stood up to     and why not .  i gave him permission to speak .  i left off ceremony .  i treated him as an equal .         not entirely  sire .  you don   t have it within you to treat others as equals .  you have the habit of command .  and even if you tried to put a person at his ease  there would be few who could manage it .  most would be speechless or  worse  subservient and sycophantic .  this man stood up to you .         well  you may admire that  demerzel  but i didn   t like him .     cleon looked thoughtfully discontented .     did you notice that he made no effort to explain his mathematics to me .  it was as though he knew i would not understand a word of it .         nor would you have  sire .  you are not a mathematician  nor a scientist of any kind  nor an artist .  there are many fields of knowledge in which others know more than you .  it is their task to use their knowledge to serve you .  you are the emperor  which is worth all their specializations put together .         is it .  i would not mind being made to feel ignorant by an old man who had accumulated knowledge over many years .  but this man  seldon  is just my age .  how does he know so much .         he has not had to learn the habit of command  the art of reaching a decision that will affect the lives of others .         sometimes  demerzel  i wonder if you are laughing at me .         sire .     said demerzel reproachfully .      but never mind .  back to that loose cannon of yours .  why should you consider him dangerous .  he seems a naive provincial to me .         he is .  but he has this mathematical development of his .         he says it is useless .         you thought it might be useful .  i thought so  after you had explained it to me .  others might .  the mathematician may come to think so himself  now that his mind has been focused on it .  and who knows  he may yet work out some way of making use of it .  if he does  then to foretell the future  however mistily  is to be in a position of great power .  even if he does not wish power for himself  a kind of self denial that always seems to me to be unlikely  he might be used by others .         i tried to use him .  he would not .         he had not given it thought .  perhaps now he will .  and if he was not interested in being used by you  might he not be persuaded by  let us say  the mayor of wye .         why should he be willing to help wye and not us .         as he explained  it is hard to predict the emotions and behavior of individuals .      cleon scowled and sat in thought .     do you really think he might develop this psychohistory of his to the point where it is truly useful .  he is so certain he cannot .         he may  with time  decide he was wrong in denying the possibility .      cleon said     then i suppose i ought to have kept him .      demerzel said     no  sire .  your instinct was correct when you let him go .  imprisonment  however disguised  would cause resentment and despair  which would not help him either to develop his ideas further or make him eager to help us .  better to let him go as you have done  but to keep him forever on an invisible leash .  in this way  we can see that he is not used by an enemy of yourself  sire  and we can see that when the time comes and he has fully developed his science  we can pull on our leash and bring him in .  then we could be  .   .   .  more persuasive .         but what if he it picked up by an enemy of mine or  better  of the empire  for i am the empire after all  or if  of his own accord  he wishes to serve an enemy  i don   t consider that out of the question  you see .         nor should you .  i will see to it that this doesn   t happen  but if  against all striving  it does happen  it would be better if no one has him than if the wrong person does .      cleon looked uneasy .     i   ll leave that all in your hands  demerzel  but i hope we   re not too hasty .  he could be  after all  nothing but the purveyor of a theoretical science that does not and cannot work .         quite possibly  sire  but it would be safer to assume the man is  or might be  important .  we lose only a little time and nothing more if we find that we have concerned ourselves with a nonentity .  we may lose a galaxy if we find we have ignored someone of great importance .         very well  then      said cleon     but i trust i won   t have to know the details  if they prove unpleasant .      demerzel said     let us hope that will not be the case .          .     seldon had had an evening  a night  and part of a morning to get over his meeting with the emperor .  at least  the changing quality of light within the walkways  moving corridors  squares  and parks of the imperial sector of trantor made it seem that an evening  a night  and part of a morning had passed .   he sat now in a small park on a small plastic seat that molded itself neatly to his body and he was comfortable .  judging from the light  it seemed to be midmorning and the air was just cool enough to seem fresh without possessing even the smallest bite .   was it like this all the time .  he thought of the gray day outside when he went to see the emperor .  and he thought of all the gray days and cold days and hot days and rainy days and snowy days on helicon  his home  and he wondered if one could miss them .  was it possible to sit in a park on trantor  having ideal weather day after day  so that it felt as though you were surrounded by nothing at all  and coming to miss a howling wind or a biting cold or a breathless humidity .   perhaps .  but not on the first day or the second or the seventh .  he would have only this one day and he would leave tomorrow .  he meant to enjoy it while he could .  he might  after all  never return to trantor .   still  he continued to feel uneasy at having spoken as independently as he had to a man who could  at will  order one   s imprisonment or execution  or  at the very least  the economic and social death of loss of position and status .   before going to bed  seldon had looked up cleon i in the encyclopedic portion of his hotel room computer .  the emperor had been highly praised as  no doubt  had all emperors in their own lifetime  regardless of their deeds .  seldon had dismissed that  but he was interested in the fact that cleon had been born in the palace and had never left its grounds .  he had never been in trantor itself  in any part of the multi domed world .  it was a matter of security  perhaps  but what it meant was that the emperor was in prison  whether he admitted the matter to himself or not .  it might be the most luxurious prison in the galaxy  but it was a prison just the same .   and though the emperor had seemed mild mannered and had shown no sign of being a bloody minded autocrat as so many of his predecessors had been  it was not good to have attracted his attention .  seldon welcomed the thought of leaving tomorrow for helicon  even though it would be winter  and a rather nasty one  so far  back home .   he looked up at the bright diffuse light .  although it could never rain in here  the atmosphere was far from dry .  a fountain played not far from him  the plants were green and had probably never felt drought .  occasionally  the shrubbery rustled as though a small animal or two was hidden there .  he heard the hum of bees .   really  though trantor was spoken of throughout the galaxy as an artificial world of metal and ceramic  in this small patch it felt positively rustic .   there were a few other persons taking advantage of the park all wearing light hats  some quite small .  there was one rather pretty young woman not far away  but she was bent over a viewer and he could not see her face clearly .  a man walked past  looked at him briefly and incuriously  then sat down in a seat facing him and buried himself in a sheaf of teleprints  crossing one leg  in its tight pink trouser leg  over the other .   there was a tendency to pastel shades among the men  oddly enough  while the women mostly wore white .  being a clean environment  it made sense to wear light colors .  he looked down in amusement at his own heliconian costume  which was predominantly dull brown .  if he were to stay on trantor as he was not he would need to purchase suitable clothing or he would become an object of curiosity or laughter or repulsion .  the man with the teleprints had  for instance  looked up at him more curiously this time  no doubt intrigued by his outworldish clothing .   seldon was relieved that he did not smile .  he could be philosophical over being a figure of fun  but  surely  he could not be expected to enjoy it .   seldon watched the man rather unobtrusively  for he seemed to be engaged in some sort of internal debate .  at the moment he looked as if he was about to speak  then seemed to think better of it  then seemed to wish to speak again .  seldon wondered what the outcome would be .   he studied the man .  he was tall  with broad shoulders and no sign of a paunch  darkish hair with a glint of blond  smooth shaven  a grave expression  an air of strength though there were no bulging muscles  a face that was a touch rugged  pleasant  but with nothing    pretty    about it .   by the time the man had lost the internal fight with himself  or won  perhaps  and leaned toward him  seldon had decided he liked him .   the man said     pardon me  weren   t you at the decennial convention .  mathematics .         yes  i was      said seldon agreeably .      ah  i thought i saw you there .  it was  excuse me  that moment of recognition that led me to sit here .  if i am intruding on your privacy          not at all .  i   m just enjoying an idle moment .         let   s see how close i can get .  you   re professor seldom .         seldon .  hari seldon .  quite close .  and you .         chetter hummin .     the man seemed slightly embarrassed .     rather a homespun name  i   m afraid .         i   ve never come across any chetters before      said seldon .     or hummins .  so that makes you somewhat unique  i should think .  it might be viewed as being better than being mixed up with all the countless haris there are .  or seldons  for that matter .      seldon moved his chair closer to hummin  scraping it against the slightly elastic ceramoid tiles .      talk about homespun      he said     what about this outworldish clothing i   m wearing .  it never occurred to me that i ought to get trantorian garb .         you could buy some      said hummin  eyeing seldon with suppressed disapproval .      i   ll be leaving tomorrow and  besides  i couldn   t afford it .  mathematicians deal with large numbers sometimes  but never in their income .   i presume you   re a mathematician  hummin .         no .  zero talent there .         oh .     seldon was disappointed .     you said you saw me at the decennial convention .         i was there as an onlooker .  i   m a journalist .     he waved his teleprints  seemed suddenly aware that he was holding them and shoved them into his jacket pouch .     i supply the material for the news holocasts .     then  thoughtfully     actually  i   m rather tired of it .         the job .      hummin nodded .     i   m sick of gathering together all the nonsense from every world .  i hate the downward spiral .      he glanced speculatively at seldon .     sometimes something interesting turns up  though .  i   ve heard you were seen in the company of an imperial guard and making for the palace gate .  you weren   t by any chance seen by the emperor  were you .      the smile vanished from seldon   s face .  he said slowly     if i was  it would scarcely be something i could talk about for publication .         no no  not for publication .  if you don   t know this  seldon  let me be the first to tell you  the first rule of the news game is that nothing is ever said about the emperor or his personal entourage except what is officially given out .  it   s a mistake  of course  because rumors fly that are much worse than the truth  but that   s the way it is .         but if you can   t report it  friend  why do you ask .         private curiosity .  believe me  in my job i know a great deal more than ever gets on the air .   let me guess .  i didn   t follow your paper  but i gathered that you were talking about the possibility of predicting the future .      seldon shook his head and muttered     it was a mistake .         pardon me .         nothing .         well  prediction  accurate prediction  would interest the emperor  or any man in government  so i   m guessing that cleon  first of that name  asked you about it and wouldn   t you please give him a few predictions .      seldon said stiffly     i don   t intend to discuss the matter .      hummin shrugged slightly .     eto demerzel was there  i suppose .          who .         you   ve never heard of eto demerzel .         never .          cleon   s alter ego  cleon   s brain  cleon   s evil spirit .  he   s been called all those things  if we confine ourselves to the nonvituperative .  he must have been there .      seldon looked confused and hummin said     well  you may not have seen him  but he was there .  and if he thinks you can predict the future        i can   t predict the future      said seldon  shaking his head vigorously .     if you listened to my paper  you   ll know that i only spoke of a theoretical possibility .         just the same  if he thinks you can predict the future  he will not let you go .         he must have .  here i am .         that means nothing .  he knows where you are and he   ll continue to know .  and when he wants you  he   ll get you  wherever you are .  and if he decides you   re useful  he   ll squeeze the use out of you .  and if he decides you   re dangerous  he   ll squeeze the life out of you .      seldon stared .     what are you trying to do .  frighten me .         i   m trying to warn you .         i don   t believe what you   re saying .         don   t you .  a while ago you said something was a mistake .  were you thinking that presenting the paper was a mistake and that it was getting you into the kind of trouble you don   t want to be in .      seldon bit his lower lip uneasily .  that was a guess that came entirely too close to the truth  and it was at this moment that seldon felt the presence of intruders .   they did not cast a shadow  for the light was too soft and widespread .  it was a simply a movement that caught the corner of his eye  and then it stopped .     flight    trantor   .   .   .  the capital of the first galactic empire  .   .   .  under cleon i  it had its    twilight glow .     to all appearances  it was then at its peak .  its land surface of     million square kilometers was entirely domed  except for the imperial palace area  and underlaid with an endless city that extended beneath the continental shelves .  the population was    billion and although the signs were plentiful  and clearly visible in hindsight  that there were gathering problems  those who lived on trantor undoubtedly found it still the eternal world of legend and did not expect it would ever  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica      .     seldon looked up .  a young man was standing before him  looking down at him with an expression of amused contempt .  next to him was another young man  a bit younger  perhaps .  both were large and appeared to be strong .   they were dressed in an extreme of trantorian fashion  seldon judged  boldly clashing colors  broad fringed belts  round hats with wide brims all about and the two ends of a bright pink ribbon extending from the brim to the back of the neck .   in seldon   s eyes  it was amusing and he smiled .   the young man before him snapped     what   re you grinning at  misfit .      seldon ignored the manner of address and said gently     please pardon my smile .  i was merely enjoying your costume .         my costume .  so .  and what are you wearing .  what   s that awful offal you call clothes .     his hand went out and his finger flicked at the lapel of seldon   s jacket  disgracefully heavy and dull  seldon himself thought  in comparison to the other   s lighthearted colors .   seldon said     i   m afraid it   s my outworlder clothes .  they   re all i have .      he couldn   t help notice that the few others who were sitting in the small park were rising to their feet and walking off .  it was as though they were expecting trouble and had no desire to remain in the vicinity .  seldon wondered if his new friend  hummin  was leaving too  but he felt it injudicious to take his eyes away from the young man who was confronting him .  he teetered back on his chair slightly .   the young man said     you an outworlder .         that   s right .  hence my clothes .         hence .  what kind of word   s that .  outworld word .         what i meant was  that was why my clothes seem peculiar to you .  i   m a visitor here .         from what planet .         helicon .      the young man   s eyebrows drew together .     never heard of it .        it   s not a large planet .         why don   t you go back there .         i intend to .  i   m leaving tomorrow .         sooner .  now .      the young man looked at his partner .  seldon followed the look and caught a glimpse of hummin .  he had not left  but the park was now empty except for himself  hummin  and the two young men .   seldon said     i   d thought i   d spend today sight seeing .         no .  you don   t want to do that .  you go home now .      seldon smiled .     sorry .  i won   t .      the young man said to his partner .     you like his clothes  marbie .         marbie spoke for the first time .     no .  disgusting .  turns the stomach .         can   t let him go around turning stomachs  marbie .  not good for people   s health .         no  not by no means  alem      said marbie .   alem grinned .     well now .  you heard what marbie said .      and now hummin spoke .  he said     look  you two  alem  marbie  whatever your names are .  you   ve had your fun .  why don   t you go away .      alem  who had been leaning slightly toward seldon  straightened and turned .     who are you .         that   s not your business      snapped hummin .      you   re trantorian .     asked alem .      also not your business .      alem frowned and said     you   re dressed trantorian .  we   re not interested in you  so don   t go looking for problems .         i intend to stay .  that means there are two of us .  two against two doesn   t sound like your kind of fight .  why don   t you go away and get some friends so you can handle two people .      seldon said     i really think you ought to get away if you can  hummin .  it   s kind of you to try to protect me  but i don   t want you harmed .         these are not dangerous people  seldon .  just half credit lackeys .          lackeys .     the word seemed to infuriate alem  so that seldon thought it must have a more insulting meaning on trantor than it had on helicon .      here  marbie      said alem with a growl .     you take care of that other motherlackey and i   ll rip the clothes off this seldon .  he   s the one we want .  now    his hands came down sharply to seize seldon   s lapels and jerk him upright .  seldon pushed away  instinctively it would seem  and his chair tipped backward .  he seized the hands stretched toward him  his foot went up  and his chair went down .   somehow alem streaked overhead  turning as he did so  and came down hard on his neck and back behind seldon .   seldon twisted as his chair went down and was quickly on his feet  staring down at alem  then looking sharply to one side for marbie .   alem lay unmoving  his face twisted in agony .  he had two badly sprained thumbs  excruciating pain in his groin  and a backbone that had been badly jarred .   hummin   s left arm had grabbed marbie   s neck from behind and his right arm had pulled the other   s right arm backward at a vicious angle .  marbie   s face was red as he labored uselessly for breath .  a knife  glittering with a small laser inset  lay on the ground beside them .   hummin eased his grip slightly and said  with an air of honest concern     you   ve hurt that one badly .      seldon said     i   m afraid so .  if he had fallen a little differently  he would have snapped his neck .      hummin said     what kind of a mathematician are you .         a heliconian one .     he stooped to pick up the knife and  after examining it  said     disgusting and deadly .      hummin said     an ordinary blade would do the job without requiring a power source .   but let   s let these two go .  i doubt they want to continue any further .      he released marbie  who rubbed first his shoulder then his neck .  gasping for air  he turned hate filled eyes on the two men .   hummin said sharply     you two had better get out of here .  otherwise we   ll have to give evidence against you for assault and attempted murder .  this knife can surely be traced to you .      seldon and hummin watched while marbie dragged alem to his feet and then helped him stagger away  still bent in pain .  they looked back once or twice  but seldon and hummin watched impassively .   seldon held out his hand .     how do i thank you for coming to the aid of a stranger against two attackers .  i doubt i would have been able to handle them both on my own .      hummin raised his hand in a deprecatory manner .     i wasn   t afraid of them .  they   re just street brawling lackeys .  all i had to do was get my hands on them  and yours  too  of course .         that   s a pretty deadly grip you have      seldon mused .   hummin shrugged .     you too .     then  without changing his tone of voice  he said     come on  we   d better get out of here .  we   re wasting time .      .   seldon said     why do we have to get away .  are you afraid those two will come back .         not in their lifetime .  but some of those brave people who cleared out of the park so quickly in their eagerness to spare themselves a disagreeable sight may have alerted the police .         fine .  we have the hoodlums    names .  and we can describe them fairly well .         describe them .  why would the police want them .         they committed an assault          don   t be foolish .  we don   t have a scratch .  they   re virtually hospital bait  especially alem .  we   re the ones who will be charged .         but that   s impossible .  those people witnessed the fact that          no people will be called .  seldon  get this into your head .  those two came to find you  specifically you .  they were told you were wearing heliconian clothes and you must have been described precisely .  perhaps they were even shown a holograph .  i suspect they were sent by the people who happen to control the police  so let   s not wait any longer .      hummin hurried off  his hand gripping seldon   s upper arm .  seldon found the grip impossible to shake and  feeling like a child in the hands of an impetuous nurse  followed .   they plunged into an arcade and  before seldon   s eyes grew accustomed to the dimmer light  they heard the burring sound of a ground car   s brakes .      there they are      muttered hummin .     faster  seldon .     they hopped onto a moving corridor and lost themselves in the crowd .     .   seldon had tried to persuade hummin to take him to his hotel room  but hummin would have none of that .      are you mad .     he half whispered .     they   ll be waiting for you there .         but all my belongings are waiting for me there too .         they   ll just have to wait .      and now they were in a small room in a pleasant apartment structure that might be anywhere for all that seldon could tell .  he looked about the one room unit .  most of it was taken up by a desk and chair  a bed  and a computer outlet .  there were no dining facilities or washstand of any kind  though hummin had directed him to a communal washroom down the hall .  someone had entered before seldon was quite through .  he had cast one brief and curious look at seldon   s clothes  rather than at seldon himself  and had then looked away .   seldon mentioned this to hummin  who shook his head and said     we   ll have to get rid of your clothes .  too bad helicon is so far out of fashion       seldon said impatiently     how much of this might just be your imagination  hummin .  you   ve got me half convinced and yet it may be merely a kind of  .   .   .  of          are you groping for the word    paranoia    .         all right  i am .  this may be some strange paranoid notion of yours .      hummin said     think about it  will you .  i can   t argue it out mathematically  but you   ve seen the emperor .  don   t deny it .  he wanted something from you and you didn   t give it to him .  don   t deny that either .  i suspect that details of the future are what he wants and you refused .  perhaps demerzel thinks you   re only pretending not to have the details that you   re holding out for a higher price or that someone else is bidding for it too .  who knows .  i told you that if demerzel wants you  he   ll get you wherever you are .  i told you that before those two splitheads ever appeared on the scene .  i   m a journalist and a trantorian .  i know how these things go .  at one point  alem said     he   s the one we want .     do you remember that .         as it happens      said seldon .     i do .         to him i was only the    other motherlackey    to be kept off  while he went about the real job of assaulting you .      hummin sat down in the chair and pointed to the bed .     stretch out  seldon .  make yourself comfortable .  whoever sent those two  it must have been demerzel  in my opinion  can send others  so we   ll have to get rid of those clothes of yours .  i think any other heliconian in this sector caught in his own world   s garb is going to have trouble until he can prove he isn   t you .         oh come on .         i mean it .  you   ll have to take off the clothes and we   ll have to atomize them  if we can get close enough to a disposal unit without being seen .  and before we can do that i   ll have to get you a trantorian outfit .  you   re smaller than i am and i   ll take that into account .  it won   t matter if it doesn   t fit exactly       seldon shook his head .     i don   t have the credits to pay for it .  not on me .  what credits i have  and they aren   t much  am in my hotel safe .         we   ll worry about that another time .  you   ll have to stay here for an hour or two while i go out in search of the necessary clothing .      seldon spread his hands and sighed resignedly .     all right .  if it   s that important  i   ll stay .         you won   t try to get back to your hotel .  word of honor .         my word as a mathematician .  but i   m really embarrassed by all the trouble you   re taking for me .  and expense too .  after all  despite all this talk about demerzel  they weren   t really out to hurt me or carry me off .  all i was threatened with was the removal of my clothes .         not all .  they were also going to take you to the spaceport and put you on a hypership to helicon .         that was a silly threat  not to be taken seriously .         why not .         i   m going to helicon .  i told them so .  i   m going tomorrow .         and you still plan to go tomorrow .     asked hummin .      certainly .  why not .         there are enormous reasons why not .      seldon suddenly felt angry .     come on  hummin  i can   t play this game any further .  i   m finished here and i want to go home .  my tickets are in the hotel room .  otherwise i   d try to exchange them for a trip today .  i mean it .         you can   t go back to helicon .      seldon flushed .     why not .  are they waiting for me there too .      hummin nodded .     don   t fire up  seldon .  they would be waiting for you there too .  listen to me .  if you go to helicon  you are as good as in demerzel   s hands .  helicon is good  safe imperial territory .  has helicon ever rebelled  ever fallen into step behind the banner of an anti emperor .         no  it hasn   t  and for good reason .  it   s surrounded by larger worlds .  it depends on the imperial peace for security .         exactly .  imperial forces on helicon can therefore count on the full cooperation of the local government .  you would be under constant surveillance at all times .  any time demerzel wants you  he will be able to have you .  and  except for the fact that i am now warning you  you would have no knowledge of this and you would be working in the open  filled with a false security .         that   s ridiculous .  if he wanted me in helicon  why didn   t he simply leave me to myself .  i was going there tomorrow .  why would he send those two hoodlums simply to hasten the matter by a few hours and risk putting me on my guard .         why should he think you would be put on your guard .  he didn   t know i   d be with you  immersing you in what you call my paranoia .         even without the question of warning me  why all the fuss to hurry me by a few hours .         perhaps because he was afraid you would change your mind .         and go where  if not home .  if he could pick me up on helicon  he could pick me up anywhere .  he could pick me up on  .   .   .  on anacreon  a good ten thousand parsecs away  if it should fall into my head to go there .  what   s distance to hyperspatial ships .  even if i find a world that   s not quite as subservient to the imperial forces as helicon is  what world is in actual rebellion .  the empire is at peace .  even if some worlds are still resentful of injustices in the past  none are going to defy the imperial armed forces to protect me .  moreover  anywhere but on helicon i won   t be a local citizen and there won   t even be that matter of principle to help keep the empire at bay .      hummin listened patiently  nodding slightly  but looking as grave and as imperturbable as ever .  he said     you   re right  as far as you go  but there   s one world that is not really under the emperor   s control .  that  i think  is what must be disturbing demerzel .      seldon thought a while  reviewing recent history and finding himself unable to choose a world on which the imperial forces might be helpless .  he said at last     what world is that .      hummin said     you   re on it  which is what makes the matter so dangerous in demerzel   s eyes  i imagine .  it is not so much that he is anxious to have you go to helicon  as that he is anxious to have you leave trantor before it occurs to you  for any reason  even if only tourist   s mania to stay .      the two men sat in silence until seldon finally said sardonically     trantor .  the capital of the empire  with the home base of the fleet on a space station in orbit about it  with the best units of the army quartered here .  if you believe that it is trantor that is the safe world  you   re progressing from paranoia to outright fantasy .         no .  you   re an outworlder  seldon .  you don   t know what trantor is like .  it   s forty billion people and there are few other worlds with even a tenth of its population .  it is of unimaginable technological and cultural complexity .  where we are now is the imperial sector  with the highest standard of living in the galaxy and populated entirely by imperial functionaries .  elsewhere on the planet  however  are over eight hundred other sectors  some of them with subcultures totally different from what we have here and most of them untouchable by imperial forces .         why untouchable .         the empire cannot seriously exert force against trantor .  to do so would be bound to shake some facet or other of the technology on which the whole planet depends .  the technology is so interrelated that to snap one of the interconnections is to cripple the whole .  believe me  seldon  we on trantor observe what happens when there is an earthquake that manages to escape being damped out  a volcanic eruption that is not vented in time  a storm that is not defused  or just some human error that escapes notice .  the planet totters and every effort must be made to restore the balance at once .         i have never heard of such a thing .      a small smile flickered its way across hummin   s face .     of course not .  do you want the empire to advertise the weakness at its core .  however  as a journalist  i know what happens even when the outworlds don   t  even when much of trantor itself doesn   t  even when the imperial pressure is interested in concealing events .  believe me .  the emperor knows  and eto demerzel knows  even if you don   t  that to disturb trantor may destroy the empire .         then are you suggesting i stay on trantor for that reason .         yes .  i can take you to a place on trantor where you will be absolutely safe from demerzel .  you won   t have to change your name and you will be able to operate entirely in the open and he won   t be able to touch you .  that   s why he wanted to force you off trantor at once and if it hadn   t been for the quirk of fate that brought us together and for your surprising ability to defend yourself  he would have succeeded in doing so .         but how long will i have to remain on trantor .            for as long as your safety requires it  seldon .  for the rest of your life  perhaps .          .     hari seldon looked at the holograph of himself cast by hummin   s projector .  it was more dramatic and useful than a mirror would have been .  in fact  it seemed as though there were two of him in the room .   seldon studied the sleeve of his new tunic .  his heliconian attitudes made him wish the colors were less vibrant  but he was thankful that  as it was  hummin had chosen softer colors than were customary here on this world .   seldon thought of the clothing worn by their two assailants and shuddered inwardly .    he said     and i suppose i must wear this hat .         in the imperial sector  yes .  to go bareheaded here is a sign of low breeding .  elsewhere  the rules are different .      seldon sighed .  the round hat was made of soft material and molded itself to his head when he put it on .  the brim was evenly wide all around  but it was narrower than on the hats his attackers had worn .  seldon consoled himself by noticing that when he wore the hat the brim curved rather gracefully .      it doesn   t have a strap under the chin .         of course not .  that   s advanced fashion for young lanks .         for young what .         a lank is someone who wears things for their shock value .  i   m sure you have such people on helicon .      seldon snorted .     there are those who wear their hair shoulder length on one side and shave the other .     he laughed at the memory .   hummin   s mouth twisted slightly .     i imagine it looks uncommonly ugly .         worse .  there are lefties and righties  apparently  and each finds the other version highly offensive .  the two groups often engage in street brawls .         then i think you can stand the hat  especially without the strap .      seldon said     i   ll get used to it .         it will attract some attention .  it   s subdued for one thing and makes you look as if you   re in mourning .  and it doesn   t quite fit .  then  too  you wear it with obvious discomfort .  however  we won   t be in the imperial sector long .  seen enough .     and the holograph flickered out .   seldon said     how much did this cost you .         what   s the difference .         it bothers me to be in your debt .         don   t worry about it .  this is my choice .  but we   ve been here long enough .  i will have been described  i   m quite certain .  they   ll track me down and they   ll come here .         in that case      said seldon     the credits you   re spending are a minor matter .  you   re putting yourself into personal danger on my account .  personal danger .         i know that .  but it   s my free choice and i can take care of myself .         but why          we   ll discuss the philosophy of it later .  i   ve atomized your clothes  by the way  and i don   t think i was seen .  there was an energy surge  of course  and that would be recorded .  someone might guess what happened from that  it   s hard to obscure any action when probing eyes and mind are sharp enough .  however  let us hope we   ll be safely away before they put it all together .          .     they traveled along walkways where the light was soft and yellow .  hummin   s eyes moved this way and that  watchful  and he kept their pace at crowd speed  neither passing nor being passed .   he kept up a mild but steady conversation on indifferent topics .   seldon  edgy and unable to do the same  said     there seems to be a great deal of walking here .  there are endless lines in both directions and along the crossovers .         why not .     said hummin .     walking is still the best form of short distance transportation .  it   s the most convenient  the cheapest  and the most healthful .  countless years of technological advance have not changed that .  are you acrophobic  seldon .         seldon looked over the railing on his right into a deep declivity that separated the two walking lanes  each in an opposite direction between the regularly spaced crossovers .  he shuddered slightly .     if you mean fear of heights  not ordinarily .  still  looking down isn   t pleasant .  how far does it go down .         forty or fifty levels at this point  i think .  this sort of thing is common in the imperial sector and a few other highly developed regions .  in most places  one walks at what might be considered ground level .         i should imagine this would encourage suicide attempts .         not often .  there are far easier methods .  besides  suicide is not a matter of social obloquy on trantor .  one can end one   s life by various recognized methods in centers that exist for the purpose  if one is willing to go through some psychotherapy at first .  there are  occasional accidents  for that matter  but that   s not why i was asking about acrophobia .  we   re heading for a taxi rental where they know me as a journalist .  i   ve done favors for them occasionally and sometimes they do favors for me in return .  they   ll forget to record me and won   t notice that i have a companion .  of course  i   ll have to pay a premium and  again of course  if demerzel   s people lean on them hard enough  they   ll have to tell the truth and put it down to slovenly accounting  but that may take considerable time .         where does the acrophobia come in .         well  we can get there a lot faster if we use a gravitic lift .  not many people use it and i must tell you that i   m not overjoyed at the idea myself  but if you think you can handle it  we had better .         what   s a gravitic lift .         it   s experimental .  the time may come when it will be widespread over trantor  provided it becomes psychologically acceptable  or can be made so to enough people .  then  maybe  it will spread to other worlds too .  it   s an elevator shaft without an elevator cab  so to speak .  we just step into empty space and drop slowly  or rise slowly  under the influence of antigravity .  it   s about the only application of antigravity that   s been established so far  largely because it   s the simplest possible application .         what happens if the power blinks out while we   re in transit .         exactly what you would think .  we fall and  unless we   re quite near the bottom to begin with  we die .  i haven   t heard of it happening yet and  believe me  if it had happened i would know .  we might not be able to give out the news for security reasons  that   s the excuse they always advance for hiding bad news  but i would know .  it   s just up ahead .  if you can   t manage it  we won   t do it  but the corridors are slow and tedious and many find them nauseating after a while .      hummin turned down a crossover and into a large recess where a line of men and women were waiting  one or two with children .   seldon said in a low voice     i heard nothing of this back home .  of course  our own news media are terribly local  but you   d think there   d be some mention that this sort of thing exists .      hummin said .     it   s strictly experimental and is confined to the imperial sector .  it uses more energy than it   s worth  so the government is not really anxious to push it right now by giving it publicity .  the old emperor  stanel vi  the one before cleon who amazed everyone by dying in his bed  insisted on having it installed in a few places .  he wanted his name associated with antigravity  they say  because he was concerned with his place in history  as old men of no great attainments frequently are .  as i said  the technique may spread  but  on the other hand  it is possible that nothing much more than the gravitic lift will ever come of it .         what do they want to come of it .     asked seldon .      antigrav spaceflight .  that  however  will require many breakthroughs and most physicists  as far as i know  are firmly convinced it is out of the question .  but  then  most thought that even gravitic lifts were out of the question .      the line ahead was rapidly growing shorter and seldon found himself standing with hummin at the edge of the floor with an open gap before him .  the air ahead faintly glittered .  automatically  he reached out his hand and felt a light shock .  it didn   t hurt  but he snatched his hand back quickly .   hummin grunted .     an elementary precaution to prevent anyone walking over the edge before activating the controls .     he punched some numbers on the control board and the glitter vanished .   seldon peered over the edge  down the deep shaft .      you might find it better  or easier      said hummin     if we link arms and if you close your eyes .  it won   t take more than a few seconds .      he gave seldon no choice  actually .  he took his arm and once again there was no hanging back in that firm grip .  hummin stepped into nothingness and seldon  who heard himself  to his own embarrassment  emit a small squeak  shuffled off with a lurch .   he closed his eyes tightly and experienced no sense of falling  no feeling of air movement .  a few seconds passed and he was pulled forward .  he tripped slightly  caught his balance  and found himself on solid ground .   he opened his eyes     did we make it .      hummin said dryly     we   re not dead      then walked away  his grip forcing seldon to follow .      i mean  did we get to the right level .         of course .         what would have happened if we were dropping down and someone else was moving upward .         there are two separate lanes .  in one lane everyone drops at the same speed  in the other everyone rises at the same speed .  the shaft clears only when there are no people within ten meters of each other .  there is no chance of a collision if all works well .         i didn   t feel a thing .         why should you .  there was no acceleration .  after the first tenth of a second  you were at constant speed and the air in your immediate vicinity was moving down with you at the same speed .         marvelous .         absolutely .  but uneconomic .  and there seems no great pressure to increase the efficiency of the procedure and make it worthwhile .  everywhere one hears the same refrain .     we can   t do it .  it can   t be done .     it applies to everything .     hummin shrugged in obvious anger and said     but we   re here at the taxi rental .  let   s get on with it .           .     seldon tried to look inconspicuous at the air taxi rental terminus  which he found difficult .  to look ostentatiously inconspicuous  to slink about  to turn his face away from all who passed  to study one of the vehicles overintently  was surely the way to invite attention .  the way to behave was merely to assume an innocent normality .   but what was normality .  he felt uncomfortable in his clothes .  there were no pockets  so he had no place to put his hands .  the two pouches  which dangled from his belt on either side  distracted him by hitting against him as he moved  so that he was continually thinking someone had nudged him .   he tried looking at women as they passed .  they had no pouches  at least none dangling  but they carried little boxlike affairs that they occasionally clipped to one hip or another by some device he could not make out .  it was probably pseudomagnetic  he decided .  their clothes were not particularly revealing  he noted regretfully  and not one had any sign of decolletage  although some dresses seemed to be designed to emphasize the buttocks .   meanwhile  hummin had been very businesslike  having presented the necessary credits and returned with the superconductive ceramic tile that would activate a specific air taxi .   hummin said     get in  seldon      gesturing to a small two seated vehicle .   seldon asked     did you have to sign your name  hummin .            of course not .  they know me here and don   t stand on ceremony .          what do they think you   re doing .         they didn   t ask and i volunteered no information .     he inserted the tile and seldon felt a slight vibration as the air taxi came to life .      we   re headed for d        said hummin  making conversation .   seldon didn   t know what d   was  but he assumed it meant some route or other .   the air taxi found its way past and around other ground cars and finally moved onto a smooth upward slanting track and gained speed .  then it lifted upward with a slight jolt .   seldon  who had been automatically strapped in by a webbed restraint  felt himself pushed down into his seat and then up against the webbing .   he said     that didn   t feel like antigravity .         it wasn   t      said hummin .     that was a small jet reaction .  just enough to take us up to the tubes .      what appeared before them now looked like a cliff patterned with cave openings  much like a checkerboard .  hummin maneuvered toward the d   opening  avoiding other air taxis that were heading for other tunnels .      you could crash easily      said seldon  clearing his throat .      so i probably would if everything depended on my senses and reactions  but the taxi is computerized and the computer can overrule me without trouble .  the same is true for the other taxis .  here we go .      they slid into d   as if they had been sucked in and the bright light of the open plaza outside mellowed  turning a warmer yellow hue .   hummin released the controls and sat back .  he drew a deep breath and said     well  that   s one stage successfully carried through .  we might have been stopped at the station .  in here  we   re fairly safe .      the ride was smooth and the walls of the tunnel slipped by rapidly .  there was almost no sound  just a steady velvety whirr as the taxi sped along .      how fast are we going .     asked seldon .   hummin cast an eye briefly at the controls .     three hundred and fifty kilometers per hour .         magnetic propulsion .         yes .  you have it on helicon  i imagine .         yes .  one line .  i   ve never been on it myself  though i   ve always meant to .  i don   t think it   s anything like this .         i   m sure it isn   t .  trantor has many thousands of kilometers of these tunnels honeycombing the land subsurface and a number that snake under the shallower extensions of the ocean .  it   s the chief method of long distance travel .         how long will it take us .         to reach our immediate destination .  a little over five hours .         five hours .     seldon was dismayed .      don   t be disturbed .  we pass rest areas every twenty minutes or so where we can stop  pull out of the tunnel  stretch our feet  cat  or relieve ourselves .  i   d like to do that as few times as possible  of course .       they continued on in silence for a while and then seldon started when a blaze of light flared at their right for a few seconds and  in the flash  he thought he saw two air taxis .      that was a rest area      said hummin in answer to the unspoken question .   seldon said     am i really going to be safe wherever it is you are taking me .      hummin said     quite safe from any open movement on the part of the imperial forces .  of course  when it comes to the individual operator  the spy  the agent  the hired assassin  one must always be careful .  naturally  i will supply you with a bodyguard .      seldon felt uneasy .     the hired assassin .  are you serious .  would they really want to kill me .      hummin said     i   m sure demerzel doesn   t .  i suspect he wants to use you rather than kill you .  still  other enemies may turn up or there may be unfortunate concatenations of events .  you can   t go through life sleepwalking .      seldon shook his head and turned his face away .  to think  only forty eight hours ago he had been just an insignificant  virtually unknown outworld mathematician  content only to spend his remaining time on trantor sight seeing  gazing at the enormity of the great world with his provincial eye .  and now  it was finally sinking in  he was a wanted man  hunted by imperial forces .  the enormity of the situation seized him and he shuddered .      and what about you and what you   re doing right now .      hummin said thoughtfully     well  they won   t feel kindly toward me  i suppose .  i might have my head laid open or my chest exploded by some mysterious and never found assailant .      hummin said it without a tremor in his voice or a change in his calm appearance  but seldon winced .   seldon said     i rather thought you would assume that might be in store for you .  you don   t seem to be  .   .   .  bothered by it .         i   m an old trantorian .  i know the planet as well as anybody can .  i know many people and many of them are under obligation to me .  i like to think that i am shrewd and not easy to outwit .  in short  seldon  i am quite confident that i can take care of myself .         i   m glad you feel that way and i hope you   re justified in thinking so  hummin  but i can   t get it through my head why you   re taking this chance at all .  what am i to you .  why should you take even the smallest risk for someone who is a stranger to you .      hummin checked the controls in a preoccupied manner and then he faced seldon squarely  eyes steady and serious .          i want to save you for the same reason that the emperor wants to use you  for your predictive powers .      seldon felt a deep pang of disappointment .  this was not after all a question of being saved .  he was merely the helpless and disputed prey of competing predators .  he said angrily     i will never live down that presentation at the decennial convention .  i have ruined my life .         no .  don   t rush to conclusions  mathematician .  the emperor and his officers want you for one reason only  to make their own lives more secure .  they are interested in your abilities only so far as they might be used to save the emperor   s rule  preserve that rule for his young son  maintain the positions  status  and power of his officials .  i  on the other hand  want your powers for the good of the galaxy .         is there a distinction .     spat seldon acidly .   and hummin replied with the stern beginning of a frown     if you do not see the distinction  then that is to your shame .  the human occupants of the galaxy existed before this emperor who now rules  before the dynasty he represents  before the empire itself .  humanity is far older than the empire .  it may even be far older than the twentyfive million worlds of the galaxy .  there are legends of a time when humanity inhabited a single world .         legends .     said seldon  shrugging his shoulders .      yes  legends  but i see no reason why that may not have been so in fact  twenty thousand years ago or more .  i presume that humanity did not come into existence complete with knowledge of hyperspatial travel .  surely  there must have been a time when people could not travel at superluminal velocities and they must then have been imprisoned in a single planetary system .  and if we look forward in time  the human beings of the worlds of the galaxy will surely continue to exist after you and the emperor are dead  after his whole line comes to an end  and after the institutions of the empire itself unravel .  in that case  it is not important to worry overmuch about individuals  about the emperor and the young prince imperial .  it is not important to worry even about the mechanics of empire .  what of the quadrillions of people that exist in the galaxy .  what of them .      seldon said     worlds and people would continue  i presume .         don   t you feel any serious need of probing the possible conditions under which they would continue to exist .      one would assume they would exist much as they do now .         one would assume .  but could one know by this art of prediction that you speak of .         psychohistory is what i call it .  in theory  one could .         and you feel no pressure to turn that theory into practice .         i would love to  hummin  but the desire to do so doesn   t automatically manufacture the ability to do so .  i told the emperor that psychohistory could not be turned into a practical technique and i am forced to tell you the same thing .         and you have no intention of even trying to find the technique .         no  i don   t  any more than i would feel i ought to try to tackle a pile of pebbles the size of trantor  count them one by one  and arrange them in order of decreasing mass .  i would know it was not something i could accomplish in a lifetime and i would not be fool enough to make a pretense of trying .         would you try if you knew the truth about humanity   s situation .         that   s an impossible question .  what it the truth about humanity   s situation .  do you claim to know it .         yes  i do .  and in five words .     hummin   s eyes faced forward again  turning briefly toward the blank changelessness of the tunnel as it pushed toward them  expanding until it passed and then dwindling as it slipped away .  he then spoke those five words grimly .   he said     the galactic empire is dying .        university    streeling university   .   .   .  an institution of higher learning in the streeling sector of ancient trantor  .   .   .  despite all these claims to fame in the fields of the humanities and silences alike  it is not for those that the university looms large in today   s consciousness .  it would probably have come as a coral surprise to the generations of scholars at the university to know that in lacer times streeling university would be most remembered because a certain hari seldon  during the period of the flight  had been in residence there for a shore time .   encyclopedia galactica       .     hari seldon remained uncomfortably silent for a while after hummin   s quiet statement .  he shrank within himself in sudden recognition of his own deficiencies .   he had invented a new science  psychohistory .  he had extended the laws of probability in a very subtle manner to take into account new complexities and uncertainties and had ended up with elegant equations in innumerable unknowns .  possibly an infinite number  he couldn   t tell .   but it was a mathematical game and nothing more .   he had psychohistory  or at least the basis of psychohistory but only as a mathematical curiosity .  where was the historical knowledge that could perhaps give some meaning to the empty equations .   he had none .  he had never been interested in history .  he knew the outline of heliconian history .  courses in that small fragment of the human story had  of course  been compulsory in the heliconian schools .  but what was there beyond that .  surely what else he had picked up was merely the bare skeletons that everyone gathered half legend  the other half surely distorted .   still  how could one say that the galactic empire was dying .  it had existed for ten thousand years as an accepted empire and even before that  trantor  as the capital of the dominating kingdom  had held what was a virtual empire for two thousand years .  the empire had survived the early centuries when whole sections of the galaxy would now and then refuse to accept the end of their local independence .  it had survived the vicissitudes that went with the occasional rebellions  the dynastic wars  some serious periods of breakdown .  most worlds had scarcely been troubled by such things and trantor itself had grown steadily until it was the worldwide human habitation that now called itself the eternal world .   to be sure  in the last four centuries  turmoil had increased somehow and there had been a rash of imperial assassinations and takeovers .  but even that was calming down and right now the galaxy was as quiet as it had ever been .  under cleon i and before him under his father  stanel vi  the worlds were prosperous and cleon himself was not considered a tyrant .  even those who disliked the imperium as an institution rarely had anything truly bad to say about cleon  much as they might inveigh against eto demerzel .   why  then  should hummin say that the galactic empire was dying and with such conviction .   hummin was a journalist .  he probably knew galactic history in some detail and he had to understand the current situation in great detail .  was it this that supplied him with the knowledge that lay behind his statement .  in that case  just what was the knowledge .   several times seldon was on the point of asking  of demanding an answer  but there was something in hummin   s solemn face that stopped him .  and there was something in his own ingrained belief that the galactic empire was a given  an axiom  the foundation stone on which all argument rested that prevented him too .  after all  if that was wrong  he didn   t want to know .   no  he couldn   t believe that he was wrong .  the galactic empire could no more come to an end than the universe itself could .  or  if the universe did end  then  and only then  would the empire end .   seldon closed his eyes  attempting to sleep but  of course  he could not .  would he have to study the history of the universe in order to advance his theory of psychohistory .   how could he .  twentyfive million worlds existed  each with its own endlessly complex history .  how could he study all that .  there were book films in many volumes  he knew  that dealt with galactic history .  he had even skimmed one once for some now forgotten reason and had found it too dull to view even halfway through .   the book films had dealt with important worlds .  with some  it dealt through all or almost all their history  with others  only as they gained importance for a time and only till they faded away .  he remembered having looked up helicon in the index and having found only one citation .  he had punched the keys that would turn up that citation and found helicon included in a listing of worlds which  on one occasion  had temporarily lined up behind a certain claimant to the imperial throne who had failed to make good his claim .  helicon had escaped retribution on that occasion  probably because it was not even sufficiently important to be punished .   what good was such a history .  surely  psychohistory would have to take into account the actions and reactions and interactions of each world  each and every world .  how could one study the history of twenty five million worlds and consider all their possible interactions .  it would surely be an impossible task and this was just one more reinforcement of the general conclusion that psychohistory was of theoretical interest but could never be put to any practical use .   seldon felt a gentle push forward and decided that the air taxi must be decelerating .      what   s up .     he asked .      i think we   ve come far enough      said hummin     to risk a small stopover for a bite to eat  a glass of something or other  and a visit to a washroom .      and  in the course of the next fifteen minutes  during which the air taxi slowed steadily  they came to a lighted recess .  the taxi swerved inward and found a parking spot among five or six other vehicles .        .     hummin   s practiced eye seemed to take in the recess  the other taxis  the diner  the walkways  and the men and women all at a glance .  seldon  trying to look inconspicuous and again not knowing how  watched him  trying not to do so too intently .   when they sat down at a small table and punched in their orders  seldon  attempting to sound indifferent  said     everything okay .         seems so      said hummin .      how can you tell .      hummin let his dark eyes rest on seldon for a moment .     instinct      he said .     years of news gathering .  you look and know     no news here .         seldon nodded and felt relieved .  hummin might have said it sardonically  but there must be a certain amount of truth to it .   his satisfaction did not last through the first bite of his sandwich .  he looked up at hummin with his mouth full and with a look of hurt surprise on his face .   hummin said     this is a wayside diner  my friend .  cheap  fast  and not very good .  the food   s homegrown and has an infusion of rather sharp yeast .  trantorian palates are used to it .      seldon swallowed with difficulty .     but back in the hotel          you were in the imperial sector  seldon .  food is imported there and where microfood is used it is high quality .  it is also expensive .       seldon wondered whether to take another bite .     you mean that as long as i stay on trantor       hummin made a hushing motion with his lips .     don   t give anyone the impression that you   re used to better .  there are places on trantor where to be identified as an aristocrat is worse than being identified as an outworlder .  the food won   t be so bad everywhere   i assure you .  these wayside places have a reputation for low quality .  if you can stomach that sandwich  you   ll be able to eat anywhere on trantor .  and it won   t hurt you .  it   s not decayed or bad or anything like that .  it just has a harsh  strong taste and  honestly  you may grow accustomed to it .  i   ve met trantorians who spit out honest food and say it lacks that homegrown tang .         do they grow much food on trantor .     asked seldon .  a quick side glance showed him there was no one seated in the immediate vicinity and he spoke quietly .     i   ve always heard it takes twenty surrounding worlds to supply the hundreds of freight ships required to feed trantor every day .         i know .  and hundreds to carry off the load of wastes .  and if you want to make the story really good  you say that the same freight ships carry food one way and waste the other .  it   s true that we import considerable quantities of food  but that   s mostly luxury items .  and we export considerable waste  carefully treated into inoffensiveness  as important organic fertilizer  every bit as important to other worlds as the food is to us .  but that   s only a small fraction of the whole .         it is .         yes .  in addition to fish in the sea  there are gardens and truck farms everywhere .  and fruit trees and poultry and rabbits and vast microorganism farms  usually called yeast farms  though the yeast makes up a minority of the growths .  and our wastes are mostly used right here at home to maintain all that growth .  in fact  in many ways trantor is very much like an enormous and overgrown space settlement .  have you ever visited one of those .         indeed i have .         space settlements are essentially enclosed cities  with everything artificially cycled  with artificial ventilation  artificial day and night  and so on .  trantor is different only in that even the largest space settlement has a population of only ten million and trantor has four thousand times that .  of course  we have real gravity .  and no space settlement can match us in our microfoods .  we have yeast vats  fungal mats  and algae ponds vast beyond the imagination .  and we are strong on artificial flavoring  added with no light hand .  that   s what gives the taste to what you   re eating .      seldon had gotten through most of his sandwich and found it not as offensive as the first bite had been .     and it won   t affect me .         it does hit the intestinal flora and every once in a while it afflicts some poor outworlder with diarrhea  but that   s rare  and you harden even to that quickly .  still  drink your milkshake  which you probably won   t like .  it contains an antidiarrhetic that should keep you safe  even if you tend to be sensitive to such things .      seldon said querulously     don   t talk about it  hummin .  a person can be suggestible to such things .         finish the milkshake and forget the suggestibility .      they finished the rest of their meal in silence and soon were on their way again .        .     they were now racing rapidly through the tunnel once more .  seldon decided to give voice to the question that had been nagging at him for the last hour or so .      why do you say the galactic empire is dying .      hummin turned to look at seldon again .     as a journalist  i have statistics poured into me from all sides till they   re squeezing out of my ears .  and i   m allowed to publish very little of it .  trantor   s population is decreasing .  twentyfive years ago  it stood at almost fortyfive billion .      partly  this decrease is because of a decline in the birthrate .  to be sure  trantor never has had a high birthrate .  if you   ll look about you when you   re traveling on trantor  you won   t encounter very many children  considering the enormous population .  but just the same it   s declining .  then too there is emigration .  people are leaving trantor in greater numbers than are arriving .         considering its large population      said seldon     that   s not surprising .         but it   s unusual just the same because it hasn   t happened before .  again  all over the galaxy trade is stagnating .  people think that because there are no rebellions at the moment and because things are quiet that all is well and that the difficulties of the past few centuries are over .  however  political infighting  rebellions  and unrest are all signs of a certain vitality too .  but now there   s a general weariness .  it   s quiet  not because people are satisfied and prosperous  but because they   re tired and have given up .         oh  i don   t know      said seldon dubiously .      i do .  and the antigrav phenomenon we   ve talked about is another case in point .  we have a few gravitic lifts in operation  but new ones aren   t being constructed .  it   s an unprofitable venture and there seems no interest in trying to make it profitable .  the rate of technological advance has been slowing for centuries and is down to a crawl now .  in some cases  it has stopped altogether .  isn   t this something you   ve noticed .  after all  you   re a mathematician .         i can   t say i   ve given the matter any thought .         no one does .  it   s accepted .  scientists are very good these days at saying that things are impossible  impractical  useless .  they condemn any speculation at once .  you  for instance  what do you think of psychohistory .  it is theoretically interesting  but it is useless in any practical sense .  am i right .         yes and no      said seldon  annoyed .     it is useless in any practical sense  but not because my sense of adventure has decayed  i assure you .  it really it useless .         that  at least      said hummin with a trace of sarcasm     is your impression in this atmosphere of decay in which all the empire lives .         this atmosphere of decay      said seldon angrily     is your impression .  is it possible that you are wrong .      hummin stopped and for a moment appeared thoughtful .  then he said     yes  i might be wrong .  i am speaking only from intuition  from guesses .  what i need is a working technique of psychohistory .       seldon shrugged and did not take the bait .  he said     i don   t have such a technique to give you .  but suppose you   re right .  suppose the empire it running down and will eventually stop and fall apart .  the human species will still exist .         under what conditions  man .  for nearly twelve thousand years  trantor  under strong rulers  has largely kept the peace .  there   ve been interruptions to that  rebellions  localized civil wars  tragedy in plenty  but  on the whole and over large areas  there has been peace .  why is helicon so pro imperium .  your world  i mean .  because it is small and would be devoured by its neighbours were it not that the empire keeps it secure .         are you predicting universal war and anarchy if the empire fails .         of course .  i   m not fond of the emperor or of the imperial institutions in general  but i don   t have any substitute for it .  i don   t know what else will keep the peace and i   m not ready to let go until i have something else in hand .      seldon said     you talk as though you are in control of the galaxy .  you are not ready to let go .  you must have something else in hand .  who are you to talk so .         i   m speaking generally  figuratively      said hummin .     i   m not worried about chetter hummin personally .  it might be said that the empire will last my time  it might even show signs of improvement in my time .  declines don   t follow a straight line path .  it may be a thousand years before the final crash and you might well imagine i would be dead then and  certainly  i will leave no descendants .  as far as women are concerned  i have nothing but the occasional casual attachment and i have no children and intend to have none .  i have given no hostages to fortune .  i looked you up after your talk  seldon .  you have no children either .             i have parents and two brothers  but no children .     he smiled rather weakly .     i was very attached to a woman at one time  but it seemed to her that i was attached more to my mathematics .         were you .         it didn   t seem so to me  but it seemed so to her .  so she left .         and you have had no one since .         no .  i remember the pain too clearly as yet .         well then  it might seem we could both wait out the matter and leave it to other people  well after our time  to suffer .  i might have been willing to accept that earlier  but no longer .  for now i have a tool  i am in command .         what   s your tool .     asked seldon  already knowing the answer .      you .     said hummin .   and because seldon had known what hummin would say  he wasted no time in being shocked or astonished .  he simply shook his head and said     you are quite wrong .  i am no tool fit for use .         why not .      seldon sighed .     how often must i repeat it .  psychohistory is not a practical study .  the difficulty is fundamental .  all the space and time of the universe would not suffice to work out the necessary problems .         are you certain of that .         unfortunately  yes .         there   s no question of your working out the entire future of the galactic empire  you know .  you needn   t trace out in detail the workings of every human being or even of every world .  there are merely terrain questions you must answer  will the galactic empire crash and  if so  when .  what will be the condition of humanity afterward .  can anything be done to prevent the crash or to ameliorate conditions afterward .  these are comparatively simple questions  it seems to me .      seldon shook his head and smiled sadly .     the history of mathematics is full of simple questions that had only the most complicated of answers  or none at all .         is there nothing to be done .  i can see that the empire is falling  but i can   t prove it .  all my conclusions are subjective and i cannot show that i am not mistaken .  because the view is a seriously unsettling one  people would prefer not to believe my subjective conclusion and nothing will be done to prevent the fall or even to cushion it .  you could prove the coming fall or  for that matter  disprove it .         but that is exactly what i cannot do .  i can   t find you proof where none exists .  i can   t make a mathematical system practical when it isn   t .  i can   t find you two even numbers that will yield an odd number as a sum  no matter how vitally your all the galaxy may need that odd number .      hummin said     well then  you   re pare of the decay .  you   re ready to accept failure .         what choice have i .         can   t you try .  however useless the effort may seem to you to be  have you anything better to do with your life .  have you some worthier goal .  have you a purpose that will justify you in your own eyes to some greater extent .      seldon   s eyes blinked rapidly .     millions of worlds .  billions of cultures .  quadrillions of people .  decillions of interrelationships .  and you want me to reduce it to order .         no  i want you to try .  for the sake of those millions of worlds  billions of cultures  and quadrillions of people .  not for the emperor .  not for demerzel .  for humanity .         i will fail      said seldon .      then we will be no worse off .  will you try .      and against his will and not knowing why  seldon heard himself say     i will try .     and the course of his life was set .        .     the journey came to its end and the air taxi moved into a much larger lot than the one at which they had eaten .   seldom still remembered the taste of the sandwich and made a wry face .    hummin turned in his taxi and came back  placing his credit slip in a small pocket on the inner surface of his shirt .  he said     you   re completely safe here from anything outright and open .  this is the streeling sector .         streeling .         it   s named for someone who first opened up the area to settlement  i imagine .  most of the sectors are named for someone or other  which means that most of the names are ugly and some are hard to pronounce .  just the same  if you try to have the inhabitants here change streeling to sweetsmell or something like that  you   ll have a fight on your hands .         of course      said seldon  sniffing loudly     it isn   t exactly sweetsmell .         hardly anywhere in trantor is  but you   ll get used to it .         i   m glad we   re here      said seldon .     not that i like it  but i got quite tired sitting in the taxi .  getting around trantor must be a horror .  back on helicon  we can get from any one place to any other by air  in far less time than it took us to travel less than two thousand kilometers here .         we have air jets too .         but in that case          i could arrange an air taxi ride more or less anonymously .  it would have been much more difficult with an air jet .  and regardless of how safe it is here  i   d feel better if demerzel didn   t know exactly where you were .  as a matter of fact  we   re not done yet .  we   re going to take the expressway for the final stage .      seldon knew the expression .     one of those open monorails moving on an electromagnetic field  right .         right .         we don   t have them on helicon .  actually  we don   t need them there .  i rode on an expressway the first day i was on trantor .  it took me from the airport to the hotel .  it was rather a novelty  but if i were to use it all the time  i imagine the noise and crowds would become overpowering .      hummin looked amused .     did you get lost .         no  the signs were useful .  there was trouble getting on and off  but i was helped .  everyone could tell i was an outworlder by my clothes  i now realize .  they seemed eager to help  though  i guess because it was amusing to watching me hesitate and stumble .         as an expert in expressway travel by now  you will neither hesitate nor stumble .     hummin said it pleasantly enough  though there was a slight twitch to the corners of his mouth .     come on  then .      they sauntered leisurely along the walkway  which was lit to the extent one might expect of an overcast day and that brightened now and then as though the sun occasionally broke through the clouds .  automatically  seldon looked upward to see if that were indeed the case  but the    sky    above was blankly luminous .   hummin saw this and said     this change in brightness seems too suit the human psyche .  there are days when the street seems to be in bright sunlight and days when it is rather darker than it is now .         but no rain or snow .         or hail or sleet .  no .  nor high humidity nor bitter cold .  trantor has its points  seldon  even now .      there were people walking in both directions and there were a considerable number of young people and also some children accompanying the adults  despite what hummin had said about the birthrate .  all seemed reasonably prosperous and reputable .  the two sexes were equally represented and the clothing was distinctly more subdued than it had been in the imperial sector .  his own costume  as chosen by hummin  fit right in .  very few were wearing hats and seldon thankfully removed his own and swung it at his side .   there was no deep abyss separating the two sides of the walkway and as hummin had predicted in the imperial sector  they were walking at what seemed to be ground level .  there were no vehicles either and seldon pointed this out to hummin .   hummin said     there are quite a number of them in the imperial sector because they   re used by officials .  elsewhere  private vehicles are rare and those that are used have separate tunnels reserved for them .  their use is not really necessary  since we have expressways and  for shorter distances  moving corridors .  for still shorter distances  we have walkways and we can use our legs .      seldon heard occasional muted sighs and creaks and saw  some distance off  the endless  passing of expressway cars .      there it is      he said  pointing .      i know  but let us move on to a boarding station .  there are more cars there and it is easier to get on .      once they were safely ensconced in an expressway car  seldon turned to hummin and said     what amazes me is how quiet the expressways are .  i realize that they are mass propelled by an electromagnetic field  but it seems quiet even for that .     he listened to the occasional metallic groan as the car they were on shifted against its neighbours .      yes  it   s a marvelous network      said hummin     but you don   t see is at its peak .  when i was younger  it was quieter than it is now and there are those who say that there wasn   t as much as a whisper fifty years ago though i suppose we might make allowance for the idealization of nostalgia .         why isn   t it that way now .         because it isn   t maintained properly .  i told you about decay .      seldon frowned .     surely  people don   t sit around and say     we   re decaying .  let   s let the expressways fall apart .             no  they don   t .  it   s not a purposeful thing .  bad spots are patched  decrepit coaches refurbished  magnets replaced .  however  it   s done in more slapdash fashion  more carelessly  and at greater intervals .  there just aren   t enough credits available .         where have the credits gone .         into other things .  we   ve had centuries of unrest .  the navy is much larger and many times more expensive than it once was .  the armed forces are much better paid  in order to keep them quiet .  unrest  revolts  and minor blazes of civil war all take their toll .         but it   s been quiet under cleon .  and we   ve had fifty years of peace .         yes  but soldiers who are well paid would resent having that pay reduced just because there is peace .  admirals resist mothballing ships and having themselves reduced in rank simply because there is less for them to do .  so the credits still go  unproductively  to the armed forces and vital areas of the social good are allowed to deteriorate .  that   s what i call decay .  don   t you .  don   t you chink that eventually you would fit that sort of view into your psychohistorical notions .      seldon stirred uneasily .  then he said     where are we going  by the way .         streeling university .         ah  that   s why the sector   s name was familiar .  i   ve heard of the university .         i   m not surprised .  trantor has nearly a hundred thousand institutions of higher learning and streeling is one of the thousand or so at the top of the heap .         will i be staying there .         for a while .  university campuses are unbreathable sanctuaries  by and large .  you will be safe there .         but will i be welcome there .         why not .  it   s hard to find a good mathematician these days .  they might be able to use you .  and you might be able to use them too tend for more than just a hiding place .         you mean  it will be a place where i can develop my notions .         you have promised      said hummin gravely .      i have promised to try      said seldon and thought to himself that it was about like promising to try to make a rope out of sand .        .     conversation had run out after that and seldon watched the structures of the streeling sector as they passed .  some were quite low  while some seemed to brush the    sky .     wide crosspassages broke the progression and frequent alleys could be seen .   at one point  it struck him that though the buildings rose upward they also swept downward and that perhaps they were deeper than they were high .  as soon as the thought occurred to him  he was convinced it was true .   occasionally  he saw patches of green in the background  farther back from the expressway  and even small trees .   he watched for quite a while and then became aware that the light was growing dimmer .  he squinted about and turned to hummin  who guessed the question .      the afternoon is waning      he said     and night is coming on .      seldon   s eyebrows raised and the corners of his mouth turned downward .     that   s impressive .  i have a picture of the entire planet darkening and then  some hours from now  lighting up again .      hummin smiled his small  careful smile .     not quite  seldon .  the planet is never turned off altogether  or turned on either .  the shadow of twilight sweeps across the planet gradually  followed half a day later by the slow brightening of dawn .  in fact  the effect follows the actual day and night above the domes quite closely  so that in higher altitudes day and night change length with the seasons .      seldon shook his head     but why close in the planet and then mimic what would be in the open .         i presume because people like it better that way .  trantorians like the advantages of being enclosed  but they don   t like to be reminded of it unduly  just the same .  you know very little about trantorian psychology  seldon .      seldon flushed slightly .  he was only a heliconian and he knew very little about the millions of worlds outside helicon .  his ignorance was not confined to trantor .  how  then  could he hope to come up with any practical applications for his theory of psychohistory .   how could any number of people  all together  know enough .  it reminded seldon of a puzzle that had been presented to him when he was young  can you have a relatively small piece of platinum  with handholds affixed  that could not be lifted by the bare  unaided strength of any number of people  no matter how many .   the answer was yes .  a cubic meter of platinum weighs         kilograms under standard gravitational pull .  if it is assumed that each person could heave     kilograms up from the ground  then     people would suffice to lift the platinum .  but you could not squeeze     people around the cubic meter so that each one could get a grip on it .  you could perhaps not squeeze more than   people around it .  and levers or other such devices were not allowed .  it had to be    bare  unaided strength .      in the same way  it could be that there was no way of getting enough people to handle the total amount of knowledge required for psychohistory  even if the facts were stored in computers rather than in individual human brains .  only so many people could gather round the knowledge  so to speak  and communicate it .   hummin said     you seem to be in a brown study  seldon .         i   m considering my own ignorance .         a useful task .  quadrillions could profitably join you .  but it   s time to get off .      seldon looked up .     how can you tell .         just as you could tell when you were on the expressway your first day on trantor .  i go by the signs .      seldon caught one just as it went by  streeling university   minutes .      we get off at the next boarding station .  watch your step .      seldon followed hummin off the coach  noting that the sky was deep purple now and that the walkways and corridors and buildings were all lighting up  suffused with a yellow glow .   it might have been the gathering of a heliconian night .  had he been placed here blindfolded and had the blindfold been removed  he might have been convinced that he was in some particularly well built up inner region of one of helicon   s larger cities .      how long do you suppose i will remain at streeling university  hummin .     he asked .   hummin said in his usual calm fashion     that would be hard to say  seldon .  perhaps your whole life .         what .         perhaps not .  but your life stopped being your own once you gave that paper on psychohistory .  the emperor and demerzel recognized your importance at once .  so did i .  for all i know  so did many others .  you see  that means you don   t belong to yourself anymore .        library    venabili  dors   .   .   .  historian  born in cinna  .   .   .  her life might well have continued on its uneventful course were it not for the face that  after she had spent two years on the faculty of streeling university  she became involved with the young hari seldon during the flight  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       .     the room that hari seldon found himself in was larger than hummin   s room in the imperial sector .  it was a bedroom with one comer serving as a washroom and with no sign of any cooking or dining facilities .  there was no window  though set in the ceiling was a grilled ventilator that made a steady sighing noise .   seldon looked about a bit ruefully .   hummin interpreted that look with his usual assured manner and said     it   s only for tonight  seldon .  tomorrow morning someone will come to install you at the university and you will be more comfortable .         pardon me  hummin  but how do you know that .         i will make arrangements .  i know one or two people here     he smiled briefly without humor     and i have a favor or two i can ask repayment for .  now let   s go into some details .      he gazed steadily at seldon and said     whatever you have left in your hotel room is lost .  does that include anything irreplaceable .         nothing really irreplaceable .  i have some personal items i value for their association with my past life  but if they are gone  they are gone .  there are  of course  some notes on my paper .  some calculations .  the paper itself .         which is now public knowledge until such time as it is removed from circulation as dangerous  which it probably will be .  still  i   ll be able to get my hands on a copy  i   m sure .  in any case  you can reconstruct it  can   t you .         i can .  that   s why i said there was nothing really irreplaceable .  also  i   ve lost nearly a thousand credits  some books  clothing  my tickets back to helicon  things like that .         all replaceable .  now i will arrange for you to have a credit tile in my name  charged to me .  that will take care of ordinary expenses .          that   s unusually generous of you .  i can   t accept it .         it   s not generous at all  since i   m hoping to save the empire in that fashion .  you must accept it .         but how much can you afford  hummin .  i   ll be using it  at best  with an uneasy conscience .         whatever you need for survival or reasonable comfort i can afford  seldon .  naturally  i wouldn   t want you to try to buy the university gymnasium or hand out a million credits in largess .         you needn   t worry  but with my name on record          it might as well be .  it is absolutely forbidden for the imperial government to exercise any security control over the university or its members .  there is complete freedom .  anything can be discussed here  anything can be said here .          what about violent crime .         then the university authorities themselves handle it  with reason and care  and there are virtually no crimes of violence .  the students and faculty appreciate their freedom and understand its terms .  too much rowdiness  the beginning of riot and bloodshed  and the government may feel it has a right to break the unwritten agreement and send in the troops .  no one wants that  not even the government  so a delicate balance is maintained .  in other words  demerzel himself can not have you plucked out of the university without a great deal more cause than anyone in the university has given the government in at least a century and a half .  on the other hand  if you are lured off the grounds by a student agent          are there student agents .         how can i say .  there may be .  any ordinary individual can be threatened or maneuvered or simply bought  and may remain thereafter in the service of demerzel or of someone else  for that matter .  so i must emphasize this  you are safe in any reasonable sense  but no one is absolutely safe .  you will have to be careful .  but though i give you that warning  i don   t want you to cower through life .  on the whole  you will be far more secure here than you would have been if you had returned to helicon or gone to any world of the galaxy outside trantor .         i hope so      said seldon drearily .      i know so      said hummin     or i would not feel it wise to leave you .          leave me .     seldon looked up sharply .     you can   t do that .  you know this world .  i don   t .         you will be with others who know this world  who know this part of it  in fact  even better than i do .  as for myself  i must go .  i have been with you all this day and i dare not abandon my own life any longer .  i must not attract too much attention to myself .  remember that i have my own insecurities  just as you have yours .      seldon blushed .     you   re right .  i can   t expect you to endanger yourself indefinitely on my behalf .  i hope you are not already ruined .      hummin said coolly     who can tell .  we live in dangerous times .  just remember that if anyone can make the times safe  if not for ourselves  then for those who follow after us  it is you .  let that thought be your driving force  seldon .           .     sleep eluded seldon .  he tossed and turned in the dark  thinking .  he had have never felt quite so alone or quite so helpless as he did after hummin had nodded  pressed his hand briefly  and left him behind .  now he was on a strange world  and in a strange part of that world .  he was without the only person he could consider a friend  and that of less than a day   s duration  and he had no idea of where he was going or what he would be doing  either tomorrow or at any time in the future .   none of that was conducive to sleep so  of course  at about the time he decided  hopelessly  that he would not sleep that night or  possibly  ever again  exhaustion overtook him  .   .   .   when he woke up it was still dark  or not quite  for across the room he saw a red light flashing brightly and rapidly  accompanied by a harsh  intermittent buzz .  undoubtedly  it was that which had awakened him .   as he tried to remember where he was and to make some sort of sense out of the limited messages his senses were receiving  the flashing and buzzing ceased and he became aware of a peremptory rapping .   presumably  the rapping was at the door  but he didn   t remember where the door was .  presumably  also  there was a contact that would flood the room with light  but he didn   t remember where that was either .   he sat up in bed and felt along the wall to his left rather desperately while calling out     one moment  please .      he found the necessary contact and the room suddenly bloomed with a soft light .   he scrambled out of bed  blinking  still searching for the door  finding it  reaching out to open it  remembering caution at the last moment  and saying in a suddenly stern  no nonsense voice     who   s there .      a rather gentle woman   s voice said     my dame is dors venabili and i have come to see dr .  hari seldon .      even as that was said  a woman was standing just in front of the door  without that door ever having been opened .   for a moment  hari seldon stared at her in surprise  then realized that he was wearing only a one piece undergarment .  he let out a strangled gasp and dashed for the bed and only then realized that he was staring at a holograph .  it lacked the hard edge of reality and it became apparent the woman wasn   t looking at him .  she was merely showing herself for identification .   he paused  breathing hard  then said  raising his voice to be heard through the door     if you   ll wait  i   ll be with you .  give me  .   .   .  maybe half an hour .      the woman  or the holograph  at any rate  said     i   ll wait      and disappeared .   there was no shower  so he sponged himself  making a rare mess on the tiled floor in the washroom corner .  there was toothpaste but no toothbrush  so he used his finger .  he had no choice but to put on the clothes he had been wearing the day before .  he finally opened the door .   he realized  even as he did so  that she had not really identified herself .  she had merely given a name and hummin had not told him whom to expect  whether it was to be this dors somebody or anyone else .  he had felt secure because the holograph was that of a personable young woman  but for all he knew there might be half a dozen hostile young men with her .   he peered out cautiously  saw only the woman  then opened the door sufficiently to allow her to enter .  he immediately closed and locked the door behind her .      pardon me      he said     what time is it .         nine      she said     the day has long since begun .      as far as official time was concerned  trantor held to galactic standard  since only so could sense be made out of interstellar commerce and governmental dealings .  each world  however  also had a local time system and seldon had not yet come to the point where he felt at home with casual trantorian references to the hour .      midmorning .     he said .      of course .         there are no windows in this room      he said defensively .   dors walked to his bed  reached out  and touched a small dark spot on the wall .  red numbers appeared on the ceiling just over his pillow .  they read       .   she smiled without superiority .     i   m sorry      she said .     but i rather assumed chetter hummin would have told you i   d be coming for you at nine .  the trouble with him is he   s so used to knowing  he sometimes forgets that others occasionally don   t know .  and i shouldn   t have used radio holographic identification .  i imagine you don   t have it on helicon and i   m afraid i must have alarmed you .      seldon felt himself relax .  she seemed natural and friendly and the casual reference to hummin reassured him .  he said     you   re quite wrong about helicon  miss          please call me dors .         you   re still wrong about helicon  dors .  we do have radioholography  but i   ve never been able to afford the equipment .  nor could anyone in my circle  so i haven   t actually had the experience .  but i understood what had happened soon enough .      he studied her .  she was not very tall  average height for a woman  he judged .  her hair was a reddish gold  though not very bright  and was arranged in shore curls about her head .    he had seen a number of women in trantor with their hair so arranged .  it was apparently a local fashion that would have been laughed at in helicon .   she was not amazingly beautiful  but was quire pleasant to look at  this being helped by full lips that seemed to have a slight humorous curl to them .  she was slim  well built  and looked quite young .   too young  he thought uneasily  to be of use perhaps .       do i pass inspection .     she asked .   she seemed to have hummin   s trick of guessing his thoughts  seldon thought  or perhaps he himself lacked the trick of hiding them .    he said     i   m sorry .  i seem to have been staring  but i   ve only been trying to evaluate you .  i   m in a strange place .  i know no one and have no friends .         please  dr .  seldon  count me as a friend .  mr .  hummin has asked me to take care of you .      seldon smiled ruefully .     you may be a little young for the job .         you   ll find i am not .         well  i   ll try to be as little trouble as possible .  could you please repeat your name .         dors venabili .     she spelled the last name and emphasized the stress on the second syllable .     as i said  please call me dors and if you don   t object too strenuously i will call you hari .  we   re quite informal here at the university and there is an almost self conscious effort to show no signs of status  either inherited or professional .         please  by all means  call me hari .         good .  i shall remain informal then .  for instance  the instinct for formality  if there is such a thing  would cause me to ask permission to sit down .  informally  however  i shall just sit .     she then sat down on the one chair in the room .   seldon cleared his throat .     clearly  i   m not at all in possession of my ordinary faculties .  i should have asked you to sit .     he sat down on the aide of his crumpled bed and wished he had thought to straighten it out somewhat  but he had been caught by surprise .   she said pleasantly     this is how it   s going to work  hari .  first  we   ll go to breakfast at one of the university cafes .  then i   ll get you a room in one of the domiciles  a better room than this .  you   ll have a window .  hummin has instructed me to get you a credit tile in his name  but it will take me a day or two to extort one out of the university bureaucracy .  until that   s done  i   ll be responsible for your expenses and you can pay me back later .  and we can use you .  chetter hummin told me you   re a mathematician and for some reason there   s a serious lack of good ones at the university .         did hummin tell you that i was a good mathematician .         as a matter of face  he did .  he said you were a remarkable man          well .     seldon looked down at his fingernails .     i would like to be considered so  but hummin knew me for less than a day and  before that  he had heard me present a paper  the quality of which he has no way of judging .  i think he was just being polite .         i don   t think so      said dors .     he is a remarkable person himself and has had a great deal of experience with people .  i   ll go by his judgment .  in any case  i imagine you   ll have a chance to prove yourself .  you can program computers  i suppose .         of course .         i   m talking about teaching computers  you understand  and i   m asking if you can devise programs to teach various phases of contemporary mathematics .         yes  that   s part of my profession .  i   m assistant professor of mathematics at the university of helicon .      she said     yes  i know .  hummin told me that .  it means  of course  that everyone will know you are a non trantorian  but that will present no serious problems .  we   re mainly trantorian here at the university  but there   s a substantial minority of outworlders from any number of different worlds and that   s accepted .  i won   t say that you   ll never hear a planetary slur but actually the outworlders are more likely to use them than the trantorians .  i   m an outworlder myself  by the way .         oh .     he hesitated and then decided it would be only polite to ask .     what world are you from .         i   m from cinna .  have you ever heard of it .      he   d be caught out if he was polite enough to lie  seldon decided  so he said     no .         i   m not surprised .  it   s probably of even less account than helicon is .  anyway  to get back to the programming of mathematical teaching computers  i suppose that that can be done either proficiently or poorly .         absolutely .         and you would do it proficiently .         i would like to think so .         there you are  then .  the university will pay you for that  so lee   s go out and eat .  did you sleep well  by the way .         surprisingly  i did .         and are you hungry .         yes  but      he hesitated .   she said cheerfully     but you   re worried about the quality of the food  is that it .  well  don   t be .  being an outworlder myself  i can understand your feelings about the strong infusion of microfood into everything  but the university menus aren   t bad .  in the faculty dining room  at least .  the students suffer a bit  but that serves to harden them .      she rose and turned to the door  but stopped when seldon could not keep himself from saying     are you a member of the faculty .      she turned and smiled at him impishly .     don   t i look old enough .  i got my doctorate two years ago at cinna and i   ve been here ever since .  in two weeks  i   ll be thirty .         sorry      said seldon  smiling in his turn     but you can   t expect to look twentyfour and not raise doubts as to your academic status .         aren   t you nice .     said dors and seldon felt a certain pleasure wash over him .  after all  he thought  you can   t exchange pleasantries with an attractive woman and feel entirely like a stranger .        .     dors was right .  breakfast was by no means bad .  there was something that was unmistakably eggy and the meat was pleasantly smoked .  the chocolate drink  trantor was strong on chocolate and seldon did not mind that  was probably synthetic  but it was tasty and the breakfast rolls were good .   he felt is only right to say as much .     this has been a very pleasant breakfast .  food .  surroundings .  everything .         i   m delighted you think so      said dors .   seldon looked about .  there were a bank of windows in one wall and while actual sunlight did not enter  he wondered if  after a while  he would learn to be satisfied with diffuse daylight and would cease to look for patches of sunlight in a room   the place was light enough .  in face  it was quite bright  for the local weather computer had apparently decided is was time for a sharp  clear day .   the cables were arranged for four apiece and most were occupied by the full number  but dors and seldon remained alone at theirs .  dors had called over some of the men and women and had introduced them .  all had been police  but none had joined them .  undoubtedly  dors intended that to be so  but seldon did not see how she managed to arrange it .   he said     you haven   t introduced me to any mathematicians  dors .         i haven   t seen any that i know .  most mathematicians start the day early and have classes by eight .  my own feeling is that any student so foolhardy as to take mathematics wants to get that part of the course over with as soon as possible .         i take is you   re not a mathematician yourself .         anything but      said dors with a short laugh .     anything .  history is my field .  i   ve already published some studies on the rise of trantor  i mean the primitive kingdom  not this world .  i suppose that will end up as my field of specialization  royal trantor .         wonderful      said seldon .      wonderful .     dors looked at him quizzically .     are you interested in royal trantor too .         in a way  yes .  that and other things like that .  i   ve never really studied history and i should have .         should you .  if you had studied history  you   d scarcely have had time to study mathematics and mathematicians are very much needed especially at this university .  we   re full to here with historians      she said  raising her hand to her eyebrows     and economists and political scientists  but we   re short on science and mathematics .  chetter hummin pointed that out to me once .  he called it the decline of science and seemed to think it was a general phenomenon .      seldon said     of course  when i say i should have studied history  i don   t mean that i should have made it a life work .  i meant i should have studied enough to help me in my mathematics .  my field of specialization is the mathematical analysis of social structure .         sounds horrible .         in a way  it is .  it   s very complicated and without my knowing a great deal more about how societies evolved it   s hopeless .  my picture is too static  you see .         i can   t see because i know nothing about it .  chetter told me you were developing something called psychohistory and that it was important .  have i got it right .  psychohistory .         that   s right .  i should have called it    psychsociology      but it seemed to me that was too ugly a word .  or perhaps i knew instinctively that a knowledge of history was necessary and then didn   t pay sufficient attention to my thoughts .         psychohistory does sound better  but i don   t know what it is .         i scarcely do myself .     he brooded a few minutes  looking at the woman on the other side of the table and feeling that she might make this exile of his seem a little less like an exile .  he thought of the other woman he had known a few years ago  but blocked it off with a determined effort .  if he ever found another companion  it would have to be one who understood scholarship and what it demanded of a person .   to get his mind onto a new track  he said     chetter hummin told me that the university is in no way troubled by the government .          he   s right .      seldon shook his head .     that seems rather unbelievably forbearing of the imperial government .  the educational institutions on helicon are by no means so independent of governmental pressures .         nor on cinna .  nor on any outworld  except perhaps for one or two of the largest .  trantor is another matter .         yes  but why .         because it   s the center of the empire .  the universities here have enormous prestige .  professionals are turned out by any university anywhere  but the administrators of the empire  the high officials  the countless millions of people who represent the tentacles of empire reaching into every corner of the galaxy  are educated right here on trantor .         i   ve never seen the statistics      began seldon .      take my word for it .  it is important that the officials of the empire have some common ground  some special feeling for the empire .  and they can   t all be native trantorians or else the outworlds would grow restless .  for that reason  trantor must attract millions of outworlders for education here .  it doesn   t matter where they come from or what their home accent or culture may be  as long as they pick up the trantorian patina and identify themselves with a trantorian educational background .  that   s what holds the empire together .  the outworlds are also less restive when a noticeable portion of the administrators who represent the imperial government are their own people by birth and upbringing .      seldon felt embarrassed again .  this was something he had never given any thought to .  he wondered if anyone could be a truly great mathematician if mathematics was all he knew .  he said     is this common knowledge .         i suppose it isn   t      said dors after some thought .     there   s so much knowledge to be had that specialists cling to their specialties as a shield against having to know anything about anything else .  they avoid being drowned .         yet you know it .         but that   s my specialty .  i   m a historian who deals with the rise of royal trantor and this administrative technique was one of the ways in which trantor spread its influence and managed the transition from royal trantor to imperial trantor .      seldon said  almost as though muttering to himself     how harmful overspecialization is .  it cuts knowledge at a million points and leaves it bleeding .      dors shrugged .     what can one do .  but you see  if trantor is going to attract outworlders to trantorian universities  it has to give them something in return for uprooting themselves and going to a strange world with an incredibly artificial structure and unusual ways .  i   ve been here two years and i   m still not used to it .  i may never get used to it .  but then  of course  i don   t intend to be an administrator  so i   m not forcing myself to be a trantorian .      and what trantor offers in exchange is not only the promise of a position with high status  considerable power  and money  of course  but also freedom .  while students are having their education  they are free to denounce the government  demonstrate against it peacefully  work out their own theories and points of view .  they enjoy that and many come here so that they can experience the sensation of liberty .         i imagine      said seldon     that it helps relieve pressure as well .  they work off all their resentments  enjoy all the smug self satisfaction a young revolutionary would have  and by the time they take their place in the imperial hierarchy  they are ready to settle down into conformity and obedience .      dors nodded .     you may be right .  in any case  the government  for all these reasons  carefully preserves the freedom of the universities .  it   s not a matter of their being forbearing at all  only clever .         and if you   re not going to be an administrator  dors  what are you going to be .         a historian .  i   ll teach  put book films of my own into the programming .         not much status  perhaps .         not much money  hari  which is more important .  as for status  that   s the sort of push and pull i   d just as soon avoid .  i   ve seen many people with status  but i   m still looking for a happy one .  status won   t sit still under you  you have to continually fight to keep from sinking .  even emperors manage to come to bad ends most of the time .  someday i may just go back to cinna and be a professor .         and a trantorian education will give you status .      don laughed .     i suppose so  but on cinna who would care .  it   s a dull world  full of farms and with lots of cattle  both four legged and two legged .         won   t you find it dull after trantor .         yes  that   s what i   m counting on .  and if it gets coo dull  i can always wangle a grant to go here or there to do a little historical research .  that   s the advantage of my field .         a mathematician  on the other hand      said seldon with a trace of bitterness at something that had never before bothered him     is expected to sit at his computer and think .  and speaking of computers .  .  .  he hesitated .  breakfast was done and it seemed to him more than likely she had some duties of her own to attend to .   but she did not seem to be in any great hurry to leave .     yes .  speaking of computers .         would i be able to get permission to use the history library .      now is was she who hesitated .     i chink that can be arranged .  if you work on mathematics programming  you   ll probably be viewed as a quasimember of the faculty and i could ask for you to be given permission .  only          only .         i don   t want to hurt your feelings  but you   re a mathematician and you say you know nothing about history .  would you know how to make use of a history library .      seldon smiled .     i suppose you use computers very much like those in a mathematics library .         we do  but the programming for each specialty has quirks of its own .  you don   t know the standard reference book films  the quick methods of winnowing and skipping .  you may be able to find a hyperbolic interval in the dark  .   .   .         you mean hyperbolic integral      interrupted seldon softly .   dors ignored him .     but you probably won   t know how to get the terms of the treaty of poldark in less than a day and a half .         i suppose i could learn .         if  .   .   .  if  .   .   .     she looked a little troubled .     if you want to  i can make a suggestion .  i give a week   s course  one hour each day  no credit on library use .  it   s for undergraduates .  would you feel it beneath your dignity to sit in on such a course with undergraduates  i mean .  it starts in three weeks .         you could give me private lessons .     seldom felt a little surprised at the suggestive tone that had entered his voice .   she did not miss it .     i dare say i could  but i think you   d be better off with more formal instruction .  we   ll be using the library  you understand  and at the end of the week you will be asked to locate information on particular items of historical interest .  you will be competing with the other students all through and that will help you learn .  private tutoring will be far less efficient  i assure you .  however  i understand the difficulty of competing with undergraduates .  if you don   t do as well as they  you may feel humiliated .  you must remember  though  that they have already studied elementary history and you  perhaps  may not have .         i haven   t .  no  may    about it .  but i won   t be afraid to compete and i won   t mind any humiliation that may come along if i manage to learn the cricks of the historical reference trade .      it was clear to seldom that he was beginning to like this young woman and that he was gladly seizing on the chance to be educated by her .  he was also aware of the face that he had reached a turning point in his mind .   he had promised hummin to attempt to work out a practical psychohistory  but that had been a promise of the mind and not the emotions .  now he was determined to seize psychohistory by the throat if he had to in order to make it practical .  that  perhaps  was the influence of dors venabili .   or had hummin counted on that .  hummin  seldom decided  might well be a most formidable person .        .     cleon i had finished dinner  which  unfortunately  had been a formal state affair .  it meant he had to spend time talking to various officials  not one of whom he knew or recognized  in set phrases designed to give each one his stroke and so activate his loyalty to the crown .  it also meant that his food reached him but lukewarm and had cooled still further before he could eat it .   there had to be some way of avoiding that .  bat first  perhaps  on his own or with one or two close intimates with whom he could relax and then attend a formal dinner at which he could merely be served an imported pear .  he loved pears .  but would that offend the guests who would take the emperor   s refusal to sac with them as a studied insult .   his wife  of course  was useless in this respect  for her presence would but further exacerbate his unhappiness .  he had married her because she was a member of a powerful dissident family who could be expected to mute their dissidence as a result of the union  though cleon devoutly hoped that she  at least  would not do so .  he was perfectly content to have her live her own life in her own quarters except for the necessary efforts to initiate an heir  for  to cell the truth  he didn   t like her .  and now that an heir had come  he could ignore her completely .   he chewed at one of a handful of nuts he had pocketed from the table on leaving and said     demerzel .         sire .      demerzel always appeared at once when cleon called .  whether he hovered constantly in earshot at the door or he drew close because the instinct of subservience somehow alerted him to a possible call in a few minutes  he did appear and that  cleon thought idly  was the important thing .  of course  there were those times when demerzel had to be away on imperial business .  cleon always hated those absences .  they made him uneasy .      what happened to that mathematician .  i forget his name .      demerzel  who surely knew the man the emperor had in mind  but who perhaps wanted to study how much the emperor remembered  said     what mathematician is it that you have in mind  sire .      cleon waved an impatient hand .     the fortune teller .  the one who came to see me .         the one we sent for .         well  sent for  then .  he did come to see me .  you were going to take care of the matter  as i recall .  have you .      demerzel cleared his throat .     sire  i have cried to .         ah .  that means you have failed  doesn   t it .     in a way  cleon felt pleased .  demerzel was the only one of his ministers who made no bones of failure .  the others never admitted failure  and since failure was nevertheless common  it became difficult to correct .  perhaps demerzel could afford to be more honest because he failed so rarely .  if it weren   t for demerzel  cleon thought sadly  he might never know what honesty sounded like .  perhaps no emperor ever knew and perhaps that was one of the reasons that the empire       he pulled his thoughts away and  suddenly nettled at the other   s silence and wanting an admission  since he had just admired demerzel   s honesty in his mind  said sharply     well  you have failed  haven   t you .      demerzel did not flinch .     sire  i have failed in part .  i felt that to have him here on trantor where things are difficult might present us with problems .  it was easy to consider that he might be more conveniently placed on his home planet .  he was planning to return to that home planet the next day  but there was always the chance of complications  of his deciding to remain on trantor  so i arranged to have two young alley men place him on his plane that very day .         do you know alley men  demerzel .     cleon was amused .      it is important  sire  to be able to reach many kinds of people  for each type has its own variety of use  alley men not the least .  as it happens  they did not succeed .         and why was that .         oddly enough  seldon was able to fight them off .         the mathematician could fight .         apparently  mathematics and the martial arts are not necessarily mutually exclusive .  i found out  not soon enough  that his world  helicon  is noted for its martial arts  not mathematics .  the fact that i did not learn this earlier was indeed a failure  sire  and i can only crave your pardon .         but then  i suppose the mathematician left for his home planet the next day as he had planned .         unfortunately  the episode backfired .  taken aback by the event  he decided not to return to helicon  but remained on trantor .  he may have been advised to this effect by a passerby who happened to be present on the occasion of the fight .  that was another unlooked for complication .      the emperor cleon frowned .     then our mathematician  what it his name .         seldon  sire .  hari seldon .         then this seldon is out of reach .         in a sense  sire .  we have traced his movements and he is now at streeling university .  while there  he is untouchable .      the emperor scowled and reddened slightly .     i am annoyed at that word    untouchable .     there should be nowhere in the empire my hand cannot reach .  yet here  on my own world  you tell me someone can be untouchable .  insufferable .         your hand can reach to the university  sire .  you can send in your army and pluck out this seldon at any moment you desire .  to do so  however  is  .   .   .  undesirable .         why don   t you say    impractical      demerzel .  you sound like the mathematician speaking of his fortune telling .  it is possible  but impractical .  i am an emperor who finds everything possible  but very little practical .  remember  demerzel  if reaching seldon is not practical  reaching you is entirely so .      eto demerzel let this last comment pass .  the    man behind the throne    knew his importance to the emperor  he had heard such threats before .  he waited in silence while the emperor glowered .  drumming his fingers against the arm of his chair  cleon asked   .  . well then  what good is this mathematician to us if he is at streeling university .         it may perhaps be possible  sire  to snatch use out of adversity .  at the university  he may decide to work on his psychohistory .         even though he insists it   s impractical .         he may be wrong and he may find out that he is wrong .  and if he finds out that he is wrong  we would find some way of getting him out of the university .  it is even possible he would join us voluntarily under those circumstances .      the emperor remained lost in thought for a while  then said     and what if someone else plucks him out before we do .         who would want to do that  sire .     asked demerzel softly .      the mayor of wye  for one      said cleon  suddenly shouting .     he dreams still of taking over the empire .         old age has drawn his fangs  sire .         don   t you believe it  demerzel .         and we have no reason for supposing he has any interest in seldon or even knows of him  sire .         come on  demerzel .  if we heard of the paper  so could wye .  if we see the possible importance of seldon  so could wye .         if that should happen      said demerzel     or even if there should be a reasonable chance of its happening  then we would be justified in taking strong measures .         how strong .      demerzel said cautiously     it might be argued that rather than have seldon in wye   s hands  we might prefer to have him in no one   s hands .  to have him cease to exist  sire .         to have him killed  you mean      said cleon .      if you wish to put it that way  sire      said demerzel .        .     hari seldon sat back in his chair in the alcove that had been assigned to him through dors venabili   s intervention .  he was dissatisfied .   as a matter of fact  although that was the expression he used in his mind  he knew that it was a gross underestimation of his feelings .  he was not simply dissatisfied  he was furious  all the more so because he wasn   t sure what it was he was furious about .  was it about the histories .  the writers and compilers of histories .  the worlds and people that made the histories .   whatever the target of his fury  it didn   t really matter .  what counted was that his notes were useless  his new knowledge was useless  everything was useless .   he had been at the university now for almost six weeks .  he had managed to find a computer outlet at the very start and with it had begun work  without instruction  but using the instincts he had developed over a number of years of mathematical labors .  it had been slow and halting  but there was a certain pleasure in gradually determining the routes by which he could get his questions answered .   then came the week of instruction with dors  which had taught him several dozen shortcuts and had brought with it two sets of embarrassments .  the first set included the sidelong glances he received from the undergraduates  who seemed contemptuously aware of his greater age and who were disposed to frown a bit at dors   s constant use of the honorific    doctor    in addressing him .      i don   t want them to think      she said     that you   re some backward perpetual student taking remedial history .         but surely you   ve established the point .  surely  a mere    seldon    is sufficient now .         no      dors said and smiled suddenly .     besides  i like to call you    dr .  seldon .     i like the way you look uncomfortable each time .         you have a peculiar sense of sadistic humor .         would you deprive me .      for some reason  that made him laugh .  surely  the natural reaction would have been to deny sadism .  somehow he found it pleasant that she accepted the ball of conversation and fired it back .  the thought led to a natural question .     do you play tennis here at the university .         we have courts  but i don   t play .         good .  i   ll teach you .  and when i do  i   ll call you professor venabili .          that   s what you call me in class anyway .         you   ll be surprised how ridiculous it will sound on the tennis court .          i may get to like it .         in that case  i will try to find what else you might get to like .         i see you have a peculiar sense of salacious humor .      she had put that ball in that spot deliberately and he said     would you deprive me .      she smiled and later did surprisingly well on the tennis court .     are you sure you never played tennis .     he said  puffing  after one session .      positive      she said .   the other set of embarrassments was more private .  he learned the necessary techniques of historical research and then burned in private at his earlier attempts to make use of the computer   s memory .  it was simply an entirely different mindset from that used in mathematics .  it was equally logical  he supposed  since it could be used  consistently and without error  to move in whatever direction he wanted to  but it was a substantially different brand of logic from that to which he was accustomed .   but with or without instructions  whether he stumbled or moved in swiftly  he simply didn   t get any results .   his annoyance made itself felt on the tennis court .  dors quickly reached the stage where it was no longer necessary to lob easy balls at her to give her time to judge direction and distance .  that made it easy to forget that she was just a beginner and he expressed his anger in his swing  firing the ball back at her as though it were a laser beam made solid .   she came trotting up to the net and said     i can understand your wanting to kill me  since it must annoy you to watch me miss the shots so often .  how is it  though  that you managed to miss my head by about three centimeters that time .  i mean  you didn   t even nick me .  can   t you do better than that .      seldon  horrified  tried to explain  but only managed to sound incoherent .   she said     look .  i   m not going to face any other returns of yours today  so why don   t we shower and then get together for some tea and whatever and you can tell me just what you were trying to kill .  if it wasn   t my poor head and if you don   t get the real victim off your chest  you   ll be entirely too dangerous on the other side of the net for me to want to serve as a target .      over tea he said     dors  i   ve scanned history after history  just scanned  browsed .  i haven   t had time for deep study yet .  even so  it   s become obvious .  all the book films concentrate on the same few events .         crucial ones .  history making ones .         that   s just an excuse .  they   re copying each other .  there are twenty five million worlds out there and there   s significant mention of perhaps twentyfive .      dors said     you   re reading general galactic histories only .  look up the special histories of some of the minor worlds .  on every world  however small  the children are taught local histories before they ever find out there   s a great big galaxy outside .  don   t you yourself know more about helicon  right now  than you know about the rise of trantor or of the great interstellar war .         that sort of knowledge is limited too      said seldon gloomily .     i know heliconian geography and the stories of its settlement and of the malfeasance and misfeasance of the planet jennisek  that   s our traditional enemy  though our teachers carefully told us that we ought to say    traditional rival .     but i never learned anything about the contributions of helicon to general galactic history .         maybe there weren   t any .         don   t be silly .  of course there were .  there may not have been great  huge space battles involving helicon or crucial rebellions or peace treaties .  there may not have been some imperial competitor making his base on helicon .  but there must have been subtle influences .  surely  nothing can happen anywhere without affecting everywhere else .  yet there   s nothing i can find    to help me .  wee here  dors .  in mathematics  all can be found in the computer  everything we know or have found out in twenty thousand years .  in history  that   s not so .  historians pick and choose and every one of them picks and chooses the same thing .         but  hari      said dors     mathematics is an orderly thing of human invention .  one thing follows from another .  there are definitions and axioms  all of which are known .  it is  .   .   .  it is  .   .   .  all one piece .  history is different .  it is the unconscious working out of the deeds and thoughts of quadrillions of human beings .  historians must pick and choose .         exactly      said seldon     but i must know all of history if i am to work out the laws of psychohistory .         in that case  you won   t ever formulate the laws of psychohistory .      that was yesterday .  now seldon sat in his chair in his alcove  having spent another day of utter failure  and he could hear dors   s voice saying     in that case  you won   t ever formulate the laws of psychohistory .      it was what he had thought to begin with and if it hadn   t been for hummin   s conviction to the contrary and his odd ability to fire seldon with his own blaze of conviction  seldon would have continued to think so .   and yet neither could he quite let go .  might there not be some way out .   he couldn   t think of any .     upperside    trantor   .   .   .  it is almost never pictured as a world seen from space .  it has long since captured the general mind of humanity as a world of the interior and the image is that of the human hive that existed under the domes .  yet there was an exterior as well and there are holographs that still remain that were taken from apace and show varying degrees of devil  see figures    and l    .  note that the surface of the domes  the interface of the vast city and the overlying atmosphere  a surface referred to in its time as    upperside      is  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       .     yet the following day found hari seldon back in the library .  for one thing  there was his promise to hummin .  he had promised to try and he couldn   t very well make it a halfhearted process .  for another  he owed something to himself too .  he resented having to admit failure .  not yet  at least .  not while he could plausibly tell himself he was following up leads .   so he stared at the list of reference book films he had not yet checked through and tried to decide which of the unappetizing number had the slightest chance of being useful to him .  he had about decided that the answer was    none of the above    and saw no way out but to look at samples of each when he was startled by a gentle tap against the alcove wall .   seldon looked up and found the embarrassed face of usung rands peering at him around the edge of the alcove opening .  seldon knew randa  had been introduced to him by dors  and had dined with him  and with others  on several occasions .   randa  an instructor in psychology  was a little man  short and plump  with a round cheerful face and an almost perpetual smile .  he had a sallow complexion and the narrowed eyes so characteristic of people on millions of worlds .  seldon knew that appearance well  for there were many of the great mathematicians who had borne it  and he had frequently seen their holograms .  yet on helicon he had never seen one of these easterners .   by tradition they were called that  though no one knew why  and the easterners themselves were said to resent the term to some degree  but again no one knew why .       there   s millions of us here on trantor      randa had said  smiling with no trace of self consciousness  when seldon  on first meeting him  had not been able to repress all trace of startled surprise .     you   ll also find lot of southerners  dark skins  tightly curled hair .  did you ever see one .         not on helicon      muttered seldon .      all westerners on helicon  eh .  how dull .  but it doesn   t matter .  takes all kinds .      he left seldon wondering at the fact that there were easterners  southerners  and westerners  but no northerners .  he had tried finding an answer to why that might be in his reference searches and had not succeeded .    and now randa   s good natured face was looking at him with an almost ludicrous look of concern .  he said     are you all right  seldon .      seldon stared .     yes  of course .  why shouldn   t i be .         i   m just going by sounds  my friend .  you were screaming .         screaming .     seldon looked at him with offended disbelief .      not loud .  like this .     ranch gritted his teeth and emitted a strangled high pitched sound from the back of his throat .     if i   m wrong  i apologize for this unwarranted intrusion on you .  please forgive me .      seldon hung his head .     you   re forgiven  lisung .  i do make that sound sometimes  i   m told .  i assure you it   s unconscious .  i   m never aware of it .         are you aware why you make it .         yes .  frustration .  frustration .       randa beckoned seldon closer and lowered his voice further .     we   re disturbing people .  let   s come out to the lounge before we   re thrown out .      in the lounge  over a pair of mild drinks  randa said     may i ask you  as a matter of professional interest  why you are feeling frustration .      seldon shrugged .     why does one usually feel frustration .  i   m tackling something in which i am making no progress .         but you   re a mathematician  hari .  why should anything in the history library frustrate you .         what were you doing here .         passing through as part of a shortcut to where i was going when i heard you  .   .   .  moaning .  now you see     and he smiled     it   s no longer a shortcut  but a serious delay one that i welcome  however .         i wish i were just passing through the history library  but i   m trying to solve a mathematical problem that requires some knowledge of history and i   m afraid i   m not handling it well .      randa stared at seldon with an unusually solemn expression on his face  then he said     pardon me  but i must run the risk of offending you now .  i   ve been computering you .         computering me .  .     seldon   s eyes widened .  he felt distinctly angry .      i have offended you .  but  you know  i had an uncle who was a mathematician .  you might even have heard of him  kiangtow randa .      seldon drew in his breath .     are you a relative of that randa .         yes .  he is my father   s older brother and he was quite displeased with me for not following in his footsteps  he has no children of his own .  i thought somehow that it might please him that i had met a mathematician and i wanted to boast of you  if i could  so i checked what information the mathematics library might have .         i see .  and that   s what you were really doing there .  well  i   m sorry .  i don   t suppose you could do much boasting .         you suppose wrong .  i was impressed .  i couldn   t make heads or tails of the subject matter of your papers  but somehow the information seemed to be very favorable .  and when i checked the news files  i found you were at the decennial convention earlier this year .  so  .   .   .  what   s    psychohistory      anyway .  obviously  the first two syllables stir my curiosity .         i see you got that word out of it .         unless i   m totally misled  it seemed to me that you can work out the future course of history .      seldon nodded wearily     that  more or less  is what psychohistory is or  rather  what it is intended to be .         but is it a serious study .     randa was smiling .     you don   t just throw sticks .         throw sticks .         that   s just a reference to a game played by children on my home planet of hopara .  the game is supposed to tell the future and if you   re a smart kid  you can make a good thing out of it .  tell a mother that her child will grow up beautiful and marry a rich man and it   s good for a piece of cake or a half credit piece on the spot .  she isn   t going to wait and see if it comes true  you are rewarded just for saying it .         i see .  no  i don   t throw sticks .  psychohistory is just an abstract study .  strictly abstract .  it has no practical application at all  except          now we   re getting to it .  exceptions are what are interesting .         except that i would like to work out such an application .  perhaps if i knew more about history          ah  that is why you are reading history .         yes  but it does me no good      said seldon sadly .     there is too much history and there is too little of it that is told .         and that   s what   s frustrating you .      seldon nodded .   randa said     but  hari  you   ve only been here a matter of weeks .         true  but already i can see           you can   t see anything in a few weeks .  you may have to spend your whole lifetime making one little advance .  it may take many generations of work by many mathematicians to make a real inroad on the problem .         i know that  lisung  but that doesn   t make me feel better .  i want to make some visible progress myself .         well  driving yourself to distraction won   t help either .  if it will make you feel better  i can give you an example of a subject much less complex than human history that people have been working for i don   t know how long without making much progress .  i know because a group is working on it right here at the university and one of my good friends is involved .  talk about frustration .  you don   t know what frustration is .         what   s the subject .     seldon felt a small curiosity stirring within him .      meteorology .         meteorology .     seldon felt revolted at the anticlimax .      don   t make faces .  look .  every inhabited world has an atmosphere .  every world has its own atmospheric composition  its own temperature range  its own rotation and revolution rate  its own axial tipping  it   s own land water distribution .  we   ve got twenty five million different problems and no one has succeeded in finding a generalization .          . that   s because atmospheric behavior easily enters a chaotic phase .  everyone knows that .         so my friend jenarr leggen says .  you   ve met him .      seldon considered .     tall fellow .  long nose .  doesn   t speak much .         that   s the one .  and trantor itself is a bigger puzzle than almost any world .  according to the records  it had a fairly normal weather pattern when it was first settled .  then  as the population grew and urbanization spread  more energy was used and more heat was discharged into the atmosphere .  the ice cover contracted  the cloud layer thickened  and the weather got lousier .  that encouraged the movement underground and set off a vicious cycle .  the worse the weather got  the more eagerly the land was dug into and the domes built and the weather got still worse .  now the planet has become a world of almost incessant cloudiness and frequent rains  or snows when it   s cold enough .  the only thing is that no one can work it out properly .  no one has worked out an analysis that can explain why the weather has deteriorated quire as it has or how one can reasonably predict the details of its day today changes .      seldon shrugged .     is that sort of thing important .         to a meteorologist it is .  why can   t they be as frustrated over their problems as you are over yours .  don   t be a project chauvinist .     .   seldon remembered the cloudiness and the dank chill on the way to the emperor   s palace .   he said     so what   s being done about it .         well  there   s a big project on the matter here at the university end jenarr leggen is part of it .  they feel that if they can understand the weather change on trantor  they will learn a great deal about the basic laws of general meteorology .  leggen wants that as much as you want your laws of psychohistory .  so he has set up an incredible array of instruments of all kinds upperside  .   .   .  you know  above the domes .  it hasn   t helped them so far .  and if there   s so much work being done for many generations on the atmosphere  without results  how can you complain that you haven   t gotten anything out of human history in a few weeks .      randa was right  seldon thought  and he himself was being unreasonable and wrong .  and yet  .   .   .  and yet  .   .   .  hummin would say that this failure in the scientific attack on problems was another sign of the degeneration of the times .  perhaps he was right  also  except that he was speaking of a general degeneration and average effect .  seldon felt no degeneration of ability and mentality in himself .   he said with some interest then     you mean that people climb up out of the domes and into the open air above .         yes .  upperside .  it   s a funny thing  though .  most native trantorians won   t do it .  they don   t like to go upperside .  the idea gives them vertigo or something .  most of those working on the meteorology project are outworlders .      seldon looked out of the window and the lawns and small garden of the university campus  brilliantly lit without shadows or oppressive heat  and said thoughtfully     i don   t know that i can blame trantorians for liking the comfort of being within  but i should think curiosity would drive come upperside .  it would drive me .         do you mean that you would like to see meteorology in action .         i think i would .  how does one get upperside .         nothing to it .  an elevator rakes you up  a door opens  and there you are .  i   ve been up there .  it   s  .   .   .  novel .         it would get my mind off psychohistory for a while .     seldon sighed .     i   d welcome that .         on the other hand      said randy     my uncle used to say     all knowledge is one      and he may be right .  you may learn something from meteorology that will help you with your psychohistory .  isn   t that possible .  .      seldon smiled weakly .     a great many things are possible .     and to himself he added  but not practical .        .     dors seemed amused .     meteorology .      seldon said     yes .  there   s work scheduled for tomorrow and i   ll go up with them .         are you tired of history .      seldon nodded his head somberly .     yes  i am .  i   ll welcome the change .  besides  randy says it   s another problem that   s too massive for mathematics to handle and it will do me good to see that my situation isn   t unique .         i hope you   re not agoraphobic .      seldon smiled .     no  i   m not  but i see why you ask .  randy says that trantorians are frequently agoraphobic and won   t go upperside .  i imagine they feel uncomfortable without a protective enclosure .      dors nodded .     you can see where that would be natural  but there are also many trantorians who are to be found among the planets of the galaxy tourists  administrators  soldiers .  and agoraphobia isn   t particularly rare in the outworlds either .         that may be  dors  but i   m not agoraphobic .  i am curious and i welcome the change  so i   ll be joining them tomorrow .      does hesitated .     i should go up with you  but i have a heavy schedule tomorrow .  gill  if you   re not agoraphobic  you   ll have no trouble and you   ll probably enjoy yourself .  oh  and stay close to the meteorologists .  i   ve heard of people getting lost up there .         i   ll be careful .  it   s a long time since i   ve gotten truly lost anywhere .           .     jenarr leggen had a dark look about him .  it was not so much his complexion  which was fair enough .  it was not even his eyebrows  which were thick and dark enough .  it was  rather  that those eyebrows were hunched over deep set eyes and a long and rather prominent nose .  he had  as a result  a most unmerry look .  his eyes did not smile and when he spoke  which wasn   t often  he had a deep  strong voice  surprisingly resonant for his rather thin body .   he said     you   ll need warmer clothing than that  seldon .      seldon said     oh .     and looked about .   there were two men and two women who were making ready to go up with leggen and seldon and  as in leggen   s own case  their rather satiny trantorian clothing was covered by thick sweaters that  not surprisingly  were brightly colored in bold designs .  no two were even faintly alike  of course .   seldon looked down at himself and said     sorry  i didn   t know but i don   t have any suitable outer garment .         i can give you one .  i think there   s a spare here somewhere .  yes  here it is .  a little threadbare  but it   s better than nothing .         wearing sweaters like these tan make you unpleasantly warm      said seldon .      here they would      said leggen .     other conditions exist upperside .  cold and windy .  too bad i don   t have spare leggings and boots for you too .  you   ll want them later .      they were taking with them a tart of instruments  which they were testing one by one with what seldon thought was unnecessary slowness .      your home planet cold .     asked leggen .   seldon said     parts of it  of course .  the part of helicon i come from is mild and often rainy .         too bad .  you won   t like the weather upperside .         i think i can manage to endure it for the time we   ll be up there .      when they were ready  the group filed into an elevator that was marked  official use only .      that   s because it goes upperside      said one of the young women     and people aren   t supposed to be up there without good reason .      seldon had not met the young woman before  but he had heard her addressed as clowzia .  he didn   t know if that was a first name  a last name  or a nickname .   the elevator seemed no different from others that seldon had been on  either here on trantor or at home in helicon  barring  of course  the gravitic lift he and hummin had used   but there was something about knowing that it was going to take him out of the confines of the planet and into emptiness above that made it feel like a spaceship .   seldon smiled internally .  a foolish fantasy .   the elevator quivered slightly  which remind seldon of hummin   s forebodings of galactic decay .  leggen  along with the other men and one of the women  seemed frozen and waiting  as though they had suspended thought as well as activity until they could get out  but clowzia kept glancing at him as though she found him terribly impressive .   seldon leaned close and whispered to her  he hesitated to disturb the others      are we going up very high .         high .     she repeated .  she spoke in a normal voice  apparently not feeling that the others required silence .  she seemed very young and it occurred to seldon that she was probably an undergraduate .  an apprentice  perhaps .      we   re taking a long time .  upperside must be many stories high in the air .      for a moment  she looked puzzled .  then     oh no .  not high at all .  we started very deep .  the university is at a low level .  we use a great deal of energy and if we   re quire deep  the energy costs are lower .      leggen said     all right .  we   re here .  lets get the equipment out .      the elevator stopped with a small shudder and the wide door slid open rapidly .  the temperature dropped at once and seldon thrust his hands into his pockets and was very glad he had a sweater on .  a cold wind stirred his hair and it occurred to him that he would have found a hat useful and  even as he thought that  leggen pulled something out of a fold in his sweater  snapped it open  and put it on his head .  the others did the same .   only clowzia hesitated .  she paused just before she put hers on  then offered it to seldon .   seldon shook his head .     i can   t take your hat  clowzia .         go ahead .  i have long hair and it   s pretty thick .  yours is short and a little  .   .   .  thin .      seldon would have liked to deny that firmly and at another time he would have .  now  however  he took the hat and mumbled     thank you .  if your head gets cold  i   ll give it back .      maybe she wasn   t so young .  it was her round face  almost a baby face .  and now that she had called attention to her hair  he could see that it was a charming russet shade .  he had never seen hair quite like that on helicon .   outside it was cloudy  as it had been the time he was taken across open country to the palace .  it was considerably colder than it had been then  but he assumed that was because they were six weeks farther into winter .  the clouds were thicker than they had been on the earlier occasion and the day was distinctly darker and threatening  or was it just closer to night .  surely  they wouldn   t come up to do important work without leaving themselves an ample period of daylight to do it in .  or did they expect to take very little time .   he would have liked to have asked  but it occurred to him that they might not like questions at this time .  all of them seemed to be in states varying from excitement to anger .   seldon inspected his surroundings .   he was standing on something that he thought might be dull metal from the sound it made when he surreptitiously thumped his foot down on it .  it was not bare metal  however .  when he walked  he left footprints .  the surface was clearly covered by dust or fine sand or clay .   well  why not .  there could scarcely be anyone coming up here to dust the place .  he bent down to pinch up some of the matter out of curiosity .   clowzia had come up to him .  she noticed what he was doing and said  with the air of a housewife caught at an embarrassing negligence     we do sweep hereabouts for the sake of the instruments .  it   s much worse most places upperside  but it really doesn   t matter .  it makes for insulation  you know .      seldon grunted and continued to look about .  there was no chance of understanding the instruments that looked as though they were growing out of the thin soil  if one could call it that  .  he hadn   t the faintest idea of what they were or what they measured .   leggen was walking toward him .  he was picking up his feet and putting them down gingerly and it occurred to seldon that he was doing so to avoid jarring the instruments .  he made a mental note to walk that way himself .      you .  seldon .      seldon didn   t quite like the tone of voice .  he replied coolly     yes  dr .  leggen .         well  dr .  seldon  then .     he said it impatiently .     that little fellow randa told me you are a mathematician .         that   s wit .         a good one .         i   d like to think so  but it   s a hard thing to guarantee .         and you   re interested in intractable problems .      seldon said feelingly     i   m stuck with one .         i   m stuck with another .  you   re free to look about .  if you have any questions  our intern  clowzia  will help out .  you might be able to help us .         i would be delighted to  but i know nothing about meteorology .         that   s all right  seldon .  i just want you to get a feel for this thing and then i   d like to discuss my mathematics  such as it is .         i   m at your service .      leggen turned away  his long scowling fare looking grim .  then he turned back .     if you get cold  too cold  the elevator door is open .  you just step in and touch the spot marked  university base .  it will take you down and the elevator will then return to us automatically .  clowzia will show you if you forget .         i won   t forget .      this time he did leave and seldon looked after him  feeling the cold wind knife through his sweater .  clowzia came back over to him  her face slightly reddened by that wind .   seldon said     dr .  leggen seems annoyed .  or is that just his ordinary outlook on life .      she giggled .     he does look annoyed most of the time  but right now he really is .      seldon said very naturally     why .      clowzia looked over her shoulder  her long hair swirling .  then she said     i   m not supposed to know  but i do just the same .  dr .  leggen had it all figured out that today  just at this time  there was going to be a break in the clouds and he   d been planning to make special measurements in sunlight .  only  .   .   .  well  look at the weather .      seldon nodded .      we have holovision receivers up here  so he knew it was cloudy worse than usual and i guess he was hoping there would be something wrong with the instruments so that it would be their fault and not that of his theory .  so far  though  they haven   t found anything out of the way .         and that   s why he looks so unhappy .         well  he never looks happy .       seldon looked about  squinting .  despite the clouds  the light was harsh .  he became aware that the surface under his feet was not quire horizontal .  he was standing on a shallow dome and as he looked outward there were other domes in all directions  with different widths and heights .      upperside seems to be irregular      he said .      mostly  i think .  thai s the way it worked out .         any reason for it .         not really .  the way i   ve heard it explained i looked around and asked  just as you did  you know was that originally the people on trantor domed in places  shopping malls  sports arenas  things like that  then whole towns  so that  here were lots of domes here and there  with different heights and different widths .  when they all came together  it was all uneven  but by that time  people decided that   s the way it ought to be .         you mean that something quite accidental came to be viewed as a tradition .          i suppose so  if you want to put it that way .       if something quite accidental can easily become viewed as a tradition and he made unbreakable or nearly so  thought seldon  would that be a law of psychohistory .  it sounded trivial  but how many other laws  equally trivial  might there be .  a million .  a billion .  were there a relatively few general laws from which these trivial ones could be derived as corollaries .  how could he say .  for a while  lost in thought  he almost forgot the biting wind .    clowzia was aware of that wind  however  for she shuddered and said     it   s very nasty .  it   s much better under the dome .         are you a trantorian .     asked seldon .      that   s right .      seldon remembered ranch   s dismissal of trantorians as agoraphobic and said     do you mind being up here .         i hate it      said clowzia     but i want my degree and my specialty and status and dr .  leggen says i can   t get it without some field work .  so here i am  hating it  especially when it   s so cold .  when it   s this cold  by the way  you wouldn   t dream that vegetation actually grows on these domes  would you .         it doer .  .   he looked at clowzia sharply  suspecting some sort of practical joke designed to make him look foolish .  she looked totally innocent  but how much of that was real and how much was just her baby face .      oh sure .  even here  when it   s warmer .  you notice the soil here .  we keep it swept away because of our work  as i said  but in other places it accumulates here and there and is especially deep in the low places where the domes meet .  plants grow in it .         but where does the soil come from .         when the dome covered just part of the planet  the wind deposited soil on them  little by little .  then  when trantor was all covered and the living levels were dug deeper and deeper  some of the material dug up  if suitable  would be spread over the top .         surely  it would break down the domes .         oh no .  the domes are very strong and they   re supported almost everywhere .  the idea was  according to a book film i viewed  that they were going to grow crops upperside  but it turned out to be much more practical to do it inside the dome .  yeast and algae could be cultivated within the domes too  taking the pressure off the usual crops  so it was decided to let upperside go wild .  there are animals on upperside too butterflies  bees  mice  rabbits .  lots of them .         won   t the plant roots damage the domes .         in thousands of years they haven   t .  the domes are treated so that they repel the roots .  most of the growth is grass  but there are trees too .  you   d be able to see for yourself if this were the warm season or if we were farther south or if you were up in a spaceship .     she looked at him with a sidewise flick of her eyes     did you see trantor when you were coming down from space .         no  clowzia  i must confess i didn   t .  the hypership was never well placed for viewing .  have you ever seen trantor from space .      she smiled weakly .     i   ve never been in space .      seldon looked about .  gray everywhere .      i can   t make myself believe it      he said .     about vegetation upperside  i mean .         it   s true  though .  i   ve heard people say  otherworlders  like yourself  who did see trantor from space  that the planet looks green  like a lawn  because it   s mostly grass and underbrush .  there are trees too  actually .  there   s a copse not very far from here .  i   ve seen it .  they   re evergreens and they   re up to six meters high .         where .         you can   t see it from here .  its on the other side of a dome .  it   s       the call came out thinly .   seldon realized they had been walking while they had been talking and had moved away from the immediate vicinity of the others .      clowzia .  get back here .  we need you .      clowzia said     uh oh .  coming .  sorry  dr .  seldon  i have to go .     she ran off  managing to step lightly despite her lined boors .   had she been playing with him .  had she been filling the gullible foreigner with a mess of lies for amusement   s sake .  such things had been known to happen on every world and in every time .  an air of transparent honesty was no guide either  in fact  successful wetellers would deliberately cultivate just such an air .   so could there really be six meter trees upperside .  without thinking much about it  he moved in the direction of the highest dome on the horizon .  he swung his arms in an attempt to warm himself .  and his feet were getting cold .   clowzia hadn   t pointed .  she might have  to give him a hint of the direction of the trees  but she didn   t .  why didn   t she .  to be sure  she had been called away .   the domes were broad rather than high  which was a good thing  since otherwise the going would have been considerably more difficult .  on the other hand  the gentle grade meant trudging a distance before he could top a dome and look down the other side .   eventually  he could see the other side of the dome he had climbed .  he looked back to make sure he could still see the meteorologists and their instruments .  they were a good way off  in a distant valley  but he could see them clearly enough .  good .   he saw no copse  no trees  but there was a depression that snaked about between two domes .  along each side of that crease  the soil was thicker and there were occasional green smears of what might be moss .  if he followed the crease and if it got low enough and the soil was thick enough  there might be trees .   he looked back  trying to fix landmarks in his mind  but there were just the rise and fall of domes .  it made him hesitate and dors   s warning against his being lost  which had seemed a rather unnecessary piece of advice then  made more sense now .  still  it seemed clear to him that the crease was a kind of road .  if he followed it for some distance  he only had to turn about and follow it back to return to this spot .   he strode off purposefully  following the rounded crease downward .  there was a soft rumbling noise above  but he didn   t give it any thought .  he had made up his mind that he wanted to see trees and that was all that occupied him at the moment .   the moss grew thicker and spread out like a carpet and here and there grassy tufts had sprung up .  despite the desolation upperside  the moss was bright green and it occurred to seldon that on a cloudy  overcast planet there was likely to be considerable rain .   the crease continued to curve and there  just above another dome  was a dark smudge against the gray sky and he knew he had found the trees .   then  as though his mind  having been liberated by the sight of those trees  could turn to other things  seldon took note of the rumble he had heard before and had  without thinking  dismissed as the sound of machinery .  now he considered that possibility  was it  indeed  the sound of machinery .   why not .  he was standing on one of the myriad domes that covered hundreds of millions of square kilometers of the worldcity .  there must be machinery of all kinds hidden under those domes  ventilation motors  for one thing .  maybe it could be heard  where and when all the other sounds of the world city were absent .   except that it did not seem to come from the ground .  he looked up at the dreary featureless sky .  nothing .   he continued to scan the sky  vertical creases appearing between his eyes and then  far off  it was a small dark spot  showing up against the gray .  and whatever it was it seemed to be moving about as though getting its bearings before it was obscured by the clouds again .   then  without knowing why  he thought  they   re after me .   and almost before he could work out a line of action  he had taken one .  he ran desperately along the crease toward the trees and then  to reach them more quickly  he turned left and hurtled up and over a low dome  treading through brown and dying fernlike overgrowth  including thorny sprigs with bright red berries .        .     seldon panted  facing a tree  holding it closely  embracing it .  he watched for the flying object to make its appearance again so that he could back about the tree and hide on the far side  like a squirrel .   the tree was cold  its bark was rough  it gave no comfort  but it offered cover .  of course  that might be insufficient  if he was being searched for with a heat seeker  but  on the other hand  the cold trunk of a tree might blur even that .   below him was hard pecked soil .  even in this moment of hiding  of attempting to see his pursuer while remaining unseen  he could not help wondering how thick the soil might be  how long it had taken to accumulate  many domes in the warmer areas of trantor tarried forests on their back  and whether the trees were always confined to the creases between domes  leaving the higher regions to moss  grass  and underbrush .   he sew it again .  it was not a hypership  nor even an ordinary airjet .  it was a jet down .  he could see the faint glow of the ion trails corning out at the vertices of a hexagon  neutralizing the gravitational pull and allowing the wings to keep it aloft like a large soaring bird .  it was a vehicle that could hover and explore a planetary terrain .   it was only the clouds than had saved him .  even if they were using heat seekers  that would only indicate there were people below .  the jetdown would have make a tentative dive below the banked ceiling before it could hope to know how many human beings there were and whether any of them might be the particular person the patties aboard were seeking .   the jet down was closer now  but it couldn   t hide from him either .  the rumble of the engine gave it away and they couldn   t rum that off  not as long as they wished to continue their search .  seldon knew the jetdowns  for on helicon or on any undomed world with skies that cleared now and then  they were common  with many in private hands .   of what possible use would jet downs be on trantor  with all the human life of the world under domes  with low cloud ceilings all but perpetual except for a few government vehicles designed for just this purpose  that of picking up a wanted person who had been lured above the domes .   why not .  government forces could nor enter the grounds of the university  but perhaps seldon was no longer on the grounds .  he was on top of the domes which might be outside the jurisdiction of any local government .  an imperial vehicle might have every right to land on any part of the dome and question or remove any person found upon is hummin had not warned him of this  but perhaps he had merely not thought of doing so .   the jet down was even closer now  nosing about like a blind beast sniffing out its prey .  would it occur to them to search this group of trees .  would they land and send out an armed soldier or two to beat through the copse .   and if so  what could he do .  he was unarmed and all his quicktwist agility would be useless against the agonizing pain of a neuronic whip .   it was not attempting to land .  either they missed the significance of the trees  or .  .  .   a new thought suddenly hit him .  what if this wasn   t a pursuit vessel at all .  what if it was part of the meteorological testing .  surely  meteorologists would want to test the upper reaches of the atmosphere .   was he a fool to hide from it .   the sky was getting darker .  the clouds were getting thicker or  much more likely  night was falling .   and it was getting colder and would get colder still .  was he going to stay out here freezing because a perfectly harmless jetdown had made an appearance and had activated a sense of paranoia that he had never felt before .  he had a strong impulse to leave the copse and get back to the meteorological station .   after all  how would the man hummin feared so much demercel know that seldon would  at this particular time  be upperside and ready to be taken .   for a moment  that seemed conclusive and  shivering with the cold  he moved out from behind the tree .   and then he scurried back as the vessel reappeared even closer than before .  he hadn   t seen it do anything that would seem to be meteorological .  it did nothing that might be considered sampling  measuring  or testing .  would he see such things if they took place .  he did not know the precise sort of instruments the jet down carried or how they worked .  if they were doing meteorological work  he might not be able to tell .   still  could he take the chance of coming into the open .   after all  what if demerzel did know of his presence upperside  simply because an agent of his  working in the university  knew about it and had reported the matter .  listing randa  that cheerful  smiling little easterner  had suggested he go upperside .  he had suggested it quite forcefully and the subject had not arisen naturally out of the conversation  at least  not naturally enough .  was it possible that he was a government agent and had alerted demerzel somehow .   then there was leggen  who had given him the sweater .  the sweater was useful  but why hadn   t leggen told him he would need one earlier so he could get his own .  was there something special about the one he was wearing .  it was uniformly purple  while all the others    indulged in the trantorian fashion of bright patterns .  anyone looking down from a height would see a moving dull blotch in among others that were bright and know immediately whom they wanted .   and clowzia .  she was supposedly upperside to learn meteorology and help the meteorologists .  how was it possible that she could come to him  talk to him at ease  and quietly walk him away from the others and isolate him so that he could easily be picked up .   for that matter  what about dors venabili .  she knew he was going upperside .  she did not stop it .  she might have gone with him  but she was conveniently busy .   it was a conspiracy .  surely  it was a conspiracy .   he had convinced himself now and there was no further thought of getting out from the shelter of the trees .   his feet felt like lumps of ice and stamping them against the ground seemed to do no good .   would the jet down never leave .   and even as he thought that  the pitch of the engine   s rumble heightened and the jet down rose into the clouds and faded away .   seldon listened eagerly  alert to the smallest sound  making sure it was finally gone .  and then  even after he was sure it was gone  he wondered if that was just a device to flush him out of hiding .  he remained where he was while the minutes slowly crawled on and night continued to fall .   and finally  when he felt that the true alternative to taking the chance of coming out in the open was that of freezing into insensibility  he stepped out and moved cautiously beyond the shelter of the trees .   it was dusky twilight  after all .  they couldn   t detect him except by a hear seeker  but  if so  he would hear die jet down return .  he waited just beyond the trees  counting to himself  ready to hide in the copse again at the smallest sound though what good that would do him once he was spotted  he couldn   t imagine .   seldon looked about .  if he could find the meteorologists  they would surely have artificial light  but except for that  there would be nothing .   he could still just make out his surroundings  but in a matter of a quarter of an hour  half an hour at the outside  he would not .  with no lights and a cloudy sky above  it would be dark completely dark .   desperate at the prospect of being enveloped in total darkness  seldon realized that he would have to find his way back to the crease that had brought him there as quickly as possible and retrace his steps .  folding his arms tightly around himself for warmth  he set off in what he thought was the direction of the crease between the domes .   there might  of course  be more than one crease leading away from the copse  but he dimly made out some of the sprigs of berries he had seen coming in  which now looked almost black rather than bright red .  he could not delay .  he had to assume he was right .  he moved up the crease as fast as he might  guided by failing sight and by the vegetation underfoot .   but he couldn   t stay in the crease forever .  he had come over what had seemed to him to be the tallest dome in sight and had found a crease that cut at right angles across his line of approach .  by his reckoning  he should now turn right  then sharp left  and that would put him on the path toward the meteorologists    dome .   seldon made the left turn and  lifting his head  he could just make out the curve of a dome against the fractionally lighter sky .  that had to be it .   or was that only wishful thinking .   he had no choice but to assume it wasn   t .  keeping his eye on the peak so that he could move in a reasonably straight line  he headed for it as quickly as he could .  as he got closer  he could make out the line of dome against sky with less and less certainty as it loomed larger and larger .  soon  if he was correct  he would be going up a gentle slope and when that slope became level he would be able to look down the other side and see the lights of the meteorologists .   in the inky dark  he could not tell what lay in his path .  wishing there were at least a few sorts to shed some light  he wondered if this was how it felt to be blind .  he waved his arms before him as if they were antennae .   it was growing colder by the minute and he paused occasionally to blow on his hands and hold them under his armpits .  he wished earnestly he could do the same for his feet .  by now  he thought  if it started to precipitate  it would be snow or  worse yet  sleet .   on  .   .   .  on .  there was nothing else to do .   eventually  it seemed to him that he was moving downward .  that was either wishful thinking or he had topped the dome .   he stopped .  if he had topped the dome  he should be able to see the artificial light of the meteorological station .  he would see the lights carried by the meteorologists themselves  sparkling or dancing like fireflies .   seldon closed his eyes as though to accustom them to dark and then try again  but that was a foolish effort .  it was no darker with his eyes closed than with them open and when he opened them it was no lighter than when he had had them closed .   possibly leggen and the others were gone  had taken their lights with them and had turned off any lights on the instruments .  or possibly seldon had climbed the wrong dome .  or he had followed a curved path along the dome so that he was now facing in the wrong direction .  or he had followed the wrong crease and had moved away from the copse in the wrong direction altogether .   what should he do .   if he was facing the wrong direction  there was a chance that light would be visible right or left  and it wasn   t .  if he had followed the wrong crease  there was no possible way he could return to the copse and locate a different crease .   his only chance lay in the assumption that he was facing the right direction and that the meteorological station was more or less directly ahead of him  but that the meteorologists had gone and had left it in darkness .   move forward  then .  the chances of success might be small  but it was the only chance he had .   he estimated that it had taken him half an hour to move from the meteorological station to the top of the dome  having gone partway with clowzia and sauntering with her rather than striding .  he was moving at little better than a saunter now in the daunting darkness .   seldon continued to slog forward .  it would have been nice to know the time and he had a timeband  of course  but in the dark  he stopped .  he wore a trantorian timeband  which gave galactic standard time  as all timebands did  and which also gave trantorian local time .  timebands were usually visible in the dark  phosphorescing so that one could tell time in the quiet dark of a bedchamber .  a heliconian timeband certainly would  why not a trantorian one .   he looked at his timeband with reluctant apprehension and touched the contact that would draw upon the power source for light .  the timeband gleamed feebly and told him the time was      .  for it to be nighttime already  seldon knew that it must be the winter season .   how far past the solstice was it .  what was the degree of axial tipping .  how long was the year .  how far from the equator was he at this moment .  there was no hint of an answer to any of these things  but what counted was that the spark of light was visible .   he was not blind .  somehow the feeble glow of his timeband gave him renewed hope .   his spirits rose .  he would move on in the direction he was going .  he would move for half an hour .  if he encountered nothing  he would move on five minutes more no further just five minutes .  if he still encountered nothing  he would stop and think .  that  however  would be thirty five minutes from now .  till then  he would concentrate only on walking and on willing himself to feel warmer  he wiggled his toes  vigorously .  he could still feel them .    seldon trudged onward and the half hour passed .  he paused  then hesitantly  he moved on for five more minutes .   now he had to decide .  there was nothing .  he might be nowhere  far removed from any opening into the dome .  he might  on the other hand  be standing three meters to the left  or right  or short of the meteorological station .  he might be two arms    lengths from the opening into the dome  which would not  however  be open .   now what .   was there any point in shouting .  he was enveloped by utter silence but for the whistling of the wind .  if there were birds  beasts  or insects in among the vegetation on the domes  they were not here during this season or at this time of night or at this particular place .  the wind continued to chill him .   perhaps he should have been shouting all due way .  the sound might have carried a good distance in the cold air .  but would there have been anyone to hear him .   would they hear him inside the dome .  were there instruments to detect sound or movement from above .  might there not be sentinels just inside .   that seemed ridiculous .  they would have heard his footsteps  wouldn   t they .   still   he called out .     help .  help .  can someone hear me .      his cry was strangled  half embarrassed .  it seemed silly shouting into vast black nothingness .   but then  he felt it was even sillier to hesitate in such a situation as this .  panic was welling up in him .  he took in a deep  cold breath and screamed for as long as he could .  another breath and another scream  changing pitch .  and another .   seldon paused  breathless  turning his head every which way  even though there was nothing to see .  he could not even detect an echo .  there was nothing left to do but wait for the dawn .  but how long was the night at this season of the year .  and how cold would it get .   he felt a tiny cold touch sting his face .  after a while  another .   it was sleeting invisibly in the pitch blackness .  and there was no way to find shelter .   he thought  it would have been better if that jet down had seen me and picked me up .  i would be a prisoner at this moment  perhaps  but i   d be warm and comfortable  at least .       or  if hummin had never interfered  i might have been back in helicon long ago .  under surveillance  but warm and comfortable .  right now that was all he wanted to be warm and conformable .   but at the moment he could only wait .  he huddled down  knowing that however long the night  he dared not sleep .  he slipped off his shoes and rubbed his icy feet .  quickly  he put his shoes back on .   he knew he would have to repeat this  as well as rubbing his hands and ears all night long to keep his circulation flowing .  but most important to remember was that he must not let himself fall asleep .  that would mean certain death .   and  having carefully thought all this out  his eyes closed and he nodded off to sleep with the sleet coming down .     rescue    leggen  jenarr   .   .   .  his contributions to meteorology  however  although considerable  pale before what has ever since been known as the leggen controversy .  that his actions helped to place hari seldon in jeopardy is undisputable  but argument rages  and has always raged  as to whether those actions were the result of unintentional circumstance or part of a deliberate conspiracy .  passions have been raised on both sides and even the most elaborate studies have come to no definite conclusions .  nevertheless  the suspicions that were raised helped poison leggen   s career and private life in the years that followed  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       .     it was not quite the end of daylight when dors venabili sought out jenarr leggen .  he answered her rather anxious greeting with a grunt and a brief nod .      well      she said a trifle impatiently .     how was he .      leggen  who was entering data into his computer  said     how was who .            my library student hari .  dr .  hari seldon .  he went up with you .  was he any help to you .      leggen removed his hands from the keys of his computer and swivelled about .     that heliconian fellow .  he was of no use at all .  showed no interest whatever .  he kept looking at the scenery when there was no scenery to look at .  a real oddball .  why did you want to send him up .         it wasn   t my idea .  he wanted to .  i can   t understand it .  he was very interested .   where is he now .      leggen shrugged .     how would i know .  somewhere around .         where did he go after he came down with you .  did he say .         he didn   t come down with us .  i told you he wasn   t interested .         then when did he come down .         i don   t know .  i wasn   t watching him .  i had an enormous amount of work to do .  there must have been a windstorm and some sort of downpour about two days ago and neither was expected .  nothing our instruments showed offered a good explanation for it or for the fact that some sunshine we were expecting today didn   t appear .  now i   m trying to make sense of it and you   re bothering me .         you mean you didn   t see him go down .         look .  he wasn   t on my mind .  the idiot wasn   t correctly dressed and i could see that inside of half an hour he wasn   t going to be able to take the cold .  i gave him a sweater  but that wasn   t going to help much for his legs and feet .  so i left the elevator open for him and i told him how to use it and explained that it would take him down and then return automatically .  it was all very simple and i   m sure he did get cold and he did go down and the elevator did come back and then eventually we all went down .         but you don   t know exactly when he went down .         no  i don   t .  i told you .  i was busy .  he certainly wasn   t up there when we left  though  and by that time twilight was coming on and it looked as though it might sleet .  so he had to have gone down .         did anyone else see him go down .         i don   t know .  clowzia may have .  she was with him for a while .  why don   t you ask her .      dors found clowzia in her quarters  just emerging from a hot shower .      it was cold up there      she said .   dors said     were you with hari seldon upperside .      clowzia said  eyebrows lifting     yes  for a while .  he wanted to wander about and ask questions about the vegetation up there .  he   s a sharp fellow  dors .  everything seemed to interest him  so i told him what i could till leggen called me back .  he was in one of his knock your head off tempers .  the weather wasn   t working and he       dors interrupted .     then you didn   t see hari go down in the elevator .         i didn   t see him at all after leggen called me over .    but he bas to be down here .  he wasn   t up there when we left .         but i can   t find him anywhere .      clowzia looked perturbed .     really .   but he   s got to be somewhere down here .         no  he doesn   t have to be somewhere down here      said dors  her anxiety growing .     what if he   s still up there .         that   s impossible .  he wasn   t .  naturally  we looked about for him before we left .  leggen had shown him how to go down .  he wasn   t properly dressed and it was rotten weather .  leggen told him if he got cold not to wait for us .  he was getting cold .  i know .  so what else could he do but go down .         but no one saw him go down .   did anything go wrong with him up there .         nothing .  not while i was with him .  he was perfectly fine except that he had to be cold  of course .      dors  by now quite unsettled  said     since no one saw him go down  he might still be up there .  shouldn   t we go up and look .      clowzia said nervously     i told you we looked around before we went down .  it was still quite light and he was nowhere in sight .         let   s look anyway .         but i can   t take you up there .  i   m just an intern and i don   t have the combination for the upperside dome opening .  you   ll have to ask dr .  leggen .           .     dors venabili knew that leggen would not willingly go upperside now .  he would have to be forced .   first  she checked the library and the dining areas again .  then she called seldon   s room finally  she went up there and signaled at the door .  when seldon did not respond  she had the floor manager open it .  he wasn   t there .  she questioned some of those who  over the last few weeks  had come to know him .  no one had seen him .   well  then  she would make leggen take her upperside .  by now  though  it was night .  he would object strenuously and how long could she spend arguing if hari seldon was trapped up there on a freezing night with sleet turning to snow .   a thought occurred to her and she rushed to the small university computer  which kept track of the doings of the students  faculty  and service staff .   her fingers flew over the keys and she soon had what she wanted .   there were three of them in another part of the campus .  she signed out for a small glidecart to take her over and found the domicile she was looking for .  surely  one of them would be available  or findable .   fortune was with her .  the first door at which she signaled was answered by a query light .  she punched in her identification number  which included her department affiliation .  the door opened and a plump middle aged man stared out at her .  he had obviously been washing up before dinner .  his dark blond hair was askew and he was not wearing any upper garment .   he said     sorry .  you catch me at a disadvantage .  what can i do for you  dr .  venabili .      she said a bit breathlessly     you   re rogen benastra  the chief seismologist  aren   t you .         yes .         this is an emergency .  i must see the seismological records for upperside for the last few hours .      benastra stared at her .     why .  nothing   s happened .  i   d know if it had .  the seismograph would inform us .         i   m not talking about a meteoric impact .         neither am i .  we don   t need a seismograph for that .  i   m talking about gravel  pinpoint fractures .  nothing today .         not that either .  please .  take me to the seismograph and read it for me .  this is life or death .         i have a dinner appointment          i said life or death and i mean it .      benastra said     i don   t see      but he faded out under dors   s glare .  he wiped his face  left quick word on his message relay  end struggled into a shirt .   they half ran  under dors   s pitiless urging  to the small squat seismology building .  dors  who knew nothing about seismology  said     down .  we   re going down .         below the inhabited levels .  of course .  the seismograph has to be fixed to bedrock and be removed from the constant clamor and vibration of the city levels .         but how can you tell what   s happening upperside from down here .         the seismograph is wired to a set of pressure transducers located within the thickness of the dome .  the impact of a speck of grit will send the indicator skittering off the screed .  we can detect the flattening effect on the dome of a high wind .  we can          yes  yes      said dors impatiently .  she was not here for a lecture on the virtues and refinements of the instruments .     can you detect human footsteps .         human footsteps .     benastra looked confused .     that   s not likely upperside .         of course it   s likely .  there were a group of meteorologists upperside this afternoon .         oh .  well  footsteps would scarcely be noticeable .         it would be noticeable if you looked hard enough and that   s what i want you to do .      benastra might have resented the firm note of command in her voice  but  if so  he said nothing .  he touched a contact and the computer screen jumped to life .   at the extreme right center  there was a fat spot of light  from which a thin horizontal line stretched to the left limit of the screen .  there was a tiny wriggle to it  a random nonrepetitive seder of little hiccups and these moved steadily leftward .  it was almost hypnotic in its effect on dors .   benastra said   .  . that   s as quiet as it can possibly be .  anything you see is the result of changing air pressure above  raindrops maybe  the distant whirr of machinery .  there   s nothing up there .         all right  but what about a few hours ago .  check on the records at fifteen hundred today  for instance .  surely  you have some recordings .      benastm gave the computer its necessary instructions and for a second or two there was wild chaos on the screen .  then it settled down and again the horizontal line appeared .      i   ll sensitize it to maximum      muttered benastra .  there were now pronounced hiccups and as they staggered leftward they changed in pattern markedly .      what   s that .     said dors .     tell me .         since you say there were people up there  venabili  i would guess they were footsteps the shifting of weight  the impact of shoes .  i don   t know that i would have guessed it if i hadn   t known about the people up there .  its what we call a benign vibration  not associated with anything we know to be dangerous .         can you tell how many people are present .         certainly not by eye .  you see  we   re getting a resultant of all the impacts .         you say    not by eye .     can the resultant be analyzed into its components by the computer .         i doubt it .  these are minimal effects and you have to allow for the inevitable noise .  the results would be untrustworthy .         well then .  move the time forward till the footstep indications stop .  can you make it fast forward  so to speak .         if i do the kind of fast forward you   re speaking of then it will all just blur into a straight line with a slight haze above and below .  what i can do is move it forward in fifteen minute stages and study it quickly before moving on .         good .  do that .      both watched the screen until benastra said     there   s nothing there now .  see .      there was again a fine with nothing but tiny uneven hiccups of noise .      when did the footsteps stop .      two hours ago .  a trifle more .         and when they stopped were there fewer than there were earlier .      benastra looked mildly outraged .     i couldn   t tell .  i don   t think the finest analysis could make a certain decision .      dors pressed her lips together .  then she said     are you testing a transducer is that what you called it near the meteorological outlet .         yes  that   s where the instruments are and that   s where the meteorologists would have been .     then  unbelievingly     do you want the to try others in the vicinity .  one at a time .         no .  stay on this one .  but keep on going forward at fifteen minute intervals .  one person may have been left behind and may have made his way back to the instruments .      benastra shook his head and muttered something under his breath .   the screen shifted again and dors said sharply     what   s that .     she was pointing .      i don   t know .  noise .         no .  its periodic .  could it be a single person   s footsteps .         sure  but it could be a dozen other things too .         it   s coming along at about the time of footsteps  isn   t it .     then  after a while  she said     push it forward a little .      he did and when the screen settled down she said     aren   t those unevennesses getting bigger .         possibly .  we can measure them .         we don   t have to .  you can see they   re getting bigger .  the footsteps are approaching the transducer .  go forward again .  see when they stop .      after a while benastm said     they stopped twenty or twenty five minutes ago .     then cautiously     whatever they are .         they   re footsteps      said dors with mountain moving conviction .     there   s a man up there and while you and i have been fooling around here  he   s collapsed and he   s going to freeze and die .  now don   t say     whatever they are .     just call meteorology and get me jenarr leggen .  life or death  i tell you .  say so .      benastra  lips quivering  had passed the stage where he could possibly resist anything this strange and passionate woman demanded .   it took no more than three minutes to get leggen   s hologram on the message platform .  he had been pulled away from his dinner table .  there was a napkin in his hand and a suspicious greasiness under his lower lip .   his long face was set in a fearful scowl .        life or death .     what is this .  who are you .     then his eye caught dors  who had moved closer to benastra so that her image would be seen on jenarr   s s screen .  he said     you again .  this is simple harassment .      dors said     it is not .  i have consulted rogen benastra  who is chief seismologist at the university .  after you and your party had left upperside  the seismograph shows clear footsteps of one person still there .  it   s my student hari seldon  who went up there in your care and who is now  quite certainly  lying in a collapsed stupor and may not live long .      you will  therefore  take me up there right now with whatever equipment may be necessary .  if you do not do so immediately  i shall proceed to university security to the president himself  if necessary .  one way or another i   ll get up there and if anything has happened to hari because you delay one minute  i will see to it that you are hauled in for negligence  incompetence whatever i can make stick  and will have you lose all status and be thrown out of academic life .  and if he   s dead  of course  that   s manslaughter by negligence .  or worse  since i   ve now warned you he   s dying .      jenarr  furious  turned to benastra .     did you detect       but dors cut in .     he told me what he detected and i   ve told you .  i do not intend to allow you to bulldoze him into confusion .  are you coming .  now .         has it occurred to you that you may be mistaken .  .  .  said jenarr  thinlipped .     do you know what i can do to you if this is a mischievous false alarm .  loss of status works both ways .         murder doesn   t      said dors .     i   m ready to chance a trial for malicious mischief .  are you ready to chance a trial for murder .      jenarr reddened  perhaps more at the necessity of giving in than at the threat .     i   ll come  but i   ll have no merry on you  young woman  if your student eventually turns out to have been safe within the dome these past three hours .           .     the three went up the elevator in an inimical silence .  leggen had eaten only part of his dinner and had left his wife at the dining area without adequate explanation .  benastra had eaten no dinner at all and had possibly disappointed some woman companion  also without adequate explanation .  dors venabili had not eaten either and she seemed the most tense and unhappy of the three .  she carried a thermal blanket and two photonic founts .   when they reached the entrance to upperside  leggen  jaw muscles tightening  entered his identification number and the door opened .  a cold wind rushed at them and benastra grunted .  none of the three was adequately dressed  but the two men had no intention of remaining up there long .   dors said tightly     it   s snowing .      leggen said     it   s wet snow .  the temperature   s just about at the freezing point .  it   s not a killing frost .         it depends on how long one remains in it  doesn   t it .     said dors .     and being soaked in melting snow won   t help .      leggen grunted .     well  where is he .     he stared resentfully out into utter blackness  made even worse by the light from the entrance behind him .   dors said     here  dr .  benastm  hold this blanket for me .  and you  dr .  leggen  close the door behind you without locking it .         there   s no automatic lock on it .  do you think we   re foolish .         perhaps not  but you can lock it from the inside and leave anyone outside unable to get into the dome .         if someone   s outside  point him out .  show him to me      said leggen .      he could be anywhere .     dors lifted her arms with a photonic fount circling each wrist .      we can   t look everywhere      mumbled benastra miserably .   the founts blazed into light  spraying in every direction .  the snowflakes glittered like a vast mob of fireflies  making it even more difficult to see .      the footsteps were getting steadily louder      said dors .     he had to be approaching the transducer .  where would it be located .         i haven   t any idea      snapped leggen .   that   s outside my field and my responsibility .         dr .  benastra .      benastra   s reply was hesitant .     i don   t really know .  to tell you the truth  i   ve never been up here before .  it was installed before my time .  the computer knows  but we never thought to ask it that .   i   m cold and i don   t see what use i am up here .         you   ll have to stay up here for a while      said dom firmly .     follow me .  i   m going to circle the entrance in an outward spiral .         we can   t see much through the snow      said leggen .      i know that .  if it wasn   t snowing  we   d have seen him by now .  i   m sure of it .  as it is  it may take a few minutes .  we can stand that .     she was by no means as confident as her words made it appear .   she began to walk  swinging her arms  playing the light over as large a field as she could  straining her eyes for a dark blotch against the snow .   and  as it happened  it was benastra who first said     what   s that .     and pointed .   dom overlapped the two founts  making a bright cone of light in the indicated direction .  she ran toward it  as did the other two .   they had found him  huddled and wet  about ten meters from the door  five from the nearest meteorological device .  dors felt for his heartbeat  but it was not necessary for  responding to her touch  seldon stirred and whimpered .      give me the blanket  dr .  benastra      said dors in a voice that was faint with relief .  she flapped it open and spread it out in the snow .     lift him onto it carefully and i   ll wrap him .  then we   ll carry him down .      in the elevator  vapors were rising from the wrapped seldon as the blanket warmed to blood temperature .   dom said     once we have him in his room  dr .  leggen  you get a doctor a good one  and see that he comes at once .  if dr .  seldon gets through this without harm  i won   t say anything  but only if he does .  remember          you needn   t lecture me      said leggen coldly .     i regret this and i will do what i can  but my only fault was in allowing this man to come upperside in the first place .      the blanket stirred and a low  weak voice made itself heard .   benastra started  for seldon   s head was cradled in the crook of his elbow .  he said     he   s trying to say something .      dors said     i know .  he said     what   s going on .          she couldn   t help but laugh just a little .  it seemed such a normal thing to say .        .     the doctor was delighted .      i   ve never seen a case of exposure      he explained .     one doesn   t get exposed on trantor .         that may be      said dors coldly     and i   m happy you have the chance to experience this novelty  but does it mean that you do not know how to treat dr .  seldon .      the doctor  an elderly man with a bald head and a small gray mustache  bristled .     of course  i do .  exposure cases on the outer worlds are common enough  an everyday affair  and i   ve read a great deal about them .      treatment consisted in part of an antiviral serum and the use of a microwave wrapping .      this ought to take care of it      the doctor said .     on the outer worlds  they make use of much more elaborate equipment in hospitals  but we don   t have that  of course  on trantor .  this is a treatment for mild cases and i   m sure it will do the job .      dons thought later  as seldon was recovering without particular injury  that it was perhaps because he was an outworlder that he had survived so well .  dark  cold  even snow were not utterly strange to him .  a trantorian probably would have died in a similar case  not so much from physical trauma as from psychic shock .   she was not sure of this  of course  since she herself was not a trantorian either .   and  turning her mind away from these thoughts  she pulled up a chair near to hari   s bed and settled down to wait .        .     on the second morning seldon stirred awake and looked up at dors  who sat at his bedside  viewing a book film and taking notes .   in a voice that was almost normal  seldon said     still here  dors .      she put down the book film .     i can   t leave you alone  tart i .  and i don   t trust anyone else .         it seems to me that every time i wake up  i see you .  have you been here all the time .         sleeping or waking  yes .         but your classes .         i have an assistant who has taken over for a while .      dors leaned over and grasped hari   s hand .  noticing his embarrassment  he was  after all  in bed   she removed it .      hari  what happened .  i was so frightened .      seldon said     i have a confession to make .         what is it  hari .         i thought perhaps you were part of a conspiracy          a conspiracy .     she said vehemently .      i mean  to maneuver me upperside where i   d be outside university jurisdiction and therefore subject to being picked up by imperial forces .         but upperside isn   t outside university jurisdiction .  sector jurisdiction on trantor is from the planetary center to the sky .         ah  i didn   t know that .  but you didn   t come with me because you said you had a busy schedule and  when i was getting paranoid  i thought you were deliberately abandoning me .  please forgive me .  obviously  it was you who got me down from there .  did anyone else care .         they were busy men      said dors carefully .     they thought you had come down earlier .  i mean  it was a legitimate thought .         clowzia thought so too .         the young intern .  yes  she did .         well  it may still have been a conspiracy .  without you  i mean .         no  hari  it is my fault .  i had absolutely no right to let you go  upperside alone .  it was my job to protect you .  i can   t stop blaming myself for what happened  for you getting lost .         now  wait a minute      said seldon  suddenly irritated .     i didn   t get lost .  what do you think i am .         i   d like to know what you call it .  you were nowhere around when the others left and you didn   t get back to the entrance  or to the neighborhood of the entrance anyway till well after dark .         but that   s not what happened .  i didn   t get lost just because i wandered away and couldn   t find my way back .  i told you i was suspecting a conspiracy and i had cause to do so .  i   m not totally paranoid .         well then  what did happen .      seldon told her .  he had no trouble remembering it in full detail  he had lived with it in nightmare for most of the preceding day .   dors listened with a frown .     but that   s impossible .  a jet down .  are you sure .         of course i   m sure .  do you think i was hallucinating .         but the imperial forces could not have been searching for you .  they could not have arrested you upperside without creating the same ferocious rumpus they would have if they had sent in a police force to arrest you on campus .         then how do you explain it .         i   m not sure      said dors     but it   s possible that the consequences of my failure to go upperside with you might have been worse than they were and that hummin will be seriously angry with me .         then let   s not tell him      said seldon .     it ended well .         we must tell him      said dors grimly .     this may not be the end .           .     that evening jenarr leggen came to visit .  it was after dinner and he looked from dors to seldon several times  as though wondering what to say .  neither offered to help him  but both waited patiently .   he had not impressed either of them as being a master of small talk .   finally he said to seldon     i   ve come to see how you are .         perfectly well      said seldon     except that i   m a little sleepy .  dr .  venabili tells me that the treatment will keep me tired for a few days  presumably so i   m sure of getting needed rest .     he smiled .     frankly  i don   t mind .      leggen breathed in deeply  let it out  hesitated  and then  almost as though he was forcing the words out of himself  said     i won   t keep you long .  i perfectly understand you need to test .  i do want to say  though  that i am sorry it all happened .  i should not have assumed  so casually that you had gone down by yourself .  since you were a tyro  i should have felt more responsible for you .  after all  i had agreed to let you come up .  i hope you can find it in your heart to  .   .   .  forgive me .  that   s really all i wish to say .      seldon yawned  purring his hand over his mouth .     pardon me .   since it seems to have turned out well  there need be no hard feelings .  in some ways  it was not your fault .  i should not have wandered away and  besides  what happened was      dors interrupted .     now  hari  please  no conversation .  just relax .  now  i want to talk to dr .  leggen just a bit before he goes .  in the first place  dr .  leggen  i quite understand you are concerned about how repercussions from this affair will affect you .  i told you there would be no follow up if dr .  seldon recovered without ill effects .  that seems to be taking place  so you may relax for now .  i would like to ask you about something else and i hope that this time i will have your free cooperation .         i will try  dr .  venabili      said leggen stiffly .      did anything unusual happen during your stay upperside .         you know it did .  i lost dr .  seldon  something for which i have just apologized .         obviously i   m not referring to that .  did anything else unusual happen .         no  nothing .  nothing at all .      dors looked at seldon and seldon frowned .  it seemed to him that dors was trying to check on his story and get an independent account .  did she think he was imagining the search vessel .  he would have liked to object heatedly  but she had raised a quieting hand at him  as though she was preventing that very eventuality .  he subsided  partly because of this and partly because he really wanted to sleep .  he hoped that leggen would not stay long .      are you certain .     said dors .     were there no intrusions from outside .         no  of course not .  oh          yes  dr .  leggen .         there was a jet down .         did that strike you as peculiar .         no  of course not .         why not .         this sounds very much as though i   m being cross examined  dr .  venabili .  i don   t much like it .         i can appreciate that  dr .  leggen  but these questions have something to do with dr .  seldon   s misadventure .  it may be that this whole affair is more complicated than i had thought .         in what way .     a new edge entered his voice .     do you intend to raise new questions  requiring new apologies .  in that case  i may find it necessary to withdraw .         not  perhaps  before you explain how it is you do not find a hovering jet down a bit peculiar .         because  my dear woman  a number of meteorological stations on trantor possess jet downs for the direct study of clouds and the upper atmosphere .  our own meteorological station does not .         why not .  it would be useful .         of course .  but we   re not competing and we   re not keeping secrets .  we will report on our findings  they will report on theirs .  it makes sense  therefore  to have a scattering of differences and specializations .  it would be foolish to duplicate efforts completely .  the money and manpower we might spend on jet downs can be spent on mesonic refractometers  while others will spend on the first and save on the latter .  after all  there may be a great deal of competitiveness and ill feeling among the sectors  but science is one thing   only thing that holds us together .  you know that  i presume      he added ironically .      i do  but isn   t it rather coincidental that someone should be sending a jet down right to your station on die very day you were going to use the station .         no coincidence at all .  we announced that we were going to make measurements on that day end  consequently  some other station thought  very properly  that they might make simultaneous nephelometric measurements  clouds  you know .  the results  taken together  would make more sense and be more useful than either taken separately .      seldon said suddenly in a rather blurred voice     they were just measuring  then .     he yawned again .      yes    said leggen .     what else could they possibly be doing .      dons blinked her eyes  as she sometimes did when she was trying to think rapidly .     that all makes sense .  to which station did this particular jet down belong .   leggen shook his head .     dr .  venabili  how can you possibly expect me to tell .         i thought that each meteorological jet down might possibly have its station   s markings on it .         surely  but i wasn   t looking up and studying it  you know .  i had my own work to do and i let them do theirs .  when they report  i   ll know whose jet down it was .         what if they don   t report .         then i would suppose their instruments failed .  that happens sometimes .     his right fist was clenched .     is that all  then .         wait a moment .  where do you suppose the jet down might have come from .         it might be any station with jet downs .  on a day   s notice  and they got more than that one of those vessels can reach us handily from anyplace on the planet .         but who most likely .         hard to say  hestelonia  wye  ziggoreth  north damiano .  i   d say one of these four was the most likely  but it might be any of forty others at least .         just one more question  then .  just one .  dr .  leggen  when you announced that your group would be upperside  did you by any chance say that a mathematician  dr .  hari seldon  would be with you  a look of apparently deep and honest surprise crossed leggen   s face  a look that quickly turned contemptuous .     why should i liar names .  of what interest would that be to anyone .         very well      said dors .     the truth of the matter  then  is that dr .  seldon saw the jet down and it disturbed him .  i am not certain why and apparently his memory is a bit fuzzy on the matter .  he more or less ran away from the jet down  got himself lost  didn   t think of trying to return  or didn   t dare to till it was well into twilight  and didn   t quite make it back in the dark .  you can   t be blamed for that  so let   s forget the whole incident on both sides .      agreed      said leggen .     good bye .     he turned on his heel and left .   when he was gone  dors rose  pulled off seldon   s slippers gently  straightened him in his bed  and covered him .  he was sleeping  of course .   then she sat down and thought .  how much of what leggen had said was true and what might possibly exist under the cover of his words .  she did not know .     mycogen    mycogen   .   .   .  a sector of ancient trantor buried in the past of its own legends mycogen made little impact on the planet .  self satisfied and self separated to a degree  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       .     when seldom woke  he found a new face looking at him solemnly .  for a moment he frowned owlishly and then he said     hummin .      hummin smiled very slightly .     you remember me  then .         it was only for a day  nearly two months ago  but i remember .  you were not arrested  then  or in any way     as you see  i am here  quite safe and whole  but   and he glanced at dors  who stood to one side    it was not very easy for me to come here .      seldon said     i   m glad to see you .   do you mind  by the way .     he jerked his thumb in the direction of the bathroom .   hummin said     take your time .  have breakfast .      hummin didn   t join him at breakfast .  neither did dors .  nor did they speak .  hummin scanned a book film with an attitude of easy absorption .  dors inspected her nails critically and then  taking out a microcomputer  began making notes with a stylus .   seldon watched them thoughtfully and did not try to start a conversation .  the silence now might be in response to some  trantorian reserve customary at a sickbed .  to be sure  he now felt perfectly normal  but perhaps they did not realize that .   it was only when he was done with his last morsel and with the final drop of milk  which he was obviously getting used to  for it no longer tasted odd  that hummin spoke .   he said     how are you  seldon .         perfectly well  hummin .  sufficiently well  certainly  for me to be up and about .         i   m glad to hear it      said hummin dryly .     dons venabili was much to blame in allowing this to happen .      seldon frowned .     no .  i insisted on going upperside .         i   m sure  but she should  at all costs  have gone with you .         i told her i didn   t want her to go with me .      dors said     that   s not so  hari .  don   t defend me with gallant lies .      seldon said angrily     but don   t forget that dors also came upperside after me  against strong resistance  and undoubtedly saved my life .  that   s not bending the truth at all .  have you added that to your evaluation  hummin .      dors interrupted again  obviously embarrassed .     please  hari .  chetter hummin is perfectly correct in feeling that i should either have kept you from going upperside or have gone up with you .  as for my subsequent actions  he has praised them .         nevertheless      said hummin     that is past and we can let it go .  let us talk about what happened upperside  seldon .      seldon looked about and said guardedly     is it safe to do so .      hummin smiled slightly .     dons has placed this room in a distortion field .  i can be pretty sure that no imperial agent at the university if there is one has the expense to penetrate it .  you are a suspicious person  seldon .         not by nature      said seldon .     listening to you in the park and afterward you are a persuasive person  hummin .  by the time you were through  i was ready to fear that eto demerzel was lurking in every shadow .         i sometimes think he might be      said hummin gravely .      if he was      said seldon     i wouldn   t know it was he .  what does he look like .         that scarcely matters .  you wouldn   t see him unless he wanted you to and by then it would all be over  i imagine which is what we must prevent .  lets talk about that jet down you saw .      seldon said     as i told you  hummin  you filled me with fears of demerzel .  as soon as i saw the jet down  i assumed he was after me  that i had foolishly stepped outside the protection of streeling university by going upperside  that i had been lured up there for the specific purpose of being picked up without difficulty .      dors said     on the other hand  leggen       seldon said quickly     was he here last night .         yes  don   t you remember .         vaguely .  i was dead tired .  it   s all a blur in my memory .         well  when he was here last night  leggen said that the jetdown was merely a meteorological vessel from another station .  perfectly ordinary .  perfectly harmless .         what .     seldon was taken aback .     i don   t believe that .      hummin said     now the question is  why don   t you believe that .  was there anything about the jet down that made you think it was dangerous .  something specific  that is  and not just a pervasive suspicion placed in your head by me .      seldon thought back  biting his lower lip .  he said     its anions .  it seemed to push its forepart below the cloud deck  as though it were looking for something  then it would appear in another spot just the same way  then in another spot  and so on .  it seemed to be searching upperside methodically  section by section  and homing in on me .      hummin said     perhaps you were personifying  seldon .  you may have been treating the jet down as though it was a strange animal looking for you .  it wasn   t  of course .  it was simply a jetdown and if it war a meteorological vessel  its actions were perfectly normal  .   .   .  and harmless .      seldon said     it didn   t seem that way to me .      hummin said     i   m sure it didn   t  but we don   t actually know anything .  your conviction that you were in danger is simply an assumption .  leggen   s decision that it was a meteorological vessel is also only an assumption .      seldon said stubbornly     i can   t believe that it was an entirely innocent event .         well then      said hummin     suppose we assume the worst  that the vessel toot looking for you .  how would whoever sent that vessel know you would be there to seek .      dors interjected     i asked dr .  leggen if he had  in his report of the forthcoming meteorological work  included the information that hari would be with the group .  there was no reason he should in the ordinary course of events and he denied that he had  with considerable surprise at the question .  i believed him .      hummin said thoughtfully     don   t believe him too readily .  wouldn   t he deny it  in any case .  now ask yourself why he allowed seldon to come along in the first place .  we know he objected initially  but he did relent  without much fight .  and that  to me  seems rather out of character for leggen .      dors frowned and said     i suppose that does make it a bit more likely that he did arrange the entire affair .  perhaps he permitted hari   s company only in order to put him in the position of being taken .  he might have received orders to that effect .  we might further argue that he encouraged his young intern  clowzia  to engage hari   s attention and draw him away from the group  isolating him .  that would account for leggen   s odd lack of concern over hari   s absence when it came time to go below .  he would insist that hari had left earlier  something he would have laid the groundwork for  since he had carefully showed him how to go down by himself .  it would also account for his reluctance to go back up in search of him  since he would not want to waste time looking for someone he assumed would not be found .      hummin  who had listened carefully  said     you make an interesting case against him  but lets not accept that too readily either .  after all  he did come upperside with you in the end .         because footsteps had been detected .  the chief seismologist had home witness to that .         well  did leggen show shock and surprise when seldon was found .  i mean  beyond that of finding someone who had been brought into extreme peril through leggen   s own negligence .  did he act as though seldon wasn   t supposed to be there .  did he behave as though he were asking himself  how is it they didn   t pick him up .      dors thought carefully  then said     he was obviously shocked by the sight of hari lying there  but i couldn   t possibly tell if there was anything to his feelings beyond the very natural horror of the situation .         no  i suppose you couldn   t .      but now seldon  who had been looking from one to the other as they spoke and who had been listening intently  said     i don   t think it was leggen .      hummin transferred his attention to seldon .     why do you say that .         for one thing  as you noted  he was clearly unwilling to have me come along .  it took a whole day of argument and i think he agreed only because he had the impression that i was a clever mathematician who could help him out with meteorological theory .  i was anxious to go up there and  if he had been under orders to see to it that i was taken upperside  there would have been no need to be so reluctant about it .         is it reasonable to suppose he wanted you only for your mathematics .  did he discuss the mathematics with you .  did he make an attempt to explain his theory to you .         no      said seldon     he didn   t .  he did say something about going into it later on  though .  the trouble was  he was totally involved with his instruments .  i gathered he had expected sunshine that hadn   t showed up and he was counting on his instruments having been at fault  but they were apparently working perfectly  which frustrated him .  i think this was an unexpected development that both soured his temper and turned his attention away from me .  as for clowzia  the young woman who preoccupied me for a few minutes  i do not get the feeling  as i look back on it  that she deliberately led me away from the scene .  the initiative was mine .  i was curious about the vegetation on upperside and it was i who drew her away  rather than vice versa .  far from leggen encouraging her action  he called her back while i was still in sight and i moved farther away and out of sight entirely on my own .         and yet      said hummin  who seemed intent on objecting to every suggestion that was made     if that ship was looking for you  those on board must have known you   d be there .  how would they know if not from leggett .         the man i suspect      said seldon     is a young psychologist named listing ranch        randa .     said dors .     i can   t believe that .  i know him .  he simply would not be working for the emperor .  he   s anti imperialist to the core .         he might pretend to be      said seldon .     in fact  he would have to be openly  violently  and extremely anti imperialist if he was trying to mask the fact that he is an imperial agent .         but that   s exactly what he   s not like      said dors .     he is not violent and extreme in anything .  he   s quiet and good natured and his views are always expressed mildly  almost timidly .  i   m convinced they   re genuine .         and yet  dors      said seldon earnestly     it was he who first told me of the meteorological project  it was he who urged me to go upperside  and it was he who persuaded leggen to allow me to join him  rather exaggerating my mathematical prowess in the process .  one must wonder why he was so anxious to get me up there  why he should labor so hard .         for your good  perhaps .  he was interested in you  hari  and must have thought that meteorology might have been useful in psychohistory .  isn   t that possible .      hummin said quietly     lets consider another point .  there was a considerable lapse of time between the moment when randa told you about the meteorology project and the moment you actually went upperside .  if randa is innocent of anything underhanded  he would have no particular reason to keep quiet about it .  if he is a friendly and gregarious person          he is      said dors .       then he might very likely tell a number of friends about it .  in that case  we couldn   t really tell who the informer might be .  in fact  just to make another point  suppose randa is anti imperialist .  that would not necessarily mean he is not an agent .  we would have to ask  whom is he an agent for .  on whose behalf does he work .      seldon was astonished .     who else is there to work for but the empire .  who else but demerzel .      hummin raised his hand .     you are far from understanding the whole complexity of trantorian politics  seldon .     he turned toward dors .     tell me again  which were the four sectors that dr .  leggen named as likely sources for a meteorological vessel .         hestelonia  wye  ziggoreth  and north damiano .         and you did not ask the question in any leading way .  you didn   t ask if a particular sector might be the source .         no  definitely not .  i simply asked if he could speculate as to the source of the jet down .         and you    hummin turned to seldon    may perhaps have seen some marking  some insigne  on the jet down .      seldon wanted to retort heatedly that the vessel could hardly be seen through the clouds  that it emerged only briefly  that he himself was not looking for markings  but only for escape  but he held back .  surely  hummin knew all that .   instead  he said simply     i   m afraid not .      dors said     if the jet down was on a kidnapping mission  might not the insigne have been masked .         that is the rational assumption      said hummin     and it may well have been  but in this galaxy rationality does not always triumph .  however  since seldon seems to have taken no note of any details concerning the vessel  we can only speculate .  what i   m thinking is  wye .         why .     echoed seldon .     i presume they wanted to take me because whoever was on the ship wanted me for my knowledge of psychohistory .         no no .     hummin lifted his right forefinger as if lecturing a young student .     w y e .  it is the name of a sector on trantor .  a very special sector .  it has been ruled by a line of mayors for some three thousand years .  it has been a continuous line  a single dynasty .  there was a time  some five hundred years ago  when two emperors and an empress of the house of wye sat on the imperial throne .  it was a comparatively short period and none of the wye rulers were particularly distinguished or successful  but the mayors of wye have never forgotten this imperial past .      they have not been actively disloyal to the ruling houses that have succeeded them  but neither have they been known to volunteer much on behalf of those houses .  during the occasional periods of civil war  they maintained a kind of neutrality  making moves that seemed best calculated to prolong the civil war and make it seem necessary to turn to wye as a compromise solution .  that never worked out  but they never stopped trying either .      the present mayor of wye is particularly capable .  he is old now  but his ambition hasn   t cooled .  if anything happens to cleon  even a natural death the mayor will have a chance at the succession over cleon   s own too young son .  the galactic public will always be a little more partial toward a claimant with an imperial past .      therefore  if the mayor of wye has heard of you  you might serve as a useful scientific prophet on behalf of his house .  there would be a traditional motive for wye to try to arrange some convenient end for cleon  use you to predict the inevitable succession of wye and the coming of peace and prosperity for a thousand years after .  of course  once the mayor of wye is on the throne and has no further use for you  you might well follow cleon to the grave .      seldon broke the grim silence that followed by saying     but we don   t know that it is this mayor of wye who is after me .         no  we don   t .  or that anyone at all is after you  at the moment .  the jet down might  after all  have been an ordinary meteorological testing vessel as leggen has suggested .  still  as the news concerning psychohistory and its potential spreads  and it surely must   .   . ore and more of the powerful and semipowerful on trantor or  for that matter  elsewhere will want to make use of your services .         what  then      said dors     shall we do .         that is the question  indeed .     hummin ruminated for a while  then said     perhaps it was a mistake to come here .  for a professor  it is all too likely that the hiding place chosen would be a university .  streeling is one of many  but it is among the largest and most free  so it wouldn   t be long before tendrils from here and there would begin feeling their soft  blind way toward this place .  i think that as soon as possible today  perhaps seldon should be moved to another and better hiding place .  but      but .     said seldon .      but i don   t know where .      seldon said     call up a gazetteer on the computer screen and choose a place at random .         certainly not      said hummin .     if we do that  we are as likely to find a place that is less secure than average  as one that is more secure .  no  this must be reasoned out .   somehow .           .     the three remained huddled in seldon   s quarters till past lunch .  during that time  hari and dors spoke occasionally and quietly on indifferent subjects  but hummin maintained an almost complete silence .  he sat uptight  ate little  and his grave countenance  which  seldon thought  made him look older than his years  remained quiet and withdrawn .   seldon imagined him to be reviewing the immense geography of trantor in his mind  searching for a comer that would be ideal .  surely  it couldn   t be easy .   seldon   s own helicon was somewhat larger by a percent or two than trantor was and had a smaller ocean .  the heliconian land surface was perhaps    percent larger than the trantorian .  but helicon was sparsely populated  its surface only sprinkled with scattered cities  trantor was all city .  where helicon was divided into twenty administrative sectors  trantor had over eight hundred and every one of those hundreds was itself a complex of subdivisions .   finally seldon said in some despair     perhaps it might be best  hummin  to chose which candidate for my supposed abilities is most nearly benign  hand me over to that one  and count on him to defend me against the rest .      hummin looked up and said in utmost seriousness     that is not necessary .  i know the candidate who is most nearly benign and he already has you .      seldon smiled .     do you place yourself on the same level with the mayor of wye and the emperor of all the galaxy .         in point of view of position  no .  but as far as the desire to control you is concerned  i rival them .  they  however  and anyone else i can think of want you in order to strengthen their own wealth and power  while i have no ambitions at all  except for the good of the galaxy .         i suspect      said seldon dryly     that each of your competitors if asked would insist that he too was thinking only of the good of the galaxy .         i am sure they would      said hummin     but so far  the only one of my competitors  as you call them  whom you have met is the emperor and he was interested in having you advance fictionalized predictions that might stabilize his dynasty .  i do not ask you for anything like that .  i ask only that you perfect your psychohistorical technique so that mathematically valid predictions  even if only statistical in nature  can be made .         true .  so far  at least      said seldon with a half smile .      therefore  i might as well ask  how are you coming along with that task .  any progress .      seldon was uncertain whether to laugh or cage .  after a pause  he did neither  but managed to speak calmly .     progress .  in less than two months .  hummin  this is something that might easily take me my whole life and the lives of the next dozen who follow me .    and even then end in failure .         i   m not talking about anything as final as a solution or even as hopeful as the beginning of a solution .  you   ve said flatly a number of times that a useful psychohistory is possible but impractical .  all i am asking is whether there now seems any hope that it can be made practical .         frankly  no .      dors said     please excuse me .  i am not a mathematician  so i hope this is not a foolish question .  how can you know something is both possible and impractical .  i   ve heard you say that  in theory  you might personally meet and greet all the people in the empire  but that it is not a practical feat because you couldn   t live long enough to do it .  but how can you tell that psychohistory is something of this sort .      seldon looked at dors with some incredulity .     do you want that explained .         yes      she said  nodding her head vigorously so that her curled hair vibrated .      as a matter of fact      said hummin     so would l        without mathematics .     said seldon with just a trace of a smile .      please      said hummin .      well      he retired into himself to choose a method of presentation .  then he said   if you want to understand some aspect of the universe  it helps if you simplify it as much as possible and include only those properties and characteristics that are essential to understanding .  if you want to determine how an object drops  you don   t concern yourself with whether it is new or old  is red or green  or has an odor or not .  you eliminate those things and thus do trot needlessly complicate matters .  the simplification you can call a model or a simulation and you can present it either as an actual representation on a computer screen or as a mathematical relationship .  if you consider the primitive theory of nonrelativistic gravitation      don said at once     you promised there would be no mathematics .  don   t try to slip it in by calling it    primitive .             no no .  i mean    primitive    only in that it has been known as long as our records go back  that its discovery is shrouded in the mists of antiquity as is that of fire or the wheel .  in any case  the equations for such gravitational theory contain within themselves a description of the motions of a planetary system  of a double star  of tides  and of many other things .  making use of such equations  we can even set up a pictorial simulation and have a planet circling a star or two stars circling each other on a two dimensional screen or set up more complicated systems in a three dimensional holograph .  such simplified simulations make it far easier to grasp a phenomenon than it would be if we had to study the phenomenon itself .  in fact  without the gravitational equations  our knowledge of planetary motions and of celestial mechanics generally would be sparse indeed .      now  as you wish to know more and more about any phenomenon or as a phenomenon becomes more complex  you need more and more elaborate equations  more and more detailed programming  and you end with a computerized simulation that is harder and harder to grasp .         can   t you form a simulation of the simulation .     asked hummin .     you would go down another degree .         in that case  you would have to eliminate some characteristic of the phenomenon which you want to include and your simulation becomes useless .  the lps that is     the least possible simulation    gains in complexity faster than the object being simulated does and eventually the simulation catches up with the phenomenon .  thus  it was established thousands of years ago that the universe as a whole  in its full complexity  cannot be represented by any simulation smaller than itself .      in other words  you can   t get any picture of the universe as a whole except by studying the entire universe .  it has been shown also that if one attempts to substitute simulations of a small pan of the universe  then another small part  then another small part  and so on  intending to put them all together to form a total picture of the universe  one would find that there are an infinite number of such part simulations .  it would therefore take an infinite time to understand the universe in full and that is just another way of saying that it is impossible to gain all the knowledge there is .         i understand you so far      said dors  sounding a little surprised .      well then  we know that some comparatively simple things are easy to simulate and as things grow more and more complex they become harder to simulate until finally they become impossible to simulate .  but at what level of complexity does simulation cease to be possible .  well  what i have shown  making use of a mathematical technique first invented in this past century and barely usable even if one employs a large and very fast computer  our galactic society falls short of that mark .  it can be represented by a simulation simpler than itself .  and i went on to show that this would result in the ability to predict future events in a statistical fashion that is  by stating the probability for alternate sets of events  rather than flatly predicting that one set will take place .         in that case      said hummin     since you can profitably simulate galactic society  it   s only a matter of doing so .  why is it impractical .         all i have proved is that it will not take an infinite time to understand galactic society  but if it takes a billion years it will still be impractical .  that will be essentially the same as infinite time to us .         is that how long it would take .  a billion years .         i haven   t been able to work out how long it would take  but i strongly suspect that it will take at least a billion years  which is why i suggested that number .         but you don   t really know .         i   ve been trying to work it out .         without success .         without success .         the university library does not help .     hummin cast a look at dors as he asked the question .   seldon shook his head slowly .     not at all .         dors can   t help .      dors sighed .     i know nothing about the subject  chetter .  i can only suggest ways of looking .  if hari looks and doesn   t find  i am helpless .      hummin rose to his feet .     in that case  there is no great use in staying here at the university and i must chink of somewhere else to place you .      seldon reached out and touched his sleeve .     still  i have an idea .      hummin stared at him with a faint narrowing of eyes that might have belied surprise  or suspicion .     when did you get the idea .  just now .         no .  it   s been buzzing in my head for a few days before i went upperside .  that little experience eclipsed it for a while  but asking about the library reminded me of it .      hummin seated himself again .     tell me your idea if it   s not something that   s totally marinated in mathematics .         no mathematics at all .  it   s just that reading history in the library reminded me that galactic society was less complicated in the past .  twelve thousand years ago  when the empire was on the way to being established  the galaxy contained only about ten million inhabited worlds .  twenty thousand years ago  the pre imperial kingdoms included only about ten thousand worlds altogether .  still deeper in the past  who knows how society shrinks down .  perhaps even to a single world as in the legends you yourself once mentioned  hummin .      hummin said     and you think you might be able to work out psychohistory if you dealt with a much simpler galactic society .         yes  it seems to me that i might be able to do so .         then too      said dors with sudden enthusiasm     suppose you work out psychohistory for a smaller society of the past and suppose you can make predictions from a study of the pre imperial situation as to what might happen a thousand years after the formation of the empire you could then check the actual situation at that time and see how near the mark you were .      hummin said coldly     considering that you would know in advance the situation of the year        of the galactic era  it would scarcely be a fair test .  you would be unconsciously swayed by your prior knowledge and you would be bound to choose values for your equation in such a way as to give you what you would know to be the solution .         i don   t think so      said dors .     we don   t know the situation in        g . e .  very well and we would have to dig .  after all  that was eleven millennia ago .      seldon   s face turned into a picture of dismay .     what do you mean we don   t know the situation in        g . e .  very well .  there were computers then  weren   t there  dors .         of course .         and memory storage units and recordings of ear and eye .  we should have all the records of        g . e .  as we have of the present year of         g . e .         in theory  yes  but in actual practice  well  you know  hari  it   s what you keep saying .  it   s possible to have full records of        g . e .   but it   s not practical to expect to have it .         yes  but what i keep saying  dors  refers to mathematical demonstrations .  i don   t see the applications to historical records .      dors said defensively     records don   t last forever  hari .  memory banks can be destroyed or defaced as a result of conflict or can simply deteriorate with time .  any memory bit  any record that is not referred to for a long time  eventually drowns in accumulated noise .  they say that fully one third of the records in the imperial library are simply gibberish  but  of course  custom will not allow those records to be removed .  other libraries are less tradition bound .  in the streeling university library  we discard worthless items every ten years .      naturally  records frequently referred to and frequently duplicated on various worlds and in various libraries governmental and private remain clear enough for thousands of years  so that many of the essential points of galactic history remain known even if they took place in pre imperial times .  however  the farther back you go  the less there is preserved .         i can   t believe that      said seldon .     i should think that new copies would be made of any record in danger of withering .  how could you let knowledge disappear .         undesired knowledge is useless knowledge      said dors .     can you imagine all the time  effort  and energy expended in a continual refurbishing of unused data .  and that wastage would grow steadily more extreme with time .         surely  you would have to allow for the fact that someone at some time might need the data being so carelessly disposed of .         a particular item might be wanted once in a thousand years .  to save it all just in case of such a need isn   t cost effective .  even in science .  you spoke of the primitive equations of gravitation and say it is primitive because its discovery is lost in the mists of antiquity .  why should that be .  didn   t you mathematicians and scientists save all data  all information  back and back to the misty primeval time when those equations were discovered .      seldon groaned and made no attempt to answer .  he said     well  hummin  so much for my idea .  as we look back into the past and as society grows smaller  a useful psychohistory becomes more likely .  but knowledge dwindles even more rapidly than size  so psychohistory becomes less likely  and the less outweighs the more .          to be sure  there is the mycogen sector      said dors  musing .   hummin looked up quickly .     so there is and that would be the perfect place to put seldon .  i should have thought of it myself .         mycogen sector      repeated hari  looking from one to the other .     what and where is mycogen sector .         hari  please  i   ll tell you later .  right now  i have preparations to make .  you   ll leave tonight .           .     dors had urged seldon to sleep a bit .  they would be leaving halfway between lights out and lights on  under cover of    night      while the rest of the university slept .  she insisted he could still use a little rest .      and have you sleep on the floor again .     seldon asked .   she shrugged .     the bed will only hold one and if we both try to crowd into it  neither of us will get much sleep .      he looked at her hungrily for a moment and said     then i   ll sleep on the floor this time .         no  you won   t .  i wasn   t the one who lay in a coma in the sleet .      as it happened  neither slept .  though they darkened the room and though the perpetual hum of trantor was only a drowsy sound in the relatively quiet confines of the university  seldon found that he had to talk .   he said     i   ve been so much trouble to you  dors  here at the university .  i   ve even been keeping you from your work .  still  i   m sorry i   ll have to leave you .      dors said     you won   t leave me .  i   m coming with you .  hummin is arranging a leave of absence for me .      seldon said  dismayed     i can   t ask you to do that .         you   re not .  hummin s asking it .  i must guard you .  after all  i faded in connection with upperside and should make up for it .         i told you .  please don   t feel guilty about that .   still  i must admit i would feel more comfortable with you at my side .  if i could only be sure i wasn   t interfering with your life  .   .   .      dors said softly     you   re not  hari .  please go to sleep .      seldon lay silent for a while  then whispered     are you sure hummin can really arrange everything  dors .      dors said     he   s a remarkable man .  he   s got influence here at the university and everywhere else  i think .  if he says he can arrange for an indefinite leave for me  i   m sure he can .  he is a moat persuasive man .      i know      said seldon .     sometimes i wonder what he really wants of me .         fit he says      said dors .     he   s a man of strong and idealistic ideas and dreams .         you sound as though you know him well  dors .         oh yes  i know him well .         intimately .      dors made an odd noise .     i   m not sure what you   re implying  hari  but  assuming the most insolent interpretation no  i don   t know him intimately .  what business would that be of yours any way .         i   m sorry .  .  said seldon .     i just didn   t want  inadvertently  to be invading someone else   s          property .  that   s even more insulting .  i think you had better go to sleep .         i   m sorry again  dors  but i can   t sleep .  let me at least change the subject .  you haven   t explained what the mycogen sector is .  why will it be good for me to go there .  what   s it like .         it   s a small sector with a population of only about two million if i remember correctly .  the thing is that the mycogenians cling rightly to a set of traditions about early history and are supposed to have very ancient records not available to anyone else .  it   s just possible they would be of more use to you in your attempted examination of pre imperial times than orthodox historians might be .  all our talk about early history brought the sector to mind .         have you ever seen their records .         no .  i don   t know anyone who has .         can you be sure that the records really exist  then .         actually  i can   t say .  the assumption among non mycogenians is that they   re a bunch of madcaps  but that may be quite unfair .  they certainly ray they have records  so perhaps they do .  in any case  we would be out of sight there .  the mycogenians keep strictly to themselves .    and now please do go to sleep .      and somehow seldon finally did .        .     hari seldon and dors venabili left the university grounds at      .  seldon realized that dors had to be the leader .  she knew trantor better than he did two years better .  she was obviously a close friend of hummin  how close .  the question kept nagging at him  and she understood his instructions .   both she and seldon were swathed in light swirling docks with tight fitting hoods .  the style had been a short lived clothing fad at the university  and among young intellectuals  generally  some years back and though right now it might provoke laughter  it had the saving grace of covering them well and of making them unrecognizable at least at a cursory glance .   hummin had said     there   s a possibility that the event upperside was completely innocent and that there are no agents after you  seldon  but lets he prepared for the worst .      seldon had asked anxiously     won   t you come with us .         i would like to      said hummin     but i must limit my absence from work if i am not to become a target myself .  you understand .      seldon sighed .  he understood .   they entered an expressway car and found a seat as far as possible from the few who had already boarded .   seldom wondered why anyone should be on the expressways at three in the morning   and then thought that it was lucky some were or he and dors would be entirely too conspicuous .    seldon fell to watching the endless panorama that passed in review as the equally endless line of coaches moved along the endless monorail on an endless electromagnetic field .   the expressway passed row upon row of dwelling units  few of them very tall  but some  for all he knew  very deep .  still  if tens of millions of square kilometers formed an urbanized total  even forty billion people would not require very tall structures or very closely packed ones .  they did pass open areas  in most of which crops seemed to be growing  but some of which were clearly parklike .  and there were numerous structures whose nature he couldn   t guess .  factories .  office buildings .  who knew .  one large featureless cylinder struck him as though it might be a water tank .  after all  trantor had to have a fresh water supply .  did they sluice rain from upperside  filter and treat it  then store it .  it seemed inevitable that they should .   seldon did not have very long to study the view  however .   dors muttered     this is about where we should be getting off .     she stood up and her strong fingers gripped his arm .   they were off the expressway now  standing on solid flooring while dors studied the directional signs .   the signs were unobtrusive and there were many of them .  seldon   s heart sank .  most of them were in pictographs and initials  which were undoubtedly understandable to native trantorians  but which were alien to him  .      this way      said dors .      which way .  how do you know .         see that .  two wings and an arrow .         two wings .  oh .     he had thought of it as an upside down    w      wide and shallow  but he could see where it might be the stylized wings of a bird .      why don   t they use words .     he said sullenly .      because words vary from world to world .  what an    air jet    is here could be a    soar    on cinna or a    swoop    on other worlds .  the two wings and an arrow are a galactic symbol for an sir vessel and the symbol is understood everywhere .   don   t you use them on helicon .         not much .  helicon is a fairly homogeneous world  culturally speaking  and we tend to cling to our private ways firmly because we   re overshadowed by our neighbours .         see .     said dors .     there   s where your psychohistory might come in .  you could show that even with different dialects the use of set symbols  galaxy wide  is a unifying force .         that won   t help .     he was following her through empty dim alley ways and part of his mind wondered what the crime rate might be on trantor and whether this was a high crime area    you can have a billion rules  each covering a single phenomenon  and you can derive no generalizations from that .  that   s what one means when one says that a system might be interpreted only by a model as complex as itself .   dors  are we heading for an air jet .      she stopped and turned to look at him with an amused frown .     if we   re following the symbols for air jets  do you suppose we   re trying to reach a golf course .   are you afraid of air jets in the way so many trantorians are .         no no .  we  y freely on helicon and i make use of air jets frequently .  it   s just that when hummin took me to the university  he avoided commercial air travel because he thought we would leave too clear a trail .         that   s because they knew where you were to begin with  hari  and were after you already .  right now  it may be that they don   t know where you are and we   re using an obscure port and a private airjet .         and who   ll be doing the flying .         a friend of hummin   s  i presume .         can he be trusted  do you suppose .         if he   s a friend of hummin   s  he surely can .         you certainly think highly of hummin      said seldon with a twinge of discontent .      with reason      said dors with no attempt at coyness .     he   s the best .   seldon   s discontent did not dwindle .      there   s the air jet      she said .   it was a small one with oddly shaped wings .  standing beside it was a small man  dressed in the usual glaring trantorian colors .   dors said     we   re psycho .      the pilot said     and i   m history .      they followed him into the air jet and seldon said     whose idea were the passwords .            hummin   s      said dors .   seldon snorted .     somehow i didn   t think hummin would have a sense of humor .  he   s so solemn .      dors smiled .     sunmaster    sunmaster fourteen   .   .   .  a leader of the mycogen sector of ancient trantor  .   .   .  as is true of all the leaders of this ingrown sector  little is known of him .  that he plays any role at all in history is due entirely to his interrelationship with hari seldon in the course of the flight  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       .     there were just two seats behind the compact pilot compartment and when seldon sat down on padding that gave slowly beneath him meshed fabric came forward to encircle his legs  waist  and chest and a hood came down over his forehead and ears .  he felt imprisoned and when he turned to his left with difficulty    and only slightly he could see that dors was similarly enclosed .   the pilot took his own seat and checked the controls .  then he said     i   m endor levanian  at your service .  you   re enmeshed because there will be a considerable acceleration at liftoff .  once we   re in the open and flying  you   ll be released .  you needn   t tell me your names .  it   s none of my business .      he turned in his seat and smiled at them out of a gnomelike face that wrinkled as his lips spread outward .     any psychological difficulties  youngsters .      dors said lightly     i   m an outworlder and i   m used to flying .         that is also true for myself      said seldon with a bit of hauteur .      excellent  youngsters .  of course  this isn   t your ordinary air jet and you may not have done any night flying  but i   ll count on you to bear up .      he was enmeshed too  but seldon could see that his arms were entirely free .   a dull hum sounded inside the jet  growing in intensity and rising in pitch .  without actually becoming unpleasant  it threatened to do so and seldon made a gesture as though to shake his head and get the sound out of his ears  but the attempt to do so merely seemed to stiffen the hold of the head mesh .   the jet then sprang  it was the only verb seldon could find to describe the event  into the sir and he found himself pushed hard against the back and bottom of his seat .   through the windshield in front of the pilot  seldon saw  with a twinge of horror  the flat rise of a wall  and then a round opening appear in that wall .  it was similar to the hole into which the sir taxi had plunged the day he and hummin had left the imperial sector  but though this one was large enough for the body of the jet  it certainly did not leave room for the wings .   seldon   s head turned as far to the right as he could manage and did so just in time to see the wing on his side wither and collapse .   the jet plunged into the opening and was seized by the electromagnetic field and hurtled along a lighted runnel .  the acceleration was constant and there were occasional clicking noises that seldon imagined might be the passing of individual magnets .   and then  in less than ten minutes  the jet was spewed out into the atmosphere  headlong into the sudden pervasive darkness of night .   the jet decelerated as it passed beyond the electromagnetic field and seldon felt himself flung against the mesh and plastered there for a few breathless moments .   then the pressure ceased and the mesh disappeared altogether .      how are you  youngsters .     came the cheerful voice of the pilot .      i   m not sure      said seldon .  he turned to dors .     are you all right .         certainly      she answered .     i think mr .  levanian was putting us through his paces to see if we were really outworlders .  is that so  mr .  levanian .         some people like excitement      said levanian .     do you .         within limits      said dors .   then seldon added approvingly     as any reasonable person would admit .      seldon went on .     it might have seemed less humorous to you  sir  if you had ripped the wings off the jet .         impossible  sir .  i told you this is not your ordinary air jet .  the wings are thoroughly computerized .  they change their length  width  curvature  and overall shape to match the speed of the jet  the speed and direction of the wind  the temperature  and half a dozen other variables .  the wings wouldn   t tear off unless the jet itself was subjected to stresses that would splinter it .      there was a spatter against seldon   s window .  he said     it   s raining .         it often is      said the pilot .   seldon peered out the window .  on helicon or on any other world  there would have been lights visible the illuminated works of man .  only on trantor would it be dark .    well  not entirely .  at one point he saw the flash of a beacon light .  perhaps the higher reaches of upperside had warning lights .   as usual  dors took note of seldon   s uneasiness .  parting his hand  she said     i   m sure the pilot knows what he   s doing  hari .         i   ll try to be sure of it  too  dors  but i wish he   d share some of that knowledge with us      seldon said in a voice loud enough to be overheard .      i don   t mind sharing      said the pilot .     to begin with  we   re heading up and we   ll be above the cloud deck in a few minutes .  then there won   t be any rain and we   ll even see the stars .      he had timed the remark beautifully  for a few stars began to glitter through the feathery cloud remnants and then all the rest sprang into brightness as the pilot flicked off the lights inside the cabin .  only the dim illumination of his own instrument panel remained to compete and outside the window the sky sparkled brightly .   dors said     that   s the first time in over two years that i   ve seen the stars .  aren   t they marvelous .  they   re so bright   and there are so many of them .      the pilot said     trantor is nearer the center of the galaxy than most of the outworlds .      since helicon was in a sparse comer of the galaxy and its star field was dim and unimpressive  seldon found himself speechless .   dors said     how quiet this flight has become .         so it is      said seldon .     what powers the jet  mr .  levanian .         a microfusion motor and a thin stream of hot gas .         i didn   t know we had working microfusion air jets .  they talk about it  but          there are a few small ones like this .  so far they exist only on trantor and are used entirely by high government officials .      seldon said     the fees for such travel must come high .         very high  sir .         how much is mr .  hummin being charged  then .         there   s no charge for this flight .  mr .  hummin is a good friend of the company who owns these jets .      seldon grunted .  then he asked     why aren   t there more of these microfusion air jets .         too expensive for one thing  sir .  those that exist fulfill all the demand .         you could create more demand with larger jets .         maybe so  but the company has never managed to make microfusion engines strong enough for large air jets .      seldon thought of hummin   s complaint that technological innovation had declined to a low level .     decadent      he murmured .      what .   said dors .      nothing      said seldon .      i was just thinking of something hummin once said to me .      he looked out at the stars and said     are we moving westward  mr .  caveman .            yes  we are .  how did you know .         because i thought that we would see the dawn by now if we were heading east to meet it .      but dawn  pursuing the planet  finally caught up with them and sunlight  real  sunlight brightened the cabin walls .  it didn   t last long  however  for the jet curved downward and into the clouds .  blue and gold vanished and were replaced by dingy gray and both seldon and dors emitted disappointed cries at being deprived of even a few more moments of true sunlight .   when they sank beneath the clouds  upperside was immediately below them and its surface at least at this spot was a rolling mixture of wooded grottos and intervening grassland .  it was the sort of thing clowzia had told seldon existed on upperside .   again there was little time for observation  however .  an opening appeared below them  rimmed by lettering that spelled mycogen  they plunged in .        .     they landed at a jetport that seemed deserted to seldon   s wondering eyes .  the pilot  having completed his task  shook hands with both hari and dors and took his jet up into the sir with a rush  plunging it into an opening that appeared for his benefit .   there seemed  then  nothing to do but wait .  there were benches that could seat perhaps a hundred people  but seldon and dors venabib were the only two people around .  the port was rectangular  surrounded by walls in which there must be many tunnels that could open to receive or deliver jets  but there were no jets present after their own had departed and none arrived while they waited .   there were no people arriving or any indications of habitation  the very life hum of trantor was muted .   seldon felt this aloneness to be oppressive .  he turned to dors and said     what is it that we must do here .  have you any idea .      dors shook her head .     hummin told me we would be met by sunmaster fourteen .  i don   t know anything beyond that .         sunmaster fourteen .  what would that be .         a human being  i presume .  from the name i can   t be certain whether it would be a man or a woman .         an odd name .         oddity is in the mind of the receiver .  i am sometimes taken to be a man by those who have never met me .         what fools they must be      said seldon  smiling .      not at all .  judging from my name  they are justified .  i   m told it is a popular masculine name on various worlds .         i   ve never encountered it before .         that   s because you aren   t much of a galactic traveler .  the name    hari       is common enough everywhere  although i once knew a woman named    hare      pronounced like your name but spelled with an    e .     in mycogen  as i recall  particular names are confined to families   and numbered .         but sunmaster seems so unrestrained a name .         what   s a little braggadocio .  back on cinna     dons    is from an old local expression meaning    spring gift .            because you were born in the spring .         no .  i first saw the light of day at the height of cinna   s summer  but the name struck my people as pleasant regardless of its traditional  and largely forgotten meaning .         in that case  perhaps sunmaster        and a deep  severe voice said     that is my name  tribesman .      seldon  startled  looked to his left .  an open ground car had somehow drawn close .  it was boxy and archaic  looking almost like a delivery wagon .  in it  at the controls  was a tall old man who looked vigorous despite his age .  with stately majesty  he got out of the ground car .   he wore a long white gown with voluminous sleeves  pinched in at the wrists .  beneath the gown were soft sandals from which the big toe protruded  while his head  beautifully shaped  was completely hairless .  he regarded the two calmly with his deep blue eyes .   he said     i greet you  tribesman .      seldon said with automatic politeness     greetings  sir .     then  honestly puzzled  he asked     how did you get in .         through the entrance  which closed behind me .  you paid little heed .         i suppose we didn   t .  but then we didn   t know what to expect .  nor do we now .         tribesman chetter hummin informed the brethren that there would be members from two of the tribes arriving .  he asked that you be cared for .         then you know hummin .         we do .  he has been of service to us .  and because he  a worthy tribesman  has been of service to us  so must we be now to him .  there are few who come to mycogen and few who leave .  i am to make you secure  give you houseroom  see that you are undisturbed .  you will be safe here .      dors bent her head .     we are grateful  sunmaster fourteen .      sunmaster turned to look at her with an sir of dispassionate contempt .     i am not unaware of the customs of the tribes      he said .     i know that among them a woman may well speak before being spoken to .  i am therefore not offended .  i would ask her to have a care among others of the brethren who may be of lesser knowledge in the matter .         oh really .     said dors  who was clearly offended  even if sunmaster was not .      in truth      agreed sunmaster .     nor is it needful to use my numerical identifier when i alone of my cohort am with you .     sunmaster    will be sufficient .   now i will ask you to come with me so that we may leave this place which is of too tribal a nature to comfort me .         comfort is for all of us      said seldon  perhaps a little more loudly than was necessary     and we will not budge from this place unless we are assured that we will not be forcibly bent to your liking against our own natures .  it is our custom that a woman may speak whenever she has something to say .  if you have agreed to keep us secure  that security must be psychological as well as physical .      sunmaster gazed at seldon levelly and said     you are bold  young tribesman .  your name .         i am hari seldon of helicon .  my companion is dors venabili of cinna .      sunmaster bowed slightly as seldon pronounced his own name  did not move at the mention of dors   s name .  he said     i have sworn to tribesman hummin that we will keep you safe  so i will do what i can to protect your woman companion in this .  if she wishes to exercise her impudence  i will do my best to see that she is held guiltless .   yet in one respect you must conform .      and he pointed  with infinite scorn  first to seldon   s head and then to dors   s .      what do you mean .     said seldon .      your cephalic hair .         what about it .         it must not be seen .         do you mean we   re to shave our heads like you .  certainly not .         my head is not shaven  tribesman seldon .  i was depilated when i entered puberty  as are all the brethren and their women .         if we   re talking about depilation  then more than ever the answer is no never .         tribesman  we ask neither shaving nor depilation .  we ask only that your hair be covered when you are among us .         how .         i have brought skincaps that will mold themselves to your skulls  together with strips that will hide the superoptical patches the eyebrows .  you will wear them while with us .  and of course  tribesman seldon  you will shave daily  or oftener if that becomes necessary .         but why must we do this .         because to us  hair on the head is repulsive and obscene .         surely  you and all your people know that it is customary for others  in all the worlds of the galaxy  to retain their cephalic hair .         we know .  and those among us  like myself  who must deal with tribesmen now and then  must witness this hair .  we manage  but it is unfair to ask the brethren generally to suffer the sight .      seldon said     very well  then  sunmaster  but tell me .  since you are born with cephalic hair  as all of us are and as you all retain it visibly till puberty  why is it so necessary to remove it .  is it just a matter of custom or is there some rationale behind it .      and the old mycogenian said proudly     by depilation  we demonstrate to the youngster that he or she has become an adult and through depilation adults will always remember who they are and never forget that all others are but tribesmen .      he waited for no response  and  in truth  seldon could think of none  but brought out from some hidden compartment in his robe a handful of thin bits of plastic of varying color  stared keenly at the two faces before him  holding first one strip  then another  against each face .      the colors must thatch reasonably      he said .     no one will be fooled into thinking you are not wearing a skincap  but it must not be repulsively obvious .      finally  sunmaster gave a particular strip to seldon and showed him how it could be pulled out into a cap .      please put it on  tribesman seldom    he said .     you will find the process clumsy at first  but you will grow accustomed to it .      seldon put it on  but the first two times it slipped off when he tried to pull it backward over his hair .      begin just above your eyebrows      said sunmaster .  his fingers seemed to twitch  as though eager to help .   seldon said  suppressing a smile     would you do it for me .      and sunmaster drew back  saying  almost in agitation     i couldn   t .  i would be touching your hair .      seldon managed to hook it on and followed sunmaster s advice  in pulling it here and there until all his hair was covered .  the eyebrow patches fitted on easily .  dors  who had watched carefully  put hers on without trouble .      how does it come off .     asked seldon .      you have but to find an end and it will peel off without trouble .  you will find it easier both to put on and take off if you cut your hair shorter .         i   d rather struggle a bit      said seldon .  then  turning to dors  he said in a low voice     you   re still pretty  dors  but it does tend to remove some of the character from your face .         the character is there underneath just the same      she answered .     and i dare say you   ll grow accustomed to the hairless me .      in a still lower whisper  seldon said     i don   t want to stay here long enough to get accustomed to this .      sunmaster  who ignored  with visible haughtiness  the mumblings among mere tribesmen  said     if you will enter my ground car  i will now take you into mycogen .           .        frankly      whispered dors     i can scarcely believe i   m on trantor .         i take it  then  you   ve never seen anything like this before .     said seldon .      i   ve only been on trantor for two years and i   ve spent much of my time at the university  so i   m not exactly a world traveler .  still  i   ve been here and there and i   ve heard of this and that  but i   ve never seen or heard of anything like this .  the sameness .       sunmaster drove along methodically and without undue haste .  there were other wagonlike vehicles in the roadway  all with hairless men at the controls  their bald pates gleaming in the light .   on either side there were three story structures  unornamented  all lines meeting at right angles  everything gray in color .      dreary      mouthed dors .     so dreary .         egalitarian      whispered seldon .     i suspect no brother can lay claim to precedence of any obvious kind over any other .      there were many pedestrians on the walkways as they passed .  there were no signs of any moving corridors and no sound of any nearby expressway .   don said     i   m guessing the grays are women .         its hard to tell      said seldon .     the gowns hide everything and one hairless head is like another .         the grays are always in pairs or with a white .  the whines tart walk alone and sunmaster is a white .         you may be right .     seldon raised his voice .     sunmaster  i am curious        if you are  then ask what you wish  although i am by no means required to answer .         we seem to be passing through a residential area .  there are no signs of business establishments  industrial areas          we are a farming community entirely .  where are you from that you do not know this .         you know i am an outworlder      seldon said stiffly .     i have been on trantor for only two months .         even so .         but if you are a farming community  sunmaster  how is it that we have passed no farms either .         on lower levels      said sunmaster briefly .      is mycogen on this level entirely residential  then .         and on a few others .  we are what you see .  every brother and his family lives in equivalent quarters  every cohort in its own equivalent community  all have the same ground can and all brothers drive their own .  there are no servants and none are at ease through the labor of others .  none may glory over another .      seldon lifted his shielded eyebrows at dors and said     but some of the people wear white  while some wear gray .         that is because some of the people are brothers and some are sisters .         and we .         you are a tribesman and a guest .  you and your    he paused and then said     companion will not be bound by all aspects of mycogenian life .  nevertheless  you will wear a white gown and your companion will wear a gray one and you will live in special guest quarters like our own .         equality for all seems a pleasant ideal  but what happens as your numbers increase .  is the pie  then  cut into smaller pieces .         there is no increase in numbers .  that would necessitate an increase in area  which the surrounding tribesmen would not allow  or a change for the worse in our way of life .         but if  .  .  began seldon .   sunmaster cut him off .     it is enough  tribesman seldon .  as i warned you  i am not compelled to answer .  our task  which we have promised our friend tribesman hummin  is to keep you secure as long as you do not violate our way of life .  that we will do  but there it ends .  curiosity is permitted  but it wears out our patience quickly if persisted in .      something about his tone allowed no more to be said and seldon chafed .  hummin  for all his help  had clearly mis stressed the matter .   it was not security that seldon sought .  at least  not security alone .  he needed information too and without that he could not and would not stay here .        .     seldon looked with some distress at their quarters .  it had a small but individual kitchen and a small but individual bathroom .  there were two narrow beds  two clothes closets  a table  and two chairs .  in short there was everything that was necessary for two people who were willing to live under cramped conditions .      we had an individual kitchen and bathroom at cinna      said dors with an air of resignation .      not i      said seldon .     helicon may be a small world  but i lived in a modem city .  community kitchens and bathrooms .   what a waste this is .  you might expect it in a hotel  where one is compelled to make a temporary stay  but if the whole sector is like this  imagine the enormous number and duplications of kitchens and bathrooms .         part of the egalitarianism  i suppose      said dors .     no fighting for favored stalls or for faster service .  the same for everyone .         no privacy either .  not that i mind terribly  dors  but you might and i don   t want to give the appearance of taking advantage .  we ought to make it clear to them that we must have separate rooms  adjoining but separate .      dors said     i   m sure it won   t work .  space is at a premium and i think they are amazed by their own generosity in giving us this much .  we   ll just make do  hari .  we   re each old enough to manage .  i   m not a blushing maiden and you   ll never convince me that you   re a callow youth .         you wouldn   t be here  were it not for me .         what of it .  it   s an adventure .         all right  then .  which bed will you take .  why don   t you take the one nearer the bathroom .     he sat down on the other .     there   s something else that bothers me .  as long as we   re here  we   re tribespeople  you and i  as is even hummin .  we   re of the other tribes  not their own cohorts  and most things are none of our business .    but most things are my business .  that   s what i   ve come here for .  i want to know some of the things they know .         or think they know      said dors with a historian   s skepticism .     i understand they have legends that are supposed to date back to primordial times  but i can   t believe they can be taken seriously .         we can   t know that until we find out what those legends are .  are there no outside records of them .         not that i know of .  these people are terribly ingrown .  they   re almost psychotic in their inward clinging .  that hummin can break down their barriers somewhat and even get them to take us in is remarkable really remarkable .      seldon brooded .     there has to be an opening somewhere .  sunmaster was surprised  angry  in fact that i didn   t know mycogen was an agricultural community .  that seems to be something they don   t want kept a secret .         the point is  it isn   t a secret .     mycogen    is supposed to be from archaic words meaning    yeast producer .     at least  that   s what i   ve been told .  i   m not a paleolinguist .  in any case  they culture all varieties of microfood yeast  of course  along with algae  bacteria  multicellular fungi  and so on .         thai s not uncommon      said seldon .     most worlds have this microculture .  we have some even on helicon .         not like mycogen .  it   s their specialty .  they use methods as archaic as the name of their section secret fertilizing formulas  secret environmental influences .  who knows what .  all is secret .         ingrown        with a vengeance .  what it amounts to is that they produce protein and subtle flavoring  so that their microfood isn   t like any other in the world .  they keep the volume comparatively low and the price is skyhigh .  i   ve never tasted any and i   m sure you haven   t  but it sells in great quantities to the imperial bureaucracy and to the upper classes on other worlds .  mycogen depends on such sales for its economic health  so they want everyone to know that they are the source of this valuable food .  that  at least  is no secret .     .      mycogen must be rich  then .         they   re not poor  but i suspect that it   s not wealth they   re after .  it   s protection .  the imperial government protects them because  without them  there wouldn   t be these microfoods that add the subtlest flavors  the tangiest spices  to every dish .  that means that  mycogen can maintain its odd way of life and be haughty toward its neighbours  who probably find them insupportable .      dors looked about .     they live an austere life .  there   s no holovision  i notice  and no book films .         i noticed one in the closet up on the shelf .     seldon reached for it  stared at the label  and then said in clear disgust     a cookbook .      dors held out her hand for it and manipulated the keys .  it took a while  for the arrangement was not quite orthodox  but she finally managed to light the screen and inspect the pages .  she said     there are a few recipes  but for the most part this seems to consist of philosophical essays on gastronomy .      she shut it off and turned it round and about .     it seems to be a single unit .  i don   t see how one would eject the microcard and insert another .  a one book scanner .  now that   s a waste .         maybe they think this one book film is all anyone needs .     he reached toward the end table that was between the two beds and picked up another object .     this could be a speaker  except that there   s no screen .         perhaps they consider the voice sufficient .         how does it work  i wonder .     seldon lifted it and looked at it from different sides .     did you ever see anything like this .         in a museum once if this is the same thing .  mycogen seems to keep itself deliberately archaic .  i suppose they consider that another way of separating themselves from the so called tribesmen that surround them in overwhelming numbers .  their archaism and odd customs make them indigestible  so to speak .  there   s a kind of perverse logic to all that .      seldon  still playing with the device  said     whoops .  it went on .  or something went on .  but i don   t hear anything .      dors frowned and picked up a small felt lined cylinder that remained behind on the end table .  she put it to her ear .     there   s a voice coming out of this      she said .     here  try it .     she handed it to him .   seldon did so and said     ouch .  it clips on .     he listened and said     yes  it hurt my ear .  you can hear me  i take it .   yes  this is our room .  no  i don   t know its number .  dors  have you any idea of the number .      dors said     there   s a number on the speaker .  maybe that will do .         maybe      said seldon doubtfully .  then he said into the speaker     the number on this device is  lt     a .  will that do .   well  where do i find out how to use this device properly and how to use the kitchen  for that matter .   what do you mean     it all works the usual way .     that doesn   t do me any good .  wee here  i   m a  .   .   .  a tribesman  an honored guest .  i don   t know the usual way .   yes  i   m sorry about my accent and i   m glad you can recognize a tribesman when you hear one .   my name is hari seldon .      there was a pause and seldon looked up at dors with a longsuffering expression on his face .     he has to look me up .  and i suppose he   ll tell me he can   t find me .   oh  you have me .  good .  in that case  can you give me the information .   yes .   yes .   yes .    and how can i call someone outside mycogen .   oh  then what about contacting sunmaster fourteen  for instance .   well  his assistant then  his aide  whatever .   uh huh .   thank you .      he put the speaker down  unhooked the hearing device from his ear with a little difficulty  turned the whole thing off  and said     they   ll arrange to have someone show us anything we need to know  but he can   t promise when that might be .  you can   t call outside mycogen not on this thing anyway  so we couldn   t get hummin if we needed him .  and if i want sunmaster fourteen  i   ve got to go through a tremendous rigmarole .  this may be an egalitarian society  but there seem to be exceptions that i bet no one will openly admit .      he looked at his watch .     in any case  dors  i   m not going to view a cookbook and still less am i going to view learned essays .  my watch is still telling university time  so i don   t know if it   s officially bedtime and at the moment i don   t care .  we   ve been awake most of the night and i would like to sleep .         that   s all right with me .  i   m tired too .         thanks .  and whenever a new day starts after we   ve caught up on our sleep  i   m going to ask for a tour of their microfood plantations .      dors looked startled .     are you interested .         not really  but if that   s the one thing they   re proud of  they should be willing to talk about it and once i get them into a talking mood then  by exerting all my charm  i may get them to talk about their legends too .  personally  i think that   s a clever strategy .         i hope so      said dors dubiously     but i think that the mycogenians will not be so easily trapped .         we   ll see      said seldon grimly .     i mean to get those legends .           .     the next morning found hari using the calling device again .  he was angry because  for one thing  he was hungry .   his attempt to reach sunmaster fourteen was deflected by someone who insisted that sunmaster could not be disturbed .      why not .     seldon had asked waspishly .      obviously  there is no need to answer that question      came back a cold voice .      we were not brought here to be prisoners      said seldon with equal coldness .     nor to starve .         i   m sure you have a kitchen and ample supplies of food .         yes  we do      said seldon .     and i do not know how to use the kitchen devices  nor do i know how to prepare the food .  do you eat it raw  fry it  boil it  roast it .         i can   t believe you are ignorant in such matters .      dors  who had been pacing up and down during this colloquy  reached for the device and seldon fended her off  whispering     he   ll break the connection if a woman tries to speak to him .      then  into the device  he said more firmly than ever     what you believe or don   t believe doesn   t matter to me in the least .  you send someone here someone who can do something about our situation  or when i reach sunmaster fourteen  as i will eventually  you will pay for this .      nevertheless  it was two hours before someone arrived  by which time seldon was in a state of savagery and dors had grown rather desperate in her attempt to soothe him  .   the newcomer was a young man whose bald pate was slightly freckled and who probably would have been a redhead otherwise .   he was bearing several pots and he seethed about to explain them when he suddenly looked uneasy and turned his back on seldon in alarm .     tribesman      he said  obviously agitated .     your skincap is not well adjusted .      seldon  whose impatience had reached the breaking point  said     that doesn   t bother me .      dors  however  said     let me adjust it  hari .  it   s just a bit too high here on the left side .      seldon then growled     you can turn now  young man .  what is your name .         i am graycloud five      said the mycogenian uncertainly as he turned and looked cautiously at seldon .     i am a novitiate .  i have brought a meal for you .     he hesitated .     from my own kitchen  where my woman prepared it  tribesman .      he put the pots down on the table and seldon raised one lid and sniffed the contents suspiciously .  he looked up at dors in surprise .     you know  it doesn   t smell bad .      dors nodded .     you   re right .  i can smell it too .      graycloud said     it   s not as hot as it ought to be .  it cooled off in transport .  you must have crockery and cutlery in your kitchen .      dors got what was needed  and after they had eaten  largely and a bit greedily  seldon felt civilized once more .   dors  who realized that the young man would feel unhappy at being alone with a woman and even unhappier if she spoke to him  found that  by default  it fell to her to carry the pots and dishes into the kitchen and wash them once she deciphered the controls of the washing device .   meanwhile  seldon asked the local time and said  somewhat abashed     you mean it   s the middle of the night .         indeed  tribesman      said graycloud .     that   s why it took a while to satisfy your need .      seldon understood suddenly why sunmaster could not be disturbed and thought of graycloud   s woman having to be awakened to prepare him a meal and felt his conscience gnaw at him .     i   m sorry      he said .     we are only tribespeople and we didn   t know how to use the kitchen or how to prepare the food .  in the morning  could you have someone arrive to instruct us properly .         the best i can do  tribesmen      said graycloud placatingly     is to have two sisters sent in .  i ask your pardon for inconveniencing you with feminine presence  but it is they who know these things .      dors  who had emerged from the kitchen  said  before remembering her place in the masculine mycogenian society      that   s fine  graycloud .  we   d love to meet the sisters .      graycloud looked at her uneasily and fleetingly  but said nothing .   seldon  convinced that the young mycogenian would  on principle  refuse to have heard what a woman said to him  repeated the remark .     that   s fine  graycloud .  we   d love to meet the sisters .      his expression cleared at once .     i will have them here as soon as it is day .      when graycloud had left  seldon said with some satisfaction     the sisters are likely to be exactly what we need .         indeed .  and in what way  hari .     asked dors .      well  surely if we treat them as though they are human beings  they will be grateful enough to speak of their legends .         if they know them      said dors skeptically .     somehow i have no faith that the mycogenians bother to educate their women very well .           .     the sisters arrived some six hours later after seldon and dors had slept some more  hoping to readjust their biological clocks .   the sisters entered the apartment shyly  almost on tiptoe .  their gowns  which  it turned out  were termed    kirtles    in the mycogenian dialect  were soft velvety gray  each uniquely decorated by a subtle pattern of fine  darker gray webbing .  the kirtles were not entirely unattractive  but they were certainly most efficient at covering up any human feature .   and  of course  their heads were bald and their faces were devoid of any ornamentation .  they darted speculative glances at the touch of blue at the comers of dors   s eyes and at the slight red stain at the comers of her lips .   for a few moments  seldon wondered how one could be certain that the sisters were truly sisters .   the answer came at once with the sisters    politely formal greetings .  both twittered and chirped .  seldon  remembering the grave tones of sunmaster and the nervous baritone of graycloud  suspected that women  in default of obvious sexual identification  were forced to cultivate distinctive voices and social mannerisms .    i   m raindrop forty three      twittered one     and this is my younger sister .         raindrop forty five      chirped the other .     we   re very strong on    raindrops    in our cohort .     she giggled .      i am pleased to meet you both      said dors gravely     but now i must know how to address you .  i can   t just say    raindrop      can i .         no      said raindrop forty three .     you must use the full name if we are both here .      seldon said     how about just forty three and forty five  ladies .      they both stole a quick glance at him  but said not a word .   dors said softly     i   ll deal with them  hari .      seldon stepped back .  presumably  they were single young women and  very likely  they were not supposed to speak to men .  the older one seemed the graver of the two and was perhaps the more puritanical .  it was hard to tell from a few words and a quick glance  but he had the feeling and was willing to go by that .   dors said     the thing is  sisters  that we tribespeople don   t know how to use the kitchen .         you mean you can   t cook .     raindrop forty three looked shocked and censorious .  raindrop forty five smothered a laugh .   seldon decided that his initial estimate of the two was correct .    dors said     i once had a kitchen of my own  but it wasn   t like this one and i don   t know what the foods are or how to prepare them .         it   s really quite simple      said raindrop forty five .     we can show you .         we   ll make you a good nourishing lunch      said raindrop forty three .     we   ll make it for  .   .   .  both of you .     she hesitated before adding the final words .  it clearly took an effort to acknowledge the existence of a man .      if you don   t mind      said dors     i would eke to be in the kitchen with you and i would appreciate it if you   d explain everything exactly .  after all  sisters  i can   t expect you to come here three times a day to cook for us .         we will show you everything      said raindrop forty three  nodding her head stiffly .     it may be difficult for a tribeswoman to learn  however .  you wouldn   t have the  .   .   .  feeling for it .         i shall try      said dors with a pleasant smile .   they disappeared into the kitchen .  seldon stared after them and tried to work out the strategy he intended to use .     microfarm    mycogen   .   .   .  the microfarms of mycogen are legendary  though they survive today only in such oftused similes as    rich as the microfarms of mycogen    or    tasty as mycogenian yeast .     such encomiums tend to intensify with time  to be sure  but hari seldon visited those microfarms in the course of the flight and there are references in his memoirs that would tend to support the popular opinion  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       .        that was good .     said seldon explosively .     it was considerably better than the food graycloud brought       dors said reasonably     you have to remember that graycloud   s woman had to prepare it on short notice in the middle of the night .     she paused and said     i wish they would say  wife .     they make    woman    sound like such an appanage  like    my house    or my robe .     it is absolutely demeaning .         i know .  it   s infuriating .  but they might well make    wife    sound like an appanage as well .  it   s the way they live and the sisters don   t seem to mind .  you and i aren   t going to change it by lecturing .  anyway  did you see how the sisters did it .         yes  i did and they made everything seem very simple .  i doubted i could remember everything they did  but they insisted i wouldn   t have to .  i could get away with mere heating .  i gathered the bread had some sort of microderivative added to it in the baking that both raised the dough and lent it that crunchy consistency and warm flavor .  just a hint of pepper  didn   t you think .         i couldn   t tell  but whatever it was  i didn   t get enough .  and the soup .  did you recognize any of the vegetables .         no .         and what was the sliced meat .  could you tell .         i don   t think it was sliced meat  actually .  we did have a lamb dish back on cinna that it reminded me of .         it was certainly not lamb .         i said that i doubted it was meat at all .   i don   t think anyone outside mycogen eats like this either .  not even the emperor  i   m sure .  whatever the mycogenians sell is  i   m willing to bet  near the bottom of the line .  they save the best for themselves .  we had better not stay here too long  hari .  if we get used to eating like this  we   ll never be able to acclimatize ourselves to the miserable stuff they have outside .     she laughed .   seldon laughed too .  he took another sip at the fruit juice  which tasted far more tantalizing than any fruit juice he had ever sipped before  and said     listen  when hummin took me to the university  we stopped at a roadside diner and had some food that was heavily yeasted .  it tasted like no  never mind what it tasted like  but i wouldn   t have thought it conceivable  then  that microfood could caste like this .  i wish the sisters were still here .  it would have been polite to thank them .         i think they were quite aware of how we would feel .  i remarked on the wonderful smell while everything was warming and they said  quire complacently  that it would taste even better .         the older one said that  i imagine .         yes .  the younger one giggled .    and they   ll be back .  they   re going to bring me a kirtle  so that i can go out to see the shops with them .  and they made it clear i would have to wash my face if i was to be seen in public .  they will show me where to buy some good quality kirtles of my own and where i can buy ready made meals of all kinds .  all i   ll have to do is heat them up .  they explained that decent sisters wouldn   t do that  but would start from scratch .  in fact  some of the meal they prepared for us was simply heated and they apologized for that .  they managed to imply  though  that tribespeople couldn   t be expected to appreciate true artistry in cooking  so that simply heating prepared food would do for us .   they seem to take it for granted  by the way  that i will be doing all the shopping and cooking .         as we say at home     when in trantor  do as the trantorians do .             yes  i was sure that would be your attitude in this case .         i   m only human      said seldon .      the usual excuse      said dors with a small smile .   seldon leaned back with a satisfactory well filled feeling and said     you   ve been on trantor for two years  dors  so you might understand a few things that i don   t .  is it your opinion that this odd social system the mycogenians have is part of a supernaturalistic view they have .         supernaturalistic .         yes .  would you have heard that this was so .         what do you mean by    supernaturalistic    .         the obvious .  a belief in entities that are independent of natural law  that are not bound by the conservation of energy  for instance  or by the existence of a constant of action .         i see .  you   re asking if mycogen is a religious community .      it was seldon   s turn .     religious .         yes .  it   s an archaic term  but we historians use it our study is riddled with archaic terms .     religious    is not precisely equivalent to    supernaturalistic      though it contains richly supernaturalistic elements .  i can   t answer your specific question  however  because i   ve never made any special investigation of mycogen .  still  from what little i   ve seen of the place and from my knowledge of religions in history  i wouldn   t be surprised if the mycogenian society was religious in character .         in that case  would it surprise you if mycogenian legends were also religious in character .         no  it wouldn   t .         and therefore not based on historical matter .         that wouldn   t necessarily follow .  the core of the legends might still be authentically historic  allowing for distortion and supernaturalistic intermixture .         ah      said seldon and seemed to retire into his thoughts .   finally dors broke the silence that followed and said     it   s not so uncommon  you know .  there is a considerable religious element on many worlds .  it   s grown stronger in the last few centuries as the empire has grown more turbulent .  on my world of cinna  at least a quarter of the population is tritheistic .      seldon was again painfully and regretfully conscious of his ignorance of history .  he said     were there times in past history when religion was more prominent than it is today .         certainly .  in addition  there are new varieties springing up constantly .  the mycogenian religion  whatever it might be  could be relatively new and may be restricted to mycogen itself .  i couldn   t really tell without considerable study .         but now we get to the point of it  dors .  is it your opinion that women are more apt to be religious than men are .      dors venabili raised her eyebrows .     i   m not sure if we can assume anything as simple as that .     she thought a bit .     i suspect that those elements of a population that have a smaller stake in the material natural world are more apt to find solace in what you call supernaturalism the poor  the disinherited  the downtrodden .  insofar as supernaturalism overlaps religion  they may also be more religious .  there are obviously many exceptions in both directions .  many of the downtrodden may lack religion  many of the rich  powerful  and satisfied may possess it .         but in mycogen      said seldon     where the women seem to be treated as subhuman would i be right in assuming they would be more religious than the men  more involved in the legends that the society has been preserving .      i wouldn   t risk my life on it  hari  but i   d be willing to risk a week   s income on it .         good      said seldon thoughtfully .   dors smiled at him .     there   s a bit of your psychohistory  hari .  rule number          the downtrodden are more religious than the satisfied .      seldon shook his head .     don   t joke about psychohistory  dors .  you know i   m not looking for tiny rules but for vast generalizations and for means of manipulation .  i don   t want comparative religiosity as the result of a hundred specific rules .  i want something from which i can  after manipulation through some system of mathematicized logic  say     aha  this group of people will tend to be more religious than that group  provided that the following criteria are met  and that  therefore  when humanity meets with these stimuli  it will react with these responses .         how horrible      said dors .     you are picturing human beings as simple mechanical devices .  press this button and you will get that twitch .         no  because there will be many buttons pushing simultaneously to varying degrees and eliciting so many responses of different sorts that overall the predictions of the furore will be statistical in nature  so that the individual human being will remain a free agent .         how can you know this .         i can   t      said seldon .     at least  i don   t know it .  i feel it to be so .  it is what i consider to be the way things ought to be .  if i can find the axioms  the fundamental laws of humanics  so to speak  and the necessary mathematical treatment  then i will have my psychohistory .  i have proved that  in theory  this is possible          but impractical  right .         i keep saying so .      a small smile curved dors   s lips     is that what you are doing  hari  looking for some sort of solution to this problem .         i don   t know .  i swear to you i don   t know .  but chetter hummin is so anxious to find a solution and  for some reason  i am anxious to please him .  he is so persuasive a man .         yes  i know .      seldon let that comment pass  although a small frown flitted across his face .   seldon continued .     hummin insists the empire is decaying  that it will collapse  that psychohistory is the only hope for saving it  or cushioning it or ameliorating it  and that without it humanity will be destroyed or  at the very least  go through prolonged misery .  he seems to place the responsibility for preventing that on me .  now  the empire will certainly last my time  but if i   m to live at ease  i must lift that responsibility from my shoulders .  i must convince myself  and even convince hummin that psychohistory is not a practical way our that  despite theory  it cannot be developed .  so i must follow up as many leads as i can and show that each one must fail .         leads .  like going back in history to a time when human society was smaller than it is now .         much smaller .  and far less complex .         and showing that a solution is still impractical .         yes .         but who is going to describe the early world for you .  if the mycogenians have some coherent picture of the primordial galaxy  sunmaster certainly won   t reveal it to a tribesman .  no mycogenian will .  this is an ingrown society how many times have we already said it .   and its members are suspicious of tribesmen to the point of paranoia .  they   ll tell us nothing .         i will have to think of a way to persuade some mycogenians to talk .  those sisters  for instance .         they won   t even bear you  male that you are  any more than sunmaster hears me .  and even if they do talk to you  what would they know but a few catch phrases .         i must start somewhere .      dors said     well  let me think .  hummin says i must protect you and i interpret that as meaning i must help you when i can .  what do i know about religion .  that   s nowhere near my specialty  you know .  i have always dealt with economic forces  rather than philosophic forces  but you can   t split history into neat little nonoverlapping divisions .  for instance  religions tend to accumulate wealth when successful and that eventually tends to distort the economic development of a society .  there  incidentally  is one of the numerous rules of human history that you   ll have to derive from your basic laws of humanics or whatever you called them .  but  .   .   .   and here  dors   s voice faded away as she lapsed into thought .  seldon watched her cautiously and dors   s eyes glazed as though she was looking deep within herself .   finally she said     this is not an invariable rule  but it seems to me that on many occasions  a religion has a book  or books of significance  books that give their ritual  their view of history  their sacred poetry  and who knows what else .  usually  those books are open to all and are a means of proselytization .  sometimes they are secret .         do you think mycogen has books of that sort .         to be truthful      said dors thoughtfully     i have never heard of any .  i might have if they existed openly which means they either don   t exist or are kept secret .  in either case  it seems to me you are not going to see them .         at least it   s a starting point      said seldon grimly .        .     the sisters returned about two hours after hari and dors had finished lunch .  they were smiling  both of them  and raindrop fortythree  the graver one  held up a gray kirtle for dors   s inspection .      it is very attractive      said dors  smiling widely and nodding her head with a certain sincerity .     i like the clever embroidery here .         it is nothing      twittered raindrop forty five .     it is one of my old things and it won   t fit very well  for you are taller than i am .  but it will do for a while and we will take you out to the very best kirtlery to get a few that will fit you and your tastes perfectly .  you will see .      raindrop forty three  smiling a little nervously but saying nothing and keeping her eyes fixed on the ground  handed a white kirtle to dors .  it was folded neatly .  dors did not attempt to unfold it  but passed it on to seldon .     from the color i should say it   s yours  hari .         presumably      said seldon     but give it back .  she did not give it to me .         oh  hari      mouthed dors  shaking her head slightly .      no      said seldon firmly .     she did not give it to me .  give it back to her and i   ll wait for her to give it to me .      dors hesitated  then made a halfhearted attempt to pass the kirtle back to raindrop forty three .   the sister put her hands behind her back and moved away  all life seeming to drain from her face .  raindrop forty five stole a glance at seldon  a very quick one  then took a quick step toward raindrop fortythree and put her arms about her .   dors said     come  hari  i   m sure that sisters are not permitted to talk to men who are not related to them .  what   s the use of making her miserable .  she can   t help it .         i don   t believe it      said seldon harshly .     if there is such a rule  is applies only to brothers .  i doubt very much that she   s ever met a tribesman before .      dors said to raindrop forty three in a soft voice     have you ever met a tribesman before  sister  or a tribeswoman .      a long hesitation and then a slow negative shake of the head .   seldon threw out his arms .     well  there you are .  if there is a rule of silence  it applies only to the brothers .  would they have sent these young women these sisters to deal with us if there was any rule against speaking to tribesmen .         it might be  hari  that they were meant to speak only to me and i to you .         nonsense .  i don   t believe it and i won   t believe it .  i am not merely a tribesman  i am an honored guest in mycogen  asked to be treated as such by chetter hummin and escorted here by sunmaster fourteen himself .  i will not be treated as though i do not exist .  i will be in communication with sunmaster fourteen and i will complain bitterly .      raindrop forty five began to sob and raindrop forty three  retaining her comparative impassivity  nevertheless flushed faintly .   dors made as though to appeal to seldon once again  but he stopped her with a brief and angry outward thrust of his right arm and then stared toweringly at raindrop forty three .   and finally she spoke and did not twitter .  rather  her voice trembled hoarsely  as though she had to force it to sound in the direction of a male being and was doing so against all her instincts and desires .      you must not complain of us  tribesman .  that would be unjust .  you force me to break the custom of our people .  what do you want of me .      seldon smiled disarmingly at once and held out his hand .     the garment you brought me .  the kirtle .      silently  she stretched out her arm and deposited the kirtle in his hand .   he bowed slightly and said in a soft warm voice     thank you  sister .     he then cast a very brief look in dors   s direction  as though to say  you see .  but dors looked away angrily .   the kirtle was featureless  seldon saw as he unfolded it  embroidery and decorativeness were for women  apparently   but it came with a tasselled belt that probably had some particular way of being worn .  no doubt he could work it out .   he said     i   ll step into the bathroom and put this thing on .  it won   t take but a minute  i suppose .      he stepped into the small chamber and found the door would not dose behind him because dors was forcing her way in as well .  only when the two of them were in the bathroom together did the door close .      what were you doing .     dors hissed angrily .     you were an absolute brute  hari .  why did you treat the poor woman that way .   seldon said impatiently     i had to make her talk to me .  i   m counting on her for information .  you know that .  i   m sorry i had to be cruel  but how else could i have broken down her inhibitions .     and he motioned her out .   when he emerged  he found dors in her kirtle too .   dors  despite the bald head the skincap gave her and the inherent dowdiness of the kirtle  managed to look quite attractive .  the stitching on the robe somehow suggested a figure without revealing it in the least .  her belt was wider than his own and was a slightly different shade of gray from her kirtle .  what   s more  it was held in front by two glittering blue stone snaps .   women did manage to beautify themselves even under the greatest difficulty  seldon thought .    looking over at hari  dors said     you look quite the mycogenian now .  the two of us are fit to be taken to the stores by the sisters .         yes      said seldon     but afterward i want raindrop forty three to take me on a tour of the microfarms .      raindrop forty three   s eyes widened and she took a rapid step backward .      i   d like to see them      said seldon calmly .   raindrop forty three looked quickly at dors .     tribeswoman       seldon said     perhaps you know nothing of the farms  sister .      that seemed to touch a nerve .  she lifted her chin haughtily as she still carefully addressed dors .     i have worked on the microfarms .  all brothers and sisters do at some point in their lives .         well then  take me on the tour      said seldon     and lets not go through the argument again .  i am not a brother to whom you are forbidden to speak and with whom you may have no dealings .  i am a tribesman and an honored guest .  i wear this skincap and this kirde so as not to attract undue attention  but i am a scholar and while i am here i must learn .  i cannot sit in this room and stare at the wall .  i want to see the one thing you have that the rest of the galaxy does not have  .   .   .  your microfarms .  i should think you   d be proud to show them .         we are proud      said raindrop forty three  finally facing seldon as she spoke     and i will show you and don   t think you will learn any of our secrets if that is what you are after .  i will show you the microfarms tomorrow morning .  it will take time to arrange a tour .      seldon said     i will wait till tomorrow morning .  but do you promise .  do i have your word of honor .      raindrop forty three said with clear contempt     i am a sister and i will do as i say .  i will keep my word  even to a tribesman .      her voice grew icy at the last words  while her eyes widened and seemed to glitter .  seldon wondered what was passing through her mind and felt uneasy .        .     seldon passed a restless night .  to begin with  dors had announced that she must accompany him on the tour of the microfarm and he had objected strenuously .      the whole purpose      he said     is to make her talk freely  to present her with an unusual environment alone with a male  even if a tribesman .  having broken custom so far  it will be easier to break it further .  if you   re along  she will talk to you and i will only get the leavings .         and if something happens to you in my absence  as it did upperside .         nothing will happen .  please .  if you want to help me  stay away .  if not  i will have nothing further to do with you .  i mean it  dors .  this is important to me .  much as i   ve grown fond of you  you cannot come ahead of this .      she agreed with enormous reluctance and said only     promise me you   ll at least be nice to her  then .      and seldon said     is it me you must protect or her .  i assure you that i didn   t treat her harshly for pleasure and i won   t do so in the future .      the memory of this argument with dors their first helped keep him awake a large part of the night  that  together with the nagging thought that the two sisters might not arrive in the morning  despite raindrop forty three   s promise .   they did arrive  however  not long after seldon had completed a spare breakfast  he was determined not to grow fat through overindulgence  and had put on a kirtle that fitted him precisely .  he had carefully organized the belt so that it hung perfectly .   raindrop forty three  still with a touch of ice in her eye  said     if you are ready  tribesman seldon  my sister will remain with tribeswoman venabili .     her voice was neither twittery nor hoarse .  it was as though she had steadied herself through the night  practicing  in her mind  how to speak to one who was a male but not a brother .   seldon wondered if she had lost sleep and said     i am quite ready .      together  half an hour later  raindrop forty three and hari seldon were descending level upon level .  though it was daytime by the clock  the light was dusky and dimmer than it had been elsewhere on trantor .   there was no obvious reason for this .  surely  the artificial daylight that slowly progressed around the trantorian sphere could include the mycogen sector .  the mycogenians must want it that way  seldon thought  clinging to some primitive habit .  slowly seldon   s eyes adjusted to the dim surroundings .   seldon tried to meet the eyes of passersby  whether brothers or sisters  calmly .  he assumed he and raindrop forty three would be taken as a brother and his woman and that they would be given no notice as long as he did nothing to attract attention .   unfortunately  it seemed as if raindrop forty three wanted to be noticed .  she talked to him in few words and in low tones out of a clenched mouth .  it was clear that the company of an unauthorized male  even though only she knew this fact  raved her self confidence .  seldon was quite sure that if he asked her to relax  he would merely make her that much more uneasy .   seldon wondered what she would do if she met someone who knew her .  he felt more relaxed once they reached the lower levels  where human beings were fewer .    the descent was not by elevators either  but by moving staired ramps that existed in pairs  one going up and one going down .  raindrop fortythree referred to them as    escalators .     seldon wasn   t sure he had caught the word correctly  never having heard it before .   as they sank to lower and lower levels  seldon   s apprehension grew .  most worlds possessed microfarms and most worlds produced their own varieties of microproducts .  seldon  back on helicon  had occasionally shopped for seasonings in the microfarms and was always aware of an unpleasant stomach turning stench .   the people who worked at the microfarms didn   t seem to mind .  even when casual visitors wrinkled their noses  they seemed to acclimate themselves to it .  seldon  however  was always peculiarly susceptible to the smell .  he suffered and he expected to suffer now .  he tried soothing himself with the thought that he was nobly sacrificing his comfort to his need for information  but that didn   t keep his stomach from turning itself into knots in apprehension .   after he had lost track of the number of levels they had descended  with the air still seeming reasonably fresh  he asked     when do we get to the microfarm levels .         we   re there now .      seldon breathed deeply .     it doesn   t smell as though we are .         smell .  what do you mean .     raindrop forty three was offended enough to speak quite loudly .      there was always a putrid odor associated with microfarms  in my experience .  you know  from the fertilizer that bacteria  yeast  fungi  and saprophytes generally need .         in your experience .     her voice lowered again .     where was that .         on my home world .      the sister twisted her face into wild repugnance .     and your people wallow in gabelle .      seldon had never heard the word before  but from the look and the intonation  he knew what it meant .   he said     it doesn   t smell like that  you understand  once it is ready for consumption .         ours doesn   t smell like that at any time .  our biotechnicians have worked out perfect strains .  the algae grow in the purest light and the most carefully balanced electrolyte solutions .  the saprophytes are fed on beautifully combined organics .  the formulas and recipes are something no tribespeople will ever know .   come on  here we are .  sniff all you want .  you   ll find nothing offensive .  that is one reason why our food is in demand throughout the galaxy and why the emperor  we are told  eats nothing else  though it is far too good for a tribesman if you ask me  even if he calls himself emperor .      she said it with an anger that seemed directly aimed at seldon .  then  as though afraid he might miss that  she added     or even if be calls himself an honored guest .      they stepped out into a narrow corridor  on each side of which were large thick glass tanks in which roiled cloudy green water full of swirling  growing algae  moving about through the force of the gas bubbles that streamed up through it .  they would be rich in carbon dioxide  he decided .   rich  rosy light shone down into the tanks  light that was much brighter than that in the corridors .  he commented thoughtfully on that .      of course      she said .     these algae work best at the red end of the spectrum .         i presume      said seldon     that everything is automated .      she shrugged  but did not respond .      i don   t see quantities of brothers and sisters in evidence      seldon said  persisting .      nevertheless  there is work to be done and they do it  even if you don   t see them at work .  the details are not for you .  don   t waste your time by asking about it .         wait .  don   t be angry with me .  i don   t expect to be told state secrets .  come on  dear .      the word slipped out .    he took her arm as she seemed on the point of hurrying away .  she remained in place  but he felt her shudder slightly and he released her in embarrassment .   he said     it   s just that is seems automated .         make what you wish of the seeming .  nevertheless  there is room here for human brains and human judgment .  every brother and sister has occasion to work here at some time .  some make a profession of it .      she was speaking more freely now but  to his continuing embarrassment  he noticed her left hand move stealthily toward her right arm and gently rub the spot where he had touched her  as though he had stung her .      it goes on for kilometers and kilometers      she said     but if we turn here there   ll he a portion of the fungal section you can see .      they moved along .  seldon noted how clean everything was .  the glass sparkled .  the tiled floor seemed moist  though when he seized a moment to bend and touch it  it wasn   t .  nor was it slippery  unless his sandals  with his big toe protruding in approved mycogenian fashion  had nonslip soles .   raindrop forty three was right in one respect .  here and there a brother or a sister worked silently  studying gauges  adjusting controls  sometimes engaged in something as unskilled as polishing equipment always absorbed in whatever they were doing .   seldon was careful not to ask what they were doing  since he did not want to cause the sister humiliation in having to answer that she did not know or anger in her having to remind him there were things he must not know .   they passed through a lightly swinging door and seldon suddenly noticed the faintest touch of the odor he remembered .  he looked at raindrop forty three  but she seemed unconscious of it and soon he too became used to it .   the character of the light changed suddenly .  the rosiness was gone and the brightness too .  all seemed to be in a twilight except where equipment was spotlighted and wherever there was a spot light there seemed to be a brother or a sister .  some wore lighted headbands that gleamed with a pearly glow and  in the middle distance  seldon could see  here and there  small sparks of light moving erratically .   as they walked  he case a quick eye on her profile .  it was all he could really judge by .  at all other times  he could not cease being conscious of her bulging bald head  her bare eyes  her colorless face .  they drowned her individuality and seemed to make her invisible .  here in profile  however  he could see something .  nose  chin  full lips  regularity  beauty .  the dim light somehow smoothed out and softened the great upper desert .   he thought with surprise  she could be very beautiful if she grew her hair and arranged it nicely .   and then he thought that she couldn   t grow her hair .  she would be bald her whole life .   why .  why did they have to do that to her .  sunmaster said it was so that a mycogenian would know himself  or herself  for a mycogenian all his  or her  life .  why was that so important that the curse of hairlessness had to be accepted as a badge or mark of identity .   and then  because he was used to arguing both sides in his mind  he thought  custom is second nature .  be accustomed to a bald head  sufficiently accustomed  and hair on it would seem monstrous  would evoke nausea .  he himself had shaved his face every morning  removing all the facial hair  uncomfortable at the merest stubble  and yet he did not think of his face as bald or as being in any way unnatural .  of course  he could grow his facial hair at any time he wished  but he didn   t wish to do so .   he knew that there were worlds on which the men did not shave  in some  they did not even clip or shape the facial hair but let it grow wild .  what would they say if they could see his own bald face  his own hairless chin  cheek  and lips .   and meanwhile  he walked with raindrop forty three endlessly  it seemed  and every once in a while she guided him by the elbow and it seemed to him that she had grown accustomed to that  for she did not withdraw her hand hastily .  sometimes it remained for nearly a minute .   she said     here .  come here .         what is that .     asked seldon .   they were standing before a small tray filled with little spheres  each about two centimeters in diameter .  a brother who was tending the area and who had just placed the tray where it was looked up in mild inquiry .   raindrop forty three said to seldon in a low voice     ask for a few .      seldon realized she could not speak to a brother until spoken to and said uncertainly     may we have a few  b brother .         have a handful  brother      said the other heartily .   seldon plucked out one of the spheres and was on the point of handing it to raindrop forty three when he noticed that she had accepted the invitation as applying to herself and reached in for two handfuls .   the sphere felt glossy  smooth .  seldon said to raindrop fortythree as they moved away from the vat and from the brother who was in attendance     are these supposed to be eaten .     he lifted the sphere cautiously to his nose .      they don   t smell      she said sharply .      what are they .      dainties .  raw dainties .  for the outside market they   re flavored in different ways  but here in mycogen we eat them unflavored    the only way .      she put one in her mouth and said     i never have enough .      seldon put his sphere into his mouth and felt it dissolve and disappear rapidly .  his mouth  for a moment  ran liquid and then it slid  almost of its own accord  down his throat .   he stood for a moment  amazed .  it was slightly sweet and  for that matter  had an even fainter bitter aftertaste  but the train sensation eluded him .      may i have another .     he said .      have half a dozen      said raindrop forty three  holding out her hand .     they never have quite the same taste twice and have practically no calories .  just taste .      she was right .  he tried to have the dainty linger in his mouth  he tried licking it carefully  tried biting off apiece .  however  the most careful lick destroyed it .  when a bit was crunched off apiece  the rest of it disappeared at once .  and each taste was undefinable and not quite like the one before .      the only trouble is      said the sister happily     that every once in a while you have a very unusual one and you never forget it  but you never have it again either .  i had one when i was nine      her expression suddenly lost its excitement and she said     it   s a good thing .  it teaches you the evanescence of things of the world .      it was a signal  seldon thought .  they had wandered about aimlessly long enough .  she had grown used to him and was talking to him .  and now the conversation had to come to its point .  now .        .     seldon said     i come from a world which lies out in the open  sister  as all worlds do but trantor .  rain comes or doesn   t come  the rivers trickle or are in flood  temperature is high or low .  that means harvests are good or bad .  here  however  the environment is truly controlled .  harvests have no choice but to be good .  how fortunate mycogen is .      he waited .  there were different possible answers and his course of action would depend on which answer came .   she was speaking quite freely now and seemed to have no inhibitions concerning his masculinity  so this long tour had served its purpose .  raindrop forty three said     the environment is not that easy to control .  there are  occasionally  viral infections and there are sometimes unexpected and undesirable mutations .  there are times when whole vast batches wither or are worthless .         you astonish me .  and what happens then .         there is usually no recourse but to destroy the spoiled batches  even those that are merely suspected of spoilage .  trays and tanks must be totally sterilized  sometimes disposed of altogether .         it amounts to surgery  then      said seldon .     you cut out the diseased tissue .         yes .         and what do you do to prevent such things from happening .         what can we do .  we test constantly for any mutations that may spring up  any new viruses that may appear  any accidental contamination or alteration of the environment .  it rarely happens that we detect anything wrong  but if we do  we take drastic action .  the result is that bad years are very few and even bad years affect only fractional bits here and there .  the worst year we   ve ever had fell short of the average by only    percent though that was enough to produce hardship .  the trouble is that even the most careful forethought and the most cleverly designed computer programs can   t always predict what is essentially unpredictable .       seldon felt an involuntary shudder go through him .  it was as though she was speaking of psychohistory  but she was only speaking of the microfarm produce of a tiny fraction of humanity  while he himself was considering all the mighty galactic empire in every one of all its activities .    unavoidably disheartened  he said     surely  it   s not all unpredictable .  there are forces that guide and that care for us all .      the sister stiffened .  she turned around toward him  seeming to study him with her penetrating eyes .   but all she said was    what .      seldon felt uneasy .     it seems to me that in speaking of viruses and mutations  we   re talking about the natural  about phenomena that are subject to natural law .  that leaves out of account the supernatural  doesn   t it .  it leaves out that which is not subject to natural law and can  therefore  control natural law .      she continued to stare at him  as though he had suddenly begun speaking some distant  unknown dialect of galactic standard .  again she said  in half a whisper this time     wharf     he continued  stumbling over unfamiliar words that half embarrassed him .     you must appeal to some great essence  some great spirit  some  .   .   .  i don   t know what to call it .      raindrop forty three said in a voice that rose into higher registers but remained low     i thought so .  i thought that was what you meant  but i couldn   t believe it .  you   re accusing us of having religion .  why didn   t you say so .  why didn   t you use the word .      she waited for an answer and seldon  a little confused at the onslaught  said     because that   s not a word i use .  i call it    supernaturalism .             call it what you will .  it   s religion and we don   t have it .  religion is for the tribesmen  for the swarming sc       the sister paused to swallow as though she had come near to choking and seldon was certain the word she had choked over was  .  .   she was in control again .  speaking slowly and somewhat below her normal soprano  she said     we are not a religious people .  our kingdom is of this galaxy and always has been .  if you have a religion  seldon felt trapped .  somehow he had not counted on this .  he raised a hand defensively .     not really .  i   m a mathematician and my kingdom is also of this galaxy .  it   s just that i thought  from the rigidity of your customs  that your kingdom          don   t think it  tribesman .  if our customs are rigid  it is because we are mere millions surrounded by billions .  somehow we must mark ourselves off so that we precious few are not lost among your swarms and hordes .  we must be marked off by our hairlessness  our clothing  our behavior  our way of life .  we must know who we are and we must be sure that you tribesmen know who we are .  we labor in our farms so that we can make ourselves valuable in your eyes and thus make certain that you leave us alone .  that   s all we ask of you  .   .   .  to leave us alone .         i have no intention of harming you or any of your people .  i seek only knowledge  here as everywhere .         so you insult us by asking about our religion  as though we have ever called on a mysterious  insubstantial spirit to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves .         there are many people  many worlds who believe in supernaturalism in one form or another  .   .   .  religion  if you like the word better .  we may disagree with them in one way or another  but we are as likely to be wrong in our disbelief as they in their belief .  in any case  there is no disgrace in such belief and my questions were not intended as insults .      but she was not reconciled .     religion .     she said angrily .     we have no need of it .      seldon   s spirits  having sunk steadily in the course of this exchange  reached bottom .  this whole thing  this expedition with raindrop forty three  had come to nothing .   but she went on to say     we have something far better .  we have history .       and seldon   s s feelings rebounded at once and he smiled .     book    hand on thigh story  .   .   .  an occasion cited by hari seldon as the first turning point in his search for a method to develop psychohistory .  unfortunately  his published writings give no indication as to what that    story    was and speculations concerning it  there have been many  are futile .  it remains one of the many intriguing mysteries concerning seldon   s career .   encyclopedia galactica       .     raindrop forty three stared at seldon  wild eyed and breathing heavily .      i can   t stay here      she said .   seldon looked about .     no one is bothering us .  even the brother from whom we got the dainties said nothing about us .  he seemed to take us as a perfectly normal pair .         that   s because there is nothing unusual about us when the light is dim  when you keep your voice low so the tribesman accent is less noticeable  and when i seem calm .  but now      her voice was growing hoarse .      what of now .         i am nervous and tense .  i am  .   .   .  in a perspiration .         who is to notice .  relax .  calm down .         i can   t relax here .  i can   t calm down while i may be noticed .         where are we to go  then .         there are little sheds for resting .  i have worked here .  i know about them .      she was walking rapidly now and seldon followed .  up a small ramp  which he would not have noticed in the twilight without her  there was a line of doors  well spread apart .      the one at the end      she muttered .     if it   s free .      it was unoccupied .  a small glowing rectangle said not in use and the door was ajar .   raindrop forty three looked about rapidly  motioned seldon in  then stepped inside herself .  she closed the door and  as she did so  a small ceiling light brightened the interior .   seldon said     is there any way the sign on the door can indicate this shed is in use .         that happened automatically when the door closed and the light went on      said the sister .   seldon could feel air softly circulating with a small sighing sound  but where on trantor was that ever present sound and feel not apparent .   the room was not large  but it had a cot with a firm  efficient mattress  and what were obviously clean sheets .  there was a chair and table  a small refrigerator  and something that looked like an enclosed hot plate  probably a tiny food heater .   raindrop forty three sat down on the chair  sitting stiffly upright  visibly attempting to force herself into relaxation .   seldon  uncertain as to what he ought to do  remained standing till she gestured a bit impatiently for him to sit on the cot .  he did so .   raindrop forty three said softly  as though talking to herself     if it is ever known that i have been here with a man even if only a tribesman i shall indeed be an outcast .      seldon rose quickly .     then let   s not stay here .         sit down .  i can   t go out when i   m in this mood .  you   ve been asking about religion .  what are you after .      it seemed to seldon that she had changed completely .  gone was the passivity  the subservience .  there was none of the shyness  the backwardness in the presence of a male .  she was glaring at him through narrowed eyes .      i told you .  knowledge .  i   m a scholar .  it is my profession and my desire to know  i want to understand people in particular  so i want to learn history .  for many worlds  the ancient historical records the truly ancient historical records have decayed into myths and legends  often becoming part of a set of religious beliefs or of supernaturalism .  but if mycogen does not have a religion  then          i said we have history .       seldon said     twice you   ve said you have history .  how old .         it goes back twenty thousand years .         truly .  let us speak frankly .  is it real history or is it something that has degenerated into legend .         it is real history  of course .      seldon was on the point of asking how she could tell  but thought better of it .  was there really a chance that history might reach back twenty thousand years and be authentic .  he was not a historian himself  so he would have to check with dors .   but it seemed so likely to him that on every world the earliest histories were medleys of self serving heroisms and minidramas that were meant as morality plays and were not to be taken literally .  it was surely true of helicon  yet you would find scarcely a heliconian who would not swear by all the tales told and insist it was all true history .  they would support  as such  even that perfectly ridiculous tale of the first exploration of helicon and the encounters with large and dangerous flying reptiles even though nothing like flying reptiles had been found to be native to any world explored and settled by human beings .   he said instead     how does this history begin .      there was a faraway look in the sister   s eyes  a look that did not focus on seldon or on anything in the room .  she said     it begins with a world our world .  one world .         one world .      seldon remembered that hummin had spoken of legends of a single  original world of humanity .       one world .  there were others later  but ours was the first .  one world  with space  with open air  with room for everyone  with fertile fields  with friendly homes  with warm people .  for thousands of years we lived there and then we had to leave and skulk in one place or another until some of us found a corner of trantor where we learned to grow food that brought us a little freedom .  and here in mycogen  we now have our own ways   and our own dreams .         and your histories give the full details concerning the original world .  the one world .         oh yes  it is all in a book and we all have it .  every one of us .  we carry it at all times so that there is never a moment when any one of us cannot open it and read it and remember who we are and who we were and resolve that someday we will have our world back .         do you know where this world is and who lives on it now .      raindrop forty three hesitated  then shook her head fiercely .     we do not  but someday we will find it .         and you have this book in your possession now .         of course .         may i see that book .      now a slow smile crossed the face of the sister .  she said     so that   s what you want .  i knew you wanted something when you asked to be guided through the microfarms by me alone .     she seemed a little embarrassed .     i didn   t think it was the book .          it is all i want      said seldon earnestly .     i really did not have my mind on anything else .  if you brought me here because you thought       she did not allow him to finish .     but here we are .  do you or don   t you want the book .         are you offering to let me see it .         on one condition .      seldon paused  weighing the possibility of serious trouble if he had overcome the sister   s inhibitions to a greater extent than he had ever intended .     what condition .     he said .   raindrop forty three   s tongue emerged lightly and licked quickly at her lips .  then she said with a distinct tremor in her voice     that you remove your skincap .           .     hari seldon stared blankly at raindrop forty three .  there was a perceptible moment in which he did not know what she was talking about .  he had forgotten he was wearing a skincap .   then he put his hand to his head and  for the first time  consciously felt the skincap he was wearing .  it was smooth  but he felt the tiny resilience of the hair beneath .  not much .  his hair  after all  was fine and without much body .   he said  still feeling it     why .      she said     because i want you to .  because that   s the condition if you want to see the book .      he said     well  if you really want me to .     his hand probed for the edge  so that he could peel it off .   but she said     no  let me do it .  i   ll do it .     she was looking at him hungrily .   seldon dropped his hands to his lap .     go ahead  then .      the sister rose quickly and sat down next to him on the cot .  slowly  carefully  she detached the skincap from his head just in front of his ear .  again she licked her lips and she was panting as she loosened the skincap about his forehead and turned it up .  then it came away and was gone and seldon   s hair  released  seemed to stir a bit in glad freedom .   he said  troubled     keeping my hair under the skincap has probably made my scalp sweat .  if so  my hair will be rather damp .      he raised his hand  as though to check the matter  but she caught it and held it back .     i want to do that      she said .     its part of the condition .      her fingers  slowly and hesitantly  touched his hair and then withdrew .  she touched it again and  very gently  stroked it .      it   s dry      she said .     it feels  .   .   .  good .         have you ever felt cephalic hair before .         only on children sometimes .  this  .   .   .  is different .     she was stroking again .      in what way .     seldon  even amid his embarrassment  found it possible to be curious .      i can   t say .  its just  .   .   .  different .      after a while he said     have you had enough .         no .  don   t rush me .  can you make it lie anyway you want it to .         not really .  it has a natural way of falling  but i need a comb for that and i don   t have one with me .         a comb .         an object with prongs  .   .   .  uh  like a fork  .   .   .  but the prongs are more numerous and somewhat softer .         can you use your fingers .     she was running hers through his hair .   he said     after a fashion .  it doesn   t work very well .         its bristly behind .         the hair is shorter there .      raindrop forty three seemed to recall something .     the eyebrows      she said .     isn   t that what they   re called .     she stripped off the shields  then ran her fingers through the gentle arc of hair  against the grain .      that   s nice      she said  then laughed in a high pitched way that was almost like her younger sister   s giggle .     they   re cute .      seldon said a little impatiently     is there anything else that   s part of the condition .      in the rather dim light  raindrop forty three looked as though she might be considering an affirmative  but said nothing .  instead  she suddenly withdrew her hands and lifted them to her nose .  seldon wondered what she might be smelling .      how odd      she said .     may i  .   .   .  may i do it again another time .      seldon said uneasily     if you will let me have the book long enough to study it  then perhaps .      raindrop forty three reached into her kirtle through a slit that seldon had not noticed before and  from some hidden inner pocket  removed a book bound in some tough  flexible material .  he took it  trying to control his excitement .   while seldon readjusted his skincap to cover his hair  raindrop forty three raised her hands to her nose again and then  gently and quickly  licked one finger .        .        felt your hair .     said dors venabili .  she looked at seldon   s hair as though she was of a mind to feel it herself .   seldon moved away slightly .     please don   t .  the woman made it seem like a perversion .         i suppose it was from her standpoint .  did you derive no pleasure from it yourself .         pleasure .  it gave me gooseflesh .  when she finally stopped  i was able to breathe again .  i kept thinking  what other conditions will she make .      dors laughed .     were you afraid that she would force sex upon you .  or hopeful .         i assure you i didn   t dare think .  i just wanted the book .      they were in their room now and dors turned on her field distorter to make sure they would not be overheard .   the mycogenian night was about to begin .  seldon had removed his skincap and kirtle and had bathed  paying particular attention to his hair  which he had foamed and rinsed twice .  he was now sitting on his cot  wearing a light nightgown that had been hanging in the closet .   dors said  eyes dancing     did she know you have hair on your chest .         i was hoping earnestly she wouldn   t think of that .         poor hari .  it was all perfectly natural  you know .  i would probably have had similar trouble if i was alone with a brother .  worse  i   m sure  since he would believe mycogenian society being what it is that as a woman i would be bound to obey his orders without delay or demur .         no  dors .  you may think it was perfectly natural  but you didn   t experience it .  the poor woman was in a high state of sexual excitement .  she engaged all her senses  .   .   .  smelled her fingers  licked them .  if she could have heard hair grow  she would have listened avidly .         but that   s what i mean by    natural .     anything you make forbidden gains sexual attractiveness .  would you be particularly interested in women   s breasts if you lived in a society in which they were displayed at all times .         i think i might .         wouldn   t you be more interested if they were always hidden  as in most societies they are .   listen  let me tell you something that happened to me .  i was at a lake resort back home on cinna  .   .   .  i presume you have resorts on helicon  beaches  that sort of thing .         of course      said seldon  slightly annoyed .     what do you think helicon is  a world of rocks and mountains  with only well water to drink .         no offense  hari .  i just want to make sure you   ll get the point of the story .  on our beaches at cinna  we   re pretty lighthearted about what we wear  .   .   .  or don   t wear .         nude beaches .         not actually  though i suppose if someone removed all of his or her clothing it wouldn   t be much remarked on .  the custom is to wear a decent minimum  but i must admit that what we consider decent leaves very little to the imagination .      seldon said     we have somewhat higher standards of decency on helicon .         yes  i could tell that by your careful treatment of me  but to each its own .  in any case  i was sitting at the small beach by the lake and a young man approached to whom i had spoken earlier in the day .  he was a decent fellow i found nothing particularly wrong with .  he sat on the arm of my chair and placed his right hand on my left thigh  which was bare  of course  in order to steady himself .      after we had spoken for a minute and a half or so  he said  impishly .     here i am .  you know me hardly at all and yet it seems perfectly natural to me that i place my hand on your thigh .  what   s more  it seems perfectly natural to you  since you don   t seem to mind that it remains there .         it was only then that i actually noticed that his hand was on my thigh .  bare skin in public somehow loses some of its sexual quality .  as i said  its the hiding from view that is crucial .      and the young man felt this too  for he went on to say     yet if i were to meet you under more formal conditions and you were wearing a gown  you wouldn   t dream of letting me lift your gown and place my hand on your thigh on the precise spot it now occupies .         i laughed and we continued to talk of this and that .  of course  the young man  now that my attention had been called to the position of his hand  felt it no longer appropriate to keep it there and removed it .      that night i dressed for dinner with more than usual care and appeared in clothing that was considerably more formal than was required or than other women in the dining room were wearing .  i found the young man in question .  he was sitting at one of the tables .  i approached  greeted him  and said     here i am in a gown  but under it my left thigh is bare .  i give you permission .  just lift the gown and place your hand on my left thigh where you had it earlier .         he tried .  i   ll give him credit for that  but everyone was staring .  i wouldn   t have stopped him and i   m sure no one else would have stopped him either  but he couldn   t bring himself to do it .  it was no more public then than it had been earlier and the same people were present in both cases .  it was clear that i had taken the initiative and that i had no objections  but he could not bring himself to violate the proprieties .  the conditions  which had been hand on thigh in the afternoon  were not hand on thigh in the evening and that meant more than anything logic could say .      seldon said     i would have put my hand on your thigh .         are you sure .         positive .         even though your standards of decency on the beach are higher than ours are .         yes .      dors sat down on her own cot  then lay down with her hands behind her head .     so that you   re not particularly disturbed that i   m wearing a nightgown with very little underneath it .         i   m not particularly shocked .  as for being disturbed  that depends on the definition of the word .  i   m certainly aware of how you   re dressed .         well  if we   re going to be cooped up here for a period of time  we   ll have to learn to ignore such things .         or take advantage of them      said seldon  grinning .     and i like your hair .  after seeing you bald all day  i like your hair .         well  don   t touch it .  i haven   t washed it yet .     she half closed her eyes .     it   s interesting .  you   ve detached the informal and formal level of respectability .  what you   re saying is that helicon is more respectable at the informal level than cinna is and less respectable at the formal level .  is that right .         actually  i   m just talking about the young man who placed his hand on your thigh and myself .  how representative we are as cinnians and heliconians  respectively  i can   t say .  i can easily imagine some perfectly proper individuals on both worlds   and some madcaps too .         we   re talking about social pressures .  i   m not exactly a galactic traveler  but i   ve had to involve myself in a great deal of social history .  on the planet of derowd  there was a time when premarital sex was absolutely free .  multiple sex was allowed for the unmarried and public sex was frowned upon only when traffic was blocked  and yet  after marriage  monogamy was absolute and unbroken .  the theory was that by working off all one   s fantasies first  one could settle down to the serious business of life .         did it work .         about three hundred years ago that stopped  but some of my colleagues say it stopped through external pressure from other worlds who were losing too much tourist business to derowd .  there is such a thing as overall galactic social pressure too .         or perhaps economic pressure  in this case .         perhaps .  and being at the university  by the way  i get a chance to study social pressures  even without being a galactic traveler .  i meet people from scores of places inside and outside of trantor and one of the pet amusements in the social science departments is the comparison of social pressures .      here in mycogen  for instance  i have the impression that sex is strictly controlled and is permitted under only the most stringent rules  all the more tightly enforced because it is never discussed .  in the streeling sector  sex is never discussed either  but it isn   t condemned .  in the jennat sector  where i spent a week once doing research  sex is discussed endlessly  but only for the purpose of condemning it .  i don   t suppose there are any two sectors in trantor   or any two worlds outside trantor    in which attitudes toward sex are completely duplicated .      seldon said     you know what you make it sound like .  it would appear .    dors said     i   ll tell you how it appears .  all this talk of sex makes one thing clear to me .  i   m simply not going to let you out of my sight anymore .         what .         twice i let you go  the first time through my own misjudgment and the second because you bullied me into it .  both times it was clearly a mistake .  you know what happened to you the first time .      seldon said indignantly     yes  but nothing happened to me the second time .         you nearly got into a lot of trouble .  suppose you had been caught indulging in sexual escapades with a sister .         it wasn   t a sexual          you yourself said she was in a high state of sexual excitement .         but          it was wrong .  please get it through your head  hari .  from now on  you go nowhere without me .         look      said seldon freezingly     my object was to find out about mycogenian history and as a result of the so called sexual escapade with a sister  i have a book the book .         the book .  true  there   s the book .  let   s see it .      seldon produced it and dors thoughtfully hefted it .   she said     it might not do us any good  hari .  this doesn   t look as though it will fit any projector i   ve ever encountered .  that means you   ll have to get a mycogenian projector and they   ll want to know why you want it .  they   ll then find out you have this book and they   ll take it away from you .      seldon smiled .     if your assumptions were correct  dors  your conclusions would be inescapable  but it happens that this is not the kind of book you think it is .  it   s not meant to be projected .  the material is printed on various pages and the pages are turned .  raindrop fortythree explained that much to me .         a print book .     it was hard to tell whether dors was shocked or amused .     that   s from the stone age .         it   s certainly pre empire      said seldon     but not entirely so .  have you ever seen a print book .         considering that i   m a historian .  of course  hari .         ah  but like this one .      he handed over the book and dors  smiling  opened it then turned to another page then flipped the pages .     its blank      she said .      it appears to be blank .  the mycogenians are stubbornly primitivistic  but not entirely so .  they will keep to the essence of the primitive  but have no objection to using modern technology to modify it for convenience   s sake .  who knows .         maybe so  hari  but i don   t understand what you   re saying .         the pages aren   t blank  they   re covered with microprint .  here  give it back .  if i press this little nubbin on the inner edge of the cover  look .      the page to which the book lay open was suddenly covered with lines of print that rolled slowly upward .   seldon said     you can adjust the rate of upward movement to match your reading speed by slightly twisting the nubbin one way or the other .  when the lines of print reach their upward limit when you reach the bottom line  that is they snap downward and turn off .  you turn to the next page and continue .         where does the energy come from that does all this .         it has an enclosed microfusion battery that lasts the life of the book .         then when it runs down          you discard the book  which you may be required to do even before it runs down  given wear and tear  and get another copy .  you never replace the battery .      dors took the book a second time and looked at it from all sides .  she said     i must admit i never heard of a book like this .         nor i .  the galaxy  generally  has moved into visual technology so rapidly  it skipped over this possibility .         this is visual .         yes  but not with the orthodox effects .  this type of book has its advantages .  it holds far more than an ordinary visual book does .      dors said     where   s the turn on .   ah  let me see if i can work it .     she had opened to a page at random and set the lines of print marching upward .  then she said     i   m afraid this won   t do you any good  hari .  it   s pre galactic .  i don   t mean the book .  i mean the print  .   .   .  the language .         can you read it  dors .  as a historian          as a historian  i   m used to dealing with archaic language  but within limits .  this is far too ancient for me .  i ran make out a few words here and there  but not enough to be useful .         good      said seldon .     if it   s really ancient  it will be useful .         not if you can   t read it .         i can read it      said seldon .     it   s bilingual .  you don   t suppose that raindrop forty three can read the ancient script  do you .         if she   s educated properly  why not .         because i suspect that women in mycogen are not educated past household duties .  some of the more learned men can read this  but everyone else would need a translation to galactic .     he pushed another nubbin .     and this supplies it .      the lines of print changed to galactic standard .      delightful      said dors in admiration .      we could learn from these mycogenians  but we don   t .         we haven   t known about it .         i can   t believe that .  i know about it now .  and you know about it .  there must be outsiders coming into mycogen now and then  for commercial or political reasons  or there wouldn   t be skincaps so ready for use .  so every once in a while someone must have caught a glimpse of this sort of print book and seen how it works  but it   s probably dismissed as something curious but not worth further study  simply because it   s mycogenian .         but is it worth study .         of course .  everything is .  or should be .  hummin would probably point to this lack of concern about these books as a sign of degeneration in the empire .      he lifted the book and said with a gush of excitement     but i am curious and i will read this and it may push me in the direction of psychohistory .         i hope so      said dors     but if you take my advice  you   ll sleep first and approach it fresh in the morning .  you won   t learn much if you nod over it .      seldon hesitated  then said     how maternal you are .         i   m watching over you .         but i have a mother alive on helicon .  i would rather you were my friend .         as for that  i have been your friend since first i met you .      she smiled at him and seldon hesitated as though he were not certain as to the appropriate rejoinder .  finally he said     then i   ll take your advice  as a friend  and sleep before reading .      he made as though to put the book on a small table between the two cots  hesitated  turned  and put it under his pillow .   dors venabili laughed softly .     i think you   re afraid i will wake during the night and read parts of the book before you have a chance to .  is that it .         well      said seldon  trying not to look ashamed     that may be it .  even friendship only goes so far and this is my book and it   s my psychohistory .         i agree      said dors     and i promise you that we won   t quarrel over that .  by the way  you were about to say something earlier when i interrupted you .  remember .      seldon thought briefly .     no .      in the dark  he thought only of the book .  he gave no thought to the hand on thigh story .  in fact  he had already quite forgotten it  consciously at least .        .     venabili woke up and could tell by her timeband that the night period was only half over .  not hearing hari   s snore  she could tell that his cot was empty .  if he had not left the apartment  then he was in the bathroom .   she tapped lightly on the door and said softly     hari .      he said     come in      in an abstracted way and she did .   the toilet lid was down and seldon  seated upon it  held the book open on his lap .  he said  quite unnecessarily     i   m reading .         yes  i see that .  but why .         i couldn   t sleep .  i   m sorry .         but why read in here .         if i had turned on the room light  i would have woken you up .         are you sure the book can   t be illuminated .         pretty sure .  when raindrop forty three described its workings  she never mentioned illumination .  besides  i suppose that would use up so much energy that the battery wouldn   t last the life of the book .     he sounded dissatisfied .   dors said     you can step out  then .  i want to use this place  as long as i   m here .      when she emerged  she found him sitting cross legged on his cot  still reading  with the room well lighted .   she said     you don   t look happy .  does the book disappoint you .      he looked up at her  blinking .     yes  it does .  i   ve sampled it here and there .  its all i   ve had time to do .  the thing is a virtual encyclopedia and the index is almost entirely a listing of people and places that are of little use for my purposes .  it has nothing to do with the galactic empire or the pre imperial kingdoms either .  it deals almost entirely with a single world and  as nearly as i can make out from what i have read  it is an endless dissertation on internal politics .         perhaps you underestimate its age .  it may deal with a period when there was indeed only one world  .   .   .  one inhabited world .         yes  i know      said seldon a little impatiently .     that   s actually what i want provided i can be sure its history  not legend .  i wonder .  i don   t want to believe it just because i want to believe it .      dors said     well  this matter of a single world origin is much in the air these days .  human beings are a single species spread all over the galaxy  so they must have originated somewhere .  at least that   s the popular view at present .  you can   t have independent origins producing the same species on different worlds .         but i   ve never seen the inevitability of that argument      said seldon .     if human beings arose on a number of worlds as a number of different species  why couldn   t they have interbred into some single intermediate species .         because species can   t interbreed .  that   s what makes them species .      seldon thought about it a moment  then dismissed it with a shrug .     well  i   ll leave it to the biologists .         they   re precisely the ones who are keenest on the earth hypothesis .         earth .  is that what they call the supposed world of origin .         that   s a popular name for it  though there   s no way of telling what it was called  assuming there was one .  and no one has any clue to what its location might be .         earth .     said seldon  curling his lips .     it sounds like a belch to me .  in any case  if the book deals with the original world  i didn   t come across it .  how do you spell the word .      she told him and he checked the book quickly .     there you are .  the name is not listed in the index  either by that spelling or any reasonable alternative .         really .         and they do mention other worlds in passing .  names aren   t given and there seems no interest in those other worlds except insofar as they directly impinge on the local world they speak of  .   .   .  at least as far as i can see from what i   ve read .  in one place  they talked about    the fifty .     i don   t know what they meant .  fifty leaders .  fifty cities .  it seemed to me to be fifty worlds .         did they give a name to their own world  this world that seems to preoccupy them entirely .     asked dors .     if they don   t call it earth  what do they call it .         as you   d expect  they call it    the world    or    the planet .     sometimes they call it    the oldest    or    the world of the dawn      which has a poetic significance  i presume  that isn   t clear to me .  i suppose one ought to read the book entirely through and some matters will then grow to make more sense .     he looked down at the book in his hand with some distaste .     it would take a very long time  though  and i   m not sure that i   d end up any the wiser .      dors sighed .     i   m sorry  hari .  you sound so disappointed .         that   s because i am disappointed .  it   s my fault  though .  i should not have allowed myself to expect too much .   at one point  come to think of it  they referred to their world as    aurora .             aurora .     said dors  lifting her eyebrows .      it sounds like a proper name .  it doesn   t make any sense otherwise  as far as i can see .  does it mean anything to you  dors .         aurora .     dors thought about it with a slight frown on her fare .     i can   t say i   ve ever heard of a planet with that name in the course of the history of the galactic empire or during the period of its growth  for that matter  but i won   t pretend to know the name of every one of the twenty five million worlds .  we could look it up in the university library if we ever get back to streeling .  there   s no use trying to find a library here in mycogen .  somehow i have a feeling that all their knowledge is in the book .  if anything isn   t there  they aren   t interested .      seldon yawned and said     i think you   re right .  in any case  there   s no use reading any more and i doubt that i can keep my eyes open any longer .  is it all right if i put out the light .         i would welcome it  hari .  and let   s sleep a little later in the morning .      then  in the dark  seldon said softly     of course  some of what they say is ridiculous .  for instance  they refer to a life expectancy on their world of between three and four centuries .         centuries .         yes  they count their ages by decades rather than by years .  it gives you a queer feeling  because so much of what they say is perfectly matter of fact that when they come out with something that odd  you almost find yourself trapped into believing it .         if you feel yourself beginning to believe that  then you should realize that many legends of primitive origins assume extended life spans for early leaders .  if they   re pictured as unbelievably heroic  you see  it seems natural that they have life spans to suit .         is that so .     said seldon  yawning again .      it is .  and the cure for advanced gullibility is to go to sleep and consider matters again the next day .      and seldon  pausing only long enough to think that an extended life span might well be a simple necessity for anyone trying to understand a galaxy of people  slept .        .     the next morning  feeling relaxed and refreshed and eager to begin his study of the book again  hari asked dors     how old would you say the raindrop sisters are .         i don   t know .  twenty  .   .   .  twenty two .         well  suppose they do live three or four centuries     hari .  that   s ridiculous .         i   m saying suppose .  in mathematics  we say    suppose    all the time and see if we can end up with something patently untrue or selfcontradictory .  an extended life span would almost surely mean an extended period of development .  they might seem in their early twenties and actually be in their sixties .         you can try asking them how old they are .         we can assume they   d lie .         look up their birth certificates .      seldon smiled wryly .     i   ll bet you anything you like a roll in the hay  if you   re willing that they   ll claim they don   t keep records or that  if they do  they will insist those records are closed to tribespeople .         no bet      said dors .     and if that   s true  then it   s useless trying to suppose anything about their age .         oh no .  think of it this way .  if the mycogenians are living extended life spans that are four or five times that of ordinary human beings  they can   t very well give birth to very many children without expanding their population tremendously .  you remember that sunmaster said something about not having the population expand and bit off his remarks angrily at that time .      dors said     what are you getting at .         when i was with raindrop forty three  i saw no children .         on the microfarms .         yes .         did you expect children there .  i was with raindrop forty five in the shops and on the residential levels and i assure you i saw a number of children of all ages  including infants .  quite a few of them .         ah .     seldon looked chagrined .     then that would mean they can   t be enjoying extended life spans .      dors said     by your line of argument  i should say definitely not .  did you really think they did .         no  not really .  but then you can   t close your mind either and make assumptions without testing them one way or another .         you can waste a lot of time that way too  if you stop to chew away at things that are ridiculous on the face of it .         some things that seem ridiculous on the face of it aren   t .  that   s all .  which reminds me .  you   re the historian .  in your work  have you ever come across objects or phenomena called    robots    .         ah .  now you   re switching to another legend and a very popular one .  there are any number of worlds that imagine the existence of machines in human form in prehistoric times .  these are called    robots .         the tales of robots probably originate from one master legend  for the general theme is the same .  robots were devised  then grew in numbers and abilities to the status of the almost superhuman .  they threatened humanity and were destroyed .  in every case  the destruction took place before the actual reliable historic records available to us today existed .  the usual feeling is that the story is a symbolic picture of the risks and dangers of exploring the galaxy  when human beings expanded outward from the world or worlds that were their original homes .  there must always have been the fear of encountering other  and superior intelligences .             perhaps they did at least once and that gave rise to the legend .         except that on no human occupied world has there been any record or trace of any prehuman or nonhuman intelligence .         but why    robots    .  does the word have meaning .         not that i know of  but it   s the equivalent of the familiar    automata .             automata .  well  why don   t they say so .         because people do use archaic terms for flavor when they tell an ancient legend .  why do you ask all this  by the way .         because in this ancient mycogenian book  they talk of robots .  and very favorably  by the way .   listen  dors  aren   t you going out with raindrop forty five again this afternoon .         supposedly if she shows up .         would you ask her some questions and try to get the answers out of her .         i can try .  what are the questions .         i would like to find out  as tactfully as possible  if there is some structure in mycogen that is particularly significant  that is tied in with the past  that has a sort of mythic value  that can       dors interrupted  trying not to smile .     i think that what you are trying to ask is whether mycogen has a temple .      and  inevitably  seldon looked blank and said     what   s a temple .         another archaic term of uncertain origin .  it means all the things you asked about significance  past  myth .  very well  i   ll ask .  it   s the sort of thing  however  that they might find difficult to speak of .  to tribespeople  certainly .         nevertheless  do try .        sacratorium    aurora   .   .   .  a mythical world  supposedly inhabited in primordial times  during the dawn of interstellar travel .  it is thought by some to he the perhaps equally mythical    world of origin    of humanity and to be another name for    earth .     the people of the mycogen  q . v .   sector of ancient trantor reportedly held themselves to be descended from the inhabitants of aurora and made that tenet central to their system of beliefs  concerning which almost nothing else is known  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       .     the two raindrops arrived at midmorning .  raindrop forty five seemed as cheerful as ever  but raindrop forty three paused just inside the door  looking drawn and circumspect .  she kept her eyes down and did not as much as glance at seldon .   seldon looked uncertain and gestured to dors  who said in a cheerful businesslike tone of voice     one moment  sisters .  i must give instructions to my man or he won   t know what to do with himself today .      they moved into the bathroom and dors whispered     is something wrong .         yes .  raindrop forty three is obviously shattered .  please tell her that i will return the book as soon as possible .      dors favored seldon with a long surprised look .     hari      she said     you   re a sweet  caring person  but you haven   t the good sense of an amoeba .  if i as much as mention the book to the poor woman  she   ll be certain that you told me all about what happened yesterday and then she   ll really be shattered .  the only hope is to treat her exactly as i would ordinarily .      seldon nodded his head and said dispiritedly     i suppose you   re right .      dors returned in time for dinner and found seldon on his cot  still leafing through the book  but with intensified impatience .   he looked up with a scowl and said     if we   re going to be staying here any length of time  we   re going to need a communication device of some sort between us .  i had no idea when you   d get back and i was a little concerned .         well  here i am      she said  removing her skincap gingerly and looking at it with more than a little distaste .     i   m really pleased at your concern .  i rather thought you   d be so lost in the book  you wouldn   t even realize i was gone .      seldon snorted .   dors said     as for communications devices  i doubt that they are easy to come by in mycogen .  it would mean easing communication with tribespeople outside and i suspect the leaders of mycogen are bound and determined to cut down on any possible interaction with the great beyond .         yes      said seldon  tossing the book to one side     i would expect that from what i see in the book .  did you find out about the whatever you called it  .   .   .  the temple .         yes      she said  removing her eyebrow patches .     it exists .  there are a number of them over the area of the sector  but there   s a central building that seems to be the important one .   would you believe that one woman noticed my eyelashes and told me that i shouldn   t let myself be seen in public .  i have a feeling she intended to report me for indecent exposure .         never mind that      said seldon impatiently .     do you know where the central temple is located .         i have directions  but raindrop forty five warned me that women were not allowed inside except on special occasions  none of which are coming up soon .  it   s called the sacratorium .         the what .         the sacratorium .         what an ugly word .  what does it mean .      dors shook her head .     it   s new to me .  and neither raindrop knew what it meant either .  to them  sacratorium isn   t what the building is called  it   s what it is .  asking them why they called it that probably sounded like asking them why a wall is called a wall .         is there anything about it they do know .         of course  hari .  they know what it   s for .  it   s a place that   s devoted to something other than the life here in mycogen .  it   s devoted to another world  a former and better one .         the world they once lived on  you mean .         exactly .  raindrop forty five all but said so  but not quite .  she couldn   t bring herself to say the word .         aurora .         that   s the word  but i suspect that if you were to say it out loud to a group of mycogenians  they would be shocked and horrified .  raindrop forty five  when she said     the sacratorium is dedicated to      stopped at that point and carefully wrote out the letters one by one with her finger on the palm of her hand .  and she blushed  as though she was doing something obscene .         strange      said seldon .     if the book is an accurate guide  aurora is their dearest memory  their chief point of unification  the center about which everything in mycogen revolves .  why should its mention be considered obscene .   are you sure you didn   t misinterpret what the sister meant .         i   m positive .  and perhaps it   s no mystery .  too much talk about it would get to tribespeople .  the best way of keeping it secret unto themselves is to make its very mention taboo .         taboo .         a specialized anthropological term .  it   s a reference to serious and effective social pressure forbidding some sort of action .  the fact that women are not allowed in the sacratorium probably has the force of a taboo .  i   m sure that a sister would be horrified if it was suggested that she invade its precincts .         are the directions you have good enough for me to get to the sacratorium on my own .         in the first place  hari  you   re not going alone .  i   m going with you .  i thought we had discussed the matter and that i had made it clear that i cannot protect you at long distance not from sleet storms and not from feral women .  in the second place  it   s impractical to think of walking there .  mycogen may be a small sector  as sectors go  but it simply isn   t that small .         an expressway  then .         there are no expressways passing through mycogenian territory .  it would make contact between mycogenians and tribespeople too easy .  still  there are public conveyances of the kind that are found on less developed planets .  in fact  that   s what mycogen is  a piece of an undeveloped planet  embedded like a splinter in the body of trantor  which is otherwise a patchwork of developed societies .    and hari  finish with the book as soon as possible .  it   s apparent that rainbow forty three is in trouble as long as you have it and so will we be if they find out .         do you mean a tribesperson reading it is taboo .         i   m sure of it .         well  it would be no great loss to give it back .  i should say that    percent of it is incredibly dull  endless in fighting among political groups  endless justification of policies whose wisdom i cannot possibly judge  endless homilies on ethical matters which  even when enlightened  and they usually aren   t  are couched with such infuriating self righteousness as to almost enforce violation .         you sound as though i would be doing you a great favor it i took the thing away from you .         except that there   s always the other   percent that discusses the never to be mentioned aurora .  i keep thinking that there may be something there and that it may be helpful to me .  that   s why i wanted to know about the sacratorium .      do you hope to find support for the book   s concept of aurora in the sacratorium .         in a way .  and i   m also terribly caught up in what the book has to say about automata  or robots  to use their term .  i find myself attracted to the concept .         surely  you don   t take it seriously .         almost .  if you accept some passages of the book literally  then there is an implication that some robots were in human shape .         naturally .  if you   re going to construct a simulacrum of a human being  you will make it look like a human being .         yes  simulacrum means    likeness      but a likeness can be crude indeed .  an artist can draw a stick figure and you might know he is representing a human being and recognize it .  a circle for the head  a stalk for the body  and four bent lines for arms and legs and you have it .  but i mean robots that really look like a human being  in every detail .         ridiculous  hari .  imagine the time it would take to fashion the metal of the body into perfect proportions  with the smooth curve of underlying muscles .         who said    metal      dors .  the impression i got is that such robots were organic or pseudo organic  that they were covered with skin  that you could not easily draw a distinction between them and human beings in any way .         does the book say that .         not in so many words .  the inference  however          is your inference  hari .  you can   t take it seriously .         let me try .  i find four things that i can deduce from what the book says about robots  and i followed up every reference the index gave .  first  as i say  they  or some of them exactly resembled human beings  second  they had very extended life spans if you want to call it that .         better say    effectiveness          said dors     or you   ll begin thinking of them as human altogether .         third      said seldon  ignoring her     that some  or  at any rate  at least one continues to live on to this day .         hart     that   s one of the most widespread legends we have .  the ancient hero does not die but remains in suspended animation  ready to return to save his people at some time of great need .  really  hari .         fourth      said seldon  still not rising to the bait     there are some lines that seem to indicate that the central temple  or the sacratorium  if that   s what it is  though i haven   t found that word in the book  actually contains a robot .     he paused  then said     do you see .      dors said     no .  what should i see .         if we combine the four points  perhaps a robot that looks exactly like a human being and that is still alive  having been alive for  say  the last twenty thousand years  is in the sacratorium .         come on  hari  you can   t believe that .         i don   t actually believe it  but i can   t entirely let go either .  what if its true .  what if its only one chance out of a million  i admit it   s true .  don   t you see how useful he could be to me .  he could remember the galaxy as it was long before any reliable historical records existed .  he might help make psychohistory possible .         even if it was true  do you suppose the mycogenians would let you see and interview the robot .         i don   t intend to ask permission .  i can at least go to the sacratorium and see if there   s something to interview first .         not now .  tomorrow at the earliest .  and if you don   t think better of it by morning  we go .         you told me yourself they don   t allow women          they allow women to look at it from outside  i   m sure  and i suspect that is all we   ll get to do .      and there she was adamant .   hari seldon was perfectly willing to let dors take the lead .  she had been out in the main roadways of mycogen and was more at home with them than he was .   dors venabili  brows knitted  was less delighted with the prospect .  she said     we can easily get lost  you know .         not with that booklet      said seldon .   she looked up at him impatiently .     fix your mind on mycogen  hari .  what i should have is a computomap  something i can ask questions of .  this mycogenian version is just a piece of folded plastic .  i can   t tell this thing where i am .  i can   t tell it by word of mouth and i can   t even tell it by pushing the necessary contacts .  it can   t tell me anything either way .  it   s a print thing .         then read what it says .         that   s what i   m trying to do  but it   s written for people who are familiar with the system to begin with .  we   ll have to ask .         no  dors .  that would be a last resort .  i don   t want to attract attention .  i would rather we take our chances and try to find our own way  even if it means making one or two wrong turns .      dors leafed through the booklet with great attention and then said grudgingly     well  it gives the sacratorium important mention .  i suppose that   s only natural .  i presume everyone in mycogen would want to get there at one time or another .     then  after additional concentration  she said     i   ll tell you what .  there   s no way of taking a conveyance from here to there .         what .         don   t get excited .  apparently  there   s a way of getting from here to another conveyance that will take us there .  we   ll have to change from one to another .      seldon relaxed .     well  of course .  you can   t take an expressway to half the places on trantor without changing .      dors cast an impatient glance at seldon .     i know that too .  it   s just that i   m used to having these things tell me so .  when they expect you to find out for yourself  the simplest things can escape you for a while .         all right  dear .  don   t snap .  if you know the way now  lead .  i will follow humbly .      and follow her he did  until they came to an intersection  where they stopped .   three white kirtled males and a pair of gray kirtled females were at the same intersection .  seldon tried a universal and general smile in their direction  but they responded with a blank stare and looked away .   and then the conveyance came .  it was an outmoded version of what seldon  back on helicon  would have called a gravi bus .  there were some twenty upholstered benches inside  each capable of holding four people .  each bench had its own doors on both sides of the bus .  when it stopped  passengers emerged on either side .   for a moment  seldon was concerned for those who got out on the traffic side of the gravi bus  but then he noticed that every vehicle approaching from either direction stopped as it neared the bus .  none passed it while it was not moving .    dors pushed seldon impatiently and he moved on to a bench where two adjoining seats were available .  dors followed after .   the men always got on and got off first  he noticed .       well  try .         for instance      she said and pointed to a smooth boxed off area on the back of the bench directly before each of them .  as soon as the conveyance had begun to move  words lit up  naming the next stop and the notable structures or crossways that were nearby .      now  that will probably tell us when we   re approaching the changeover we want .  at least the sector isn   t completely barbaric .         good      said seldon .  then  after a while  leaning toward dors  he whispered     no one is looking at us .  it seems that artificial boundaries are set up to preserve individual privacy in any crowded place .  have you noticed that .         i   ve always taken it for granted .  if that   s going to be a rule of your psychohistory  no one will be very impressed by it .      as dors had guessed  the direction plaque in front of them eventually announced the approach to the changeover for the direct line to the sacratorium .   they exited and again had to wait .  some buses ahead had already left this intersection  but another gravi bus was already approaching .  they were on a well traveled route  which was not surprising  the sacratorium was bound to be the center and heartbeat of the sector .   they got on the gravi bus and seldon whispered     we   re not paying .         according to the map  public transportation is a free service .      seldon thrust out his lower lip .     how civilized .  i suppose that nothing is all of a piece  not backwardness  not barbarism  nothing .      but dors nudged him and whispered     your rule is broken .  we   re being watched .  the man on your right .           .     seldon   s eyes shifted briefly .  the man to his right was rather thin and seemed quite old .  he had dark brown eyes and a swarthy complexion  and seldon was sure that he would have had black hair if he had not been depilated .   he faced front again  thinking .  this brother was rather atypical .  the few brothers he had paid any attention to had been rather tall  lightskinned  and with blue or gray eyes .  of course  he had not seen enough of them to make a general rule .   then there was a light touch on the right sleeve of his kirtle .  seldon turned hesitantly and found himself looking at a card on which was written lightly  careful  tribesman .   seldon started and put a hand to his skincap automatically .  the man next to him silently mouthed     hair .      seldon   s hand found it  a tiny exposure of bristles at his temple .  he must have disturbed the skincap at some point or another .  quickly and as unobtrusively as possible  he tugged the skincap  then made sure that it was snug under the pretence of stroking his head .   he turned to his neighbor on his right  nodded slightly  and mouthed     thank you .      his neighbor smiled and said in a normal speaking voice     going to the sacratorium .      seldon nodded .     yes  i am .         easy guess .  so am i .  shall we get off together .     his smile was friendly .      i   m with my my          with your woman .  of course .  all three together  then .      seldon was not sure how to react .  a quick look in the other direction showed him that dors   s eyes were turned straight ahead .  she was showing no interest in masculine conversation an attitude appropriate for a sister .  however  seldon felt a soft pat on his left knee  which he took  with perhaps little justification  to mean     it   s all right .      in any case  his natural sense of courtesy was on that side and he said     yes  certainly .      there was no further conversation until the direction plaque told them they were arriving at the sacratorium and seldon   s mycogenian friend was rising to get off .   the gravi bus made a wide turn about the perimeter of a large area of the sacratorium grounds and there was a general exodus when it came to a halt  the men sliding in front of the women to exit first .  the women followed .   the mycogenian   s voice crackled a bit with age  but it was cheerful .  he said     it   s a little early for lunch my  .   .   .  friends  but take my word for it that things will be crowded in not too long a time .  would you be willing to buy something simple now and eat it outside .  i am very familiar with this area and i know a good place .      seldon wondered if this was a device to maneuver innocent tribespeople into something or other disreputable or costly  yet decided to chance it .      you   re very kind      he said .     since we are not at all familiar with the place  we will be glad to let you take the lead .      they bought lunch sandwiches and a beverage that looked like milkat an open air stand .  since it was a beautiful day and they were visitors  the old mycogenian said  they would go to the sacratorium grounds and eat out of doors  the better to become acquainted with their surroundings .   during their walk  carrying their lunch  seldon noted that  on a very small scale  the sacratorium resembled the imperial palace and that the grounds around it resembled  on a minute scale  the imperial grounds .  he could scarcely believe that the mycogenian people admired the imperial institution or  indeed  did anything but hate and despise it  yet the cultural attraction was apparently not to be withstood .      it   s beautiful      said the mycogenian with obvious pride .      quite      said seldon .     how it glistens in the daylight .         the grounds around it      he said     are constructed in imitation of the government grounds on our dawn world  .   .   .  in miniature  to be sure .         did you ever see the grounds of the imperial palace .     asked seldon cautiously .   the mycogenian caught the implication and seemed in no way put out by it .     they copied the dawn world as best they could too .      seldon doubted that in the extreme  but he said nothing .   they came to a semicircular seat of white stonite  sparkling in the light as the sacratorium did .      good      said the mycogenian  his dark eyes gleaming with pleasure .     no one   s taken my place .  i call it mine only because it   s my favorite seat .  it affords a beautiful view of the side wall of the sacratorium past the trees .  please sit down .  it   s not cold  i assure you .  and your companion .  she is welcome to sit too .  she is a tribeswoman  i know  and has different customs .  she  .   .   .  she may speak if she wishes .      dors gave him a hard look and sat down .   seldon  recognizing the fact that they might remain with this old mycogenian a while  thrust out his hand and said     i am hari and my female companion is dors .  we don   t use numbers  i   m afraid .         to each his  .   .   .  or her  .   .   .  own      said the other expansively .     i am mycelium seventy two .  we are a large cohort .         mycelium .     said seldon a bit hesitantly .      you seem surprised      said mycelium .     i take it  then  you   ve only met members of our elder families .  names like cloud and sunshine and starlight all astronomical .         i must admit      began seldon .      well  meet one of the lower classes .  we take our names from the ground and from the micro organisms we grow .  perfectly respectable .         i   m quite certain      said seldon     and thank you again for helping me with my  .   .   .  problem in the gravi bus .         listen      said mycelium seventy two     i saved you a lot of trouble .  if a sister had seen you before i did  she would undoubtedly have screamed and the nearest brothers would have bustled you off the bus maybe not even waiting for it to stop moving .      dors leaned forward so as to see across seldon .     how is it you did not act in this way yourself .         i .  i have no animosity against tribespeople .  i   m a scholar .         a scholar .         first one in my cohort .  i studied at the sacratorium school and did very well .  i   m learned in all the ancient arts and i have a license to enter the tribal library  where they keep book films and books by tribespeople .  i can view any book film or read any book i wish to .  we even have a computerized reference library and i can handle that too .  that sort of thing broadens your mind .  i don   t mind a little hair showing .  i   ve seen pictures of men with hair many a time .  and women too .     he glanced quickly at dors .   they ate in silence for a while and then seldon said     i notice that every brother who enters or leaves the sacratorium is wearing a red sash .         oh yes      said mycelium seventy two .     over the left shoulder and around the right side of the waist usually very fancily embroidered .         why is that .         it   s called an    obiah .     it symbolizes the joy felt at entering the sacratorium and the blood one would spill to preserve it .         blood .     said dors  frowning .      just a symbol .  i never actually heard of anyone spilling blood over the sacratorium .  for that matter  there isn   t that much joy .  it   s mostly wailing and mourning and prostrating one   s self over the lost world .     his voice dropped and became soft .     very silly .      dors said     you   re not a  .   .   .  a believer .         i   m a scholar      said mycelium with obvious pride .  his face wrinkled as he grinned and took on an even more pronounced appearance of age .  seldon found himself wondering how old the man was .  several centuries .   no  they   d disposed of that .  it couldn   t be and yet     how old are you .     seldon asked suddenly  involuntarily .   mycelium seventy two showed no signs of taking offense at the question  nor did he display any hesitation at answering     sixtyseven .      seldon had to know .     i was told that your people believe that in very early times everyone lived for several centuries .      mycelium seventy two looked at seldon quizzically .     now how did you find that out .  someone must have been talking out of turn  .  .  .  but its true .  there is that belief .  only the unsophisticated believe it  but the elders encourage it because it shows our superiority .  actually  our life expectancy is higher than elsewhere because we eat more nutritionally  but living even one century is rare .         i take it you don   t consider mycogenians superior      said seldon .   mycelium seventy two said     there   s nothing wrong with mycogenians .  they   re certainly not inferior .  still  i think that all men are equal .   even women      he added  looking across at dors .      i don   t suppose      said seldon     that many of your people would agree with that .         or many of your people      said mycelium seventy two with a faint resentment .     i believe it  though .  a scholar has to .  i   ve viewed and even read all the great literature of the tribespeople .  i understand your culture .  i   ve written articles on it .  i can sit here just as comfortably with you as though you were  .   .   .  tit .       dors said a little sharply     you sound proud of understanding tribespeople   s ways .  have you ever traveled outside mycogen .      mycelium seventy two seemed to move away a little .     no .         why not .  you would get to know us better .         i wouldn   t feel right .  i   d have to wear a wig .  i   d be ashamed .      dors said     why a wig .  you could stay bald .         no      said mycelium seventy two     i wouldn   t be that kind of fool .  i   d be mistreated by all the hairy ones .         mistreated .  why .     said dors .     we have a great many naturally bald people everywhere on trantor and on every other world too .         my father is quite bald      said seldon with a sigh     and i presume that in the decades to come i will be bald too .  my hair isn   t all that thick now .         that   s not bald      said mycelium seventy two .     you keep hair around the edges and over your eyes .  i mean bald no hair at all .         anywhere on your body .     said dors  interested .   and now mycelium seventy two looked offended and said nothing .   seldon  anxious to get the conversation back on track  said     tell me  mycelium seventy two  can tribespeople enter the sacratorium as spectators .      mycelium seventy two shook his head vigorously .     never .  it   s for the sons of the dawn only .      dors said     only the sons .      mycelium seventy two looked shocked for a moment  then said forgivingly     well  you   re tribespeople .  daughters of the dawn enter only on certain days and times .  that   s just the way it is .  i don   t say i approve .  if it was up to me  i   d say     go in .  enjoy if you can .     sooner others than me  in fact .         don   t you ever go in .         when i was young  my parents took me  but  he shook his head     it was just people staring at the book and reading from it and sighing and weeping for the old days .  it   s very depressing .  you can   t talk to each other .  you can   t laugh .  you can   t even look at each other .  your mind has to be totally on the lost world .  totally .     he waved a hand in rejection .     not for me .  i   m a scholar and i want the whole world open to me .         good      said seldon  seeing an opening .     we feel that way too .  we are scholars also  dors and myself .         i know      said mycelium seventy two .      you know .  how do you know .         you   d have to be .  the only tribespeople allowed in mycogen are imperial officials and diplomats  important traders  and scholars   and to me you have the look of scholars .  that   s what interested me in you .  scholars together .     he smiled delightedly .      so we are .  i am a mathematician .  dors is a historian .  and you .         i specialize in  .   .   .  culture .  i   ve read all the great works of literature of the tribespeople  lissauer  mentone  novigor          and we have read the great works of your people .  i   ve read the book  for instance .   about the lost world .      mycelium seventy two   s eyes opened wide in surprise .  his olive complexion seemed to fade a little .     you have .  how .  where .         at our university we have copies that we can read if we have permission .         copies of the book .         yes .         i wonder if the elders know this .      seldon said     and i   ve read about robots .         robots .         yes .  that is why i would like to be able to enter the sacratorium .  i would like to see the robot .      dors kicked lightly at seldon   s ankle  but he ignored her .    mycelium seventy two said uneasily     i don   t believe in such things .  scholarly people don   t .     but he looked about as though he was afraid of being overheard .   seldon said     i   ve read that a robot still exists in the sacratorium .      mycelium seventy two said     i don   t want to talk about such nonsense .      seldon persisted .     where would it be if it was in the sacratorium .         even if one was there  i couldn   t tell you .  i haven   t been in there since i was a child .         would you know if there was a special place  a hidden place .         there   s the elders    aerie .  only elders go there  but there   s nothing there .         have you ever been there .         no  of course not .         then how do you know .         i don   t know that there   s no pomegranate tree there .  i don   t know that there   s no laser organ there .  i don   t know that there   s no item of a million different kinds there .  does my lack of knowledge of their absence show they are all present .      for the moment  seldon had nothing to say .   a ghost of a smile broke through mycelium seventy two   s look of concern .  he said     that   s scholars    reasoning .  i   m not an easy man to tackle  you see .  just the same  i wouldn   t advise you to try to get up into the elders    aerie .  i don   t think you   d like what would happen if they found a tribesman inside .   well .  best of the dawn to you .     and he rose suddenly without warning  and hurried away .   seldon looked after him  rather surprised .     what made him rush off like that .         i think      said dors     it   s because someone is approaching .      and someone was .  a tall man in an elaborate white kirtle  crossed by an even more elaborate and subtly glittering red sash  glided solemnly toward them .  he had the unmistakable look of a man with authority and the even more unmistakable look of one who is not pleased .        .     hari seldon rose as the new mycogenian approached .  he hadn   t the slightest idea whether that was the appropriate polite behavior  but he had the distinct feeling it would do no harm .  dors venabili rose with him and carefully kept her eyes lowered .   the other stood before them .  he too was an old man  but more subtly aged than mycelium seventy two .  age seemed to lend distinction to his still handsome face .  his bald head was beautifully round and his eyes were a startling blue  contrasting sharply with the bright all  but glowing red of his sash .   the newcomer said     i see you are tribespeople .     his voice was more high pitched than seldon had expected  but he spoke slowly  as though conscious of the weight of authority in every word he uttered .      so we are      said seldon politely but firmly .  he saw no reason not to defer to the other   s position  but he did not intend to abandon his own .      your names .         i am hari seldon of helicon .  my companion is dors venabili of cinna .  and yours  man of mycogen .      the eyes narrowed in displeasure  but he too could recognize an air of authority when he felt it .      i am skystrip two      he said  lifting his head higher     an elder of the sacratorium .  and your position  tribesman .         we      said seldon  emphasizing the pronoun     are scholars of streeling university .  i am a mathematician and my companion is a historian and we are here to study the ways of mycogen .         by whose authority .         by that of sunmaster fourteen  who greeted us on our arrival .      skystrip two fell silent for a moment and then a small smile appeared on his face and he took on an air that was almost benign .  he said     the high elder .  i know him well .         and so you should      said seldon blandly .     is there anything else  elder .         yes .     the elder strove to regain the high ground .     who was the man who was with you and who hurried away when i approached .      seldon shook his head     we never saw him before  elder  and know nothing about him .  we encountered him purely by accident and asked about the sacratorium .         what did you ask him .         two questions  elder .  we asked if that building was the sacratorium and if tribespeople were allowed to enter it .  he answered in the affirmative to the first question and in the negative to the second .         quite so .  and what is your interest in the sacratorium .         sir  we are here to study the ways of mycogen and is not the sacratorium the heart and brain of mycogen .         it is entirely ours and reserved for us .         even if an elder the high elder would arrange for permission in view of our scholarly function .         have you indeed the high elder   s permission .      seldon hesitated the slightest moment while dors   s eyes lifted briefly to look at him sideways .  he decided he could not carry off a lie of this magnitude .     no      he said     not yet .         or ever      said the elder .     you are here in mycogen by authority  but even the highest authority cannot exert total control over the public .  we value our sacratorium and the populace can easily grow excited over the presence of a tribesperson anywhere in mycogen but  most particularly  in the vicinity of the sacratorium .  it would take one excitable person to raise a cry of    invasion .     and a peaceful crowd such as this one would be turned into one that would be thirsting to tear you apart .  i mean that quite literally .  for your own good  even if the high elder has shown you kindness  leave .  now .         but the sacratorium      said seldon stubbornly  though dors was pulling gently at his kirtle .      what is there in the sacratorium that can possibly interest you .     said the elder .     you see it now .  there is nothing for you to see in the interior .         there is the robot      said seldon .   the elder stared at seldon in shocked surprise and then  bending to bring his lips close to seldon   s ear  whispered harshly     leave now or i will raise the cry of    invasion .     myself .  nor  were it not for the high elder  would i give you even this one chance to leave .      and dors  with surprising strength  nearly pulled seldon off his feet as she stepped hastily away  dragging him along until he caught his balance and stepped quickly after her .           it was over breakfast the next morning  not sooner  that dors took up the subject   and in a way that seldon found most wounding .   she said     well  that was a pretty fiasco yesterday .      seldon  who had honestly thought he had gotten away with it without comment  looked sullen .     what made it a fiasco .         driven out is what we were .  and for what .  what did we gain .         only the knowledge that there is a robot in there .         mycelium seventy two said there wasn   t .         of course he said that .  he   s a scholar  or thinks he is end what he doesn   t know about the sacratorium would probably fill that library he goes to .  you saw the elder   s reaction .         i certainly did .         he would not have reacted like that if there was no robot inside .  he was horrified we knew .         that   s just your guess  hari .  and even if there was  we couldn   t get in .         we could certainly try .  after breakfast  we go out and buy a sash for me  one of those obiahs .  i put it on  keep my eyes devoutly downward  and walk right in .         skincap and all .  they   ll spot you in a microsecond .         no  they won   t .  we   ll go into the library where all the tribespeople data is kept .  i   d like to see it anyway .  from the library  which is a sacratorium annex  i gather  there will probably be an entrance into the sacratorium     where you will be picked up at once .         not at all .  you heard what mycelium seventy two had to say .  everyone keeps his eyes down and meditates on their great lost world  aurora .  no one looks at anyone else .  it would probably be a grievous breach of discipline to do so .  then i   ll find the elders    aerie          just like that .         at one point  mycelium seventy two said he would advise me not to try to get up into the elders    aerie .  up .  it must be somewhere in that tower of the sacratorium  the central tower .      dors shook her head .     i don   t recall the man   s exact words and i don   t think you do either .  that   s a terribly weak foundation to wait .     she stopped suddenly and frowned .      well .     said seldon .      there is an archaic word    aerie    that means    a dwelling place on high .             ah .  there you are .  you see  we   ve learned some vital things as the result of what you tall a fiasco .  and if i can find a living robot that   s twenty thousand years old and if it can tell me      suppose that such a thing exists  which passes belief  and that you find it  which is not very likely  how long do you think you will be able to talk to it before your presence is discovered .         i don   t know  but if i can prove it exists and if i can find it  then i   ll think of some way to talk to it .  it   s too late for me to back out now under any circumstances .  hummin should have left me alone when i thought there was no way of achieving psychohistory .  now that it seems there may be  i won   t let anything stop me   short of being killed .         the mycogenians may oblige  hari  and you can   t run that risk .         yes  i can .  i   m going to try .         no  hari .  i must look after you and i can   t let you .         you must let me .  finding a way to work out psychohistory is more important than my safety .  my safety is only important because i may work out psychohistory .  prevent me from doing so and your task loses its meaning .   think about it .      hari felt himself infused with a renewed sense of purpose .  psychohistory his nebulous theory that he had  such a short while ago  despaired ever of proving loomed larger  more real .  now he had to believe that it was possible  he could feel it in his gut .  the pieces seemed to be falling together and although he couldn   t see the whole pattern yet  he was sure the sacratorium would yield another piece to the puzzle .      then i   ll go in with you so i can pull you out  you idiot  when the time comes .         women can   t enter .         what makes me a woman .  only this gray kirtle .  you can   t see my breasts under it .  i don   t have a woman   s style hairdo with the skincap on .  i have the same washed  unmarked face a man has .  the men here don   t have stubble .  all i need is a white kirtle and a sash and i can enter .  any sister could do it if she wasn   t held back by a taboo .  i am not held back by one .         you   re held back by me .  i won   t let you .  it   s too dangerous .         no more dangerous for me than for you .         but i must take the risk .         then so must i .  why is your imperative greater than mine .         because      seldon paused in thought .      just tell yourself this      said dors  her voice hard as rock .     i won   t let you go there without me .  if you try  i will knock you unconscious and tie you up .  if you don   t like that  then give up any thought of going alone .      seldon hesitated and muttered darkly .  he gave up the argument  at least for now .        .     the sky was almost cloudless  but it was a pale blue  as though wrapped in a high thin mist .  that  thought seldon  was a good touch  but suddenly he missed the sun itself .  no one on trantor saw the planet   s sun unless he or she went upperside and even then only when the natural cloud layer broke .   did native trantorians miss the sun .  did they give it any thought .  when one of them visited another world where a natural sun was in view  did he or she stare  half blinded  at it with awe .   why  he wondered  did so many people spend their lives not trying to find answers to questions not even thinking of questions to begin with .  was there anything more exciting in life than seeking answers .   his glance shifted to ground level .  the wide roadway was lined with low buildings  most of them shops .  numerous individual ground cars moved in both directions  each hugging the right side .  they seemed like a collection of antiques  but they were electrically driven and quite soundless .  seldon wondered if    antique    was always a word to sneer at .  could it be that silence made up for slowness .  was there any particular hurry to life  after all .   there were a number of children on the walkways and seldon   s lips pressed together in annoyance .  clearly  an extended life span for the mycogenians was impossible unless they were willing to indulge in infanticide .  the children of both sexes  though it was hard to tell the boys from the girls  wore kirtles that came only a few inches below the knee  making the wild activity of childhood easier .   the children also still had hair  reduced to an inch in length at most  but even so the older ones among them had hoods attached to their kirtles and wore them raised  hiding the top of the head altogether .  it was as though they were getting old enough to make the hair seem a trifle obscene   or old enough to be wishing to hide it  in longing for the day of rite of passage when they were depilated .   a thought occurred to seldon .  he said     dors  when you   ve been out shopping  who paid  you or the raindrop women .         i did of course .  the raindrops never produced a credit tile .  but why should they .  what was being bought was for us  not for them .         but you have a trantorian credit tile a tribeswoman credit tile .         of course  hari  but there was no problem .  the people of mycogen may keep their own culture and ways of thought and habits of life as they wish .  they can destroy their cephalic hair and wear kirtles .  nevertheless  they must use the world   s credits .  if they don   t  that would choke off commerce and no sensible person would want to do that .  the credits nerve  hari .     she held up her hand as though she was holding an invisible credit tile .      and they accepted your credit tile .         never a peep out of them .  and never a word about my skincap .  credits sanitize everything .         well  that   s good .  so i can buy          no  i   ll do the buying .  credits may sanitize everything  but they more easily sanitize a tribeswoman .  they   re so used to paying women little or no attention that they automatically pay me the same .    and here   s the clothing store i   ve been using .         i   ll wait out here .  get me a nice red sash one that looks impressive .         don   t pretend you   ve forgotten our decision .  i   ll get two .  and another white kirtle also  .   .   .  to my measurements .         won   t they think it odd that a woman would be buying a white kirtle .         of course not .  they   ll assume i   m buying it for a male companion who happens to be my size .  actually  i don   t think they   ll bother with any assumptions at all as long as my credit tile is good .      seldon waited  half expecting someone to come up and greet him as a tribesman or denounce him as one more likely  but no one did .  those who passed him did so without a glance and even those who glanced in his direction moved on seemingly untouched .  he was especially nervous about the gray kirtles    the women walking by in pairs or  even worse  with a man .  they were downtrodden  unnoticed  snubbed .  how better to gain a brief notoriety than by shrieking at the sight of a tribesman .  but even the women moved on .   they   re not expecting to see a tribesman  seldon thought  so they don   t see one .   that  he decided  augured well for their forthcoming invasion of the sacratorium .  how much less would anyone expect to see tribespeople there and how much more effectively would they therefore fail to see them .   he was in fairly good humor when dors emerged .      you have everything .         absolutely .         then lets go back to the room  so you can change .      the white kirtle did not fit her quite as well as the gray one did .  obviously  she could not have tried it on or even the densest shopkeeper would have been struck with alarm .      how do i look  hari .     she asked .      exactly like a boy      said seldon .     now let   s try the sash  .   .   .  or obiah .  i had better get used to calling it that .      dors  without her skincap  was shaking out her hair gratefully .  she said sharply     don   t put it on now .  we   re not going to parade through mycogen with the sash on .  the last thing we want to do is call attention to ourselves .         no no .  i just want to see how it goes on .         well  not that one .  this one is better quality and more elaborate .         you   re right  dors .  i   ve got to gather in what attention there is .  i don   t want them to detect you as a woman .         i   m not thinking of that  hari .  i just want you to look pretty .         a thousand thanks  but that   s impossible  i suspect .  now  let   s see  how does this work .      together  hari and dors practiced putting their obiahs on and taking them off  over and over again  until they could do it in one fluid motion .  dors taught hari how to do it  as she had seen a man doing it the day before at the sacratorium .   when hari praised her for her acute observations  she blushed and said     its really nothing  hari  just something i noticed .      hari replied     then you   re a genius for noticing .      finally satisfied  they stood well apart  each surveying the other .  hari   s obiah glittered  a bright red dragonlike design standing out against a paler field of similar hue .  dors   s was a little less bold  had a simple thin line down the center  and was very light in color .     there      she said     just enough to show good taste .     she took it off .      now      said seldon     we fold it up and it goes into one of the inner pockets .  i have my credit tile hummin   s  really  and the key to this place in this one and here  on the other side  the book .         the book .  should you be carrying it around .         i must .  i   m guessing that anyone going to the sacratorium ought to have a copy of the book with him .  they may intone passages or have readings .  if necessary  we   ll share the book and maybe no one will notice .  ready .         i   ll never be ready  but i   m going with you .         it will be a tedious trip .  will you check my skincap and make sure no hair shows this time .  and don   t scratch your head .         i won   t .  you look all right .         so do you .         you also look nervous .      and seldon said wryly     guess why .      dors reached out impulsively and squeezed hari   s hand  then drew back as if surprised at herself .  looking down  she straightened her white kirtle .  hari  himself a trifle surprised and peculiarly pleased  cleared his throat and said     okay  let   s go .        aerie    robot   .   .   .  a term used in the ancient legends of several worlds for what are more usually called    automata .     robots are described as generally human in shape and made of metal  although some are supposed to have been pseudoorganic in nature .  hari seldon  in the course of the flight  is popularly supposed to have seen an actual robot  but that story is of dubious origin .  nowhere in seldon   s voluminous writings does he mention robots at all  although  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       .     they were not noticed .   hari seldon and dors venabili repeated the trip of the day before and this time no one gave them a second look .  hardly anyone even gave them a first look .  on several occasions  they had to tuck their knees to one side to allow someone sitting on an inner seat to get past them and out .  when someone got in  they quickly realized they had to move over if there was an inner empty seat .   this time they quickly grew tired of the smell of kitties that were not freshly laundered because they were not so easily diverted by what went on outside .   but eventually they were there .      that   s the library      said seldon in a low voice .      i suppose so      said dors .     at least that   s the building that mycelium seventytwo pointed out yesterday .      they sauntered toward it leisurely .      take a deep breath      said seldon .     this is the first hurdle .      the door ahead was open  the light within subdued .  there were five broad stone steps leading upward .  they stepped onto the lowermost one and waited several moments before they realized that their weight did not cause the steps to move upward .  dors grimaced very slightly and gestured seldon upward .   together they walked up the stairs  feeling embarrassed on behalf of mycogen for its backwardness .  then  through a door  where  at a desk immediately inside was a man bent over the simplest and clumsiest computer seldon had ever seen .   the man did not look up at them .  no need  seldon supposed .  white kirtle  bald head all mycogenians looked so nearly the same that one   s eyes slid off them and that was to the tribespeople   s advantage at the moment .   the man  who still seemed to be studying something on the desk  said     scholars .         scholars      said seldon .   the man jerked his head toward a door .     go in .  enjoy .      they moved inward and  as nearly as they could see  they were the only ones in this section of the library .  either the library was not a popular resort or the scholars were few or most likely both .   seldon whispered     i thought surely we would have to present some sort of license or permission form and i would have to plead having forgotten it .         he probably welcomes our presence under any terms .  did you ever see a place like this .  if a place  like a person  could be dead  we would be inside a corpse .      most of the books in this section were print books like the book in seldon   s inner pocket .  dors drifted along the shelves  studying them .  she said     old books  for the most part .  part classic .  part worthless .         outside books .  non mycogen  i mean .         oh yes .  if they have their own books  they must be kept in another section .  this one is for outside research for poor little selfstyled scholars like yesterday   s .   this is the reference department and here   s an imperial encyclopedia  .   .   .  must be fifty years old if a day  .   .   .  and a computer .      she reached for the keys and seldon stopped her .     wait .  something could go wrong and we   ll be delayed .      he pointed to a discreet sign above a free standing set of shelves that glowed with the letters to the sacratorium .  the second a in sacratorium was dead  possibly recently or possibly because no one cared .   the empire  thought seldon  was in decay .  all parts of it .  mycogen too .    he looked about .  the poor library  so necessary to mycogenian pride  perhaps so useful to the elders who could use it to find crumbs to shore up their own beliefs and present them as being those of sophisticated tribespeople  seemed to be completely empty .  no one had entered after them .   seldon said     let   s step in here  out of eyeshot of the man at the door  and put on our sashes .      and then  at the door  aware suddenly there would be no turning back if they passed this second hurdle  he said     dors  don   t come in with me .      she frowned .     why not .         it   s not safe and i don   t want you to be at risk .         i am here to protect you      she said with soft firmness .      what kind of protection can you be .  i can protect myself  though you may not think it .  and i   d be handicapped by having to protect you .  don   t you see that .         you mustn   t be concerned about me  hari      said dors .     concern is my part .     she tapped her sash where it crossed in the space between her obscured breasts .      because hummin asked you to .         because those are my orders .      she seized seldon   s arms just above his elbow and  as always  he was surprised by her firm grip .  she said     i   m against this  hari  but if you feel you must go in  then i must go in too .         all right  then .  but if anything happens and you can wriggle out of it  run .  don   t worry about me .         you   re wasting your breath  hari .  and you   re insulting me .      seldon touched the entrance panel and the portal slid open .  together  almost in unison  they walked through .        .     a large room  all the larger because it was empty of anything resembling furniture .  no chairs  no benches  no seats of any kind .  no stage  no drapery  no decorations .   no lights  merely a uniform illumination of mild  unfocused light .  the walls were not entirely blank .  periodically  arranged in spaced fashion at various heights and in no easy repetitive order  there were small  primitive  twodimensional television screens  all of which were operating .  from where dors and seldon stood  there was not even the illusion of a third dimension  not a breath of true holovision .   there were people present .  not many and nowhere together .  they stood singly and  like the television monitors  in no easy repetitive order .  all were white kirtled  all sashed .   for the most part  there was silence .  no one talked in the usual sense .  some moved their lips  murmuring softly .  those who walked did so stealthily  eyes downcast .   the atmosphere was absolutely funereal .   seldon leaned toward dors  who instantly put a finger to her lips  then pointed to one of the television monitors .  the screen showed an idyllic garden bursting with blooms  the camera panning over it slowly .   they walked toward the monitor in a fashion that imitated the others slow steps  putting each foot down softly .   when they were within half a meter of the screen  a soft insinuating voice made itself heard     the garden of antennin  as reproduced from ancient guidebooks and photographs  located in the outskirts of eos .  note the       dors said in a whisper seldon had trouble catching over the sound of the set     it turns on when someone is close and it will turn off if we step away .  if we   re close enough  we can talk under cover  but don   t look at me and stop speaking if anyone approaches .      seldon  his head bent  his hands clasped before him  he had noted that this was a preferred posture   said     any moment i expect someone to start wailing .         someone might .  they   re mourning their lost world      said dors .      i hope they change the films every once in a while .  it would be deadly to always see the same ones .         they   re all different      said dors  her eyes sliding this way and that .     they may change periodically .  i don   t know .         wait .     said seldon just a hair   s breadth too loud .  he lowered his voice and said     come this way .      dors frowned  failing to make out the words  but seldon gestured slightly with his head .  again the stealthy walk  but seldon   s footsteps increased in length as he felt the need for greater speed and dons  catching up  pulled sharply if very briefly at his kirtle he slowed .      robots here      he said under the cover of the sound as it came on .   the picture showed the corner of a dwelling place with a rolling lawn and a line of hedges in the foreground and three of what could only be described as robots .  they were metallic  apparently  and vaguely human in shape .   the recording said     this is a view  recently constructed  of the establishment of the famous wendome estate of the third century .  the robot you see near the center was  according to tradition  named bendar and served twenty two years  according to the ancient records  before being replaced .      dors said        recently constructed      so they must change views .         unless they   ve been saying  recently constructed    for the last thousand years .      another mycogenian stepped into the sound pattern of the scene and said in a low voice  though not as low as the whisperings of seldon and dors     greetings  brothers .      he did not look at seldon and dons as he spoke and after one involuntary and startled glance  seldon kept his head averted .  dors had ignored it all .   seldon hesitated .  mycelium seventy two had said that there was no talking in the sacratorium .  perhaps he had exaggerated .  then too he had not been in the sacratorium since he was a child .   desperately  seldon decided he must speak .  he said in a whisper     and to you  brother  greetings .      he had no idea whether that was the correct formula of reply or if there was a formula  but the mycogenian seemed to find nothing amiss in it .      to you in aurora      he said .      and to you      said seldon and because it seemed to him that the other expected more  he added     in aurora      and there was an impalpable release of tension .  seldon felt his forehead growing moist .   the mycogenian said     beautiful .  i haven   t seen this before .         skillfully done      said seldon .  then  in a burst of daring  he added     a loss never to be forgotten .      the other seemed startled  then said     indeed  indeed      and moved away .   dors hissed     take no chances .  don   t say what you don   t have to .         it seemed natural .  anyway  this it recent .  but those are disappointing robots .  they are what i would expect automata to be .  i want to see the organic ones the humanoids .         if they existed      said dors with some hesitation     it seems to me they wouldn   t be used for gardening jobs .         true      said seldon .     we must find the elders    aerie .         if that exists .  it seems to me there is nothing in this hollow cave but a hollow cave .         let   s look .      they paced along the wall  passing from screen to screen  trying to wait at each for irregular intervals until dors clutched seldon   s arms .  between two screens were lines marking out a faint rectangle .      a door      dors said .  then she weakened the assertion by adding     do you think .      seldon looked about surreptitiously .  it was in the highest degree convenient that  in keeping with the mourning atmosphere  every face  when not fixed on a television monitor  was bent in sad concentration on the floor .   seldon said     how do you suppose it would open .         an entrance patch .         i can   t make out any .         it   s just not marked out  but there   s a slight discoloration there .  do you see it .  how many palms .  how many times .         i   ll try .  keep an eye out and kick me if anyone looks in this direction .      he held his breath casually  touched the discolored spot to no avail  and then placed his palm full upon it and pressed .   the door opened silently not a creak  not a scrape .  seldon stepped through as rapidly as he could and dors followed him .  the door closed behind them .      the question is      said dors     did anyone see us .      seldon said     elders must go through this door frequently .         yes  but will anyone think we are elders .      seldon waited  then said     if we were observed and if anyone thought something was wrong  this door would have been flung open again within fifteen seconds of our entering .         possibly      said dors dryly     or possibly there is nothing to be seen or done on this side of the door and no one cares if we enter .         that remains to be seen      muttered seldon .   the rather narrow room they had entered was somewhat dark  but as they stepped farther into it  the light brightened .   there were chairs  wide and comfortable  small tables  several davenports  a deep and tall refrigerator  cupboards .      if this is the elders    aerie      said seldon     the elders seem to do themselves comfortably  despite the austerity of the sacratorium itself .         as would be expected      said dors .     asceticism among a ruling class except for public show is very rare .  put that down in your notebook for psychohistorical aphorisms .     she looked about .     and there is no robot .      seldon said     a aerie is a high position  remember  and this ceiling is not .  there must be upper storeys and that must be the way .     he pointed to a well carpeted stairway .   he did not advance toward it  however  but looked about vaguely .   dors guessed what he was seeking .  she said     forget about elevators .  there   s a cult of primitivism in mycogen .  surely  you haven   t forgotten that  have you .  there would be no elevators and  what   s more  if we place our weight at the foot of the stairs  i am quite certain it will not begin moving upward .  we   re going to have to climb it .  several flights  perhaps .         climb it .         it must  in the nature of things  lead to the aerie if it leads anywhere .  do you want to see the aerie or don   t you .      together they stepped toward the staircase and began the climb .   they went up three flights and  as they did  the light level decreased perceptibly and in steady increments .  seldon took a deep breath and whispered     i consider myself to be in pretty good shape  but i hate this .         you   re not used to this precise type of physical exertion .     she showed no signs of physical distress whatever .   at the top of the third flight the stairs ended and before them was another door .      and if it   s locked .     said seldon  more to himself than to dors .     do we try to break it down .      but dors said     why should it be locked when the lower door was nor .  if this is the elders    aerie  i imagine there   s a taboo on anyone but elders coming here and a taboo is much stronger than any lock .         as far as those who accept the taboo are concerned      said seldon  but he made no move toward the door .      there   s still time to turn back  since you hesitate      said dors .     in fact  i would advise you to rum back .         i only hesitate because i don   t know what we   ll find inside .  if it   s empty       and then he added in a rather louder voice     then it   s empty      and he strode forward and pushed against the entry panel .   the door retracted with silent speed and seldon took a step back at the surprising flood of light from within .   and there  facing him  eyes alive with light  arms half upraised  one foot slightly advanced before the other  gleaming with a faintly yellow metallic shine  was a human figure .  for a few moments  it seemed to be wearing a tight fitting tunic  but on closer inspection it became apparent that the tunic was part of the structure of the object .      it   s the robot      said seldon in awe     but it   s metallic .         worse than that      said dors  who had stepped quickly to one side and then to the other .     its eyes don   t follow me .  its arms don   t as much as tremble .  it   s not alive if one can speak of robots as being alive .      and a man unmistakably a man stepped out from behind the robot and said     perhaps not .  but i am alive .      and almost automatically  dors stepped forward and took her place between seldon and the man who had suddenly appeared .        .     seldon pushed dors to one side  perhaps a shade more roughly than he intended .     i don   t need protection .  this is our old friend sunmaster fourteen .      the man who faced them  wearing a double sash that was perhaps his right as high elder  said     and you are tribesman seldon .         of course      said seldon .      and this  despite her masculine dress  is tribeswoman venabili .      dors said nothing .   sunmaster fourteen said     you are right  of course  tribesman .  you are in no danger of physical harm from me .  please sit down .  both of you .  since you are not a sister  tribeswoman  you need not retire .  there is a seat for you which  if you value such a distinction  you will be the first woman ever to have used .         i do not value such a distinction      said dors  spacing her words for emphasis .   sunmaster fourteen nodded .     that is as you wish .  i too will sit down  for i must ask you questions and i do not care to do it standing .      they were sitting now in a corner of the room .  seldon   s eyes wandered to the metal robot .   sunmaster fourteen said     it if a robot .         i know      said seldon briefly .      i know you do      said sunmaster fourteen with similar curtness .     but now that we have settled that matter  why are you here .      seldon gazed steadily at sunmaster fourteen and said     to see the robot .         do you know that no one but an elder is allowed in the aerie .          i did not know that  but i suspected it .         do you know that no tribesperson is allowed in the sacratorium .         i was told that .         and you ignored the fact  is that it .         as i said  we wanted to see the robot .         do you know that no woman  even a sister  is allowed in the sacratorium except at certain stated  and rare occasions .         i was told that .         and do you know that no woman is at any time  or for any reason allowed to dress in masculine garb .  that holds  within the borders of mycogen  for tribeswomen as well as for sisters .         i was not told that  but i am not surprised .         good .  i want you to understand all this .  now  why did you want to see the robot .      seldon said with a shrug     curiosity .  i had never seen a robot or even known that such a thing existed .         and how did you come to know that it did exist and  specifically  that it existed here .      seldon was silent  then said     i do not wish to answer that question .         is that why you were brought to mycogen by tribesman hummin .  to investigate robots .         no .  tribesman hummin brought us here that we might be secure .  however  we are scholars  dr .  venabili and i .  knowledge is our province and to gain knowledge is our purpose .  mycogen is little understood outside its borders and we wish to know more about your ways and your methods of thought .  it is a natural desire and  it seems to us  a harmless even praiseworthy one .         ah  but we do not wish the outer tribes and worlds to know about us .  that is our natural desire and we are the judge of what is harmless to us and what harmful .  so i ask you again  tribesman   how did you know that a robot existed in mycogen and that it existed in this room .         general rumor      said seldon at length .      do you insist on that .         general rumor .  i insist on it .      sunmaster fourteen   s keen blue eyes seemed to sharpen and he said without raising his voice     tribesman seldon  we have long cooperated with tribesman hummin .  for a tribesman  he has seemed a decent and trustworthy individual .  for a tribesman .  when he brought you two to us and commended you to our protection  we granted it .  but tribesman hummin  whatever his virtues  is still a tribesman and we had misgivings .  we were not at all sure what your   or his real purpose might be .         our purpose was knowledge      said seldon .     academic knowledge .  tribeswoman venabili is a historian and i too have an interest in history .  why should we not be interested in mycogenian history .         for one thing  because we do not wish you to be .   in any case  two of our trusted sisters were sent to you .  they were to cooperate with you  try to find out what it was you wanted  and what is the expression you tribesmen use .  play along with you .  yet not in such a way that you would be too aware as to what was happening .     sunmaster fourteen smiled  but it was a grim smile .      raindrop forty five      sunmaster fourteen went on     went shopping with tribeswoman venabili  but there seemed nothing out of the way in what happened on those trips .  naturally  we had a full report .  raindrop forty three showed you  tribesman seldon  our microfarms .  you might have been suspicious of her willingness to accompany you alone  something that is utterly out of the question for us  but you reasoned that what applied to brothers did not apply to tribesmen and you flattered yourself that that flimsy bit of reasoning won her over .  she complied with your desire  though at considerable cost to her peace of mind .  and  eventually  you asked for the book .  to have handed it over too easily might have roused your suspicion  so she pretended to a perverse desire only you could satisfy .  her self sacrifice will not be forgotten .   i take it  tribesman  you still have the book and i suspect you have it with you now .  may i have it .      seldon sat in bitter silence .   sunmaster fourteen   s wrinkled hand remained obtrusively outstretched and he said     how much better it would be than to wrest it from you by force .      and seldon handed it over .  sunmaster fourteen leafed through its pages briefly  as though to reassure himself it was unharmed .   he said with a small sigh     it will have to be carefully destroyed in the approved manner .  sad    .    but once you had this book  we were  of course  not surprised when you made your way out to the sacratorium .  you were watched at all times  for you cannot think that any brother or sister  not totally absorbed  would not recognize you for tribespeople at a glance .  we know a skincap when we see one and there are less than seventy of them in mycogen  .   .   .  almost all belonging to tribesmen on official business who remain entirely in secular governmental buildings during the time they are here .  so you were not only seen but unmistakably identified  over and over .      the elderly brother who met you was careful to tell you about the library as well as about the sacratorium  but he was also careful to tell you what you were forbidden to do  for we did not wish to entrap you .  skystrip two also warned you  .   .   .  and quite forcibly .  nevertheless  you did not turn away .      the shop at which you bought the white kirtle and the two sashes informed us at once and from that we knew well what you intended .  the library was kept empty  the librarian was warned to keep his eyes to himself  the sacratorium was kept under utilized .  the one brother who inadvertently spoke to you almost gave it away  but hastened off when he realized with whom he was dealing .  and then you came up here .      you see  then  that it was your intention to come up here and that we in no way lured you here .  you came as a result of your own action  your own desire  and what i want to ask you yet once again is  why .      it was dors who answered this time  her voice firm  her eyes hard .     we will tell you yet once again  mycogenian .  we are scholars  who consider knowledge sacred and it is only knowledge that we seek .  you did not lure us here  but you did not stop us either  as you might have done before ever we approached this building .  you smoothed our way and made it easy for us and even that might be considered a lure .  and what harm have we done .  we have in no way disturbed the building  or this room  or you  or that .      she pointed to the robot .     it is a dead lump of metal that you hide here and we now know that it is dead and that is all the knowledge we sought .  we thought it would be more significant and we are disappointed  but now that we know it is merely what it is  we will leave and  if you wish  we will leave mycogen as well .      sunmaster fourteen listened with no trace of expression on his face  but when she was done  he addressed seldon  saying     this robot  as you see it  is a symbol  a symbol of all we have lost and of all we no longer have  of all that  through thousands of years  we have not forgotten and what we intend someday to return to .  because it is all that remains to us that is both material and authentic  it is dear to us yet to your woman it is only    a dead lump of metal .     do you associate yourself with that judgment  tribesman seldon .      seldon said     we are members of societies that do not tie ourselves to a past that is thousands of years old  making no contact at all with what has existed between that past and ourselves .  we live in the present  which we recognize as the product of al .  the past and not of one long gone moment of time that we hug to our chests .  we realize  intellectually  what the robot may mean to you and we are willing to let it continue to mean that to you .  but we can only see it with our own eyes  as you can only see it with yours .  to us  it is a dead lump of metal .         and now      said dors     we will leave .         you will not      said sunmaster fourteen .     by coming here  you have committed a crime .  it is a crime only in our eyes  as you will hasten to point out    his lips curved in a wintry smile    but this is our territory and  within it  we make the definitions .  and this crime  as we define it  is punishable by death .         and you are going to shoot us down .     said dors haughtily .   sunmaster fourteen   s expression was one of contempt and he continued to speak only to seldon .     what do you think we are  tribesman seldon .  our culture is as old as yours  as complex  as civilized  as humane .  i am not armed .  you will be tried and  since you are manifestly guilty  executed according to law  quickly and painlessly .      if you were to try to leave now  i would not stop you  but there are many brothers below  many more than there appeared to be when you entered the sacratorium and  in their rage at your action  they may lay rough and forceful hands on you .  it has happened in our history that tribespeople have even died so and it is not a pleasant death certainly not a painless one .         we were warned of this      said dors     by skystrip two .  so much for your complex  civilized  and humane culture .         people can be moved to violence at moments of emotion  tribesman seldon      said sunmaster fourteen calmly     whatever their humanity in moments of calm .  this is true in every culture  as your woman  who is said to be a historian  must surely know .      seldon said     let us remain reasonable  sunmaster fourteen .  you may be the law in mycogen over local affairs  but you are not the law over us and you know it .  we are both non mycogenian citizens of the empire and it is the emperor and his designated legal officers who must remain in charge of any capital offense .      sunmaster fourteen said     that may be so in statutes and on papers and on holovision screens  but we are not talking theory now .  the high elder has long had the power to punish crimes of sacrilege without interference from the imperial throne .         if the criminals are your own people      said seldom    it would be quite different if they were outsiders .         i doubt it in this case .  tribesman hummin brought you here as fugitives and we are not so yeast headed in mycogen that we don   t strongly suspect that you are fugitives from the emperor   s laws .  why should he object if we do his work for him .         because      said seldon     he would .  even if we were fugitives from the imperial authorities and even if he wanted us only to punish us  he would still want us .  to allow you to kill  by whatever means and for whatever reason  non mycogenians without due imperial process would be to defy his authority and no emperor could allow such a precedent .  no matter how eager he might be to see that the microfood trade not be interrupted  he would still feel it necessary to re establish the imperial prerogative .  do you wish  in your eagerness to kill us  to hove a division of imperial soldiery loot your farms and your dwellings  desecrate your sacratorium  and take liberties with the sisters  consider .      sunmaster fourteen smiled once again  but displayed no softness .     actually  i have considered and there is an alternative .  after we condemn you  we could delay your execution to allow you to appeal to the emperor for a review of your case .  the emperor might be grateful at this evidence of our ready submission to his authority and grateful too to lay his hands on you two for some reason of his own  and mycogen might profit .  is that what you want  then .  to appeal to the emperor in due course and to be delivered to him .      seldon and dors looked at each other briefly and were silent .   sunmaster fourteen said     i feel you would rather be delivered to the emperor than die  but why do i get the impression that the preference is only by a slight margin .         actually      said a new voice     i think neither alternative is acceptable and that we must search for a third .           .     it was dors who identified the newcomer first  perhaps because it was she who expected him .      hummin      she said     thank goodness you found us .  i got in touch with you the moment i realized i was not going to deflect hari from    she held up her hands in a wide gesture    this .      hummin   s smile was a small one that did not alter the natural gravity of his face .  there was a subtle weariness about him .      my dear      he said     i was engaged in other things .  i cannot always pull away at a moment   s notice .  and when i got here  i had  like you two  to supply myself with a kirde and sash  to say nothing of a skincap  and make my way out here .  had i been here earlier  i might have stopped this  but i believe i   m not too late .      sunmaster fourteen had recovered from what had seemed to be a painful shock .  he said in a voice that lacked its customary severe depth     how did you get in here  tribesman hummin .         it was not easy  high elder  but as tribeswoman venabili likes to say  i am a very persuasive person .  some of the citizens here remember who i was and what i have done for mycogen in the past  that i am even an honorary brother .  have you forgotten  sunmaster fourteen .      the elder replied     i have not forgotten  but even the most favorable memory can not survive certain actions .  a tribesman here and a tribeswoman .  there is no greater crime .  all you have done is not great enough to balance that .  my people are not unmindful .  we will make it up to you some other way .  but these two must die or be handed over to the emperor .         i am also here      said hummin calmly .     is that not a crime as well .         for you      said sunmaster fourteen     for you personally  as a kind of honorary brother  i can  .   .   .  overlook it  .   .   .  once .  not these two .         because you expect a reward from the emperor .  some favor .  some concession .  have you already been in touch with him or with his chief of staff  eto demerzel  more likely .         that is not a subject for discussion .         which is itself an admission .  come on  i don   t ask what the emperor promised  but it cannot be much .  he does not have much to give in these degenerate days .  let me make you an offer .  have these two told you they are scholars .         they have .         and they are .  they are not lying .  the tribeswoman is a historian and the tribesman is a mathematician .  the two together are trying to combine their talents to make a mathematics of history and they call the combined subject    psychohistory .          sunmaster fourteen said     i know nothing about this psychohistory  nor do i care to know .  neither it nor any other facet of your tribal learning interests me .         nevertheless      said hummin     i suggest that you listen to me .      it took hummin some fifteen minutes  speaking concisely  to describe the possibility of organizing the natural laws of society  something he always mentioned with audible quotation marks in the tone of his voice  in such a way as to make it possible to anticipate the future with a substantial degree of probability .   and when he was done  sunmaster fourteen  who had listened expressionlessly  said     a highly unlikely piece of speculation  i should say .      seldon  with a rueful expression  seemed about to speak  undoubtedly to agree  but hummin   s hand  resting lightly on the other   s knee  tightened unmistakably .   hummin said     possibly  high elder  but the emperor doesn   t think so .  and by the emperor  who is himself an amiable enough personage  i really mean demerzel  concerning whose ambitions you need no instruction .  they would like very much to have these two scholars  which is why i   ve brought them here for safekeeping .  i had little expectation that you would do demerzel   s work for him by delivering the scholars to him .         they have committed a crime that          yes  we know  high elder  but it is only a crime because you choose to call it so .  no real harm has been done .         it has been done to our belief  to our deepest felt          but imagine what harm will be done if psychohistory falls into the hands of demerzel .  yes  i grant that nothing may come of it  but suppose for a moment that something does and that the imperial government has the use of it can foretell what is to come can take measures with that foreknowledge which no one else would have can take measures  in fact  designed to bring about an alternate future more to the imperial liking .         well .         is there any doubt  high elder  that the alternate furore more to the imperial liking would be one of tightened centralization .  for centuries now  as you very well know  the empire has been undergoing a steady decentralization .  many worlds now acknowledge only lip service to the emperor and virtually rule themselves .  even here on trantor  there is decentralization .  mycogen  as only one example  is free of imperial interference for the most part .  you rule its high elder and there is no imperial officer at your side overseeing your actions and decisions .  how long do you think that will last with men like demerzel adjusting the furore to their liking .         still the flimsiest of speculation      said sunmaster fourteen     but an disturbing one  i admit .         on the other hand  if these scholars can complete their task  an unlikely if  you might say  but an if then they are sure to remember that you spared them when you might have chosen not to .  and it would then be conceivable that they would learn to arrange a future  for instance  that would allow mycogen to be given a world of its own  a world that could be terraformed into a close replica of the lost world .  and even if these two forget your kindness  i will be here to remind them .         well      said sunmaster fourteen .      come on      said hummin     it is not hard to decide what must be going through your mind .  of all tribespeople  you must trust demerzel the least .  and though the chance of psychohistory might be small  if i was not being honest with you  i would not admit that  it is not zero  and if it will bring about a restoration of the lost world  what can you want more than that .  what would you not risk for even a tiny chance of that .  come now i promise you and my promises are not lightly given .  release these two and choose a tiny chance of your heart   s desire over no chance at all .      there was silence and then sunmaster fourteen sighed .     i don   t know how it is  tribesman hummin  but on every occasion that we meet  you persuade me into something i do not really want to do .         have i ever misled you  high elder .         you have never offered me so small a chance .         and so high a possible reward .  the one balances the other .      and sunmaster fourteen nodded his head .     you are right .  take these two and take them out of mycogen and never let me see them again unless there comes a time when  but surely it will not be in my lifetime .         perhaps not  high elder .  but your people have been waiting patiently for nearly twenty thousand years .  would you then object to waiting another perhaps two hundred .         i would not willingly wait one moment  but my people will wait as long as they must .      and standing up  he said     i will clear the path .  take them and go .            .     they were finally back in a tunnel .  hummin and seldon had traveled through one when they went from the imperial sector to streeling university in the air taxi .  now they were in another tunnel  going from mycogen to  .   .   .  seldon did not know where .  he hesitated to ask .  hummin   s face seemed as if it was carved out of granite and it didn   t welcome conversation .   hummin sat in the front of the four seater  with no one to his right .  seldon and dors shared the backseat .   seldon chanced a smile at dors  who looked glum .     it   s nice to be in real clothes again  isn   t it .         i will never      said dors with enormous sincerity     wear or look at anything that resembles a kirtle .  and i will never  under any circumstances  wear a skincap .  in fact  i   m going to feel odd if i ever see a normally bald man .      and it was dors who finally asked the question that seldon had been reluctant to advance .     chetter      she said rather petulantly     why won   t you tell us where we   re going .      hummin hitched himself into a sideways position and he looked back at dors and seldon gravely .     somewhere      he said     where it may be difficult for you to get into trouble although i   m not sure such a place exists .      dors was at once crestfallen .     actually  chetter  it   s my fault .  at streeling  i let hari go upperside without accompanying him .  in mycogen  i at least accompanied him  but i suppose i ought not to have let him enter the sacratorium at all .         i was determined      said seldon warmly .     it was in no way dors   s fault .      hummin made no effort to apportion blame .  he simply said     i gather you wanted to see the robot .  was there a reason for that .  can you tell me .      seldon could feel himself redden .      i was wrong in that respect  hummin .  i did not see what i expected to see or what i hoped to see .  if i had known the content of the aerie  i would never have bothered going there .  call it a complete fiasco .         but then  seldon  what was it you hoped to see .  please tell me .   take your time if you wish .  this is a long trip and i am willing to listen .         the thing is  hummin  that i had the idea that there were humaniform robots  that they were long lived  that at least one might still be alive  and that it might be in the aerie .  there was a robot there  but it was metallic  it was dead  and it was merely a symbol .  had i but known          yes .  did we all but know  there would be no need for questions or for research of any kind .  where did you get your information about humaniform robots .  since no mycogenian would have discussed that with you  i can think of only one source .  the mycogenian book a powered print book in ancient auroran and modern galactic .  am i right .         yes .         and how did you get a copy .      seldon paused  then muttered     its somewhat embarrassing .         i am not easily embarrassed  seldon .      seldon told him and hummin allowed a very small smile to twitch across his face .   hummin said     didn   t it occur to you that what occurred had to be a charade .  no sister would do a thing like that except under instruction and with a great deal of persuading .      seldon frowned and said with asperity     that was not at all obvious .  people are perverted now and then .  and its easy for you to grin .  i didn   t have the information you had and neither did dors .  if you did not wish me to fall into traps  you might have warned me of those that existed .         i agree .  i withdraw my remark .  in any case  you don   t have the book any longer  i   m sure .         no .  sunmaster fourteen took it from me .         how much of it did you read .         only a small fraction .  i didn   t have time .  it   s a huge book and i must tell you  hummin  it is dreadfully dull .         yes  i know that  for i think i have read more of it than you have .  it is not only dull  it is totally unreliable .  it is a one sided  official mycogenian view of history that is more intent on presenting that view than a reasoned objectivity .  it is even deliberately unclear in spots so that outsiders even if they were to read the book would never know entirely what they read .  what was it  for instance  that you thought you read about robots that interested you .         i   ve already told you .  they speak of humaniform robots  robots that could not be distinguished from human beings in outward appearance .         how many of these would exist .     asked hummin .      they don   t say .   at least  i didn   t come across a passage in which they gave numbers .  there may have been only a handful  but one of them  the book refers to as    renegade .     it seems to have an unpleasant significance  but i couldn   t make out what .         you didn   t tell me anything about that      interposed dors .     if you had  i would have told you that it   s not a proper name .  it   s another archaic word and it means  roughly  what    traitor    would mean in galactic .  the older word has a greater aura of fear about it .  a traitor  somehow  sneaks to his treason  but a renegade flaunts it .      .   hummin said     i   ll leave the fine points of archaic language to you  dors  but  in any case  if the renegade actually existed and if it was a humaniform robot  then  clearly  as a traitor and enemy  it would not be preserved and venerated in the elders    aerie .      seldon said     i didn   t know the meaning of    renegade      but  as i said  i did get the impression that it was an enemy .  i thought it might have been defeated and preserved as a reminder of the mycogenian triumph .         was there any indication in the book that the renegade was defeated .         no  but i might have missed that portion          not likely .  any mycogenian victory would be announced in the book unmistakably and referred to over and over again .         there was another point the book made about the renegade      said seldon  hesitating     but i can   t be at all sure i understood it .      hummin said     as i told you  .   .   .  they are deliberately obscure at times .         nevertheless  they seemed to say that the renegade could somehow tap human emotions  .   .   .  influence them          any politician can      said hummin with a shrug .     it   s called charisma when it works .      seldon sighed .     well  i wanted to believe .  that was it .  i would have given a great deal to find an ancient humaniform robot that was still alive and that i could question .         for what purpose .     asked hummin .      to learn the details of the primordial galactic society when it still consisted of only a handful of worlds .  from so small a galaxy psychohistory could be deduced more easily .      hummin said     are you sure you could trust what you heard .  after many thousands of years  would you be willing to rely on the robot   s early memories .  how much distortion would have entered into them .         that   s right      said dors suddenly .     it would be like the computerized records i told you of  hari .  slowly  those robot memories would be discarded  lost  erased  distorted .  you can only go back so far and the farther you go back  the less reliable the information becomes no matter what you do .      hummin nodded .     i   ve heard it referred to as a kind of uncertainty principle in information .         but wouldn   t it be possible      said seldon thoughtfully     that some information  for special reasons  would be preserved .  parts of the mycogenian book may well refer to events of twenty thousand years ago and yet be very largely as it had been originally .  the more valued and the more carefully preserved particular information is  the more long lasting and accurate it may be .         the key word is    particular .     what the book may care to preserve may not be what you wish to have preserved and what a robot may remember best may be what you wish him to remember least .      seldon said in despair     in whatever direction i turn to seek a way of working out psychohistory  matters so arrange themselves as to make it impossible .  why bother trying .         it might seem hopeless now      said hummin unemotionally     but given the necessary genius  a route to psychohistory may be found that none of us would at this moment expect .  give yourself more time .    but we   re coming to a rest area .  let us pull off and have dinner .      over the lamb patties on rather tasteless bread  most unpalatable after the fare at mycogen   seldon said     you seem to assume  hummin  that i am the possessor of    the necessary genius .     i may not be  you know .      hummin said     that   s true .  you may not be .  however  i know of no alternate candidate for the post  so i must cling to you .      and seldon sighed and said     well  i   ll try  but i   m out of any spark of hope .  possible but not practical  i said to begin with  and i   m more convinced of that now than i ever was before .        heatsink    amaryl  yugo   .   .   .  a mathematician who  next to hari seldon himself  may be considered most responsible for working out the details of psychohistory .  it was he who  .   .   .    .   .   .  yet the conditions under which he began life are almost more dramatic than his mathematical accomplishments .  born into the hopeless poverty of the lower classes of dahl  a sector of ancient tractor  he might have passed his life in utter obscurity were it not for the fact that seldon  quite by accident  encountered him in the course of  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       .     the emperor of all the galaxy felt weary physically weary .  his lips ached from the gracious smile he had had to place on his face at careful intervals .  his neck was stiff from having inclined his head this way and that in a feigned show of interest .  his ears pained from having to listen .  his whole body throbbed from having to rise and to sit and to turn and to hold out his hand and to nod .   it was merely a state function where one had to meet mayors and viceroys and ministers and their wives or husbands from here and there in trantor and  worse  from here and there in the galaxy .  there were nearly a thousand present  all in costumes that varied from the ornate to the downright outlandish  and he had had to listen to a babble of different accents made the worse by an effort to speak the emperor   s galactic as spoken at the galactic university .  worst of all  the emperor had had to remember to avoid making commitments of substance  while freely applying the lotion of words without substance .   all had been recorded  sight and sound very discreetly  and eto demerzel would go over it to see if cleon  first of that name  had behaved himself .  that  of course  was only the way that the emperor put it to himself .  demerzel would surely say that he was merely collecting data on any unintentional self revelation on the pan of the guests .  and perhaps he was .   fortunate demerzel .   the emperor could not leave the palace and its extensive grounds  while demerzel could range the galaxy if he wished .  the emperor was always on display  always accessible  always forced to deal with visitors  from the important to the merely intrusive .  demerzel remained anonymous and never allowed himself to be seen inside the palace grounds .  he remained merely a fearsome name and an invisible  and therefore the more frightening  presence .   the emperor was the inside man with all the trappings and emoluments of power .  demerzel was the outside man  with nothing evident  not even a formal title  but with his fingers and mind probing everywhere and asking for no reward for his tireless labors but one the reality of power .   it amused the emperor in a macabre sort of way to consider that  at any moment  without warning  with a manufactured excuse or with none at all  he could have demerzel arrested  imprisoned  exiled  tortured  or executed .  after all  in these annoying centuries of constant unrest  the emperor might have difficulty in exerting his will over the various planets of the empire  even over the various sectors of trantor with their rabble of local executives and legislatures that he was forced to deal with in a maze of interlocking decrees  protocols  commitments  treaties  and general interstellar legalities  but at least his powers remained absolute over the palace and its grounds .   and yet cleon knew that his dreams of power were useless .  demerzel had served his father and cleon could not remember a time when he did not turn to demerzel for everything .  it was demerzel who knew it all  devised it all  did it all .  more than that  it was on demerzel that anything that went wrong could be blamed .  the emperor himself remained above criticism and had nothing to fear except  of course  palace coups and assassination by his nearest and dearest .  it was to prevent this  above all  that he depended upon demerzel .   emperor cleon felt a tiny shudder at the thought of trying to do without demerzel .  there had been emperors who had ruled personally  who had had a series of chiefs of staff of no talent  who had had incompetents serving in the post and had kept them  and somehow they had gotten along for a time and after a fashion .   but cleon could not .  he needed demerzel .  in fact  now that the thought of assassination had come to him and  in view of the modern history of the empire  it was inevitable that it had come to him he could see that getting rid of demerzel was quite impossible .  it couldn   t be done .  no matter how cleverly he  cleon  would attempt to arrange it  demerzel  he was sure  would anticipate the move somehow  would know it was on its way  and would arrange  with far superior cleverness  a palace coup .  cleon would be dead before demerzel could possibly be taken away in chains and there would simply be another emperor that demerzel would serve and dominate .   or would demerzel tire of the game and make himself emperor .   never .  the habit of anonymity was too strong in him .  if demerzel exposed himself to the world  then his powers  his wisdom  his luck  whatever it was  would surely desert him .  cleon was convinced of that .  he felt it to be beyond dispute .   so while he behaved himself  cleon was safe .  with no ambitions of his own  demerzel would serve him faithfully .   and now here was demerzel  dressed so severely and simply that it made cleon uneasily conscious of the useless ornamentation of his robes of state  now thankfully removed with the aid of two valets .  naturally  it would not be until he was alone and in dishabille that demerzel would glide into view .      demerzel      said the emperor of all the galaxy     i am tired .         state functions are tiring  sire      murmured demerzel .      then must i have them every evening .         not every evening  but they are essential .  it gratifies others to see you and to be taken note of by you .  it helps keep the empire running smoothly .         the empire used to be kept running smoothly by power      said the emperor somberly .     now it must be kept running by a smile  a wave of the hand  a murmured word  and a medal or a plaque .         if all that keeps the peace  sire  there is much to be said for it .  and your reign proceeds well .         you know why because i have you at my side .  my only real gift is that i am aware of your importance .     he looked at demerzel slyly .     my son need not be my heir .  he is not a talented boy .  what if i make you my heir .      demerzel said freezingly     sire  that is unthinkable .  i would not usurp the throne .  i would not steal it from your rightful heir .  besides  if i have displeased you  punish me justly .  surely  nothing i have done or could possibly do deserves the punishment of being made emperor .      cleon laughed .     for that true assessment of the value of the imperial throne  demerzel  i abandon any thought of punishing you .  come now  let us talk about something .  i would sleep  but i am not yet ready for the ceremonies with which they put me to bed .  let us talk .         about what  sire .         about anything .   about that mathematician and his psychohistory .  i think about him every once in a while  you know .  i thought of him at dinner tonight .  i wondered  what if a psychohistorical analysis would predict a method for making it possible to be an emperor without endless ceremony .         i somehow think  sire  that even the cleverest psychohistorian could not manage that .         well  tell me the latest .  is he still hiding among those peculiar baldheads of mycogen .  you promised you would winkle him out of there .         so i did  sire  and i moved in that direction  but i regret that i must say that i failed .         failed .     the emperor allowed himself to frown .     i don   t like that .          nor i  sire .  i planned to have the mathematician be encouraged to commit some blasphemous act such acts are easy to commit in mycogen  especially for an outsider one that would call for severe punishment .  the mathematician would then be forced to appeal to the emperor and  as a result  we would get him .  i planned it at the cost of insignificant concessions on our part important to mycogen  totally unimportant to us   and i meant to play no direct role in the arrangement .  it was to be handled subtly .         i dare say      said cleon     but it failed .  did the mayor of mycogen     he is called the high elder  sire .         do not quibble over titles .  did this high elder refuse .         on the contrary  sire  he agreed and the mathematician  seldon  fell into the trap neatly .         well then .         he was allowed to leave unharmed .         why .     said cleon indignantly .      of this i am not certain  sire  but i suspect we were outbid .         by whom .  by the mayor of wye .         possibly  sire  but i doubt that .  i have wye under constant surveillance .  if they had gained the mathematician  i would know it by now .      the emperor was not merely frowning .  he was clearly enraged .     demerzel  this is bad .  i am greatly displeased .  a failure like this makes me wonder if you are perhaps not the man you once were .  what measures shall we take against mycogen for this clear defiance of the emperor   s wishes .      demerzel bowed low in recognition of the storm unleashed  but he said in steely tones     it would be a mistake to move against mycogen now  sire .  the disruption that would follow would play into the hands of wye .         but we must do something .          perhaps not  sire .  it is not as bad as it may seem .         how can it be not as bad as it seems .         you   ll remember  sire  that this mathematician was convinced that psychohistory was impractical .         of course i remember that  but that doesn   t matter  does it .  for our purposes .         perhaps not .  but if it were to become practical  it would serve our purposes to an infinitely great extent  sire .  and from what i have been able to find out  the mathematician is now attempting to make psychohistory practical .  his blasphemous attempt in mycogen was  i understand  part of an attempt at solving the problem of psychohistory .  in that case  it may pay us  sire  to leave him to himself .  it will serve us better to pick him up when he is closer to his goal or has reached it .         not if wye gets him first .         that  i shall see to it  will not happen .         in the same way that you succeeded in winkling the mathematician out of mycogen just now .         i will not make a mistake the next time  sire      said demerzel coldly .   the emperor said     demerzel  you had better not .  i will not tolerate another mistake in this respect .     and then he added pettishly     i think i shall not sleep tonight after all .           .     jirad tisalver of the dahl sector was short .  the top of his head came up only to hari seldon   s nose .  he did not seem to take that to heart  however .  he had handsome  even features  was given to smiling  and sported a thick black mustache and crisply curling black hair .   he lived  with his wife and a half grown daughter  in an apartment of seven small rooms  kept meticulously clean  but almost bare of furnishings .   tisalver said     i apologize  master seldon and mistress venabili  that i cannot give you the luxury to which you must be accustomed  but dahl is a poor sector and i am not even among the better off among our people .         the more reason      responded seldon     that we must apologize to you for placing the burden of our presence upon you .         no burden  master seldon .  master hummin has arranged to pay us generously for your use of our humble quarters and the credits would be welcome even if you were not  and you are .       seldon remembered hummin   s parting words when they finally arrived in dahl .      seldom    he had said     this is the third place i   ve arranged as sanctuary .  the first two were notoriously beyond the reach of the imperium  which might well have served to attract their attention  after all  they were logical places for you .  this one is different .  it is poor  unremarkable  and  as a matter of fact  unsafe in some ways .  it is not a natural refuge for you  so that the emperor and his chief of staff may not think to turn their eyes in this direction .  would you mind staying out of trouble this time  then .         i will try  hummin      said seldon  a little offended .     please be aware that the trouble is not of my seeking .  i am trying to learn what may well take me thirty lifetimes to learn if i am to have the slightest chance of organizing psychohistory .         i understand      said hummin .     your efforts at learning brought you to upperside in streeling and to the elders    aerie in mycogen and to who can guess where in dahl .  as for you  dr .  venabili  i know you   ve been trying to take care of seldon  but you must try harder .  get it fixed in your head that he is the most important person on trantor  or in the galaxy  for that matter  and that he must be kept secure at any cost .         i will continue to do my best      said dors stiffly .      and as for your host family  they have their peculiarities  but they are essentially good people with whom i have dealt before .  try not to get them in trouble either .      but tisalver  at least  did not seem to anticipate trouble of any kind from his new tenants and his expressed pleasure at the company he now had quite apart from the rent credits he would be getting seemed quite sincere .   he had never been outside dahl and his appetite for tales of distant places was enormous .  his wife too  bowing and smiling  would listen and their daughter  with a finger in her mouth  would allow one eye to peep from behind the door .   it was usually after dinner  when the entire family assembled  that seldon and dors were expected to talk of the outside world .  the food was plentiful enough  but it was bland and often tough .  so soon after the tangy food of mycogen  it was all but inedible .   the    table    was a long shelf against one wall and they ate standing up .   gentle questioning by seldon elicited the fact that this was the usual situation among dahlites as a whole and was not due to unusual poverty .  of course  mistress tisalver explained  there were those with high government jobs in dahl who were prone to adopt all kinds of effete customs like chairs she called them    body shelves     but this was looked down upon by the solid middle class .   much as they disapproved of unnecessary luxury  though  the tisalvers loved hearing about it  listening with a virtual storm of tongueclicking when told of mattresses lifted on legs  of ornate chests and wardrobes  and of a superfluity of tableware .   they listened also to a description of mycogenian customs  while jirad tisalver stroked his own hair complacently and made it quite obvious that he would as soon think of emasculation as of depilation .  mistress tisalver was furious at any mention of female subservience and flatly refused to believe that the sisters accepted it tranquilly .   they seized most  however  on seldon   s .  casual reference to the imperial grounds .  when  upon questioning  it turned out that seldon had actually seen and spoken to the emperor  a blanket of awe enveloped the family .  it took a while before they dared ask questions and seldon found that he could not satisfy them .  he had not  after all  seen much of the grounds and even less of the palace interior .   that disappointed the tisalvers and they were unremitting in their attempts to elicit more .  and  having heard of seldon   s imperial adventure  they found it hard to believe dors   s assertion that  for her part  she had never been anywhere in the imperial grounds .  most of all  they rejected seldon   s casual comment that the emperor had talked and behaved very much as any ordinary human being would .  that seemed utterly impossible to the tisalvers .   after three evenings of this  seldon found himself tiring .  he had  at first  welcomed the chance to do nothing for a while  during the day  at least  but view some of the history book films that dors recommended .  the tisalvers turned over their book viewer to their guests during the day with good grace  though the little girl seemed unhappy and was sent over to a neighbor   s apartment to use theirs for her homework .      it doesn   t help      seldon said restlessly in the security of his room after he had piped in some music to discourage eavesdropping .     i can see your fascination with history  but it   s all endless detail .  it   s a mountainous heap no  a galactic heap of data in which i can   t see the basic organization .         i dare say      said dors     that there must have been a time when human beings saw no organization in the stars in the sky  but eventually they discovered the galactic structure .         and i   m sure that took generations  not weeks .  there must have been a time when physics seemed a mass of unrelated observations before the central natural laws were discovered and that took generations .    and what of the tisalvers .         what of them .  i think they   re being very nice .         they   re curious .         of course they are .  wouldn   t you be if you were in their place .         but is it just curiosity .  they seem to be ferociously interested in my meeting with the emperor .      dors seemed impatient .     again  .   .   .  its only natural .  wouldn   t you befit the situation was reversed .         it makes me nervous .         hummin brought us here .         yes  but he   s not perfect .  he brought me to the university and i was maneuvered upperside .  he brought us to sunmaster fourteen  who entrapped us .  you know he did .  twice bitten  at least once shy .  i   m tired of being questioned .         then turn the tables  hari .  aren   t you interested in dahl .         of course .  what do you know about it to begin with .         nothing .  it   s just one of more than eight hundred sectors and i   ve only been on trantor a little over two years .         exactly .  and there are twenty five million other worlds and i   ve been on this problem only a little over two months .   i tell you .  i want to go back to helicon and take up a study of the mathematics of turbulence  which was my ph . d .  problem  and forget i ever saw   or thought i saw that turbulence gave an insight into human society .      but that evening he said to tisalver     but you know  master tisalver  you   ve never told me what you do  the nature of your work .         me .     tisalver placed his fingers on his chest  which was covered by the simple white t shirt with nothing underneath  which seemed to be the standard male uniform in dahl .     nothing much .  i work at the local holovision station in programming .  it   s very dull  but it   s a living .         and it   s respectable      said mistress tisalver .     it means he doesn   t have to work in the heatsinks .         the heatsinks .     said dors  lifting her light eyebrows and managing to look fascinated .      oh well      said tisalver     that   s what dahl is best known for .  it isn   t much  but forty billion people on trantor need energy and we supply a lot of it .  we don   t get appreciated  but i   d like to see some of the fancy sectors do without it .      seldon looked confused .     doesn   t trantor get its energy from solar power stations in orbit .         some      said tisalver     and some from nuclear fusion stations out on the islands and some from microfusion motors and some from wind stations upperside  but half       he raised a finger in emphasis and his face looked unusually grave    half comes from the heatsinks .  there are heatsinks in lots of places  but none none  as rich as those in dahl .  are you serious that you don   t know about the heatsinks .  you sit there and stare at me .      dors said quickly     we are outworlders  you know .      she had almost said    tribespeople      but had caught herself in time .      especially dr .  seldon .  he   s only been on trantor a couple of months .         really .     said mistress tisalver .  she was a trifle shorter than her husband  was plump without quite being fat  had her dark hair drawn tightly back into a bun  and possessed rather beautiful dark eyes .  like her husband  she appeared to be in her thirties .    after a period in mycogen  not actually long in duration but intense  it struck dors as odd to have a woman enter the conversation at will .  how quickly modes and manners establish themselves  she thought  and made a mental note to mention that to seldon    one more item for his psychohistory .       oh yes      she said .     dr .  seldon is from helicon .      mistress tisalver registered polite ignorance .     and where might that be .      dors said     why  it   s      she turned to seldon .     where is it  hari .      seldon looked abashed .     to tell you the truth  i don   t think i could locate it very easily on a galactic model without looking up the coordinates .  all i can say is that it   s on the other side of the central black hole from trantor and getting there by hypership is rather a chore .      mistress tisalver said     i don   t think jirad and i will ever be on a hypership .         someday  casilia      said tisalver cheerfully     maybe we will .  but tell us about helicon  master seldon .      seldon shook his head .     to me that would be dull .  its just a world  like any other .  only trantor is different from all the rest .  there are no heatsinks on helicon  or probably anywhere else except trantor .  tell me about them .          only trantor is different from all the rest .     the sentence repeated itself in seldon   s mind and for a moment he grasped at it  and for some reason dor   s hand on thigh story suddenly recurred to him  but tisalver was speaking and it passed out of seldon   s mind as quickly as it had entered .    tisalver said     if you really want to know about heatsinks  i can show you .     he turned to his wife .     casilia  would you mind if tomorrow evening i take master seldon to the heatsinks .         and me      said dors quickly .      and mistress venabili .      mistress tisalver frowned and said sharply     i don   t think it would be a good idea .  our visitors would find it dull .         i don   t think so  mistress tisalver      said seldon ingratiatingly .     we would very much like to see the heatsinks .  we would be delighted if you would join us too  .   .   .  and your little daughter if she wants to come .         to the heatsinks .     said mistress tisalver  stiffening .     it   s no place at all for a decent woman .      seldon felt embarrassed at his gaffe .     i meant no harm  mistress tisalver .         no offense      said tisalver .     casilia thinks it   s beneath us and so it is  but as long as i don   t work there  it   s no distress merely to visit and show it to guests .  but it is uncomfortable and i would never get casilia to dress properly .      they got up from their crouching positions .  dahlite    chairs    were merely molded plastic seats on small wheels and they cramped seldon   s knees terribly and seemed to wiggle at his least body movement .  the tisalvers  however  had mastered the art of sitting firmly and rose without trouble and without needing to use their arms for help as seldon had to .  dors also got up without trouble and seldon once again marveled at her natural grace .   before they parted to their separate rooms for the night  seldon said to dors     are you sure you know nothing about heatsinks .  mistress tisalver makes them seem unpleasant .         they can   t be that unpleasant or tisalver wouldn   t suggest taking us on tour .  lets be content to be surprised .           .     tisalver said     you   ll need proper clothing .     mistress tisalver sniffed markedly in the background .   cautiously  seldon  thinking of kirtles with vague distress  said     what do you mean by proper clothing .         something light  such as i wear .  a t shirt  very short sleeves  loose slacks  loose underpants  foot socks  open sandals .  i have it all for you .         good .  il doesn   t sound bad .         as for mistress venabili  i have the same .  i hope it fits .      the clothes tisalver supplied each of them  which were his own  fit fine if a bit snugly .  when they were ready  they bade mistress tisalver good bye and she  with a resigned if still disapproving air  watched them from the doorway as they set off .   it was early evening and there was an attractive twilight glow above .  it was clear that dahl   s lights would soon be winking on .  the temperature was mild and there were virtually no vehicles to be seen  everyone was walking .  in the distance was the everpresent hum of an expressway and the occasional glitter of its lights could be easily seen .   the dahlites  seldon noted  did not seem to be walking toward any particular destination .  rather  there seemed to be a promenade going on  a walking for pleasure .  perhaps  if dahl was an impoverished sector  as tisalver had implied  inexpensive entertainment was at a premium and what was as pleasant  and as inexpensive  as an evening stroll .   seldon felt himself easing automatically into the gait of an aimless stroll himself and felt the warmth of friendliness a  around him .  people greeted each other as they passed and exchanged a few words .  black mustaches of different shape and thickness flashed everywhere and seemed a requisite for the dahlite male  as ubiquitous as the bald heads of the mycogenian brothers .   it was an evening rite  a way of making sure that another day had passed safely and that one   s friends were still well and happy .  and  it soon became apparent  dors caught every eye .  in the twilight glow  the ruddiness of her hair had deepened  but it stood out against the sea of black haired heads  except for the occasional gray  like a gold coin winking its way across a pile of coal .      this is very pleasant      said seldon .      it is      said tisalver .     ordinarily  i   d be walking with my wife and she   d be in her element .  there is no one for a kilometer around whom she doesn   t know by name  occupation  and interrelationships .  i can   t do that .  right now  half the people who greet me  .   .   .  i couldn   t tell you their names .  but  in any case  we mustn   t creep along too slowly .  we must get to the elevator .  it   s a busy world on the lower levels .      they were on the elevator going down when dors said     i presume  master tisalver  that the heatsinks are places where the internal heat of trantor is being used to produce steam that will turn turbines and produce electricity .         oh no .  highly efficient large scale thermopiles produce electricity directly .  don   t ask me the details  please .  i   m just a holovision programmer .  in fact  don   t ask anyone the details down there .  the whole thing is one big black box .  it works  but no one knows how .         what if something goes wrong .         it doesn   t usually  but if it does  some expert comes over from somewhere .  someone who understands computers .  the whole thing is highly computerized  of course .      the elevator came to a halt and they stepped out .  a blast of heat struck them .      it   s hot      said seldon quite unnecessarily .      yes  it is      said tisalver .     that   s what makes dahl so valuable as an energy source .  the magma layer is nearer the surface here than it is anywhere else in the world .  so you have to work in the heat .         how about air conditioning .     said dors .      there is air conditioning  but it   s a matter of expense .  we ventilate and dehumidify and cool  but if we go too far  then we   re using up too much energy and the whole process becomes too expensive .      tisalver stopped at a door at which he signaled .  it opened to a blast of cooler air and he muttered     we ought to be able to get someone to help show us around and he   ll control the remarks that mistress venabili will otherwise be the victim of  .   .   .  at least from the men .         remarks won   t embarrass me      said dors .      they will embarrass me      said tisalver .   a young man walked out of the office and introduced himself as hano linder .  he resembled tisalver quite closely  but seldon decided that until he got used to the almost universal shortness  swarthiness  black hair  and luxuriant mustaches  he would not be able to see individual differences easily .   lindor said     i   ll be glad to show you around for what there is to see .  it   s not one of your spectaculars  you know .     he addressed them all  but his eyes were fixed on dors .  he said     it   s not going to be comfortable .  i suggest we remove our shirts .         it   s nice and cool in here      said seldon .      of course  but that   s because we   re executives .  rank has its privileges .  out there we can   t maintain air conditioning at this level .  that   s why they get paid more than i do .  in fact  those are the best paying jobs in dahl  which is the only reason we get people to work down here .  even so  it   s getting harder to get heatsinkers all the time .     he took a deep breath .     okay  out into the soup .      he removed his own shirt and tucked it into his waistband .  tisalver did the same and seldon followed suit .   linder glanced at dors and said     for your own comfort  mistress  but it   s not compulsory .         that   s all right      said dors and removed her shirt .   her brassiere was white  unpadded  and showed considerable cleavage .      mistress      said lindor     that   s not      he thought a moment  then shrugged and said     all right .  we   ll get by .      at first  seldon was aware only of computers and machinery  huge pipes  flickering lights  and flashing screens .   the overall light was comparatively dim  though individual sections of machinery were illuminated .  seldon looked up into the almost darkness .  he said     why isn   t it better lit .         it   s lit well enough  .   .   .  where it should be      said lindor .  his voice was well modulated and he spoke quickly  but a little harshly .     overall illumination is kept low for psychological reasons .  too bright is translated  in the mind  into heat .  complaints go up when we turn up the lights  even when the temperature is made to go down .      dors said     it seems to be well computerized .  i should think the operations could be turned over to computers altogether .  this sort of environment is made for artificial intelligence .         perfectly right      said lindor     but neither can we take a chance on any failures .  we need people on the spot if anything goes wrong .  a misfunctioning computer can raise problems up to two thousand kilometers away .         so can human error .  isn   t that so .     said seldon .      oh yes  but with both people and computers on the job  computer error can be more quickly tracked down and corrected by people and  conversely  human error can be more quickly corrected by computers .  what it amounts to is that nothing serious can happen unless human error and computer error take place simultaneously .  and that hardly ever happens .         hardly ever  but not never  eh .     said seldon .      almost never  but not never .  computers aren   t what they used to be and neither are people .         that   s the way it always seems      said seldon  laughing slightly .      no no .  i   m not talking memory .  i   m not talking good old days .  i   m talking statistics .      at this  seldon recalled hummin talking of the degeneration of the times .      see what i mean .     said lindor  his voice dropping .     there   s a bunch of people  at the c   level from the looks of them  drinking .  not one of them is at his or her post .         what are they drinking .     asked dors .      special fluids for replacing electrolyte loss .  fruit juice .         you can   t blame them  can you .     said dors indignantly .     in this dry heat  you would have to drink .         do you know how long a skilled c   can spin out a drink .  and there   s nothing to be done about it either .  if we give them fiveminute breaks for drinks and stagger them so they don   t all congregate in a group  you simply stir up a rebellion .      they were approaching the group now .  there were men and women  dahl seemed to be a more or less amphisexual society  and both sexes were shirtless .  the women wore devices that might be called brassieres  but they were strictly functional .  they served to lift the breasts in order to improve ventilation and limit perspiration  but covered nothing .   dors said in an aside to seldon     that makes sense  hari .  i   m soaking wet there .         take off your brassiere  then      said seldon .     i won   t lift a finger to stop you .         somehow      said dors     i guessed you wouldn   t .     she left her brassiere where it was .   they were approaching the congregation of people about a dozen of them .   dors said     if any of them make rude remarks  i shall survive .         thank you      said lindor .     i cannot promise they won   t .    but i   ll have to introduce you .  if they get the idea that you two are inspectors and in my company  they   ll become unruly .  inspectors are supposed to poke around on their own without anyone from management overseeing them .      he held up his arms .     heatsinkers  i have two introductions to make .  we have visitors from outside two outworlders  two scholars .  they   ve got worlds running short on energy and they   ve come here to see how we do it here in dahl .  they think they may learn something .         they   ll learn how to sweat .     shouted a heatsinker and there was raucous laughter .      she   s got a sweaty chest right now      shouted a woman     covering up like that .      dors shouted back     i   d take it off  but mine can   t compete with yours .     the laughter turned good natured .   but one young man stepped forward  staring at seldon with intense deep set eyes  his face set into a humorless mask .  he said     i know you .  you   re the mathematician .      he ran forward  inspecting seldon   s face with eager solemnity .  automatically  dors stepped in front of seldon and lindor stepped in front of her  shouting     back  heatsinker .  mind your manners .      seldon said     wait .  let him talk to me .  why is everyone piling in front of me .      lindor said in a low voice     if any of them get close  you   ll find they don   t smell like hothouse flowers .         i   ll endure it      said seldon brusquely .     young man  what is it you want .         my name is amaryl .  yugo amaryl .  i   ve seen you on holovision .         you might have  but what about it .         i don   t remember your name .         you don   t have to .         you talked about something called psychohistory .         you don   t know how i wish i hadn   t .         what .         nothing .  what is it you want .         i want to talk to you .  just for a little while .  now .      seldon looked at lindor  who shook his head firmly .     not while he   s on his shift .         when does your shift begin  mr .  amaryl .     asked seldon .      sixteen hundred .         can you see me tomorrow at fourteen hundred .         sure .  where .      seldon turned to tisalver .  would you permit me to see him in your place .      tisalver looked very unhappy .     its not necessary .  he   s just a heatsinker .      seldon said     he recognized my face .  he knows something about me .  he can   t be just an anything .  i   ll see him in my room .     and then  as tisalver   s face didn   t soften  he added     my room  for which rent is being paid .  and you   ll be at work  out of the apartment .      tisalver said in a low voice     it   s not me  master seldon .  it   s my wife  casilia .  she won   t stand for it .         i   ll talk to her      said seldon grimly .     she   ll have to .           .     casilia tisalver opened her eyes wide .     a heatsinker .  not in my apartment .         why not .  besides  he   ll be coming to my room      said seldon .     at fourteen hundred .         i won   t have it      said mistress tisalver .     this is what comes of going down to the heatsinks .  jirad was a fool .         not at all  mistress tisalver .  we went at my request and i was fascinated .  i must see this young man  since that is necessary to my scholarly work .         i   m sorry if it is  but i won   t have it .      dors venabili raised her hand .     hari  let me take care of this .  mistress tisalver  if dr .  seldon must see someone in his room this afternoon  the additional person naturally means additional rent .  we understand that .  for today  then  the rent on dr .  seldon   s room will be doubled .      mistress tisalver thought about it .     well  that   s decent of you  but it   s not only the credits .  there   s the neighbours to think of .  a sweaty  smelly heatsinker          i doubt that he   ll be sweaty and smelly at fourteen hundred  mistress tisalver  but let me go on .  since dr .  seldon must see him  then if he can   t see him here  he   ll have to see him elsewhere  but we can   t run here and there .  that would be too inconvenient .  therefore  what we will have to do is to get a room elsewhere .  it won   t be easy and we don   t want to do it  but we will have to .  so we will pay the rent through today and leave and of course we will have to explain to master hummin why we have had to change the arrangements that he so kindly made for us .         wait .     mistress tisalver   s face became a study of calculation .     we wouldn   t like to disoblige master hummin  .   .   .  or you two .  how long would this creature have to stay .         he   s coming at fourteen hundred .  he must be at work at sixteen hundred .  he will be here for less than two hours  perhaps considerably less .  we will meet him outside  the two of us  and bring him to dr .  seldon   s room .  any neighbours who see us will think he is an outworlder friend of ours .      mistress tisalver nodded her head .     then let it be as you say .  double rent for master seldon   s room for today and the heatsinker will visit just this one time .         just this one time      said dors .   but later  when seldon and dors were sitting in her room  dors said     why do you have to see him  hari .  is interviewing a heatsinker important to psychohistory too .      seldon thought he detected a small edge of sarcasm in her voice and he said tartly     i don   t have to base everything on this huge project of mine  in which i have very little faith anyway .  i am also a human being with human curiosities .  we were down in the heatsinks for hours and you saw what the working people there were like .  they were obviously uneducated .  they were low level individuals no play on words intended and yet here was one who recognized me .  he must have seen me on holovision on the occasion of the decennial convention and he remembered the word    psychohistory .     he strikes me as unusual  as out of place somehow   and i would like to talk to him .         because it pleases your vanity to have become known even to heatsinkers in dahl .         well  .   .   .  perhaps .  but it also piques my curiosity .         and how do you know he hasn   t been briefed and intends to lead you into trouble as has happened before .      seldon winced .     i won   t let him run his fingers through my hair .  in any case  we   re more nearly prepared now  aren   t we .  and i   m sure you   ll be with me .  i mean  you let me go upperside alone  you let me go with raindrop forty three to the microfarms alone  and you   re not going to do that again  are you .         you can be absolutely sure i won   t      said dors .      well then  i   ll talk to the young man and you can watch out for traps .  i have every faith in you .           .     amaryl arrived a few minutes before       looking warily about .  his hair was neat and his thick mustache was combed and turned up slightly at the edges .  his t shirt was startlingly white .  he did smell  but it was a fruity odor that undoubtedly came from the slightly overenthusiastic use of scent .  he had a bag with him .   seldon  who had been waiting outside for him  seized one elbow lightly  while dors seized the other  and they moved rapidly into the elevator .  having reached the correct level  they passed through the apartment into seldon   s room .   amaryl said in a low hangdog voice     nobody home  huh .         everyone   s busy      said seldon neutrally .  he indicated the only chair in the room  a pad directly on the floor .      no      said amaryl .     i don   t need that .  one of you two use it .     he squatted on the floor with a graceful downward motion .   dors imitated the movement  sitting on the edge of seldon   s floorbased mattress  but seldon dropped down rather clumsily  having to make use of his hands and unable  quite  to find a comfortable position for his legs .   seldon said     well  young man  why do you want to see me .         because you   re a mathematician .  you   re the first mathematician i ever saw close up so i could touch him  you know .         mathematicians feel like anyone else .         not to me  dr  .   .   .   .  dr .   .   .   .  seldon .         that   s my name .      amaryl looked pleased .     i finally remembered .   you see  i want to be a mathematician too .         very good .  what   s stopping you .      amaryl suddenly frowned .     are you serious .         i presume something is stopping you .  yes  i   m serious .         what   s stopping me is i   m a dahlite  a heatsinker on dahl .  i don   t have the money to get an education and i can   t get the credits to get an education .  a real education  i mean .  all they taught me was to read and cipher and use a computer and then i knew enough to be a heatsinker .  but i wanted more .  so i taught myself .         in some ways  that   s the best kind of teaching .  how did you do that .         i knew a librarian .  she was willing to help me .  she was a very nice woman and she showed me how to use computers for learning mathematics .  and she set up a software system that would connect me with other libraries .  i   d come on my days off and on mornings after my shift .  sometimes she   d lock me in her private room so i wouldn   t be bothered by people coming in or she would let me in when the library was closed .  she didn   t know mathematics herself  but she helped me all she could .  she was oldish  a widow lady .  maybe she thought of me as a kind of son or something .  she didn   t have children of her own .       maybe  thought seldon briefly  there was some other emotion involved too  but he put the thought away .  none of his business .       i liked number theory      said amaryl .     i worked some things out from what i learned from the computer and from the bookfilms it used to teach me mathematics .  i came up with some new things that weren   t in the book films .      seldon raised his eyebrows .     that   s interesting .  like what .         i   ve brought some of them to you .  i   ve never showed them to anyone .  the people around me      he shrugged .     they   d either laugh or be annoyed .  once i tried to tell a girl i knew  but she just said i was weird and wouldn   t see me anymore .  is it all right for me to show them to you .         quite all right .  believe me .      seldon held out his hand and after a brief hesitation  amaryl handed him the bag he was carrying .   for a long time  seldon looked over amaryl   s papers .  the work was naive in the extreme  but he allowed no smile to cross his face .  he followed the demonstrations  not one of which was new  of course  or even nearly new  or of any importance .   but that didn   t matter .   seldon looked up .     did you do all of this yourself .      amaryl  looking more than half frightened  nodded his head .   seldon extracted several sheets .     what made you think of this .     his finger ran down a line of mathematical reasoning .   amaryl looked it over  frowned  and thought about it .  then he explained his line of thinking .   seldon listened and said     did you ever read a book by anat bigell .         on number theory .         the title was mathematical deduction .  it wasn   t about number theory  particularly .      amaryl shook his head .     i never heard of him .  i   m sorry .         he worked out this theorem of yours three hundred years ago .      amaryl looked stricken .     i didn   t know that .         i   m sure you didn   t .  you did it more cleverly  though .  it   s not rigorous  but          what do you mean     rigorous    .         it doesn   t matter .     seldon put the papers back together in a sheaf  restored it to the bag  and said     make several copies of all this .  take one copy  have it dated by an official computer  and place it under computerized seal .  my friend here  mistress venabili  can get you into streeling university without tuition on some sort of scholarship .  you   ll have to start at the beginning and take courses in other subjects than mathematics  but   by now amaryl had caught his breath .     into streeling university .  they won   t take me .         why not .  dors  you can arrange it  can   t you .         i   m sure i can .         no  you can   t      said amaryl hotly .     they won   t take me .  i   m from dahl .         well .         they won   t take people from dahl .      seldon looked at dors .     what   s he talking about .      dors shook her head .     i really don   t know .      amaryl said     you   re an outworlder  mistress .  how long have you been at streeling .         a little over two years  mr .  amaryl .         have you ever seen dahlites there short  curly black hair  big mustaches .         there are students with all kinds of appearances .         but no dahlites .  look again the next time you   re there .         why not .     said seldon .      they don   t like us .  we look different .  they don   t like our mustaches .         you can shave your      but seldon   s voice died under the other   s furious glance .      never .  why should i .  my mustache is my manhood .         you shave your beard .  that   s your manhood too .         to my people it is the mustache .      seldon looked at dors again and murmured     bald heads  mustaches  .   .   .  madness .         what .     said amaryl angrily .      nothing .  tell me what else they don   t like about dahlites .         they make up things not to like .  they say we smell .  they say we   re dirty .  they say we steal .  they say we   re violent .  they say we   re dumb .          why do they say all this .         because its easy to say it and it makes them feel good .  sure  if we work in the heatsinks  we get dirty and smelly .  if we   re poor and held down  some of us steal and get violent .  but that isn   t the way it is with all of us .  how about those tall yellow hairs in the imperial sector who think they own the galaxy no  they do own the galaxy .  don   t they ever get violent .  don   t they steal sometimes .  if they did my job  they   d smell the way i do .  if they had to live the way i have to  they   d get dirty too .         who denies that there are people of all kinds in all places .     said seldon .      no one argues the matter .  they just take it for granted .  master seldon  i   ve got to get away from trantor .  i have no chance on trantor  no way of earning credits  no way of getting an education  no way of becoming a mathematician  no way of becoming any thing but what they say i am  .   .   .  a worthless nothing .     this last was said in frustration  and desperation .   seldon tried to be reasonable .     the person i   m renting this room from is a dahlite .  he has a clean job .  he   s educated .         oh sure      said amaryl passionately .     there are some .  they let a few do it so that they can say it can be done .  and those few can live nicely as long as they stay in dahl .  let them go outside and they   ll see how they   re treated .  and while they   re in here they make themselves feel good by treating the rest of us like dirt .  that makes them yellow hairs in their own eyes .  what did this nice person you   re renting this room from say when you told him you were bringing in a heatsinker .  what did he say i would be like .  they   re gone now  .   .   .  wouldn   t be in the same place with me .      seldon moistened his lips .     i won   t forget you .  i   ll see to it that you   ll get off trantor and into my own university in helicon once i   m back there myself .         do you promise that .  your word of honor .  even though i   m a dahlite .         the fact that you   re a dahlite is unimportant to me .  the fact that you are already a mathematician is .  but i still can   t quite grasp what you   re telling me .  i find it impossible to believe that there would be such unreasoning feeling against harmless people .      amaryl said bitterly     that   s because you   ve never had any occasion to interest yourself in such things .  it ran all pass right under your nose and you wouldn   t smell a thing because it doesn   t affect you .       dors said     mr .  amaryl  dr .  seldon is a mathematician like you and his head can sometimes be in the clouds .  you must understand that .  i am a historian  however .  i know that it isn   t unusual to have one group of people look down upon another group .  there are peculiar and almost ritualistic hatreds that have no rational justification and that can have their serious historical influence .  it   s too bad .      amaryl said     saying something is    too bad    is easy .  you say you disapprove  which makes you a nice person  and then you can go about your own business and not be interested anymore .  it   s a lot worse than    too bad .     it   s against everything decent and natural .  we   re all of us the same  yellow hairs and black hairs  tall and short  easterners  westerners  southerners  and outworlders .  we   re all of us  you and i and even the emperor  descended from the people of earth  aren   t we .         descended from what    asked seldon .  he turned to look at dors  his eyes wide .      from the people of earth .     shouted amaryl .     the one planet on which human beings originated .         one planet .  just one planet .         the only planet .  sure .  earth .         when you say earth  you mean aurora  don   t you .         aurora .  what   s that .   i mean earth .  have you never heard of earth .         no      said seldon .     actually not .         it   s a mythical world      began dors     that          it   s not mythical .  it was a real planet .      seldon sighed .     i   ve heard this all before .  well  let   s go through it again .  is there a dahlite book that tells of earth .         what .         some computer software  then .         i don   t know what you   re talking about .         young man  where did you hear about earth .         my dad told me .  everyone knows about it .         is there anyone who knows about it especially .  did they teach you about it in school .         they never said a word about it there .         then how do people know about it .      amaryl shrugged his shoulders with an air of being uselessly badgered over nothing .     everyone just does .  if you want stories about it  there   s mother rittah .  i haven   t heard that she   s died yet .         your mother .  wouldn   t you know          she   s not my mother .  that   s just what they call her .  mother rittah .  she   s an old woman .  she lives in billibotton .  or used to .         where   s that .         down in that direction      said amaryl  gesturing vaguely .      how do i get there .         get there .  you don   t want to get there .  you   d never come back .         why not .         believe me .  you don   t want to go there .         but i   d like to see mother rittah .      amaryl shook his head .     can you use a knife .         for what purpose .  what kind of knife .         a cutting knife .  like this .     amaryl reached down to the belt that held his pants tight about his waist .  a section of it came away and from one end there flashed out a knife blade  thin  gleaming  and deadly .   dors   s hand immediately came down hard upon his right wrist .   amaryl laughed .     i wasn   t planning to use it .  i was just showing it to you .     he put the knife back in his belt .     you need one in selfdefense and if you don   t have one or if you have one but don   t know how to use it  you   ll never get out of billibotton alive .  anyway    he suddenly grew very grave and intent     are you really serious  master seldon  about helping me get to helicon .         entirely serious .  that   s a promise .  write down your name and where you can be reached by hypercomputer .  you have a code  i suppose .         my shift in the heatsinks has one .  will that do .         yes .         well then      said amaryl  looking up earnestly at seldon     this means i have my whole future riding on you  master seldon  so please don   t go to billibotton .  i can   t afford to lose you now .     he turned beseeching eyes on dors and said softly     mistress venabili  if he   ll listen to you  don   t let him go .  please .         billibotton    dahl   .   .   .  oddly enough  the best known aspect of this sector is billibotton  a semi legendary place about which innumerable tales have grown up .  in fact  a whole branch of literature now exists in which heroes and adventurers  and victims  must dare the dangers of passing through billibotton .  so stylized have these stories become that the one well known and  presumably  authentic tale involving such a passage  that of hari seldon and dors venabili  has come to seem fantastic simply by association  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       .     when hari seldon and dors venabili were alone  dors asked thoughtfully     are you really planning to see this    mother    woman .         i   m thinking about it  dors .         you   re an odd one  hari .  you seem to go steadily from bad to worse .  you went upperside  which seemed harmless enough  for a rational purpose when you were in streeling .  then  in mycogen  you broke into the elders    aerie  a much more dangerous task  for a much more foolish purpose .  and now in dahl  you want to go to this place  which that young man seems to think is simple suicide  for something altogether nonsensical .         i   m curious about this reference to earth  and must know if there   s anything to it .      dors said     it   s a legend and not even an interesting one .  it is routine .  the names differ from planet to planet  but the content is the same .  there is always the tale of an original world and a golden age .  there is a longing for a supposedly simple and virtuous past that is almost universal among the people of a complex and vicious society .  in one way or another  this is true of all societies  since everyone imagines his or her own society to be too complex and vicious  however simple it may be .  mark that down for your psychohistory .         just the same      said seldon     i have to consider the possibility that one world did once exist .  aurora  .   .   .  earth  .   .   .  the name doesn   t matter .  in fact       he paused and finally dors said     well .      seldon shook his head .     do you remember the hand on thigh story you told me in mycogen .  it was right after i got the book from raindrop forty three  .   .   .  well  it popped into my head one evening recently when we were talking to the tisalvers .  i said something that reminded me  for an instant          reminded you of what .         i don   t remember .  it came into my head and went out again  but somehow every time i think of the single world notion  it seems to me i have the tips of my fingers on something and then lose it .      dors looked at seldon in surprise .     i don   t see what it could be .  the hand on thigh story has nothing to do with earth or aurora .         i know  but this  .   .   .  thing  .   .   .  that hovers just past the edge of my mind seems to be connected with this single world anyway and i have the feeling that i must find out more about it at any cost .  that  .   .   .  and robots .         robots too .  i thought the elders    aerie put an end to that .         not at all .  i   ve been thinking about them .     he stared at dors with a troubled look on his fare for a long moment  then said     but i   m not sure .         sure about what  hari .      but seldon merely shook his head and said nothing more .   dors frowned  then said     hari  let me tell you one thing .  in sober history and  believe me  i know what i   m talking about there is no mention of one world of origin .  it   s a popular belief  i admit .  i don   t mean just among the unsophisticated followers of folklore  like the mycogenians and the dahlite heatsinkers  but there are biologists who insist that there must have been one world of origin for reasons that are well outside my area of expertise and there are the more mystical historians who tend to speculate about it .  and among the leisure class intellectuals  i understand such speculations are becoming fashionable .  still  scholarly history knows nothing about it .      seldon said     all the more reason  perhaps  to go beyond scholarly history .  all i want is a device that will simplify psychohistory for me and i don   t care what the device is  whether it is a mathematical trick or a historical trick or something totally imaginary .  if the young man we   ve just talked to had had a little more formal training  i   d have set him on the problem .  his thinking is marked by considerable ingenuity and originality       dors said     and you   re really going to help him  then .         absolutely .  just as soon as i   m in a position to .         but ought you to make promises you   re not sure you   ll be able to keep .         i want to keep it .  if you   re that stiff about impossible promises  consider that hummin told sunmaster fourteen that i   d use psychohistory to get the mycogenians their world back .  there   s just about zero chance of that even if i work out psychohistory  who knows if it can be used for so narrow and specialized a purpose .  there   s a real case of promising what one can   t deliver .      but dors said with some heat     chetter hummin was trying to save our lives  to keep us out of the hands of demerzel and the emperor .  don   t forget that .  and i think he really would like to help the mycogenians .         and i really would like to help yugo amaryl and i am far more likely to be able to help him than i am the mycogenians  so if you justify the second  please don   t criticize the first .  what   s more  dors     and his eyes flashed angrily     i really would like to find mother rittah and i   m prepared to go alone .         never .     snapped dors .     if you go  i go .           .     mistress tisalver returned with her daughter in tow an hour after amaryl had left on this way to his shift .  she said nothing at all to either seldon or dors  but gave a curt nod of her head when they greeted her and gazed sharply about the room as though to verify that the heatsinker had left no trace .  she then sniffed the air sharply and looked at seldon accusingly before marching through the common room into the family bedroom .   tisalver himself arrived home later and when seldon and dors came to the dinner table  tisalver took advantage of the fact that his wife was still ordering some last minute details in connection with the dinner to say in a low voice     has that person been here .         and gone      said seldon solemnly .     your wife was out at the time .      tisalver nodded and said     will you have to do this again .         i don   t think so      said seldon .      good .      dinner passed largely in silence  but afterward  when the daughter had gone to her room for the dubious pleasures of computer practice  seldon leaned back and said     tell me about billibotton .      tisalver looked astonished and his mouth moved without any sound issuing .  casilia  however  was less easily rendered speechless .   she said     is that where your new friend lives .  are you going to return the visit .         so far      said seldon quietly     i have just asked about billibotton .      casilia said sharply     it is a slum .  the dregs live there .  no one goes there  except the filth that make their homes there .         i understand a mother rittah lives there .         i never heard of her      said casilia  her mouth closing with a snap .  it was quite clear that she had no intention of knowing anyone by name who lived in billibotton .   tisalver  casting an uneasy look at his wife  said     i   ve heard of her .  she   s a crazy old woman who is supposed to tell fortunes .         and does she live in billibotton .         i don   t know  master seldon .  i   ve never seen her .  she   s mentioned sometimes in the news holocasts when she makes her predictions .         do they come true .      tisalver snorted .     do predictions ever come true .  hers don   t even make sense .         does she ever talk about earth .         i don   t know .  i wouldn   t be surprised .         the mention of earth doesn   t puzzle you .  do you know about earth .      now tisalver looked surprised .     certainly  master seldon .  it   s the world all people came from  .   .   .  supposedly .         supposedly .  don   t you believe it .         me .  i   m educated .  but many ignorant people believe it .         are there book films about earth .         children   s stories sometimes mention earth .  i remember  when i was a young boy  my favorite story began     once  long ago  on earth  when earth was the only planet     remember  casilia .  you liked it too .      casilia shrugged  unwilling to bend as yet .      i   d like to see it sometime      said seldon     but i mean real bookfilms  .   .   .  uh  .   .   .  learned ones  .   .   .  or films  .   .   .  or printouts .         i never heard of any  but the library          i   ll try that .   are there any taboos about speaking of earth .         what are taboos .         i mean  is it a strong custom that people mustn   t talk of earth or that outsiders mustn   t ask about it .      tisalver looked so honestly astonished that there seemed no point in waiting for an answer .   dors put in     is there some rule about outsiders not going to billibotton .      now tisalver turned earnest .     no rule  but it   s not a good idea for anyone to go there .    wouldn   t .      dors said     why not .         it   s dangerous .  violent .  everyone is armed .   i mean  dahl is an armed place anyway  but in billibotton they use the weapons .  stay in this neighborhood .  it   s safe .         so far      said casilia darkly .     it would be better if we left altogether .  heatsinkers go anywhere these days .     and there was another lowering look in seldon   s direction .   seldon said     what do you mean that dahl is an armed place .  there are strong imperial regulations against weapons .         i know that      said tisalver     and there are no stun guns here or percussives or psychic probes or anything like that .  but there are knives .     he looked embarrassed .   dors said     do you carry a knife  tisalver .         me .     he looked genuinely horrified .     i am a man of peace and this is a safe neighborhood .         we have a couple of them in the house      said casilia  sniffing again .     we   re not that certain this is a safe neighborhood .         does everyone carry knives .     asked dors .      almost everyone  mistress venabili      said tisalver .     it   s customary .  but that doesn   t mean everyone uses them .         but they use them in billibotton  i suppose      said dors .      sometimes .  when they   re excited  they have fights .         and the government permits it .  the imperial government  i mean .         sometimes they try to clean billibotton up  but knives are too easy to hide and the custom is too strong .  besides  it   s almost always dahlites that get killed and i don   t think the imperial government gets too upset over that .         what if it   s an outsider who gets killed .         if it   s reported  the imperials could get excited .  but what happens is that no one has seen anything and no one knows anything .  the imperials sometimes round up people on general principles  but they can never prove anything .  i suppose they decide it   s the outsiders    fault for being there .   so don   t go to billibotton  even if you have a knife .      seldon shook his head rather pettishly .     i wouldn   t carry a knife .  i don   t know how to use one .  not skillfully .         then it   s simple  master seldon .  stay out .     tisalver shook his head portentously .     just stay out .         i may not be able to do that either      said seldon .   dors glared at him  clearly annoyed  and said to tisalver     where does one buy a knife .  or may we have one of yours .      casilia said quickly     no one takes someone else   s knife .  you must buy your own .      tisalver said     there are knife stores all over .  there aren   t supposed to be .  theoretically they   re illegal  you know .  any appliance store sells them  however .  if you see a washing machine on display  that   s a sure sign .         and how does one get to billibotton .     asked seldon .      by expressway .     tisalver looked dubious as he looked at dors   s frowning expression .   seldon said     and once i reach the expressway .         get on the eastbound side and watch for the signs .  but if you must go  master seldon    tisalver hesitated  then said     you mustn   t take mistress venabili .  women sometimes are treated  .   .   .  worse .         she won   t go      said seldon .      i   m afraid she will      said dors with quiet determination .        .     the appliance store dealer   s mustache was clearly as lush as it had been in his younger days  but it was grizzled now  even though the hair on his head was still black .  he touched the mustache out of sheer habit as he gazed at dors and brushed it back on each side .   he said     you   re not a dahlite .         yes  but i still want a knife .      he said     it   s against the law to sell knives .      dors said     i   m not a policewoman or a government agent of any soft .  i   m going to billibotton .      he stared at her thoughtfully .     alone .         with my friend .     she jerked her thumb over her shoulder in the direction of seldon  who was waiting outside sullenly .      you   re buying it for him .     he stared at seldon and it didn   t take him long to decide .     he   s an outsider too .  let him come in and buy it for himself        he   s not a government agent either .  and i   m buying it for myself .      the dealer shook his head .     outsiders are crazy .  but if you want to spend some credits  i   ll take them from you .  he reached under the counter  brought out a stub  turned it with a slight and expert motion  and the knife blade emerged .      is that the largest you have .         best woman   s knife made .         show me a man   s knife .         you don   t want one that   s coo heavy .  do you know how to use one of these things .         i   ll learn and i   m not worried about heavy .  show me a man   s knife .      the dealer smiled .     well  if you want to see one      he moved farther down the counter and brought up a much fatter stub .  he gave it a twist and what appeared to be a butcher   s knife emerged .   he handed it to her  handle first  still smiling .   she said     show me that twist of yours .      he showed her on a second knife  slowly twisting one way to make the blade appear  then the other way to make it disappear .     twist and squeeze      he said .      do it again  sir .      the dealer obliged .   dors said     all right  close it and toss me the haft     he did  in a slow upward loop .   she caught it  handed it back  and said     faster .      he raised his eyebrows and then  without warning  backhanded it to her left side .  she made no attempt to bring over her right hand  but caught it with her left and the blade showed tumescently at once then disappeared .  the dealer   s mouth fell open .      and this is the largest you have .     she said .      it is .  if you try to use it  it will just tire you out .         i   ll breathe deeply .  i   ll take a second one too .         for your friend .         no .  for me .         you plan on using two knives .         i   ve got two hands .      the dealer sighed .     mistress  please stay out of billibotton .  you don   t know what they do to women there .         i can guess .  how do i put these knives on my belt .         not the one you   ve got on  mistress .  that   s not a knife belt .  i can sell you one  though .         will it hold two knives .         i might have a double belt somewhere .  not much call for them .         i   m calling for them .         i may not have it in your size .         then we   ll cut it down or something .         it will cost you a lot of credits .         my credit tile will cover it .      when she emerged at last  seldon said sourly     you look ridiculous with that bulky belt .         really  hari .  too ridiculous to go with you to billibotton .  then let   s both go back to the apartment .         no .  i   ll go on by myself .  i   ll be safer by myself .      dors said     there is no use saying that  hari .  we both go back or we both go forward .  under no circumstances do we separate .      and somehow the firm look in her blue eyes  the set to her lips  and the manner in which her hands had dropped to the hafts at her belt  convinced seldon she was serious .      very well      he said     but if you survive and if i ever see hummin again  my price for continuing to work on psychohistory much as i have grown fond of you will be your removal .  do you understand .      and suddenly dors smiled .     forget it .  don   t practice your chivalry on me .  nothing will remove me .  do you understand .           .     they got off the expressway where the sign  flickering in the air  said  billibotton .  as perhaps an indication of what might be expected  the second i was smeared  a mere blob of fainter light .   they made their way out of the car and down to the walkway below .  it was early afternoon and at first glance  billibotton seemed much like the part of dahl they had left .   the air  however  had a pungent aroma and the walkway was littered with crash .  one could tell that auto sweeps were not to  e found in the neighborhood .   and  although the walkway looked ordinary enough  the atmosphere was uncomfortable and as tense as a too tightly coiled spring .   perhaps it was the people .  there seemed the normal number of pedestrians  but they were not like pedestrians elsewhere  seldon thought .  ordinarily  in the press of business  pedestrians were self absorbed and in the endless crowds on the endless thoroughfares of trantor  people could only survive psychologically by ignoring each other .  eyes slid away .  brains were closed off .  there was an artificial privacy with each person enclosed in a velvet fog of his or her own making .  or there was the ritualistic friendliness of an evening promenade in those neighborhoods that indulged in such things .   but here in billibotton  these was neither friendliness nor neutral withdrawal .  at least not where outsiders were concerned .  every person who passed  moving in either direction  turned to stare at seldon and dors .  every pair of eyes  as though attached by invisible cords to the two outsiders  followed them with ill will .   the clothing of the billibottoners tended to be smudged  old  and sometimes corn .  there was a patina of ill washed poverty over them and seldon felt uneasy at the slickness of his own new clothes .   he said     where in billibotton does mother rittah live  do you suppose .         i don   t know      said dors .     you brought us here  so you do the supposing .  i intend to confine myself to the task of protection and i think i   m going to find it necessary to do just that .      seldon said     i assumed it would only be necessary to ask the way of any passerby  but somehow i   m not encouraged to do so .         i don   t blame you .  i don   t think you   ll find anyone springing w your assistance .         on the other hand  there are such things as youngsters .     he indicated one with a brief gesture of one hand .  a boy who looked to be about twelve in any case young enough to lack the universal adult male mustache had come to a full halt and was staring at them .   dors said     you   re guessing that a boy that age has not yet developed the full billibottonian dislike of outsiders .         at any rate      said seldon     i   m guessing he is scarcely large enough to have developed the full billibottonian penchant for violence .  i suppose he might run away and shout insults from a distance if we approach him  but i doubt he   ll attack us .      seldon raised his voice .     young man .      the boy took a step backward and continued to stare .   seldon said     come here      and beckoned .   the boy said     wa    fox  guy .         so i can ask you directions .  come closer  so i don   t have to shout .      the boy approached two steps closer .  his face was smudged  but his eyes were bright and sharp .  his sandals were of different make and there was a large patch on one leg of his trousers .  i he said     wa    kind o    directions .         we   re trying to find mother rittah .      the boy   s eyes flickered .     wa    for  guy .         i   m a scholar .  do you know what a scholar     ya went to school .         yes .  didn   t you .      the boy spat to one side in contempt .     nah .         i want advice from mother rittah if you   ll take me to her .         ya want your fortune .  ya come to billibotton  guy  with your fancy clothes  so  .  can tell ya your fortune .  all bad .         what   s your name  young man .         what   s it to ya .         so we can speak in a more friendly fashion .  and so you can take me to mother rittah   s place .  do you know where she lives .         maybe yes  maybe no .  my name   s raych .  what   s in it for me if i take ya .         what would you like  raych .      the boy   s eyes halted at dors   s belt .  raych said     the lady got a couple o    knives .  gimme one and i   ll take ya to mother rittah .         those are grown people   s knives  raych .  you   re too young .         then i guess i   m too young to know where mother rittah lives .     and he looked up slyly through the shaggy halt that curtained his eyes .   seldon grew uneasy .  it was possible they might attract a crowd .  several men had stopped already  but had then moved on when nothing of interest seemed to be taking place .  if  however  the boy grew angry and lashed out at them in word or deed  people would undoubtedly gather .   he smiled and said     can you read  raych .      raych spat again .     nab .  who wants to read .         can you use a computer .         a talking computer .  sure .  anyone can .         i   ll tell you what  then .  you take me to the nearest computer store and i   ll buy you a little computer all your own and software that will teach you to read .  a few weeks and you   ll be able to read .      it seemed to seldon that the boy   s eyes sparkled at the thought  but if so they hardened at once .      nab  knife or nothin    .         that   s the point  raych .  you learn to read and don   t tell anyone and you can surprise people .  after a while you can bet them you can read .  bet them five credits .  you can win a few extra credits that way and you can buy a knife of your own .      the boy hesitated .     nab .  no one will bet me .  no one got credits .         if you can read  you can get a job in a knife store and you can save your wages and get a knife at a discount .  how about that .         when ya gonna buy the talking computer .         right now .  i   ll give it to you when i see mother rittah .         you got credits .         i have a credit tile .         let   s see ya buy the computer .      the transaction was carried through  but when the boy reached for it  seldon shook his head and put it inside his pouch .     you   ve got to get me to mother rittah first  raych .  are you sure you know where to find her .      raych allowed a look of contempt to cross his face .     sure i do .  i   ll take ya there  only ya better hand over the computer when we get there or i   ll get some guys i know after you and the lady  so ya better watch out .         you don   t have to threaten us      said seldon .     we   ll take care of our end of the deal .      raych led them quickly along the walkway  past curious stares .   seldon was silent during the walk and so was dors .  dors was far less lost in her own thoughts  though  for she clearly remained conscious of the surrounding people at all times .  she kept meeting  with a level glare  the eyes of those passersby that turned toward them .  on occasion  when there were footsteps behind them  she turned to look grimly back .   and then raych stopped and said     in here .  she ain   t homeless  ya know .      they followed him into an apartment complex and seldon  who had had the intention of following their route with a view to retracing his steps later  was quickly lost .   he said     how do you know your way through these alleys  raych .      the boy shrugged .     i been loafin    through them since i was a kid      he said .     besides  the apartments are numbered where they ain   t broken offend there   s arrows and things .  you can   t get lost if you know the tricks .      raych knew the tricks  apparently  and they wandered deeper into the complex .  hanging over it all was an air of total decay  disregarded debris  inhabitants slinking past in clear resentment of the outsiders    invasion .  unruly youngsters ran along the alleys in pursuit of some game or other .  some of them yelled     hey  get out o    the way .     when their levitating ball narrowly missed dors .   and finally  raych stopped before a dark scarred door on which the number      glowed feebly .      this is it      he said and held out his hand .      first let   s see who   s inside      said seldon softly .  he pushed the signal button and nothing happened .      it don   t work      said raych .     ya gotta bang .  loud .  she don   t hear too good .      seldon pounded his fist on the door and was rewarded with the sound of movement inside .  a shrill voice called out     who wants mother rittah .      seldon shouted     two scholars .      he tossed the small computer  with its small package of software attached  to raych  who snatched it  grinned  and took off at a rapid run .  seldon then turned to face the opening door and mother rittah .        .     mother rittah was well into her seventies  perhaps  but had the kind of face that  at first sight  seemed to belie that .  plump cheeks  a little mouth  a small round chin slightly doubled .  she was very short not quite   .   meters tall  and had a thick body .   but there were fine wrinkles about her eyes and when she smiled  as she smiled at the sight of them  others broke out over her face .  and she moved with difficulty .      come in  come in      she said in a soft high pitched voice and peered at them as though her eyesight was beginning to fail .     outsiders  .   .   .  outworlders even .  am i right .  you don   t seem to have the trantor smell about you .      seldon wished she hadn   t mentioned smell .  the apartment  overcrowded and littered with small possessions that seemed dim and dusty  reeked with food odors that were on the edge of rancidity .  the air was so thick and clinging that he was sure his cloches would smell strongly of it when they left .   he said     you are sight  mother rittah .  i am hari seldon of helicon .  my friend is dors venabili of cinna .         so      she said  looking about for an unoccupied spot on the floor where she could invite them to sit  but finding none suitable .   dors said     we are willing to stand  mother .         what .     she looked up at dors .     you must speak briskly  my child .  my hearing is not what it was when i was your age .         why don   t you get a hearing device .     said seldon  raising his voice .      it wouldn   t help  master seldon .  something seems to be wrong with the nerve and i have no money for nerve rebuilding .   you have come to learn the future from old mother rittah .         not quite      said seldon .     i have come to learn the past .         excellent .  it is such a strain to decide what people want to hear .         it must  e quite an art      said dors  smiling .      it seems easy  but one has to he properly convincing .  i earn my fees .         if you have a credit outlet      said seldon .     we will pay any reasonable fees if you tell us about earth without cleverly designing what you tell us to suit what we want to hear .  we wish to hear the truth .      the old woman  who had been shuffling about the room  making adjustments here and there  as though to make it all prettier and more suitable for important visitors  stopped shots .     what do you want to know about earth .         what is it  to begin with .      the old woman turned and seemed to gaze off into space .  when she spoke  her voice was low and steady .      it is a world  a very old planet .  it is forgotten and lost .      dors said     it is not part of history .  we know that much .         it comes before history  child      said mother rittah solemnly .     it existed in the dawn of the galaxy and before the dawn .  it was the only world with humanity .     she nodded firmly .   seldon said     was another name for earth  .   .   .  aurora .      and now mother rittah   s face misted into a frown .     where did you hear that .         in my wanderings .  i have heard of an old forgotten world named aurora on which humanity lived in primordial peace .         it   s a lie .      she wiped her mouth as though to get the taste of what she had just heard out of it .     that name you mention must never be mentioned except as the place of evil .  it was the beginning of evil .  earth was alone till evil came  along with its sister worlds .  evil nearly destroyed earth  but earth rallied and destroyed evil with the help of heroes .         earth was before this evil .  are you sure of that .         long before .  earth was alone in the galaxy for thousands of years millions of years .         millions of years .  humanity existed on it for millions of years with no other people on any other world .         that   s true .  that   s true .  that   s true .          but how do you know all this .  is it all in a computer program .  or a printout .  do you have anything i can read .      mother rittah shook her head .     i heard the old stories from my mother  who heard it from hers  and so on far back .  i have no children  so i tell the stories to others  but it may come to an end .  this is a time of disbelief .      dors said     not really  mother .  there are people who speculate about prehistoric times and who study some of the tales of lost worlds .      mother rittah made a motion of her arm as though to wipe it away .     they look at it with cold eyes .  scholarly .  they try to fit it in with their notions .  i could tell you stories for a year of the great hero ba lee  but you would have no time to listen and i have lost the strength to tell .      seldon said     have you ever heard of robots .      the old woman shuddered and her voice was almost a scream .     why do you ask such things .  those were artificial human beings  evil in themselves and the work of the evil worlds .  they were destroyed and should never be mentioned .         there was one special robot  wasn   t there  that the evil worlds hated .      mother rittah tottered toward seldon and peered into his eyes .  he could feel her hot breath on his face .     have you come to mock me .  you know of these things and yet you ask .  why do you ask .         because i wish to know .         there was an artificial human being who helped earth .  he was danee  friend of ba lee .  he never died and lives somewhere  waiting for his time to return .  none knows when that time will be  but someday he will come and restore the great old days and remove all cruelty  injustice  and misery .  that is the promise .     at this  she closed her eyes and smiled  as if remembering  .   .   .   seldon waited a while in silence  then sighed and said     thank you  mother rittah .  you have been very helpful .  what is your fee .         so pleasant to meet outworlders      the old woman replied .     ten credits .  may i offer you some refreshment .         no  thank you      said seldon earnestly .     please take twenty .  you need only tell us how to get back to the expressway from here .   and  mother rittah  if you can arrange to have some of your tales of earth put into a computer disc  i will pay you well .         i would need so much strength .  how well .         it would depend on how long the story is and how well it is told .  i might pay a thousand credits .      mother rittah licked her lips .     a thousand credits .  but how will i find you when the story is told .         i will give you the computer code number at which i can be reached .      after seldon gave mother rittah the code number  he and dors left  thankful for the comparatively clean odor of the alley outside .  they walked briskly in the direction indicated by the old woman .   dors said     that wasn   t a very long interview  hari .         i know .  the surroundings were terribly unpleasant and i felt i had learned enough .  amazing how these folktales tend to magnify .         what do you mean     magnify    .         well  the mycogenians fill their aurora with human beings who lived for centuries and the dahlites fill their earth with a humanity that lived for millions of years .  and both talk of a robot that lives forever .  still  it makes one think .         as far as millions of years go  there   s room for where are we going .         mother rittah said we go in this direction till we reach a rest area  then follow the sign for central walkway  bearing left  and keep on following the sign .  did we pass a rest area on the way in .  .       we may be leaving by a route different from the one we came in .  i don   t remember a rest area  but i wasn   t watching the route .  i was keeping my eye on the people we passed and      her voice died away .  up ahead the alley swelled outward on both sides .   seldon remembered .  they had passed that way .  there had been a couple of ratty couch pads resting on the walkway floor on either side .   there was  however  no need for dors to watch passersby going out as she had coming in .  there were no passersby .  but up ahead in the rest area they spotted a group of men  rather large sized for dahlites  mustaches bristling  bare upper arms muscular and glistening under the yellowish indoor light of the walkway .   clearly  they were waiting for the outworlders and  almost automatically  seldon and dors came to a halt .  for a moment or two  the tableau held .  then seldon looked behind him hastily .  two or three additional men had stepped into view .   seldon said between his teeth     we   re trapped .  i should not have let you come  dors .             on the contrary .  this is why i   m here  but was it worth your seeing mother rittah .         if we get out of this  it was .      seldon then said in a loud and firm voice     may we pass .      one of the men ahead stepped forward .  he was fully seldon   s height of   .    meters  but broader in the shoulders and much more muscular .  a bit flabby at the waist  though  seldon noted .      i   m marron      he said with self satisfied significance  as though the name ought to have meaning     and i   m here to tell you we don   t like outworlders in our district .  you want to come in  all right  but if you want to leave  you   ll have to pay .         very well .  how much .         all you   ve got .  you rich outworlders have credit tiles  right .  just hand them over .         no .         no point saying no .  we   ll just take them .         you can   t take them without killing me or hurting me and they won   t work without my voiceprint .  my normal voiceprint .         that   s not so  master see  i   m being polite we can take them away from you without hurting you very much .         how many of you big strong men will it take .  nine .  no .     seldon counted rapidly .     ten .         just one .  me .         with no help .          just me .         if the rest of you will clear away and give us room  i would like to see you cry it  marron .         you don   t have a knife  master .  you want one .         no  use yours to make the fight even .  i   ll fight without one .      marron looked about at the others and said     hey  this puny guy is a sport .  he don   t even sound scared .  that   s sort of nice .  it would be a shame to hurt him .   i tell you what  master .  i   ll take the girl .  if you want me to stop  hand over your credit tile and her tile and use your right voices to activate them .  if you say no  then after i   m through with the girl  .   .   .  and that   ll take some time    he laughed     i   ll just have to hurt you .         no      said seldon .     let the woman go .  i   ve challenged you to a fight one to one  you with a knife  me without .  if you want bigger odds  i   ll fight two of you  but let the woman go .         stop  hari .     cried out dors .     if he wants me  let him come and get me .  you stay right where you are  hari  and don   t move .         you hear that .     said marron  grinning broadly .        you stay right where you are  hari  and don   t move .     i think the little lady wants me .  you two  keep him still .      each of seldon   s arms were caught in an iron grip and he felt the sharp point of a knife in his back .      don   t move      said a harsh whisper in his ear     and you can watch .  the lady will probably like it .  marron   s pretty good at this .      dors called out again .     don   t move  hari .     she corned to face marron watchfully  her half closed hands poised near her belt .   he closed in on her purposefully and she waited till he had come within arm   s length  when suddenly her own arms flashed and marron found himself facing two large knives .   for a moment  he leaned backward and then he laughed .     the little lady has two knives knives like the big boys have .  and i   ve only got one .  but that   s fair enough .     his knife was swiftly out .     i hate to have to cut you  little lady  because it will be more fun for both of us if i don   t .  maybe i can just knock them out of your hands  huh .      dors said     i don   t want to kill you .  i   ll do all i can to avoid doing so .  just the same  i call on all to witness  that if i do kill you  it is to protect my friend  as i am honor bound to do .      macron pretended to be terrified .     oh  please don   t kill me  little lady .     then he burst into laughter and was joined by the other dahlites present .   macron lunged with his knife  quite wide of the mark .  he tried it again  then a third time  but dors never budged .  she made no attempt to fend off any motion that was not truly aimed at her .   macron   s expression darkened .  he was trying to make her respond with panic  but he was only making himself seem ineffectual .  the next lunge was directly at her and dors   s left hand blade moved flashingly and caught his with a force that pushed his arm aside .  her right hand blade flashed inward and made a diagonal slit in his t shirt .  a thin bloody line smeared the dark haired skin beneath .   macron looked down at himself in shock as the onlookers gasped in surprise .  seldon felt the grip on him weaken slightly as the two who held him were distracted by a duel not going quite as they had expected .  he tensed himself .   now macron lunged again and this time his left hand shot outward to enclose dors   s right wrist .  again dors   s left hand blade caught his knife and held it motionless  while her right hand twisted agilely and drew downward  even as macron   s left hand closed upon it .  it closed on nothing but the blade and when he opened his hand there was a bloody line down the palm .   dors sprang back and macron  aware of the blood on his chest and hand  roared out chokingly     someone toss me another knife .      there was hesitation and then one of the onlookers tossed his own knife underhanded .  macron reached for it  but dors was quicker .  her right hand blade struck the thrown knife and sent it flying backward  whirling as it went .   seldon felt the grips on his arms weaken further .  he lifted them suddenly  pushing up and forward  and was free .  his two captors turned toward him with a sudden shout  but he quickly kneed one in the groin and elbowed the other in the solar plexus and both went down .   he knelt to draw the knives of each and rose as double armed as dors .  unlike dors  seldon did not know how to handle the blades  but he knew the dahlites would scarcely be aware of that  dor said      just keep them off  hari .  don   t attack yet .   macron  my next stroke will not be a scratch .      macron  totally enraged  roared incoherently and charged blindly  attempting by sheer kinetic energy to overwhelm his opponent .  dors  dipping and sidestepping  ducked under his right arm  kicked her foot against his right ankle  and down he crashed  his knife flying .   she then knelt  placed one blade against the back of his neck and the other against his throat  and said     yield .      with another yell  macron struck out against her with one arm  pushed her to one side  then scrambled to his feet .   he had not yet stood up completely when she was upon him  one knife slashing downward and hacking away a section of his mustache .  this time he yowled like a large animal in agony  clapping his hand to his face .  when he drew it away  it was dripping blood .   dors shouted     it won   t grow again  macron .  some of the lip went with it .  attack once more and you   re dead meat .      she waited  but macron had had enough .  he stumbled away  moaning  leaving a trail of blood .   dors turned toward the others .  the two that seldon had knocked down were still lying there  unarmed and not anxious to get up .  she bent down  cut their belts with one of her knives and then slit their trousers .      this way  you   ll have to hold your pants up when you walk      she said .   she stared at the seven men still on their feet  who were watching her with awestruck fascination .     and which of you threw the knife .      there was silence .   she said     it doesn   t matter to me .  come one at a time or all together  but each time i slash  someone dies .      and with one accord  the seven turned and scurried away .   dors lifted her eyebrows and said to seldom    this time  at least  hummin can   t complain that i failed to protect you .      seldon said     i still can   t believe what i saw .  i didn   t know you could do anything like that  or talk like that either .      dors merely smiled .     you have your talents too .  we make a good pair .  here  retract your knife blades and put them into your pouch .  i think the news will spread with enormous speed and we can get out of billibotton without fear of being stopped .      she was quite right .     undercover    davan   .   .   .  in the unsettled times marking the final centuries of the first galactic empire  the typical sources of unrest arose from the fact that political and military leaders jockeyed for    supreme    power  a supremacy that grew more worthless with each decade  .  only rarely was there anything that could be called a popular movement prior to the advent of psychohistory .  in this connection  one intriguing example involves davan  of whom little is actually known  but who may have met with hari seldon at one time when  .   .   .   encyclopedia galactica       .     both hari seldon and dors venabili had taken rather lingering baths  making use of the somewhat primitive facilities available to them in the tisalver household .  they had changed their clothing and were in seldon   s room when jirad tisalver returned in the evening .  his signal at the door was  or seemed  rather timid .  the buzz did not last long .   seldon opened the door and said pleasantly     good evening  master tisalver .  and mistress .      she was standing right behind her husband  forehead puckered into a puzzled frown .   tisalver said tentatively  as though he was unsure of the situation     are you and mistress venabili both well .     he nodded his head as though trying to elicit an affirmative by body language .      quite well .  in and out of billibotton without trouble and we   re all washed and changed .  there   s no smell left .     seldon lifted his chin as he said it  smiling  tossing the sentence over tisalver s shoulder to his wife .   she sniffed loudly  as though testing the matter .   still tentatively  tisalver said     i understand there was a knife fight .      seldon raised his eyebrows .     is that the story .         you and the mistress against a hundred thugs  we were cold  and you killed them all .  is that so .     there was the reluctant sound of deep respect in his voice .      absolutely not      dors put in with sudden annoyance .     that   s ridiculous .  what do you think we are .  mass murderers .  and do you think a hundred thugs would remain in place  waiting the considerable time it would take me us to kill them all .  i mean  think about it .         that   s what they   re saying      said casilia tisalver with shrill firmness .     we can   t have that sort of thing in this house .         in the first place      said seldon     it wasn   t in this house .  in the second  it wasn   t a hundred men  it was ten .  in the third  no one was killed .  there was some altercation back and forth  after which they left and made way for us .         they just made way .  do you expect me to believe that  outworlders .     demanded mistress tisalver belligerently .   seldon sighed .  at the slightest stress  human beings seemed to divide themselves into antagonistic groups .  he said     well  i grant you one of them was cut a little .  not seriously .         and you weren   t hurt at all .     said tisalver .  the admiration in his voice was more marked .      not a scratch      said seldon .     mistress venabili handles two knives excellently well .         i dare say      said mistress tisalver  her eyes dropping to dors   s belt     and that   s not what i want to have going on here .      dors said sternly     as long as no one attacks us here  that   s what you won   t have here .         but on account of you      said mistress tisalver     we have trash from the street standing at the doorway .         my love      said tisalver soothingly     let us not anger          why .     spat his wife with contempt .     are you afraid of her knives .  i would like to see her use them here .         i have no intention of using them here      said dors with a sniff as loud as any that mistress tisalver had produced .     what is this trash from the street you   re talking about .      tisalver said     what my wife means is that an urchin from billibotton at least  judging by his appearance wishes to see you and we are not accustomed to that sort of thing in this neighborhood .  it undermines our standing .     he sounded apologetic .   seldon said     well  master tisalver  we   ll go outside  find out what it   s all about  and send him on his business as quickly          no .  wait      said dors  annoyed .     these are our rooms .  we pay for them .  we decide who visits us and who does not .  if there is a young man outside from billibotton  he is nonetheless a dahlite .  more important  he   s a trantorian .  still more important  he   s a citizen of the empire and a human being .  most important  by asking to see us  he becomes our guest .  therefore  we invite him in to see us .      mistress tisalver didn   t move .  tisalver himself seemed uncertain .   dors said     since you say i killed a hundred bullies in billibotton  you surely do not think i am afraid of a boy or  for that matter  of you two .     her right hand dropped casually to her belt .   tisalver said with sudden energy     mistress venabili  we do not intend to offend you .  of course these rooms are yours and you can entertain whomever you wish here .     he stepped back  pulling his indignant wife with him  undergoing a burst of resolution for which he might conceivably have to pay afterward .   dors looked after them sternly .   seldon smiled dryly .     how unlike you  dors .  i thought i was the one who quixotically got into trouble and that you were the calm and practical one whose only aim was to prevent trouble .      dors shook her head .     i can   t bear to hear a human being spoken of with contempt just because of his group identification even by other human beings .  it   s these respectable people here who create those hooligans out there .         and other respectable people      said seldon     who create these respectable people .  these mutual animosities are as much a part of humanity          then you   ll have to deal with it in your psychohistory  won   t you .         most certainly if there is ever a psychohistory with which to deal with anything at all .   ah  here comes the urchin under discussion .  and it   s raych  which somehow doesn   t surprise me .           .     raych entered  looking about  clearly intimidated .  the forefinger of his right hand reached for his upper lip as though wondering when he would begin to feel the first downy hairs there .   he turned to the clearly outraged mistress tisalver and bowed clumsily .     thank ya  missus .  ya got a lovely place .      then  as the door slammed behind him  he turned to seldon and dors with an air of easy connoisseurship .     nice place  guys .         i   m glad you like it      said seldon solemnly .     how did you know we were here .         followed ya .  how   d ya think .  hey  lady    he turned to dors     you don   t fight like no dame .         have you watched many dames fight .     asked dors  amused .   raych rubbed his nose     no  never seen none whatever .  they don   t carry knives  except little ones to scare kids with .  never scared me .         i   m sure they didn   t .  what do you do to make dames draw their knives .         nothin    .  you just kid around a little .  you holler     hey  lady  lemme          he thought about it for a moment and said     nothin    .      dors said     well  don   t try that on me .         ya kiddin    .  after what ya did to marron .  hey  lady  where   d you learn to fight that way .         on my own world .         could ya teach me .         is that what you came here to see me about .         akchaly  no .  i came to bring ya a kind of message .         from someone who wants to fight me .         no one wants to fight ya  lady .  listen  lady  ya got a reputation now .  everybody knows ya .  you just walk down anywhere in old billibotton and all the guys will step aside and let ya pass and grin and make sure they don   t look cross eyed at ya .  oh  lady  ya got it made .  that   s why he wants to see ya .      seldon said     raych  just exactly who wants to see us .         guy called davan .         and who is he .         just a guy .  he lives in billibotton and don   t carry no knife .         and he stays alive  raych .         he reads a lot and he helps the guys there when they get in trouble with the gov   ment .  they kinda leave him alone .  he don   t need no knife .         why didn   t he come himself  then .     said dors .     why did he send you .         he don   t like this place .  he says it makes him sick .  he says all the people here  they lick the gov   ment    s      he paused  looked dubiously at the two outworlders  and said     anyway  he won   t come here .  he said they   d let me in cause i was only a kid .     he grinned .     they almost didn   t  did they .  i mean that lady there who looked like she was smellin    somethin    .      he stopped suddenly  abashed  and looked down at himself .     ya don   t get much chance to wash where i come from .         it   s all right      said dors  smiling .     where are we supposed to meet  then  if he won   t come here .  after all if you don   t mind we don   t feel like going to billibotton .         i told ya      said raych indignantly .     ya get free run of billibotton  i swear .  besides  where he lives no one will bother ya .         where is it .     asked seldon .      i can take ya there .  it ain   t far .         and why does he want to see us .     asked dors .      dunno .  but he says like this      raych half closed his eyes in an effort to remember .        tell them i wanna see the man who talked to a dahlite heatsinker like he was a human being and the woman who beat marron with knives and didn   t kill him when she mighta done so .     i think i got it right .      seldon smiled .     i think you did .  is he ready for us now .         he   s waiting .         then we   ll come with you .     he looked at dors with a trace of doubt in his eyes .   she said     all right .  i   m willing .  perhaps it won   t be a trap of some sort .  hope springs eternal            .     there was a pleasant glow to the evening light when they emerged  a faint violet touch and a pinkish edge to the simulated sunset clouds that were scudding along .  dahl might have complaints of their treatment by the imperial rulers of trantor  but surely there was nothing wrong with the weather the computers spun out for them .   dors said in a low voice     we seem to be celebrities .  no mistake about that .      seldon brought his eyes down from the supposed sky and was immediately aware of a fair sized crowd around the apartment house in which the tisalvers lived .   everyone in the crowd stared at them intently .  when it was clear that the two outworlders had become aware of the attention  a low murmur ran through the crowd  which seemed to be on the point of breaking out into applause .   dors said     now i can see where mistress tisalver would find this annoying .  i should have been a little more sympathetic .      the crowd was  for the most part  poorly dressed and it was not hard to guess that many of the people were from billibotton .   on impulse  seldon smiled and raised one hand in a mild greeting that was met with applause .  one voice  lost in the safe anonymity of the crowd called out     can the lady show us some knife tricks .      when dors called back     no  i only draw in anger      there was instant laughter .   one man stepped forward .  he was clearly not from billibotton and bore no obvious mark of being a dahlite .  he had only a small mustache  for one thing  and it was brown  not black .  he said     marlo tanto of the    trantorian hv news .     can we have you in focus for a bit for our nightly holocast .         no      said dors shortly .     no interviews .      the newsman did not budge .     i understand you were in a fight with a great many men in billibotton  and won .     he smiled .     that   s news  that is .         no      said dors .     we met some men in billibotton  talked to them  and then moved on .  that   s all there is to it and that   s all you   re going to get .         what   s your name .  you don   t sound like a trantorian .         i have no name .         and your friend   s name .         he has no name .      the newsman looked annoyed     look  lady .  you   re news and i   m just trying to do my job .      raych pulled at dors   s sleeve .  she leaned down and listened to his earnest whisper .   she nodded and straightened up again .     i don   t think you   re a newsman  mr .  tanto .  what i think you are is an imperial agent trying to make trouble for dahl .  there was no fight and you   re trying to manufacture news concerning one as a way of justifying an imperial expedition into billibotton .  i wouldn   t stay here if i were you .  i don   t think you   re very popular with these people .      the crowd had begun to mutter at dors   s first words .  they grew louder now and began to drift  slowly and in a menacing way  in the direction of tanto .  he looked nervously around and began to move away .   dors raised her voice .     let him go .  don   t anyone touch him .  don   t give him any excuse to report violence .      and they parted before him .   raych said     aw  lady  you shoulda let them rough him up .         bloodthirsty boy      said dors     take us to this friend of yours .           .     they met the man who called himself davan in a room behind a dilapidated diner .  far behind .   raych led the way  once more showing himself as much at home in the burrows of billibotton as a mole would be in tunnels underground in helicon .   it was dors venabili whose caution first manifested itself .  she stopped and said     come back  raych .  exactly where are we going .         to davan      said raych  looking exasperated .     i told ya .         but this is a deserted area .  there   s no one living here .     dors looked about with obvious distaste .  the surroundings were lifeless and what light panels were there were did not glower did so only dimly .      it   s the way davan likes it      said raych .     he   s always changing around  staying here  staying there .  ya know  .   .   .  changing around .         why .     demanded dors .      it   s safer  lady .         from whom .         from the gov   ment        why would the government want davan .         i dunno  lady .  tell ya what .  i   ll tell ya where he is and tell ya how to go and ya go on alone if ya don   t want me to take ya .      seldon said     no  raych  i   m pretty sure we   ll get lost without you .  in fact  you had better wait till we   re through so you can lead us back .      raych said at once     what   s in it f   me .  ya expect me to hang around when i get hungry .         you hang around and get hungry  raych  and i   ll buy you a big dinner .  anything you like .         ya say that now .  mister .  how do i know .      dors   s hand flashed and it was holding a knife  blade exposed     you   re not calling us liars  are you  raych .      raych   s eyes opened wide .  he did not seem frightened by the threat .  he said     hey  i didn   t see that .  do it again .         i   ll do it afterward if you   re still here .  otherwise    dors glared at him    we   ll track you down .         aw  lady  come on      said raych .     ya ain   t gonna track me down .  ya ain   t that kind .  but i   ll be here .     he struck a pose .     ya got my word .      and he led them onward in silence  though the sound of their shoes was hollow in the empty corridors .   davan looked up when they entered  a wild look that softened when he saw raych .  he gestured quickly toward the two others questioningly .   raych said     these are the guys .     and  grinning  he left .   seldon said     i am hari seldon .  the young lady is dors venabili .      he regarded davan curiously .  davan was swarthy and had the thick black mustache of the dahlite male  but in addition he had a stubble of beard .  he was the first dahlite whom seldon had seen who had not been meticulously shaven .  even the bullies of billibotton had been smooth of cheek and chin .   seldon said     what is your name  sir .         davan .  raych must have told you .         your second name .         i am only davan .  were you followed here  master seldon .         no  i   m sure we weren   t .  if we had  then by sound or sight  i expect raych would have known .  and if he had not  mistress venabili would have .      dors smiled slightly .     you have faith in me  hari .         more all the time      he said thoughtfully .   davan stirred uneasily .     yet you   ve already been found .         found .         yes  i have heard of this supposed newsman .         already .     seldon looked faintly surprised .     but i suspect he really was a newsman  .   .   .  and harmless .  we tatted him an imperial agent at raych   s suggestion  which was a good idea .  the surrounding crowd grew threatening and we got rid of him .         no      said davan     he was what you called him .  my people know the man and he does work for the empire .    but then you do not do as i do .  you do not use a false name and change your place of abode .  you go under your own names  making no effort to remain undercover .  you are hari seldon  the mathematician .         yes  i am      said seldon .     why should i invent a false name .         the empire wants you  does it not .      seldon shrugged .     i stay in places where the empire cannot reach out to take me .         not openly  but the empire doesn   t have to work openly .  i would urge you to disappear  .   .   .  really disappear .         like you  .   .   .  as you say      said seldom looking about with an edge of distaste .  the room was as dead as the corridors he had walked through .  it was musty through and through and it was overwhelmingly depressing .      yes      said davan .     you could be useful to us .         in what way .         you talked to a young man named yugo amaryl .         yes  i did .         amaryl tells me that you can predict the future .      seldon sighed heavily .  he was tired of standing in this empty room .  davan was sitting on a cushion and there were other cushions available  but they did not look clean .  nor did he wish to lean against the mildew streaked wall .   he said     either you misunderstood amaryl or amaryl misunderstood me .  what i have done is to prove that it is possible to choose staffing conditions from which historical forecasting does not descend into chaotic conditions  but can become predictable within limits .  however  what those starting conditions might be i do not know  nor am i sure that those conditions can be found by any one person  or by any number of people in a finite length of time .  do you understand me .         no .      seldon sighed again .     then let me try once more .  it is possible to predict the future  but it may be impossible to find out how to take advantage of that possibility .  do you understand .      davan looked at seldon darkly  then at dors .     then you cant predict the future .         now you have the point  master davan .         just call me davan .  but you may be able to learn to predict the future someday .         that is conceivable .         then that   s why the empire wants you .         no      seldon raised his finger didactically .     it   s my idea that that is why the empire is not making an overwhelming effort to get me .  they might like to have me if i can be picked up without trouble  but they know that right now i know nothing and that it is therefore not worth upsetting the delicate peace of trantor by interfering with the local rights of this sector or that .  that   s the reason i can move about under my own name with reasonable security .      for a moment  davan buried his head in his hands and muttered     this is madness .     then he looked up wearily and said to dors     are you master seldon   s wife .      dors said calmly     i am his friend and protector .         how well do you know him .         we have been together for some months .         no more .         no more .         would it be your opinion he is speaking the truth .         i know he is  but what reason would you have to crust me if you do not trust him .  if hari is  for some reason  lying to you  might i not be lying to you equally in order to support him .      davan looked from one to the other helplessly .  then he said     would you  in any case  help us .         who are    us    and in what way do you need help .      davan said     you see the situation here in dahl .  we are oppressed .  you must know that and  from your treatment of yugo amaryl  i cannot believe you lack sympathy for us .         we are fully sympathetic .         and you must know the source of the oppression .         you are going to cell me that it   s the imperial government  i suppose  and i dare say it plays its part .  on the other hand  i notice that there is a middle class in dahl that despises the heatsinkers and a criminal class that terrorizes the rest of the sector .      davan   s lips tightened  but he remained unmoved .     quite true .  quite true .  but the empire encourages it as a matter of principle .  dahl has the potential for making serious trouble .  if the heatsinkers should go on strike  trantor would experience a severe energy shortage almost at once  .   .   .  with all that that implies .  however   dahl   s own upper classes will spend money to hire the hoodlums of billibotton   and of other places to fight the heatsinkers and break the strike .  it has happened before .  the empire allows some dahlites to prosper comparatively in order to convert them into imperialist lackeys  while it refuses to enforce the arms control laws effectively enough to weaken the criminal element     the imperial government does this everywhere  and not in dahl alone .  they can   t exert force to impose their will  as in the old days when they ruled with brutal directness .  nowadays  trantor has grown so complex and so easily disturbed that the imperial forces must keep their hands off          a form of degeneration      said seldon  remembering hummin   s complaints .      what .     said davan .      nothing      said seldon .     go on .         the imperial forces must keep their hands off  but they find that they can do much even so .  each sector is encouraged to be suspicious of its neighbours .  within each sector  economic and social classes are encouraged to wage a kind of war with each other .  the result is that all over trantor it is impossible for the people to take united action .  everywhere  the people would rather fight each other than make a common stand against the central tyranny and the empire rules without having to exert force .         and what      said dors     do you think can be done about it .         i   ve been trying for years to build a feeling of solidarity among the peoples of trantor .         i can only suppose      said seldon dryly     that you are finding this an impossibly difficult and largely thankless task .         you suppose correctly      said davan     but the party is growing stronger .  many of our knifers are coming to the realization that knives are best when they are not used on each other .  those who attacked you in the corridors of billibotton are examples of the unconverted .  however  those who support you now  who are ready to defend you against the agent you thought was a newsman  are my people .  i live here among them .  it is not an attractive way of life  but i am safe here .  we have adherents in neighboring sectors and we spread daily .         but where do we come in .     asked dors .      for one thing      said davan     both of you are outworlders  scholars .  we need people like you among our leaders .  our greatest strength is drawn from the poor and the uneducated because they suffer the most  but they can lead the least .  a person like one of you two is worth a hundred of them .         that   s an odd estimate from someone who wishes to rescue the oppressed      said seldon .      i don   t mean as people      said davan hastily .     i mean as far as leadership is concerned .  the party must have among its leaders men and women of intellectual power .         people like us  you mean  are needed to give your party a veneer of respectability .      davan said     you can always put something noble in a sneering fashion if you try .  but you  master seldon  are more than respectable  more than intellectual .  even if you won   t admit to being able to penetrate the mists of the future           please  davan      said seldon     don   t be poetic and don   t use the conditional .  it   s not a matter of admitting .  i can   t foresee the future .  those are not mists that block the view but chrome steel barriers .         let me finish .  even if you can   t actually predict with what do you call it .  psychohistorical accuracy  you   ve studied history and you may have a certain intuitive feeling for consequences .  now  isn   t that so .      seldon shook his head .     i may have a certain intuitive understanding for mathematical likelihood  but how far i can translate that into anything of historical significance is quite uncertain .  actually  i have not studied history .  i wish i had .  i feel the loss keenly .      dors said evenly     i am the historian  davan  and i can say a few things if you wish .         please do      said davan  making it half a courtesy  half a challenge .      for one thing  there have been many revolutions in galactic history that have overthrown tyrannies  sometimes on individual planets  sometimes in groups of them  occasionally in the empire itself or in the pre imperial regional governments .  often  this has only meant a change in tyranny .  in other words  one ruling class is replaced by another sometimes by one that is more efficient and therefore still more capable of maintaining itself while the poor and downtrodden remain poor and downtrodden or become even worse off .      davan  listening intently  said     i   m aware of that .  we all are .  perhaps we can learn from the past and know better what to avoid .  besides  the tyranny that now exists is actual .  that which may exist in the future is merely potential .  if we are always to draw back from change with the thought that the change may be for the worse  then there is no hope at all of ever escaping injustice .      dors said     a second point you must remember is that even if you have right on your side  even if justice thunders condemnation  it is usually the tyranny in existence that has the balance of force on its side .  there is nothing your knife handlers can do in the way of rioting and demonstrating that will have any permanent effect as long as  in the extremity  there is an army equipped with kinetic  chemical  and neurological weapons that is willing to use them against your people .  you can get all the downtrodden and even all the respectables on your side  but you must somehow win over the security forces and the imperial army or at least seriously weaken their loyalty to the rulers .      davan said     trantor is a multigovernmental world .  each sector has its own rulers and some of them are themselves anti imperial .  if we can have a strong sector on our side  that would change the situation  would it not .  we would then not be merely ragamuffins fighting with knives and stones .         does that mean you do have a strong sector on your side or merely that it is your ambition to have one .      davan was silent .   dors said     i shall assume that you are thinking of the mayor of wye .  if the mayor is in the mood to make use of popular discontent as a way of improving the chance of toppling the emperor  doesn   t it strike you that the end the mayor would have in view would be that of succeeding to the imperial throne .  why should the mayor risk his present not inconsiderable position for anything less .  merely for the blessings of justice and the decent treatment of people  concerning whom he can have little interest .         you mean      said davan     that any powerful leader who is willing to help us may then betray us .         it is a situation that is all too common in galactic history .         if we are ready for that  might we not betray him .         you mean  make use of him and then  at some crucial moment  subvert the leader of his forces  or a leader  at any race  and have him assassinated .         not perhaps exactly like that  but some way of getting rid of him might exist if that should prove necessary .         then we have a revolutionary movement in which the principal players must be ready to betray each other  with each simply waiting for the opportunity .  it sounds like a recipe for chaos .         you will not help us  then .     said davan .   seldon  who had been listening to the exchange between davan and dors with a puzzled frown on his face  said     we can   t put it that simply .  we would like to help you .  we are on your side .  it seems to me that no sane man wants to uphold an imperial system that maintains itself by fostering mutual hatred and suspicions .  even when it seems to work  it can only be described as metastable  that is  as too apt to fall into instability in one direction or another .  but the question is  how can we help .  if i had psychohistory  if i could tell what is most likely to happen  or if i could tell what action of a number of alternative possibilities is most likely to bring on an apparently happy consequence  then i would put my abilities at your disposal .    but i don   t have is i can help you best by trying to develop psychohistory .         and how long will that take .      seldon shrugged .     i cannot say .         how can you ask us to wait indefinitely .         what alternative do i have  since i am useless to you as i am .  but i will say this  i have until very recently been quite convinced that the development of psychohistory was absolutely impossible .  now i am not so certain of that .         you mean you have a solution in mind .         no  merely an intuitive feeling that a solution might be possible .  i have not been able to pin down what has occurred to make me have that feeling .  it may be an illusion  but i am trying .  let me continue to try .   perhaps the will meet again .         or perhaps      said davan     if you return to where you are now staying  you will eventually find yourself in an imperial trap .  you may think that the empire will leave you alone white you struggle with psychohistory  but i am certain the emperor and his toady demerzel are in no mood to wait forever  any more than i am .         it will do them no good to hasten      said seldon calmly     since i am not on their side  as i am on yours .   come  dors .      they turned and left davan  sitting alone in his squalid room  and found raych waiting for them outside .        .     raych was eating  licking his fingers  and crumpling the bag in which the food whatever it was had been .  a strong smell of onions pervaded the air different somehow  yeast based perhaps .   dors  recreating a little from the odor  said     where did you get the food from  raych .         davan   s guys .  they brought it to me .  davan   s okay .         then we don   t have to buy you dinner  do we .     said seldon  conscious of his own empty stomach .      ya owe me somethin       said raych  looking greedily in dors   s direction .     how about the lady   s knife .  one of    em .         no knife      said dors .     you get us back safely and i   ll give you five credits .         can   t get no knife for five credits      grumbled raych .      you   re not getting anything but five credits      said dors .      you   re a lousy dame  lady      said raych .      i   m a lousy dame with a quick knife  raych  so get moving .         all right .  don   t get all perspired .     raych waved his hand .     this way .      it was back through the empty corridors  but this time dors  looking this way and that  stopped .     hold on  raych .  we   re being followed .      raych looked exasperated .     ya ain   t supposed to hear    em .      seldon said  bending his head to one side     i don   t hear anything .         i do      said dors .     now  raych  i don   t want any fooling around .  you tell me right now what   s going on or i   ll rap your head so that you won   t see straight for a week .  i mean it .      raych held up one arm defensively .     you try it  you lousy dame .  you try it .   it   s davan   s guys .  they   re just taking care of us  in case any knifers come along .         davan   s guys .         yeah .  they   re goin    along the service corridors .      dors   s right hand shot out and seized raych by the scruff of his upper garment .  she lifted and he dangled  shouting     hey  lady .  hey .      seldon said     dors .  don   t be hard on him .         i   ll be harder still if i think he   s lying .  you   re my charge  hari  not he .         i   m not lyin         said raych  struggling .     i   m not .         i   m sure he isn   t      said seldon .      well  we   ll see .  raych  tell them to come out where we can see them .     she let him drop and dusted her hands .      you   re some kind of nut  lady      said raych aggrievedly .  then he raised his voice .     yay  davan .  come out here  some of ya guys .      there was a wait and then  from an unlit opening along the corridor  two dark mustached men came out  one with a scar running the length of his cheek .  each held the sheath of a knife in his hand  blade withdrawn .      how many more of you are there .     asked dors harshly .      a few      said one of the newcomers .     orders .  we   re guarding you .  davan wants you safe .         thank you .  try to be even quieter .  raych  keep on moving .      raych said sulkily     ya toughed me up when i was telling the truth .         you   re right      said dors .     at least  i think you   re right  .   .   .  and i apologize .         i   m not sure i should accept      said raych  trying to stand tall .     but awright  just this once .     he moved on .   when they reached the walkway  the unseen corps of guards vanished .  at least  even dors   s keen ears could hear them no more .  by now  though  they were moving into the respectable part of the sector .   dors said thoughtfully     i don   t think we have clothes that would fit you  raych .      raych said     why do ya want clothes to fit me  missus .      respectability seemed to invade raych once they were out of the corridors .      i got clothes .         i thought you   d like to come into our place and take a bath .      raych said     what for .  i   ll wash one o    these days .  and i   ll put on my other shirt .     he looked up at dors shrewdly .     you   re sorry ya roughed me up .  right .  ya tryin    to make up .      dors smiled .     yes .  sort of .      raych waved a hand in lordly fashion .     that   s all right .  ya didn   t hurt .  listen .  you   re strong for a lady .  ya lifted me up like i was nothin    .         i was annoyed  raych .  i have to be concerned about master seldon .         ya sort of his bodyguard .     raych looked at seldon inquiringly .     ya got a lady for a bodyguard .         i can   t help it      said seldom smiling wryly .     she insists .  and she certainly knows her job .      dors said     think again  raych .  are you sure you won   t have a bath .  a nice warm bath .      raych said     i got no chance .  ya think that lady is gonna let me in the house again .      dors looked up and saw casilia tisalver outside the front door of the apartment complex  staring first at the outworld woman and then at the slum bred boy .  it would have been impossible to tell in which case her expression was angrier .   raych said     well  so long  mister and missus .  i don   t know if she   ll let either of ya in the house .     he placed his hands in his pocket and swaggered off in a fine affectation of carefree indifference .   seldon said     good evening  mistress tisalver .  it   s rather late  isn   t it .         it   s very late      she replied .     there was a near riot today outside this very complex because of that newsman you pushed the street vermin at .         we didn   t push anyone on anyone      said dors .      i was there      said mistress tisalver intransigently .     i saw it .      she stepped aside to let them enter  but delayed long enough to make her reluctance quite plain .      she acts as though that was the last straw      said dors as she and seldon made their way up to their rooms .      so .  what can she do about it .     asked seldon .      i wonder      said dors .     officers    raych   .   .   .  according to hari seldon  the original meeting with raych was entirely accidental .  he was simply a gutter urchin from whom seldon had asked directions .  but his life  from that moment on  continued to be intertwined with that of the great mathematician until  .   encyclopedia galactica       .     the next morning  dressed from the waist down  having washed and shaved  seldon knocked on the door that led to dors   s adjoining room and said in a moderate voice     open the door  dors .      she did .  the short reddish gold curls of her hair were still wet and she too was dressed only from the waist down .   seldon stepped back in embarrassed alarm .  dors looked down at the swell of her breasts indifferently and wrapped a towel around her head .     what is it .     she asked .   seldon said  looking off to his right     i was going to ask you about wye .      dors said very naturally     about why in connection with what .  and for goodness sake  don   t make me talk to your ear .  surely  you   re not a virgin .      seldon said in a hurt tone     i was merely trying to be polite .  if you don   t mind  i certainly don   t .  and it   s not why about what .  i   m asking about the wye sector .         why do you want to know .  or  if you prefer  why wye .         look  dors  i   m serious .  every once in a while  the wye sector is mentioned the mayor of wye  actually .  hummin mentioned him  you did  davan did .  i don   t know anything about either the sector or the mayor .         i   m not a native trantorian either  hari .  i know very little  but you   re welcome to what i do know .  wye is near the south pole quite large  very populous          very populous at the south pole .         we   re not on helicon  hari .  or on cinna either .  this is trantor .  everything is underground and underground at the poles or underground at the equator is pretty much the same .  of course  i imagine they keep their day night arrangements rather extreme    long days in their summer  long nights in their winter almost as it would be on the surface .  the extremes are just affectation  they   re proud of being polar .         but upperside they must be cold  indeed .         oh yes .  the wye upperside is snow and ice  but it doesn   t lie as thickly there as you might think .  if it did  it might crush the dome  but it doesn   t and that is the basic reason for wye   s power .      she turned to her mirror  removed the towel from her head  and threw the dry net over her hair  which  in a matter of five seconds  gave it a pleasant sheen .  she said     you have no idea how glad i am not to be wearing a skincap      as she put on the upper portion of her clothing .      what has the ice layer to do with wye   s power .         think about it .  forty billion people use a great deal of power and every calorie of it eventually degenerates into heat and has to be gotten rid of .  it   s piped to the poles  particularly to the south pole  which is the more developed of the two  and is discharged into space .  it metes most of the ice in the process and i   m sure that accounts for trantor   s clouds and rains  no matter how much the meteorology boggins insist that things are more complicated than that .         does wye make use of the power before discharging it .         they may  for all i know .  i haven   t the slightest idea  by the way  as to the technology involved in discharging the heat  but i   m talking about political power .  if dahl were to stop producing usable energy  that would certainly .  inconvenience trantor  but there are other sectors that produce energy and can up their production and  of course  there is stored energy in one form or another .  eventually  dahl would have to be dealt with  but there would be time .  wye  on the other hand         yes .         well  wye gets rid of at least    percent of all the heat developed on trantor and there is no substitute .  if wye were to shut down its heat emission  the temperature would start going up all over trantor .         in wye too .         ate  but since wye is at the south pole  it can arrange an influx of cold air .  it wouldn   t do much good  but wye would last longer than the rest of trantor .  the point is  then  that wye is a very touchy problem for the emperor and the mayor of wye is  or at least can be extremely powerful .         and what kind of a person is the present mayor of wye .         that i don   t know .  what i   ve occasionally heard would make it seem that he is very old and pretty much a recluse  but hard as a hypership hull and still cleverly maneuvering for power .         why  i wonder .  if he   s that old  he couldn   t hold the power for long .         who knows  hari .  a lifelong obsession  i suppose .  or else it   s the game  .   .   .  the maneuvering for power  without any real longing for the power itself .  probably if he had the power and took over demerzel   s place or even the imperial throne itself  he would feel disappointed because the game would be over .  of nurse he might  if he was still alive  begin the subsequent game of keeping power  which might be just as difficult and just as satisfying .      seldon shook his head .     it strikes me that no one could possibly want to be emperor .         no sane person would  i free  but the    imperial wish      as it is frequently called  is like a disease that  when caught  drives out sanity .  and the closer you get to high office  the more likely you are to catch the disease .  with each ensuing promotion          the disease grows still more acute .  yes  i can see that .  but it also seems to me that trantor is so huge a world  so interlocking in its needs and so conflicting in its ambitions  that it makes up the major part of the inability of the emperor to rule .  why doesn   t he just leave trantor and establish himself on some simpler world .      dors laughed .     you wouldn   t ask that if you knew your history .  trantor is the empire through thousands of years of custom .  an emperor who is not at the imperial palace is not the emperor .  he is a place  even more than a person .      seldon sank into silence  his face rigid  and after a while dors asked  what   s the matter  hari .         i   m thinking      he said in a muffled voice .     ever since you told me that hand on thigh story  i   ve had fugitive thoughts that now your remark about the emperor being a place rather than a person seems to have struck a chord .         what kind of chord .      seldon shook his head .     i   m still thinking .  i may be all wrong .     his glance at dors sharpened  his eyes coming into focus .     in any case  we ought to go down and have breakfast .  we   re late and i don   t think mistress tisalver is in a good enough humor to have it brought in for us .         you optimist      said dors .     my own feeling is that she   s not in a good enough humor to want us to stay breakfast or not .  she wants us out of here .         that may be  but we   re paying her .         yes  but i suspect she hates us enough by now to scorn our credits .         perhaps her husband will feel a bit more affectionate concerning the rent .         if he has a single word to say  hari  the only person who would be more surprised than me to hear it would be mistress tisalver .   very well  i   m ready .      and they moved down the stairs to the tisalver portion of the apartment to find the lady in question waiting for them with less than breakfast  and with considerably more too .        .     casilia tisalver stood ramrod straight with a tight smile on her round face and her dark eyes glinting .  her husband was leaning moodily against the wall .  in the center of the room were two men who were standing stiffly upright  as though they had noticed the cushions on the floor but scorned them .   both had the dark crisp hair and the chick black mustache to be expected of dahlites .  both were thin and both were dressed in dark clothes so nearly alike that they were surely uniforms .  there was thin white piping up and over the shoulders and down the sides of the tubular trouser legs .  each had  on the right side of his chest  a rather dim spaceship and sun  the symbol of the galactic empire on every inhabited world of the galaxy  with  in this case  a dark    d    in the center of the sun .   seldon realized immediately that these were two members of the dahlite security forces .      what   s all this .     said seldon sternly .   one of the men stepped forward .     i am sector officer lanel russ .  this is my partner  gebore astinwald .      both presented glittering identification holo tabs .  seldon didn   t bother looking at them .     what it is you want .      russ said calmly     are you hari seldon of helicon .         i am .         and are you dors venabili of cinna  mistress .         i am      said dors .      i   m here to investigate a complaint that one hari seldon instigated a riot yesterday .         i did no such thing      said seldon .      our information is      said russ  looking at the screen of a small computer pad     that you accused a newsman of being an imperial agent  thus instigating a riot against him .      dors said     it was i who said he was an imperial agent  officer .  i had reason to think he was .  it is surely no crime to express one   s opinion .  the empire has freedom of speech .         that does not cover an opinion deliberately advanced in order to instigate a riot .         how can you say it was  officer .      at this point  mistress tisalver interposed in a shrill voice     i can say it  officer .  she saw there was a crowd present  a crowd of gutter people who were just looking for trouble .  she deliberately said he was an imperial agent when she knew nothing of the sort and she shouted it to the crowd to stir them up .  it was plain that she knew what she was doing .         casilia      said her husband pleadingly  but she cast one look at him and he said no more .   russ turned to mistress tisalver .     did you lodge the complaint  mistress .         yes .  these two have been living here for a few days and they   ve done nothing but make trouble .  they   ve invited people of low reputation into my apartment  damaging my standing with my neighbours .         is it against the law  officer      asked seldon     to invite clean  quiet citizens of dahl into one   s room .  the two rooms upstairs are our rooms .  we have rented them and they are paid for .  is it a crime to speak to dahlites in dahl  officer .         no  it is not      said russ .     that is not part of the complaint .  what gave you reason  mistress venabili  to suppose the person you so accused was  in fact  an imperial agent .      doss said     he had a small brown mustache  from which i concluded he was not a dahlite .  i surmised he was an imperial agent        you surmised .  your associate  master seldon  has no mustache at all .  do you surmise he is an imperial agent .         in any case      said seldon hastily     there was no riot .  we asked the crowd to take no action against the supposed newsman and i   m sure they didn   t .         you   re sure  master seldon .     said russ .     our information is that you left immediately after making your accusation .  how could you witness what happened after you left .         i couldn   t      said seldon     but let me ask you is the man dead .  is the man hurt .         the man has been interviewed .  he denies he is an imperial agent and we have no information that he is .  he also claims he was handled roughly .         he may well be lying in both respects      said seldon .     i would suggest a psychic probe .         that cannot be done on the victim of a crime      said russ .     the sector government is very firm on that .  it might do if you two  as the criminals in this case  each underwent a psychic probe .  would you like us to do that .      seldon and dors exchanged glances for a moment  then seldon said     no  of course not .         of course not      repeated russ with just a tinge of sarcasm in his voice     hut you   re ready enough to suggest it for someone else .      the other officer  astinwald  who had so far not said a word  smiled at this .   russ said     we also have information that two days ago you engaged in a knife fight in billibotton and badly hurt a dahlite citizen named    he struck a button on his computer pad and studied the new page on the screen     elgin marron .      doss said     dot your information tell you how the fight started .         that is irrelevant at the moment  mistress .  do you deny that the fight took place .         of course we don   t deny the fight took place      said seldon hotly     but we deny that we in any way instigated that .  we were attacked .  mistress venabili was seized by this marron and it was clear he was attempting to rape her .  what happened afterward was pure self defense .  or does dahl condone rape .      russ said with very little intonation in his voice     you say you were attacked .  by how many .         ten men .         and you alone with a woman defended yourself against tea men .         mistress venabili and i defended ourselves .  yes .         how is it  then  that neither of you shows any damage whatever .  are either of you cut or bruised where it doesn   t show right now .         no  officer .         how is it  then  that in the fight of one plus a woman against ten  you are in no way hurt  but that the complainant  elgin marron  has been hospitalized with wounds and will require a skin transplant on his upper lip .         we fought well      said seldon grimly .      unbelievably well .  what would you say if i told you that three men have testified that you and your friend attacked marron  unprovoked .         i would say that it belies belief that we should .  i   m sure that marron has a record as a brawler and knifeman .  i tell you that there were ten there .  obviously  six refused to swear to a lie .  do the other three explain why they did not come to the help of their friend if they witnessed him under unprovoked attack and in danger of his life .  it must be clear to you that they are lying .         do you suggest a psychic probe for them .         yes .  and before you ask  i still refuse to consider one for us .      russ said     we have also received information that yesterday  after leaving the scene of the riot  you consulted with one davan  a known subversive who is wanted by the security police .  is that true .         you   ll have to prove that without help from us      said seldon .     we   re not answering any further questions .      russ put away his pad .     i   m afraid i must ask you to come with us to headquarters for further interrogation .         i don   t think that   s necessary  officer      said seldon .     we are outworlders who have done nothing criminal .  we have tried to avoid a newsman who was annoying us unduly  we tried to protect ourselves against rape and possible murder in a part of the sector known for criminal behavior  and we   ve spoken to various dahlites .  we see nothing there to warrant our further questioning .  it would come under the heading of harassment .         we make these decisions      said russ .     not you .  will you please come with us .         no  we will not      said dors .      watch out .     cried out mistress tisalver .     she   s got two knives .      officer russ sighed and said     thank you  mistress  but i know she does .     he turned to dors .     do you know it   s a serious crime to carry a knife without a permit in this sector .  do you have a permit .         no  officer  i don   t .         it was clearly with an illegal knife  then  that you assaulted marron .  do you realize that that greatly increases the seriousness of the crime .         it was no crime  officer      said dors .     understand that .  marron had a knife as well and no permit  i am certain .         we have no evidence to that effect and while marron has knife wounds  neither of you have any .         of course he had a knife  officer .  if you don   t know that every man in billibotton and most men elsewhere in dahl carry knives for which they probably don   t have permits  then you   re the only man in dahl who doesn   t know .  there are shops here wherever you turn that sell knives openly .  don   t you know that .      russ said     it doesn   t matter what i know or don   t know in this respect .  nor does it matter whether other people are breaking the law or how many of them do .  all that matters at this moment is that mistress venabili is breaking the anti knife law .  i must ask you to give up those knives to me right now  mistress  and the two of you must then accompany me to headquarters .      dors said     in that case  take my knives away from me .      russ sighed .     you must not think  mistress  that knives are all the weapons there are in dahl or that i need engage you in a knife fight .  both my partner and i have blasters that will destroy you in a moment  before you can drop your hands to your knife hilt however fast you are .  we won   t use a blaster  of course  because we are not here to kill you .  however  each of us also has a neuronic whip  which we can use on you freely .  i hope you won   t ask for a demonstration .  it won   t kill you  do you permanent harm of any kind  or leave any marks  but the pain is excruciating .  my partner is holding a neuronic whip on you right now .  and here is mine .   now  let us have your knives  mistress venabili .      there was a moment   s pause and then seldon said     it   s no use  dors .  give him your knives .      and at that moment  a frantic pounding sounded at the door and they all heard a voice raised in high pitched expostulation .        .     raych had not entirely left the neighborhood after he had walked them back to their apartment house .   he had eaten well while waiting for the interview with davan to  e done and later had slept a bit after finding a bathroom that more or less worked .  he really had no place to go now that all that was done .  he had a home of sorts and a mother who was not likely to be perturbed if he stayed away for a while .  she never was .   he did not know who his father was and wondered sometimes if he really had one .  he had been told he had to have one and the reasons for that had been explained to him crudely enough .  sometimes he wondered if he ought to believe so peculiar a story  but he did find the details titillating .   he thought of that in connection with the lady .  she was an old lady  of course  but she was pretty and she could fight like a man better than a man .  it filled him with vague notions .   and she had offered to let him take a bath .  he could swim in the billibotton pool sometimes when he had some credits he didn   t need for anything else or when he could sneak in .  those were the only times he got wet all over  but it was chilly and he had to wait to get dry .   taking a bath was different .  there would be hoc water  soap  towels  and warm air .  he wasn   t sure what it would feel like  except that it would be nice if she was there .   he was walkway wise enough to know of places where he could park himself in an alley off a walkway that would  e near a bathroom and still be near enough to where she was  yet where he probably wouldn   t be found and made to run away .   he spent the night thinking strange thoughts .  what if he did learn to read and write .  could he do something with that .  he wasn   t sure what  but maybe the could cell him .  he had vague ideas of being paid money to do things he didn   t know how to do now  but he didn   t know what those things might be .  he would have to be cold  but how do you get told .   if he stayed with the man and the lady  they might help .  but why should they want him to stay with them .   he drowsed off  coming to later  not because the light was brightening  but because his sharp ears caught the heightening and deepening of sounds from the walkway as the activities of the day began .   he had learned to identify almost every variety of sound  because in the underground maze of billibotton  if you wanted to survive with even a minimum of comfort  you had to be aware of things before you saw them .  and there was something about the sound of a ground car motor that he now heard that signaled danger to him .  it had an official sound  a hostile sound  he shook himself awake and stole quietly toward the walkway .  he scarcely needed to see the spaceship and sun on the groundcar .  its lines were enough .  he knew they had to be coming for the man and the lady because they had seen davan .  he did not pause to question his thoughts or to analyze them .  he was off on a run  beating his way through the gathering life of the day .   he was back in less than fifteen minutes .  the ground car was still there and there were curious and cautious onlookers gazing at it from all sides and from a respectful distance .  there would soon be more .  he pounded his way up the stairs  trying to remember which door he should bang on .  no time for the elevator .   he found the door at least he thought he did   and he banged  shouting in a squeak     lady .  lady .      he was too excited to remember her name  but he remembered part of the man   s .     hari .     he shouted .     let me in .      the door opened and he rushed in tried to rush in .  the rough hand of an officer seized his arm .     hold it  kid .  where do you think you   re going .         leggo .  i ain   t done nothin    .     he looked about .     hey  lady  what   re they join    .         arresting us      said dors grimly .      what for .     said raych  panting and struggling .     hey  leggo  you sunbadger .  don   t go with him  lady .  you don   t have to go with him .          you get out      said russ  shaking the boy vehemently .      no  i ain   t  you ain   t either  sunbadger .  my whole gang is coming .  you ain   t gettin    out  less   n you let these guys go .         what whole gang .     said russ  frowning .      they   re right outside now .  prob   ly takin    your ground car apart .  and they   ll take yore apart .      russ turned toward his partner     call headquarters .  have them send out a couple of trucks with macros .         no .     shrieked raych  breaking loose and rushing at astinwald .     don   t call .      russ levelled his neuronic whip and fired .   raych shrieked  grasped at his right shoulder  and fell down  wriggling madly .   russ had not yet turned back to seldon  when the latter  seizing him by the wrist  pushed the neuronic whip up in the air and then around and behind  while stamping on his foot to keep him relatively motionless .  hari could feel the shoulder dislocate  even while russ emitted a hoarse  agonized yell .   astinwald raised his blaster quickly  but dors   s left arm was around his shoulder and the knife in her right hand was at his throat .      don   t move .     she said .     move a millimeter  any part of you  and i cut you through your neck to the spine .   drop the blaster .  drop it .  and the neuronic whip .      seldon picked up raych  still moaning  and held him tightly .  he turned to tisalver and said     there are people out there .  angry people .  i   ll have them in here and they   ll break up everything you   ve got .  they   ll smash the walls .  if you don   t want that to happen  pick up those weapons and throw them into the next room .  take the weapons from the security officer on the door and do the same .  quickly .  get your wife to help .  she   ll think twice next time before sending in complaints against innocent people .   dors  this one on the floor won   t do anything for a while .  put the other one out of action  but don   t kill him .         right      said dors .  reversing her knife  she struck him hard on the skull with the haft .  he went to his knees .   she made a face .     i hate doing that .         they fired at raych      said seldon  trying to mask his own sick feeling at what had happened .   they left the apartment hurriedly and  once out on the walkway  found it choked with people  almost all men  who raised a shout when they saw them emerge .  they pushed in close and the smell of poorly washed humanity was overpowering .   someone shouted     where are the sunbadgers .         inside      called out dors piercingly .     leave them alone .  they   ll be helpless for a while  but they   ll get reinforcements  so get out of here fast        what about you .     came from a dozen throats .      we   re getting out too .  we won   t be back .         i   ll take care of them      shrilled raych  struggling out of seldon   s arms and standing on his feet .  he was rubbing his right shoulder madly .     i can walk .  lemme past .      the crowd opened for him and he said     mister  lady  come with me .  fast .      they were accompanied down the walkway by several dozen men and then raych suddenly gestured at an opening and muttered     in here  folks .  i   ll rake ya to a place no one will ever find ya .  even davan prob   ly don   t know it .  only thing is  we got to go through the sewer levels .  no one will see us there  but it   s sort of stinky  .   .   .  know what i mean .         i imagine we   ll survive      muttered seldon .   and down they went along a narrow spiralling ramp and up rose the mephitic odors to greet them .        .     raych found them a hiding place .  it had meant climbing up the metal rungs of a ladder and it had led them to a large loft like room  the use of which seldon could not imagine .  it was filled with equipment  bulky and silent  the function of which also remained a mystery .  the room was reasonably clean and free of dust and a steady draft of air wafted through that prevented the dust from settling and more important seemed to lessen the odor .   raych seemed pleased .     ain   t this nice .     he demanded .  he still rubbed his shoulder now and then and winced when he rubbed too hard .      it could be worse      said seldon .     do you know what this place is used for  raych .      raych shrugged or began to do so and winced .     i dunno      he said .  then he added with a touch of swagger     who cares .      dors  who had sat down on the floor after brushing it with her hand and then looking suspiciously at her palm  said     if you want a guess  i think this is part of a complex that is involved in the detoxification and recycling of wastes .  the stuff must surely end up as fertilizer .         then      said seldon gloomily     those who run the complex will be down here periodically and may come at any moment  for all we know .         i been here before      said raych .     i never saw no one here .         i suppose trantor is heavily automated wherever possible and if anything calls for automation it would be this treatment of wastes      said dors .     we may be safe  .   .   .  for a while .         not for long .  we   ll get hungry and thirsty  dors .         i can get food and water for us      said raych .     ya got to know how to make out if you   re an alley kid .         thank you  raych      said seldon absently     but right now i   m not hungry .     he sniffed .     i may never be hungry again .         you will be      said dors     and even if you lose your appetite for a while  you   ll get thirsty .  at least elimination is no problem .  we   re practically living over what is clearly an open sewer .      there was silence for a while .  the light was dim and seldon wondered why the trantorians didn   t keep it dark altogether .  but then it occurred to him that he had never encountered true darkness in any public area .  it was probably a habit in an energy rich society .  strange that a world of forty billion should be energy rich  but with the internal heat of the planet to draw upon  to say nothing of solar energy and nuclear fusion plants in space  it was .  in fact  come to think of it  there was no energy poor planet in the empire .  was there a time when technology had been so primitive that energy poverty was possible .   he leaned against a system of pipes through which for all he knew sewage ran .  he drew away from the pipes as the thought occurred to him and he sat down next to dors .   he said     is there any way we can get in touch with chetter hummin .      dors said     as a matter of fact  i did send a message  though i hated to .         you hated to .         my orders are to protect you .  each time i have to get in touch with him  it means i   ve failed .      seldon regarded her out of narrowed eyes .     do you have to be so compulsive  dons .  you can   t protect me against the security officers of an entire sector .         i suppose not .  we can disable a few          i know .  we did .  but they   ll send out reinforcements  .   .   .  armored ground cars  .   .   .  neuronic cannon  .   .   .  sleeping mist .  i   m not sure what they have  but they   re going to throw in their entire armory .  i   m sure of it .         you   re probably right      said dons  her mouth tightening .      they won   t find ya  lady      said raych suddenly .  his sharp eyes had moved from one to the other as they talked .     they never find davan .      dors smiled without joy and ruffled the boy   s hair  then looked at the palm of her hand with a little dismay .  she said     i   m not sure if you ought to stay with us  raych .  i don   t want them finding you .          they won   t find me and if i leave ya  who   ll get ya food and water and who   ll find ya new hidin    places  so the sunbadgers   ll never know where to look .         no  raych  they   ll find us .  they don   t really look too hard for davan .  he annoys them  but i suspect they don   t take him seriously .  do you know what i mean .         you mean he   s just a pain in the  .   .   .  the neck and they figure he ain   t worth chasing all over the lot .         yes  that   s what i mean .  but you see  we hurt two of the officers very badly and they   re not going to let us get away with that .  if it takes their whole force if they have to sweep through every hidden or unused corridor in the sector they   ll get us .      raych said     that makes me feel like  .   .   .  like natin   n    .  if i didn   t run in there and get zapped  ya wouldn   t have taken out them officers and ya wouldn   t be in such trouble .         no  sooner or later  we   d have uh taken them out .  who knows .  we may have to take out a few more .         well  ya did it beautiful      said raych .     if i hadn   t been aching all over  i could   ve watched more and enjoyed it .      seldon said     it wouldn   t do us any good to try to fight the entire security system .  the question is  what will they do to us once they have us .  a prison sentence  surely .         oh no .  if necessary  we   ll have to appeal to the emperor      put in dors .      the emperor .     said raych  wide eyed .     you know the emperor .      seldon waved at the boy .     any galactic citizen can appeal to the emperor .   that strikes me as the wrong thing to do  dors .  ever since hummin and i left the imperial sector  we   ve been evading the emperor .         not to the extent of being thrown into a dahlite prison .  the imperial appeal will serve as a delay in any case  a diversion  and perhaps in the course of that delay  we can think of something else .         there   s hummin .         yes  there is      said dors uneasily     but we can   t consider him the doit all .  for one thing  even if my message reached him and even if he was able to rush to dahl  how would he find us here .  and  even if he did  what could he do against the entire dahlite security force .         in that case      said seldon .     we   re going to have to think of something we can do before they find us .      raych said     if ya follow me  i can keep ya ahead of them .  i know every place there is around here .         you can keep us ahead of one person  but there   ll be a great many  moving down any number of corridors .  we   ll escape one group and bump into another .      they sat in uncomfortable silence for a good while  each confronting what seemed to  e a hopeless situation .  then dors venabili stirred and said in a tense  low whisper     they   re here .  i hear them .      for a while  they strained  listening  then raych sprang to his feet and hissed     they comin    that way .  we gotta go this way .      seldon  confused  heard nothing at all  but would have been content to trust the others    superior hearing  but even as raych began moving hastily and quietly away from the direction of the approaching tread  a voice rang out echoing against the sewer walls .     don   t move .  don   t move .      and raych said     that   s davan .  how   d he know we were here .         davan .     said seldon .     are you sure .         sure i   m sure .  he   ll help .           .     davan asked     what happened .      seldon felt minimally relieved .  surely  the addition of davan could scarcely count against the full force of the dahl sector  but  then again  he commanded a number of people who might create enough confusion  he said     you should know  davan .  i suspect that many of the crowd who were at tisalver   s place this morning were your people .         yes  a number were .  the story is that you were being arrested and that you manhandled a squadron of sunbadgers .  but why were you being arrested .         two      said seldon  lifting two fingers .     two sunbadgers .  and that   s bad enough .  part of the reason we were being arrested was that we had gone to see you .         that   s not enough .  the sunbadgers don   t bother with me much as a general thing .     he added bitterly     they underestimate me .         maybe      said seldon     out the woman from whom we rent our rooms reported us for having started a riot  .   .   .  over the newsman we ran into on our way to you .  you know about that .  with your people on the scene yesterday and again this morning and with two officers badly hurt  they may well decide to clean out these corridors  and that means you will suffer .  i really am sorry .  i had no intention or expectation of being the cause of any of this .      but davan shook his head .     no  you don   t know the sunbadgers .  that   s not enough either .  they don   t want to clean us up .  the sector would have to do something about us if they did .  they   re only too happy to let us rot in billibotton and the other slums .  no  they   re after you .  what have you done .      dors said impatiently     we   ve done nothing and  in any case  what does it matter .  if they   re not after you and they are after us  they   re going to come down here to flush us out .  if you get in the way  you   ll be in deep trouble .         no  not me .  i have friends powerful friends      said davan .     i told you that last night .  and they can help you as well as me .  when you refused to help us openly  i got in touch with them .  they know who you are  dr .  seldon .  you   re a famous man .  they   re in a position to talk to the mayor of dahl and see to it that you are left alone  whatever you have done .  but you   ll have to be taken a way out of dahl .      seldon smiled .  relief flooded over him .  he said     you know someone powerful  do you  davan .  someone who responds at once  who has the ability to talk the dahl government out of taking drastic steps  and who can take us away .  good .  i   m not surprised .     he turned to dors  smiling .     it   s mycogen all over again .  how does hummin do it .      but dors shook her head .     too quick .   i don   t understand .      seldon said     i believe he can do anything .         i know him better than you do  and longer  and i don   t believe that .      seldon smiled     don   t underestimate him .     and then  as though anxious not to linger longer on that subject  he turned to davan .     but how did you find us .  raych said you knew nothing about this place .         he don   t      shrilled raych indignantly .     this place is all mine .  i found it .         i   ve never been here before      said davan  looking about .     it   s an interesting place .  raych is a corridor creature  perfectly at home in this maze .         yes  davan  we gathered as much ourselves .  but how did you find it .         a heat seeker .  i have a device that detects infra red radiation  the particular thermal pattern that is given off at thirty seven degrees celsius .  it will react to the presence of human beings and not to other heat sources .  it reacted to you three .      dons was frowning .     what good is that on trantor  where there are human beings everywhere .  they have them on other worlds  but       davan said     but not on trantor .  i know .  except that they are useful in the slums  in the forgotten  decaying corridors and alleyways .         and where did you get it .     asked seldon .   davan said     it   s enough that i have it .    but we   ve got to get you away  master seldon .  too many people want you and i want my powerful friend to have you .         where is he  this powerful friend of yours .         he   s approaching .  at least a new thirty seven degree source is registering and i don   t see that it can be anyone else .      through the door strode a newcomer  but seldon   s glad exclamation died on his lips .  it was not chetter hummin .     wye    wye   .   .   .  a sector of the world city of trantor  .   .   .  in the latter centuries of the galactic empire  wye was the strongest and stablest portion of the world city .  its rulers had long aspired to the imperial throne  justifying that by their descent from early emperors .  under mannix iv  wye was militarized and  imperial authorities later claimed  was planning a planet wide coup  .   encyclopedia galactica       .     the man who entered was tall and muscular .  he had a long blond mustache that curled up at the tips and a fringe of hair that went down the sides of his face and under his chin  leaving the point of his chin and his lower lip smoothly bare and seeming a little moist .  his head was so closely cropped and his hair was so fight that  for one unpleasant moment  seldon was reminded of mycogen .   the newcomer wore what was unmistakably a uniform .  it was red and white and about his waist was a wide belt decorated with silver studs .   his voice  when he spoke  was a rolling bass and its accent was not like any that seldon had heard before .  most unfamiliar accents sounded uncouth in seldon   s experience  but this one seemed almost musical  perhaps because of the richness of the low tones .      i am sergeant emmer thalus      he rumbled in a slow succession of syllables .     i have come seeking dr .  hari seldon .      seldon said     i am he .     in an aside to dors  he muttered     if hummin couldn   t come himself  he certainly sent a magnificent side of beef to represent him .      the sergeant favored seldon with a stolid and slightly prolonged look .  then he said     yes .  you have been described to me .  please come with me  dr .  seldon .      seldon said     lead the way .      the sergeant stepped backward .  seldon and dors venabili stepped forward .   the sergeant stopped and raised a large hand  palm toward dors .     i have been instructed to take dr .  hari seldon with me .  i have not been instructed to take anyone else .      for a moment  seldon looked at him uncomprehendingly .  then his look of surprise gave way to anger .     it   s quite impossible that you have been told that  sergeant .  dr .  dors venabili is my associate and my companion .  she must come with me .         that is nor in accordance with my instructions  doctor .         i don   t care about your instructions in any way  sergeant thalus .  i do not budge without her .         what   s more      said dors with clear irritation     my instructions are to protect dr .  seldon at all times .  i cannot do that unless i am with him .  therefore  where he goes  i go .      the sergeant looked puzzled .     my instructions are strict that i see to it that no harm comes to you  dr .  seldon .  if you will not come voluntarily  i must carry you to my vehicle .  i will try to do so gently .      he extended his two arms as though to seize seldon by the waist and carry him off bodily .   seldon skittered backward and out of reach .  as he did so  the side of his fight palm came down on the sergeant   s right upper arm where the muscles were thinnest  so that he struck the bone .   the sergeant drew a sudden deep breath and seemed to shake himself a bit  but turned  face expressionless  and advanced again .  davan  watching  remained where he was  motionless  but raych moved behind the sergeant  seldon repeated his palm stroke a second time  then a third  but now sergeant thalus  anticipating the blow  lowered his shoulder to catch it on hard muscle .   dors had drawn her knives .      sergeant      she said forcefully .     turn in this direction  i want you to understand i may be forced to hurt you severely if you persist in attempting to carry dr .  seldon off against his will .      the sergeant paused  seemed to take in the slowly waving knives solemnly  then said     it is not in my instructions to refrain from harming anyone but dr .  seldon .      his right hand moved with surprising speed toward the neuronic whip in the holster at his hip .  dors moved as quickly forward  knives flashing .   neither completed the movement .   dashing forward  raych had pushed at the sergeant   s back with his left hand and withdrew the sergeant   s weapon from its holster with his right he moved away quickly  holding the neuronic whip in both hands now and shouting     hands up  sergeant  or you   re gonna get it .      the sergeant whirled and a nervous look crossed his reddening face .  it was the only moment that its stolidity had weakened .     put that down  sonny      he growled .     you don   t know how it works .      raych howled     i know about the safety .  it   s off and this thing can fire .  and it will if you try to rush me .      the sergeant froze .  he clearly knew how dangerous it was to have an excited twelve year old handling a powerful weapon .   nor did seldon feel much better .  he said     careful  raych .  don   t shoot .  keep your finger off the contact .         i ain   t gonna let him rush me .         he won   t .   sergeant  please don   t move .  let   s get something straight .  you were told to take me away from here .  is that right .         that   s right      said the sergeant  eyes somewhat protruding and firmly fixed on raych  whose eyes were as firmly fixed on the sergeant  .      but you were not cold to take anyone else .  is that right .         no  i was not  doctor      said the sergeant firmly .  not even the threat of a neuronic whip was going to make him weasel .  one could see that .      very well  but listen to me  sergeant .  were you told not to take anyone else .         i just said      no no .  listen  sergeant .  there   s a difference .  were your instructions simply    take dr .  seldon .     .  was that the entire order  with no mention of anyone else  or were the orders more specific .  were your orders as follows     take dr .  seldon and don   t take anyone else    .      the sergeant turned that over in his head  then he said     i was told to take you  dr .  seldon .         then there was no mention of anyone else  one way or the other  was there .      pause .     no .         you were not told to take dr .  venabili  but you were not told not to take dr .  venabili either .  is that right .      pause .     yes .         so you can either take her or not take her  whichever you please .      long pause .     i suppose so .         now then  here   s raych  the young fellow who   s got a neuronic whip pointing at you your neuronic whip  remember  and he is anxious to use it .         yay .     shouted raych .          not yet  raych      said seldon .     and here is dr .  venabili with two knives that she can use very expertly and there   s myself  who can  if i get the chance  break your adam   s apple with one hand so that you   ll never speak above a whisper again .  now then  do you want to take dr .  venabili or don   t you want to .  your orders allow you to do either .      and finally the sergeant said in a beaten voice     i will take the woman .         and the boy  raych .         and the boy .         good .  have i your word of honor your word of honor as a soldier that you will do as you have just said  .   .   .  honestly .         you have my word of honor as a soldier      said the sergeant .      good .  raych  give back the whip .   now .   don   t make me wait .      raych  his face twisted into an unhappy grimace  looked at dors  who hesitated and then slowly nodded her head .  her face was as unhappy as raych   s .   raych held out the neuronic whip to the sergeant and said     they   re makin    me  ya big      his last words were unintelligible .   seldon said     put away your knives  dors .      dors shook her head  but put them away .      now  sergeant .     said seldon .   the sergeant looked at the neuronic whip  then at seldon .  he said     you are an honorable man  dr .  seldon  and my word of honor holds .     with a military snap  he placed his neuronic whip in his holster .   seldon turned to davan and said     davan  please forget what you have seen here .  we three are going voluntarily with sergeant thalus .  you tell yugo amaryl when you see him that i will not forget him and that  once this is over and i am free to act  i will see that he gets into a university .  and if there   s anything reasonable i can ever do for your cause  davan  i will .   now  sergeant  let   s go .           .        have you ever been in an air jet before  raych .     asked hari seldon .   raych shook his head speechlessly .  he was looking down at upperside rushing beneath them with a mixture of fright and awe .   it struck seldon again how much trantor was a world of expressways and tunnels .  even long trips were made underground  y the general population .  air travel  however common it might be on the outworlds  was a luxury on trantor and an air jet like this   how had hummin managed it .  seldon wondered .   he looked out the window at the rise and fall of the domes  at the general green in this area of the planet  the occasional patches of what were little less than jungles  the arms of the sea they occasionally passed over  with its leaden waters taking on a sudden all too brief sparkle when the sun peeped out momentarily from the heavy cloud layer .   an hour or so into the flight  dors  who was viewing a new historical novel without much in the way of apparent enjoyment  clicked it off and said     i wish i knew where we were going .         if you can   t tell      said seldon     then i certainly can   t .  you   ve been on trantor longer than i have .         yes  but only on the inside      said dors .     out here  with only upperside below me  i   m as lost as an unborn infant would be .         oh well .   presumably  hummin knows what he   s doing .         i   m sure he does      replied dors rather tartly     but that may have nothing to do with the present situation .  why do you continue to assume any of this represents his initiative .      seldon   s eyebrows lifted .     now that you ask  i don   t know .  i just assumed it .  why shouldn   t this be his .         because whoever arranged it didn   t specify that i be taken along with you .  i simply don   t see hummin forgetting my existence .  and because he didn   t come himself  as he did at streeling and at mycogen .         you can   t always expect him to  dors .  he might well be occupied .  the astonishing thing is nor that he didn   t come on this occasion but that he did come on the previous ones .         assuming he didn   t come himself  would he send a conspicuous and lavish flying palace like this .     she gestured around her at the large luxurious jet .      it might simply have been available .  and he might have reasoned that no one would expect something as noticeable as this to be carrying fugitives who were desperately trying to avoid detection .  the well known double double cross .         too well known  in my opinion .  and would he send an idiot like sergeant thalus in his place .         the sergeant is no idiot .  he   s simply been trained to complete obedience .  with proper instructions  he could be utterly reliable .         there you are  hari .  we come back to that .  why didn   t he get proper instructions .  it   s inconceivable to me that chetter hummin would tell him to carry you out of dahl and not say a word about me .  inconceivable .      and to that seldon had no answer and his spirits sank .   another hour passed and dors said     it looks as if it   s getting colder outside .  the green of upperside is turning brown and i believe the heaters have turned on .         what does that signify .         dahl is in the tropic zone so obviously we   re going either north or south  and a considerable distance too .  if i had some notion in which direction the nightline was i could tell which .      eventually  they passed over a section of shoreline where there was a rim of ice hugging the domes where they were rimmed by the sea .   and then  quite unexpectedly  the air jet angled downward .   raych screamed     we   re goin    to hit .  we   re goin    to smash up .      seldon   s abdominal muscles tightened and he clutched the arms of his seat .   dors seemed unaffected .  she said     the pilots up front don   t seem alarmed .  we   ll be tunneling .      and  as she said so  the jet   s wings swept backward and under it and  like a bullet  the air jet encored a tunnel .  blackness swept back over them in an instant and a moment later the lighting system in the tunnel turned on .  the walls of the tunnel snaked past the jet on either side .      i don   t suppose i   ll ever be sure they know the tunnel isn   t already occupied      muttered seldon .      i   m sure they had reassurance of a clear tunnel some dozens of kilometers earlier      said dors .     at any rate  i presume this is the last stage of the journey and soon we   ll know where we are .      she paused and then added     and i further presume we won   t like the knowledge when we have it .           .     the air jet sped out of the tunnel and onto a long runway with a roof so high that it seemed closer to true daylight than anything seldon had seen since he had left the imperial sector .   they came to a halt in a shorter time than seldon would have expected  but at the price of an uncomfortable pressure forward .  raych  in particular  was crushed against the seat before him and was finding it difficult to breath rill dors   s hand on his shoulder pulled him back slightly .   sergeant thalus  impressive and erect  left the jet and moved to the rear  where he opened the door of the passenger compartment and helped the three out  one by one .   seldon was last .  he half turned as he passed the sergeant  saying     it was a pleasant trip  sergeant .      a slow smite spread over the sergeant   s large face and lifted his moustached upper lip .  he touched the visor of his cap in what was half a salute and said     thank you again  doctor .      they were then ushered into the backseat of a ground car of lavish design and the sergeant himself pushed into the front seat and drove the vehicle with a surprisingly light touch .   they passed through wide roadways  flanked by tall  well designed buildings  all glistening in broad daylight .  as elsewhere on trantor  they heard the distant drone of an expressway .  the walkways were crowded with what were  for the most part  well dressed people .  the surroundings were remarkably almost excessively clean .   seldon   s sense of security sank further .  dors   s misgivings concerning their destination now seemed justified after all .  he leaned coward her and said     do you think we are back in the imperial sector .      she said     no  the buildings are more rococo in the imperial sector and there   s less imperial parkishness to this sector if you know what i mean .         then where are we  dors .      we   ll have to ask  i   m afraid  hari .      it was not a long trip and soon they rolled into a car bay that flanked an imposing four story structure .  a frieze of imaginary animals ran along the top  decorated with strips of warm pink stone .  it was an impressive facade with a rather pleasing design .   seldon said     that certainly looks rococo enough .      dors shrugged uncertainly .   raych whistled and said in a failing attempt to sound unimpressed     hey  look at that fancy place .      sergeant thalus gestured to seldom clearly indicating that he was to follow .  seldon hung back and  also relying on the universal language of gesture  held out both arms  clearly including dors and raych .   the sergeant hesitated in a slightly hangdog fashion at the impressive pink doorway .  his mustache almost seemed to droop .   then he said gruffly     all three of you  then .  my word of honor holds .   still  others may not feel obligated by my own obligation  you know .      seldon nodded .     i hold you responsible for your own deeds only  sergeant .      the sergeant was clearly moved and  for a moment  his face lightened as though he was considering the possibility of shaking seldon   s hand or expressing heartfelt his approval in some other way .  he decided against it  however  and stepped onto the bottom step of the flight that led to the door .  the stairs immediately began a stately upward movement .   seldon and dors stepped after him at once and kept their balance without much trouble .  raych  who was momentarily staggered in surprise  jumped onto the moving stairs after a short run  shoved both hands into his pockets  and whistled carelessly .   the door opened and two women stepped out  one on either side in symmetrical fashion .  they were young and attractive .  their dresses  belted tightly about the waist and reaching nearly to their ankles  fell in crisp pleats and rustled when they walked .  both had brown hair that was coiled in thick plaits on either side of their heads .   seldon found it attractive  but wondered how long it took them each morning to arrange it just so .  he had not been aware of so elaborate a coiffure on the women they had passed in the streets .    the two women stared at the newcomers with obvious contempt .  seldon was not surprised .  after the day   s events  he and dors looked almost as disreputable as raych .   yet the women managed to bow decorously and then made a half turn and gestured inward in perfect unison and with symmetry carefully maintained .   did they rehearse these things .   it was clear that the three were to enter .   they stepped through an elaborate room  cluttered with furniture and decorative items whose use seldon did not readily understand .  the floor was light colored  springy  and glowed with luminescence .  seldon noted with some embarrassment that their footwear left dusty marks upon it .   and then an inner door was flung open and yet another woman emerged .  she was distinctly older than the first two  who sank slowly as she came in  crossing their legs symmetrically as they did so in a way that made seldon marvel that they could keep their balance  it undoubtedly took a deal of practice  .   seldon wondered if he too was expected to display some ritualized form of respect  but since he hadn   t the faintest notion of what this might consist of  he merely bowed his head slightly .  dors remained standing erect and  it seemed to seldon  did so with disdain .  raych was staring open mouthed in all directions and looked as though he didn   t even see the woman who had just entered .   she was plump nor fat  but comfortably padded .  she wore her hair precisely as the young ladies did and her dress was in the same style  but much more richly ornamented too much so to suit seldon   s aesthetic notions .   she was clearly middle aged and there was a hint of gray in her hair  but the dimples in her cheeks gave her the appearance of having rather more than a dash of youth .  her light brown eyes were merry and on the whole she looked more motherly than old .   she said     how are you .  all of you .      she showed no surprise at the presence of dors and raych  but included them easily in her greeting .      i   ve been waiting for you for some time and almost had you on upperside at streeling .  you are dr .  hari seldon  whom i   ve been looking forward to meeting .  you  i think  must be dr .  dors venabili  for you had been reported to be in his company .  this young man i fear i do not know  but i am pleased to see him .  but we must not spend our time talking  for i   m sure you would like to rest first .         and bathe  madam      said dors rather forcefully     each of us could use a thorough shower .         yes  certainly      said the woman     and a change in clothing .  especially the young man .     she looked down at raych without any of the look of contempt and disapproval that the two young women had shown .   she said     what is your name  young man .         raych      said raych in a rather choked and embarrassed voice .  he then added experimentally     missus .         what an odd coincidence      said the woman  her eyes sparkling .     an omen  perhaps .  my own name is rashelle .  isn   t that odd .    but come .  we shall take care of you all .  then there will be plenty of time to have dinner and to talk .         wait  madam      said dors .     may i ask where we are .         wye  dear .  and please call me rashelle  as you come to feel more friendly .  i am always at ease with informality .      dors stiffened .     are you surprised that we ask .  isn   t it natural that we should wane to know where we are .      rashelle laughed in a pleasant  tinkling manner .     really  dr .  venabili  something must be done about the name of this place .  i was not asking a question but making a statement .  you asked where you were and i did not ask you why .  i told you  wye .     you are in the wye sector .         in wye .     said seldon forcibly .      yes indeed  dr .  seldon .  we   ve wanted you from the day you addressed the decennial convention and we are so glad to have you now .           .     actually  it took a full day to rest and unstiffen  to wash and get clean  to obtain new clothes  satiny and rather loose  in the style of wye   and to sleep a good deal .   it was during the second evening in wye that there was the dinner that madam rashelle had promised .   the table was a large one too large  considering that there were only four dining  hari seldon  dors venabili  raych  and rashelle .  the walls and ceiling were softly illuminated and the colors changed at a rate that caught the eye but not so rapidly as in any way to discommode the mind .  the very tablecloth  which was not cloth  seldon had not made up his mind what it might be   seemed to sparkle .   the servers were many and silent and when the door opened it seemed to seldon that he caught a glimpse of soldiers  armed and at the ready  outside .  the room was a velvet glove  but the iron fist was not far distant .   rashelle was gracious and friendly and had clearly taken a particular liking to raych  who  she insisted  was to sit next to her .   raych scrubbed  polished  and shining  all but unrecognizable in his new clothes  with his hair clipped  cleaned  and brushed    scarcely dared to say a word .  it was as though he felt his grammar no longer fit his appearance .  he was pitifully ill at ease and he watched dors carefully as she switched from utensil to utensil  trying to match her exactly in every respect .   the food was tasty but spicy to the point where seldon could not recognize the exact nature of the dishes .   rashelle  her plump face made happy by her gentle smile and her fine teeth gleaming white  said     you may think we have mycogenian additives in the food  but we do not .  it is all homegrown in wye .  there is no sector on the planet more self sufficient than wye .  we labor hard to keep that so .      seldon nodded gravely and said     everything you have given us is first rate  rashelle .  we are much obliged to you .      and yet within himself he thought the food was not quite up to mycogenian standards and he felt moreover  as he had earlier muttered to dors  that he was celebrating his own defeat .  or hummin   s defeat  at any rare  and that seemed to him to be the same thing .   after all  he had been captured by wye  the very possibility that had so concerned hummin at the time of the incident upperside .   rashelle said     perhaps  in my role as hostess  i may be forgiven if i ask personal questions .  am i correct in assuming that you three do not represent a family  that you  hari  and you  dors  are not married and that raych is not your son .         the three of us are not related in any way      said seldon .     raych was born on trantor  i on helicon  dors on cinna .         and how did you all meet  then .      seldon explained briefly and with as little detail as he could manage  .     there   s nothing romantic or significant in the meetings      he added .      yet i am given to understand that you raised difficulties with my personal aide  sergeant thalus  when he wanted to take only you out of dahl .      seldon said gravely     i had grown fond of dors and raych and did not wish to be separated from them .      rashelle smiled and said     you are a sentimental man  i see .         yes  i am .  sentimental .  and puzzled too .         puzzled .         why yes .  and since you were so kind as to ask personal questions of us  may i ask one as well .         of course  my dear hari .  ask anything you please .         when we first arrived  you said that wye has wanted me from the day i addressed the decennial convention .  for what reason might that be .         surely  you are not so simple as not to know .  we want you for your psychohistory .         that much i do understand .  but what makes you think that having me means you have psychohistory .         surely  you have not been so careless as to lose it .         worse  rashelle .  i have never had it     rashelle   s face dimpled .     but you said you had it in your talk .  not that i understood your talk .  i am not a mathematician .  i hate numbers .  but i have in my employ mathematicians who have explained to me what it is you said .         in that case  my dear rashelle  you must listen more closely .  i can well imagine they have cold you that i have proven that psychohistorical predictions are conceivable  but surely they must also have cold you that they are not practical .         i can   t believe that  hari .  the very next day  you were called into an audience with that pseudo emperor  cleon .         the pseudo emperor .     murmured dors ironically .      why yes      said rashelle as though she was answering a serious question .     pseudo emperor .  he has no true claim to the throne .         rashelle      said seldon  brushing that aside a bit impatiently     i told cleon exactly what i have just told you and he let me go .      now rashelle did nor smile .  a small edge crept into her voice .     yes  he let you go the way the cat in the fable lets a mouse go .  he has been pursuing you ever since in streeling  in mycogen  in dahl .  he would pursue you here if he dared .  but come now our serious talk is too serious .  let us enjoy ourselves .  let us have music .      and at her words  there suddenly sounded a soft but joyous instrumental melody .  she leaned toward raych and said softly     my boy  if you are not at ease with the fork  use your spoon or your fingers .  i won   t mind .      raych said     yes  mum      and swallowed hard  but dors caught his eye and her lips silently mouthed     fork .      he remained with his fork .   dors said     the music is lovely  madam    she pointedly rejected the familiar form of address    but it must not he allowed to distract us .  there is the thought in my mind that the pursuer in all those places might have been in the employ of the wye sector .  surely  you would not be so well acquainted with events if wye were not the prime mover .      rashelle laughed aloud .     wye has its eyes and ears everywhere  of course  but we were not the pursuers .  had we been  you would have been picked up without fail as you were in dahl finally when  indeed  we were the pursuers .  when  however  there is a pursuit that fails  a grasping hand that misses  you may be sure that it is demerzel .         do you think so little of demerzel .     murmured dors .      yes .  does that surprise you .  we have beaten him .         you .  or the wye sector .         the sector  of course  but insofar as wye is the victor  then i am the victor .         how strange      said dors .     there seems to be a prevalent opinion throughout trantor that the inhabitants of wye have nothing to do with victory  with defeat  or with anything else .  it is felt that there is but one will and one fist in wye and that is that of the mayor .  surely  you  or any other wyan weigh nothing in comparison .      rashelle smiled broadly .  she paused to look at raych benevolently and to pinch his cheek  then said     if you believe that our mayor is an autocrat and that there is but one will that sways wye  then perhaps you are right .  but  even so  i can still use the personal pronoun  for my will is of account .         why yours .     said seldon .     why not .     said rashelle as the servers began clearing the table .     i am the mayor of wye .           .     it was raych who was the first to react to the statement .  quite forgetting the cloak of civility that sat upon him so uncomfortably  he laughed raucously and said     hey  lady  ya can   t be mayor .  mayors is guys .      rashelle looked at him good naturedly and said in a perfect imitation of his tone of voice     hey  kid  some mayors is guys and some mayors is dames .  put that under your lid and let it bubble .      raych   s eyes protruded and he seemed stunned .  finally he managed to say     hey  ya talk regular  lady .         sure thing .  regular as ya want      said rashelle  still smiling .   seldon cleared his throat and said     that   s quite an accent you have  rashelle .      rashelle tossed her head slightly .     i haven   t had occasion to use it in many years  but one never forgets .  i once had a friend  a good friend  who was a dahlite when i was very young .     she sighed .     he didn   t speak that way  of course he was quite intelligent but he could do so if he wished and he taught me .  it was exciting to talk so with him .  it created a world that excluded our surroundings .  it was wonderful .  it was also impossible .  my father made that plain .  and now along comes this young rascal  raych  to remind me of those long ego days .  he has the accent  the eyes  the impudent cast of countenance  and in six years or so he will be a delight and terror to the young women .  won   t you  raych .      raych said     i dunno  lady uh  mum .         i   m sure you will and you will come to look very much like my  .   .   .  old friend and it will be much more comfortable for me not to see you then .  and now  dinner   s over and it   s time for you to go to your room  raych .  you can watch holovision for a while if you wish .  i don   t suppose you read .      raych reddened .     i   m gonna read someday .  master seldon says i   m gonna .         then i   m sure you will .      a young woman approached raych  curtsying respectfully in rashelle   s direction .  seldon had not seen the signal that had summoned her .   raych said     can   t i stay with master seldon and missus venabili .         you   ll see them later      said rashelle gently     but master and missus and i have to talk right now so you must go .      dors mouthed a firm    go .     at raych and with a grimace the boy slid out of his chair and followed the attendant .   rashelle turned to seldon and dors once raych was gone and said     the boy will be safe  of course  and treated well .  please have no fears about that .  and i will be safe too .  as my woman approached just now  so will a dozen armed men  and much more rapidly when summoned .  i want you to understand that .      seldon said evenly     we are in no way thinking of attacking you  rashelle  or must i now say     madam mayor    .         still rashelle .  i am given to understand that you are a wrestler of sorts  hari  and you  dors  are very skillful with the knives we have removed from your room .  i don   t want you to rely uselessly on your skills  since i want hari alive  unharmed  and friendly .         it is quite well understood  madam mayor      said dors  her lack of friendship uncompromised     that the ruler of wye  now and for the past forty years  is mannix  fourth of that name  and that he is still alive and in full possession of his faculties .  who  then  are you really .         exactly who i say i am  dors .  mannix iv is my father .  he is  as you say  still alive and in possession of his faculties .  in the eyes of the emperor and of all the empire  he is mayor of wye  but he is weary of the strains of power and is willing  at last  to let them slip into my hands  which are just as willing to receive them .  i am his only child and i was brought up all my life to rule .  my father is therefore mayor in law and name  but i am mayor in fact .  it is to me  now  that the armed forces of wye have sworn allegiance and in wye that is all that counts .      seldon nodded .     let it be as you say .  but even so  whether it is mayor mannix iv or mayor rashelle i it is the first  i suppose there is no purpose in your holding me .  i have told you that i don   t have a workable psychohistory and i do not think that either i or anyone else will ever have one .  i have cold that to the emperor .  i am of no use either to you or to him .      rashelle said     how naive you are .  do you know the history of the empire .      seldon shook his head .     i have recently come to wish that i knew it much better .      dors said dryly     i know imperial history quite well  though the pre imperial age is my specialty  madam mayor .  but what does it matter whether we do or do not .         if you know your history  you know that the house of wye is ancient and honorable and is descended from the dacian dynasty .      dors said     the dacians ruled five thousand years ago .  the number of their descendants in the hundred and fifty generations that have lived and died since then may number half the population of the galaxy if all genealogical claims  however outrageous  are accepted .         our genealogical claims  dr .  venabili    rashelle   s tone of voice was  for the first time  cold and unfriendly and her eyes flashed like steel     are not outrageous .  they are fully documented .  the house of wye has maintained itself consistently in positions of power through all those generations and there have been occasions when we have held the imperial throne and have ruled as emperors .         the history book films      said dors     usually refer to the wye rulers as    anti emperors      never recognized by the bulk of the empire .         it depends on who writes the history book films .  in the future  we wilt  for the throne which has been ours will be ours again .         to accomplish that  you must bring about civil war .         there won   t be much risk of that      said rashelle .  she was smiling again .     that is what i must explain to you because i want dr .  seldon   s help in preventing such a catastrophe .  my father  mannix iv  has been a man of peace all his life .  he has been loyal to whomever it might be that ruled in the imperial palace and he has kept wye a prosperous and strong pillar of the trantorian economy for the good of all the empire .         i don   t know that the emperor has ever trusted him any the more for all that      said dors .      i   m sure that is so      said rashelle calmly     for the emperors that have occupied the palace in my father   s time have known themselves to be usurpers of a usurping line .  usurpers cannot afford to trust the true rulers .  and yet my father has kept the peace .  he has  of course  developed and trained a magnificent security force to maintain the peace  prosperity  and stability of the sector and the imperial authorities have allowed this because they wanted wye peaceful  prosperous  stable  and loyal .         but is it loyal .     said dors .      to the true emperor  of course      said rashelle     and we have now reached the stage where our strength is such that we can take over the government quickly in a lightning stroke  in fact  and before one can say    civil war    there will be a true emperor  or empress  if you prefer  and trantor will be as peaceful as before .      dors shook her head .     may i enlighten you .  as a historian .         i am always willing to listen .     and she inclined her head ever so slightly toward dors .      whatever size your security force may be  however well trained and well equipped  they cannot possibly equal in size and strength the imperial forces backed by twenty five million worlds .         ah  but you have put your finger on the usurper   s weakness  dr .  venabili .  there are twenty five million worlds  with the imperial forces scattered over them .  those forces are thinned out over incalculable space  under uncounted officers  none of them particularly ready for any action outside their own provinces  many ready for action in their own interest rather than in the empire   s .  our forces  on the other hand  are all here  all on trantor .  we can act and conclude before the distant generals and admirals can get it through their heads that they are needed .         but that response will come  and with irresistible force .         are you certain of that .     said rashelle .     we will be in the palace .  trantor will be ours and at peace .  why should the imperial forces stir when  by minding their own business  each petty military leader can have his own world to rule  his own province .         but is that what you want .     asked seldon wonderingly .     are you telling me that you look forward to ruling over an empire that will break up into splinters .      rashelle said     that is exactly right .  i would rule over trantor  over its outlying space settlements  over the few nearby planetary systems that are part of the trantorian province .  i would much rather be emperor of trantor than emperor of the galaxy .         you would be satisfied with trantor only      said dors in tones of the deepest disbelief .      why not .     said rashelle  suddenly ablaze .  she leaned forward eagerly  both hands pressed palms down on the table .     that is what my father has been planning for forty years .  he is only clinging to life now to witness its fulfillment .  why do we need millions of worlds  distant worlds that mean nothing to us  that weaken us  that draw our forces far away from us into meaningless cubic parsecs of space  that drown us in administrative chaos  that ruin us with their endless quarrels and problems when they are all distant nothings as far as we are concerned .  our own populous world our own planetary city is galaxy enough for us .  we have all we need to support ourselves .  as for the rest of the galaxy  let it splinter .  every petty militarist can have his own splinter .  they needn   t fight .  there will be enough for all .         but they will fight  just the same      said dors .     each will refuse to be satisfied with his province .  each will feat that his neighbor is not satisfied with his province .  each will feel insecure and will dream of galactic rule as the only guarantee of safety .  this is certain  madam empress of nothing .  there will be endless wars into which you and trantor will be inevitably drawn to the ruin of all .      rashelle said with clear contempt     so it might seem  if one could see no farther than you do  if one relied on the ordinary lessons of history .         what is there to see farther .     retorted dors .     what is one to rely on beyond the lessons of history .         what lies beyond .     said rashelle .     why  he .         and her arm shot outward  her index finger jabbing toward seldon .      me .     said seldon .     i have already told you that psychohistory       rashelle said     do not repeat what you have already said  my good dr .  seldon .  we gain nothing by that .   do you think  dr .  venabili  that my father was never aware of the danger of endless civil war .  do you think he did not bend his powerful mind to thinking of some way to prevent that .  he has been prepared at any time these last ten years to take over the empire in a day .  it needed only the assurance of security beyond victory .         which you can   t have      said dors .      which we had the moment we heard of dr .  seldon   s paper at the decennial convention .  i saw at once that that was what we needed .  my father was too old to see the significance at once .  when i explained it  however  he saw it too and it was then that he formally transferred his power to me .  so it is to you  hari  that i owe my position and to you i will owe my greater position in the future .         i keep telling you that it cannot      began seldon with deep annoyance .      it is not important what can or cannot be done .  what is important is what people will or will not believe can be done .  they will believe you  hari  when you tell them the psychohistoric prediction is that trantor can rule itself and that the provinces can become kingdoms that will live together in peace .         i will make no such prediction      said seldon     in the absence of true psychohistory .  i won   t play the charlatan .  if you want something like that  you say it .         now  hari .  they won   t believe me .  it   s you they will believe .  the great mathematician .  why not oblige them .         as it happens      said seldom    the emperor also thought to use me as a source of self serving prophecies .  i refused to do it for him  so do you think i will agree to do it for you .      rashelle was silent for a while and when she spoke again her voice had lost its intense excitement and became almost coaxing .      hari      she said     think a little of the difference between cleon and myself .  what cleon undoubtedly wanted from you was propaganda to preserve his throne .  it would be useless to give him that  for the throne can   t be preserved .  don   t you know that the galactic empire is in a state of decay  that it cannot endure for much longer .  trantor itself is slowly sliding into ruin because of the ever increasing weight of administering twenty five million worlds .  what   s ahead of us is breakup and civil war  no matter what you do for cleon .      seldon said     i have heard something like this said .  it may even be true  but what then .         well then  help it break into fragments without any war .  help me take trantor .  help me establish a firm government over a realm small enough to  e ruled efficiently .  let me give freedom to the rest of the galaxy  each portion to go its own way according to its own customs and cultures .  the galaxy will become a working whole again through the free agencies of trade  tourism  and communication and the fate of cracking into disaster under the present rule of force that barely holds it together will be averted .  my ambition is moderate indeed  one world  not millions  peace  not war  freedom  not slavery .  think about it and help me .      seldon said     why should the galaxy believe me any more than they would believe you .  they don   t know me and which of our fleet commanders will be impressed by the mere word    psychohistory    .         you won   t be believed now  but i don   t ask for action now .  the house of wye  having waited thousands of years  can wait thousands of days more .  cooperate with me and i will make your name famous .  i will make the promise of psychohistory glow through all the worlds and at the proper time  when i judge the movement to be the chosen moment  you will pronounce your prediction and we will strike .  then  in a twinkling of history  the galaxy will exist under a new order that will render it stable and happy for eons .  come now  hari  can you refuse me .        overthrow    thalus  emmer   .   .   .  a sergeant in the armed security forces of the wye sector of ancient trantor  .   .   .    .   .   .  aside from these totally unremarkable vital statistics  nothing is known of the man except that on one occasion he held the fate of the galaxy in his fist .   encyclopedia galactica       .     breakfast the next morning was served in an alcove near the rooms of the captured three and it was luxurious indeed .  there certainly was a considerable variety to the food and more than enough of everything .   seldon sat at the breakfast table with a mound of spicy sausages before him  totally ignoring dors venabili   s gloomy predictions concerning stomachs and colic .   raych said     the dame  .   .   .  the madam mayor said when she came to see me last night          she came to see you .     said seldon .      yeah .  she said she wanted to make sure i was comfortable .  she said when she had a chance she would take me to a zoo .         a zoo .     seldon looked at dors .     what kind of zoo can they have on trantor .  cats and dogs .         there are some aboriginal animals      said dors     and i imagine they import some aboriginals from other worlds and there are also the shared animals that all the worlds have other worlds having more than trantor  of course .  as a matter of fact  wye has a famous zoo  probably the best on the planet after the imperial zoo itself .      raych said     she   s a nice old lady .         not that old      said dors     but she   s certainly feeding us well .         there   s that      admitted seldon .   when breakfast was over  raych left to go exploring .   once they had retired to dors   s room  seldon said with marked discontent     i don   t know how long we   ll be left to ourselves .  she   s obviously plotted ways of preoccupying our time .      dors said     actually  we have little to complain of at the moment .  we   re much more comfortable here than we were either in mycogen or dahl .      seldon said     dors  you   re not being won over by that woman  are you .         me .  by rashelle .  of course not .  how can you possibly think so .         welt  you   re comfortable .  you   re well fed .  it would be natural to relax and accept what fortune brings .         yes  very natural .  and why not do that .         look  you were telling me last night about what   s going to happen if she wins out .  i may not be much of a historian myself  but i am willing to take your word for it and  actually  it makes sense even to a nonhistorian .  the empire will shatter and its shards will be fighting each other for  .   .   .  for  .   .   .  indefinitely .  she must be stopped .         i agree      said dors .     she must be .  what i fail to see is how we can manage to do that little thing right at this moment .     she looked at seldon narrowly .     hari  you didn   t sleep fast night  did you .         did you .     it was apparent he had not .   dors stared at him  a troubled look clouding her face .     have you lain awake thinking of galactic destruction because of what i said .         that and some other things .  is it possible to reach chetter hummin .     this last was said in a whisper .   dors said     i tried to reach him when we first had to flee arrest in dahl .  he didn   t come .  i   m sure he received the message  but he didn   t come .  it may be that  for any of a number of reasons  he just couldn   t come to us  but when he can he will .         do you suppose something has happened to him .         no      said dors patiently .     i don   t think so .         how can you know .         the word would somehow get to me .  i   m sure of it .  and the word hasn   t gotten to me .      seldon frowned and said     i   m not as confident as you are about all this .  in fact  i   m not confident at all .  even if hummin came  what can he do in this case .  he can   t fight all of wye .  if they have  as rashelle claims  the best organized army on trantor  what will he be able to do against it .         there   s no point in discussing that .  do you suppose you can convince rashelle bang it into her head somehow that you don   t have psychohistory .         i   m sure she   s aware that i don   t have it and that i   m not going to get it for many years if at all .  but she   ll say i have psychohistory and if she does that skillfully enough  people will believe her and eventually they will act on what she says my predictions and pronouncements are  even if i don   t say a word .         surely  that will take rime .  she won   t build you up overnight .  or in a week .  to do it properly  it might take her a year .      seldon was pacing the length of the room  turning sharply on his heel and striding back .     that might be so  but i don   t know .  there would be pressure on her to do things quickly .  she doesn   t strike me as the kind of woman who has cultivated the habit of patience .  and her old father  mannix iv  would be even more impatient .  he must feel the nearness of death and if he   s worked for this all his life  he would much prefer to see it done a week before his death rather than a week after .  besides      here he paused and looked around the empty room .      besides what .         well  we must have our freedom .  you see  i   ve solved the psychohistory problem .      dors   s eyes widened .     you have it .  you   ve worked it out .         not worked it out in the full sense .  that might take decades  .   .   .  centuries  for all i know .  but i now know it   s practical  not just theoretical .  i know it can be done so i must have the time  the peace  the facilities to work at it .  the empire must be held together till i  or possibly my successors will learn how best to keep it so or how to minimize the disaster if it does split up despite us .  it was the thought of having a beginning to my task and of not being able to work at it  that kept me up last night .           .     it was their fifth day in wye and in the morning dors was helping raych into a formal costume that neither was quite familiar with .   raych looked at himself dubiously in the holo mirror and saw a reflected image that faced him with precision  imitating all his motions but without any inversion of left and right .  raych had never used a holo mirror before and had been unable to keep from trying to feel it  then laughing  almost with embarrassment  when his hand passed through it while the image   s hand poked ineffectually at his real body .   he said at last     i look funny .      he studied his tunic  which was made of a very pliant material  with a thin filigreed belt  then passed his hands up a stiff collar that rose like a cup past his ears on either side .      my head looks like a ball inside a bowl .      dors said     but this is the sort of thing rich children wear in wye .  everyone who sees you will admire you and envy you .         with my hair all stuck down .         certainly .  you   ll wear this round little hat .         it   ll make my head more like a ball .         then don   t let anyone kick it .  now  remember what i told you .  keep your wits about you and don   t act like a kid .         but i am a kid      he said  looking up at her with a wide eyed innocent expression .      i   m surprised to hear you say that      said dors .     i   m sure you think of yourself as a twelve year old adult .      raych grinned .     okay .  i   ll be a good spy .         that   s not what i   m telling you to be .  don   t take chances .  don   t sneak behind doors to listen .  if you get caught at it  you   re no good to anyone especially not to yourself .         aw  c   mon  missus  what do ya think i am .  a kid or somethin    .         you just said you were  didn   t you  raych .  you just listen to everything that   s said without seeming to .  and remember what you hear .  and tell us .  that   s simple enough .         simple enough for you to say  missus venabili      said raych with a grin     and simple enough for me to do .         and be careful .      raych winked .     you bet .      a flunky  as coolly impolite as only an arrogant flunky can be  came to take raych to where rashelle was awaiting him .   seldon looked after them and said thoughtfully     he probably won   t see the zoo  he   ll be listening so carefully .  i   m not sure it   s right to thrust a boy into danger like that .         danger .  i doubt it .  raych was brought up in the slums of billibotton  remember .  i suspect he has more alley smarts than you and i put together .  besides  rashelle is fond of him and will interpret everything he does in his favor .   poor woman .         are you actually sorry for her  dors .         do you mean that she   s not worth sympathy because she   s a mayor   s daughter and considers herself a mayor in her own right and because she   s intent on destroying the empire .  perhaps you   re right  but even so there are some aspects of her for which one might show some sympathy .  for instance  she   s had an unhappy love affair .  that   s pretty evident .  undoubtedly  her heart was broken for a time  at least .      seldon said     have you ever had an unhappy love affair  dors .      der considered for a moment or two  then said     not really .  i   m too involved with my work to get a broken heart .         i thought as much .         then why did you ask .         i might have been wrong .         how about you .      seldon seemed uneasy .     as a matter of fact  yes .  i have spared the time for a broken heart .  badly cracked  anyway .         i thought as much .         then why did you ask .         not because i thought i might be wrong  i promise you .  i just wanted to see if you would lie .  you didn   t and i   m glad .      there was a pause and then seldon said     five days have passed and nothing has happened .         except that we are being treated well  hari .         if animals could think  they   d think they were being treated well when they were only being fattened for the slaughter .         i admit she   s fattening the empire for the slaughter .         but when .         i presume when she   s ready .         she boasted she could complete the coup in a day and the impression i got was that she could do that on any day .         even if she could  she would want to make sure that she could cripple the imperial reaction and that might take time .         how much time .  she plans to cripple the reaction by using me  but she is making no effort to do so .  there is no sign that she   s trying to build up my importance .  wherever i go in wye i   m unrecognized .  there are no wyan crowds gathering to cheer me .  there   s nothing on the news holocasts .      dors smiled .     one would almost suppose that your feelings are hurt at not being made famous .  you   re naive  hari .  or not a historian  which is the same thing .  i think you had better be more pleased that the study of psychohistory will be bound to make a historian of you than that it may save the empire .  if all human beings understood history  they might cease making the same stupid mistakes over and over .         in what way am i native .     asked seldom lifting his head and staring down his nose at her .      don   t be offended  hari .  i think it   s one of your attractive features  actually .         i know .  it arouses your maternal instincts and you have been asked to take care of me .  but in what way am i naive .         in thinking that rashelle would cry to propagandize the population of the empire  generally  into accepting you as seer .  she would accomplish nothing in that way .  quadrillions of people are hard to move quickly .  there is social and psychological inertia  as well as physical inertia .  and  by coming out into the open  she would simply alert demerzel .         then what is she doing .         my guess is that the information about you suitably exaggerated and glorified is going out to a crucial few .  it is going to those viceroys of sectors  those admirals of fleets  those people of influence she feels look kindly .  upon her  or grimly upon the emperor .  a hundred or so of those who might rally to her side will manage to confuse the loyalists just long enough to allow rashelle the first to set up her new order firmly enough to beat off whatever resistance might develop .  at least  i imagine that is how she reasons .         and yet we haven   t heard from hummin .         i   m sure he must be doing something just the same .  this is too important to ignore .         has it occurred to you that he might be dead .         that   s a possibility  but i don   t think so .  if he was  the news would reach me .         here .         even here .      seldon raised his eyebrows  but said nothing .   raych came back in the late afternoon  happy and excited  with descriptions of monkeys and of bakarian demoires and he dominated the conversation during dinner .   it was not until after dinner when they were in their own quarters that dors said     now  tell me what happened with madam mayor  raych .  tell me anything she did or said that you think we ought to know .         one thing      said raych  his face lighting up .     that   s why she didn   t show at dinner  i bet .         what was it .         the zoo was closed except for us  you know .  there were lots of us  rashelle and me and all sorts of guys in uniforms and dames in fancy clothes and like that .  then this guy in a uniform a different guy  who wasn   t there to begin with came in toward the end and he said something in a low voice and rashelle corned to all the people and made with her hand like they shouldn   t move and they didn   t .  and she went a little ways away with this new guy  so she could talk to him and no one could hear her .  except i kept paying no attention and kept looking at the different cages and sort of moved near to rashelle so i could hear her .      she said     how dare they .     like she was real mad .  and the guy in the uniform  he looked nervous i just got quick looks because i was trying to make out like i was watching the animals so mostly i just heard the words .  he said somebody i don   t remember the name  but he was a general or somethin  .  he said this general said the officers had sworn religious to rashelle   s old man          sworn allegiance      said dors .      somethin    like that and they was nervous about havin    to do what a dame says .  he said they wanted the old man or else  if he was kind of sick  he should pick some guy to be mayor  not a dame .         not a dame .  are you sure .         that   s what he said .  he like whispered it .  he was so nervous and rashelle was so mad she could hardly speak .  she said     i   ll have his head .  they wilt all swear allegiance to me tomorrow and whoever refuses will lave cause to regret it before an hour has passed .     that   s exactly what she said .  she broke up the whole party and we all came back and she didn   t say one word to me al .  the rime .  just sat there  looking kinda mean and angry .      dors said     good .  don   t you mention this to anyone  raych .         course not .  is it what you wanted .         very much what i wanted .  you did well  raych .  now  go to your room and forget the whole thing .  don   t even think about it .      once he was gone  dors turned to seldon and said     this is very interesting .  daughters have succeeded fathers  or mothers  for that matter  and held mayoralties or other high offices on any number of occasions .  there have even been reigning empresses  as you undoubtedly know  and i can   t recall that there was ever in imperial history any serious question of serving under one .  it makes one wonder why such a thing should now  arise in wye .      seldon said  why not .  we   ve only recently been in mycogen  where women are held in a total lack of esteem and couldn   t possibly hold positions of power  however minor .         yes  of course  but that   s an exception .  there are other places where women dominate .  for the most part  though  government and power have been more or less equisexual .  if more men tend to hold high positions  it is usually because women tend to be more bound biologically to children .         but what is the situation in wye .         equisexual  as far as i know .  rashelle didn   t hesitate to assume mayoral power and i imagine old mannix didn   t hesitate to grant it to her .  and she was surprised and furious at encountering male dissent .  she can   t have expected it .      seldon said     you   re clearly pleased at this .  why .         simply because it   s so unnatural that it must be contrived and i imagine hummin is doing the contriving .      seldon said thoughtfully     you think so .         i do      said dors .      you know      said seldon     so do i .           .     it was their tenth day in wye and in the morning hari seldon   s door signal sounded and raych   s high pitched voice outside was crying out     mister .  mister seldom it   s war .      seldon took a moment to swap from sleep to wakefulness and scrambled out of bed .  he was shivering slightly  the wyans liked their domiciles on the chilly side  he had discovered quite early in his stay there  when he threw the door open .   raych bounced in  excited and wide eyed .     mister seldon  they have mannix  the old mayor    .  they have          who have  raych .         the imperials  their jets came in last night all over .  the news holocasts are telling all about it .  it   s on in missus   s room .  she said to let ya sleep  but i figured ya would wanner know .         and you were quite right .     seldom pausing only tong enough to throw on a bathrobe  burst into dors   s room .  she was fully dressed and was watching the bolo sec in the alcove .   behind the clear  small image of a desk sat a man  with the spaceship and sun sharply defined on the left front of his tunic .  on either side  two soldiers  also wearing the spaceship and sun  stood armed .  the officer at the desk was saying      is under the peaceful control of his imperial majesty .  mayor mannix is safe and well and is in full possession of his mayoral powers under the guidance of friendly imperial troops .  he will be before you soon to urge calm on all wyans and to ask any wyan soldiers still in arms to lay them down .      there were other news holocasts by various newsmen with unemotional voices  all wearing imperial armbands .  the news was all the same  surrender by this or that unit of the wyan security forces after firing a few shots for the record  and sometimes after no resistance at all .  this town center and that town center were occupied  and there were repeated views of wyan crowds somberly watching imperial forces marching down the streets .   dors said     it was perfectly executed  hari .  surprise was complete .  there was no chance of resistance and none of consequence was offered .      then mayor mannix iv appeared  as had been promised .  he was standing upright and  perhaps for the sake of appearances  there were no imperials in sight  though seldon was reasonably certain that an adequate number were present just out of camera range .   mannix was old  but his strength  though worn  was still apparent .  his eyes did not meet the holo camera and his words were spoken as though forced upon him but  as had been promised  they counseled wyans to remain calm  to offer no resistance  to keep wye from harm  and to cooperate with the emperor who  it was hoped  would survive long on the throne .      no mention of rashelle      said seldon .     it   s as though his daughter doesn   t exist .         no one has mentioned her      said dors     and this place  which is  after all  her residence  or one of them hasn   t been attacked .  even if she manages to slip away and take refuge in some neighboring sector  i doubt she will be safe anywhere on trantor for long .         perhaps not      came a voice     but i   ll be safe here for a little while .      rashelle entered .  she was properly dressed  properly calm .  she was even smiling  but it was no smile of joy  it was  rather  a cold baring of teeth .   the three stared at her in surprise for a moment and seldon wondered if she had any of her servants with her or if they had promptly deserted her at the first sign of adversity .       dors said a little coldly     i see  madam mayor  that your hopes for a coup can not be maintained .  apparently  you have been forestalled .         i have not been forestalled .  i have been betrayed .  my officers have been tampered with and against all history and rationality    they have refused to fight for a woman but only for their old master .  and  traitors that they are  they then let their old master be seized so that he cannot lead them in resistance .      she looked about for a chair and sat down .     and now the empire must continue to decay and die when i was prepared to offer it new life .         i think      said dors     the empire has avoided an indefinite period of useless fighting and destruction .  console yourself with that  madam mayor .      it was as though rashelle did not hear her .     so many years of preparation destroyed in a night .     she sat there beaten  defeated  and seemed to have aged twenty years .   dors said     it could scarcely have been done in a night .  the suborning of your officers if that took place must have taken time .         at that  demerzel is a master and quite obviously i underestimated him .  how he did it  i don   t know threats  bribes  smooth and specious argument .  he is a master at the art of stealth and betrayal i should have known .      she went on after a pause .     if this was outright force on his part  i would have had no trouble destroying anything he sent against us .  who would think that wye would be betrayed  that an oath of allegiance would be so lightly thrown aside .      seldon said with automatic rationality     but i imagine the oath was made not to you  but to your father .         nonsense      said rashelle vigorously .     when my father gave me the mayoral office  as he was legally entitled to do  he automatically passed on to me any oaths of allegiance made to him .  there is ample precedence for this .  it is customary to have the oath repeated to the new ruler  but that is a ceremony only and not a legal requirement .  my officers know that  though they choose to forget .  they use my womanhood as an excuse because they quake in fear of imperial vengeance that would never have come had they been staunch or tremble with greed for promised rewards they will surely never get if i know demerzel .      she turned sharply toward seldon .     he wants you  you know .  demerzel struck at us for you .      seldon started .     why me .         don   t be a fool .  for the same reason i wanted you  .   .   .  to use you as a cool  of course .     she sighed .     at least i am not utterly betrayed .  there are still loyal soldiers to be found .   sergeant .      sergeant emmer thalus entered with a soft cautious step that seemed incongruous  considering his size .  his uniform was spruce  his long blond mustache fiercely curled .      madam mayor      he said  drawing himself to attention with a snap .   he was still  in appearance  the side of beef that hari had named him a man still following orders blindly  totally oblivious to the new and changed state of affairs .   rashelle smiled sadly at raych .     and how are you  little raych .  i had meant to make something of you .  it seems now i won   t be able to .         hello  missus  .   .   .  madam      said raych awkwardly .      and to have made something of you too  dr .  seldom    said rashelle     and there also i must crave pardon .  i cannot .         for me  madam  you need have no regrets .         but i do .  i cannot very well let demerzel have you .  that would be one victory too many for him and at least i can stop that .         i would not work for him  madam  i assure you  any more than i would have worked for you .         it is not a matter of work .  it is a matter of being used .  farewell  dr .  seldon .   sergeant  blast him .      the sergeant drew his blaster at once and dors  with a loud cry  lunged forward  but seldon reached out for her and caught her by the elbow .  he hung on desperately .      stay hack  dors      he shouted     or he   ll kill you .  he won   t kill me .  you too  raych .  stand back .  don   t move .      seldon faced the sergeant .     you hesitate  sergeant  because you know you cannot shoot i might have killed you ten days ago  but i did not .  and you gave me your word of honor at that time that you would protect me .         what are you waiting for .     snapped rashelle .     i said shoot him down  sergeant .      seldom said nothing more .  he stood there while the sergeant  eyes bulging  held his blaster steady and pointed at seldon   s head .      you have your order .     shrieked rashelle .      i have your word      said seldon quietly .   and sergeant thalus said in a choked tone     dishonored either way .     his hand fell and his blaster clanged to the floor .   rashelle cried out     then you too betray me    .      before seldon could move or dors free herself from his grip  rashelle seized the blaster  turned it on the sergeant  and closed contact .   seldon had never seen anyone blasted before .  somehow  from the name of the weapon perhaps  he had expected a loud noise  an explosion of flesh and blood .  this wyan blaster  at least  did nothing of the sort .  what mangling it did to the organs inside the sergeant   s chest seldon could not tell but  without a change in expression  without a wince of pain  the sergeant crumbled and fell  dead beyond any doubt or any hope .   and rashelle turned the blaster on seldon with a firmness that put to rest any hope for his own life beyond the next second .   it was raych  however  who jumped into action the moment the sergeant fell .  racing between seldon and rashelle  he waved his hands wildly .      missus  missus      he called .     don   t shoot .      for a moment  rashelle looked confused .     out of the way  raych .  i don   t want to hurt you .      that moment of hesitation was all dors needed .  breaking loose violently  she plunged toward rashelle with a long low dive .  rashelle went down with a cry and the blaster hit the ground a second time .   raych retrieved it .   seldon  with a deep and shuddering breath  said     raych  give that to me .      but raych backed away .     ya ain   t gonna kill her  are ya  mister seldon .  she was nice to me .         i won   t kill anyone  raych      said seldon .     she killed the sergeant and would have killed me  but she didn   t shoot rather than hurt you and we   ll let her live for that .      it was seldon  who now sat down  the blaster held loosely in his hand  white dors removed the neuronic whip from the dead sergeant   s other holster .   a new voice rang out .     i   ll take care of her now  seldon .      seldon looked up and in sudden joy said     hummin .  finally .         i   m sorry it took so long  seldon .  i had a lot to do .  how are you  dr .  venabili .  i take it this is mannix   s daughter  rashelle .  but who is the boy .         raych is a young dahlite friend of ours      said seldon .   soldiers were entering and  at a small gesture from hummin  they lifted rashelle respectfully .   dors  able to suspend her intent surveillance of the other woman  brushed at her clothes with her hands and smoothed her blouse .  seldon suddenly realized that he was still in his bathrobe .   rashelle  shaking herself loose from the soldiers with contempt  pointed to hummin and said to seldon     who is this .      seldon said     it is chetter hummin  a friend of mine and my protector on this planet .         your protector .     rashelle laughed madly .     you fool .  you idiot .  that man is demerzel and if you look at your venabili woman  you will see from her face that she is perfectly aware of that .  you have been trapped all along  far worse than ever you were with me .           .     hummin and seldon sat at lunch that day  quite alone  a pall of quiet between them for the most part .  it was toward the end of the meal that seldon stirred and said in a lively voice     well  sir  how do i address you .  i think of you as    chetter hummin    still  but even if i accept you in your other persona  i surely cannot address you as    eto demerzel .     in that capacity  you have a title and i don   t know the proper usage .  instruct me .      the other said gravely     call me  hummin    if you don   t mind .  or    chetter .     yes  i am eto demerzel  but with respect to you i am hummin .  as a matter of fact  the two are not distinct .  i told you that the empire is decaying and failing .  i believe that to be true in both my capacities .  i told you that i wanted psychohistory as a way of preventing that decay and failure or of bringing about a renewal and reinvigoration if the decay and failure must run its course .  i believe that in both my capacities too .         but you had me in your grip i presume you were in the vicinity when i gad my meeting with his imperial majesty .         with cleon .  yes  of course .         and you might have spoken to me  then  exactly as you later did as hummin .         and accomplished what .  as demerzel  i have enormous tasks .  i have to handle cleon  a well meaning but not very capable ruler  and prevent him  insofar as i can  from making mistakes .  i have to do my bit in governing trantor and the empire coo .  and  as you see  i had to spend a great deal of time in preventing wye from doing harm .         yes  i know      murmured seldon .      it wasn   t easy and i nearly lost out .  i have spent years sparring carefully with mannix  learning to understand his chinking and planning a countermove to his every move .  i did not think  at any time  that while he was still alive he would pass on his powers to his daughter .  i had not studied her and i was not prepared for her utter lack of caution .  unlike her father  she has been brought up to take power for granted and had no clear idea of its limitations .  so she got you and forced me to act before i was quite ready .         you almost lost me as a result .  i faced the muzzle of a blaster twice .     .      i know      said hummin  nodding .     and we might have lost you upperside coo another accident i could not foresee .         but you haven   t really answered my question .  why did you send me chasing all over the face of trantor to escape from demerzel when you yourself were demerzel .         you told cleon that psychohistory was a purely theoretical concept  a kind of mathematical game that made no practical sense .  that might indeed have been so  but if i approached you officially  i was sure you would merely have maintained your belief .  yet i was attracted to the notion of psychohistory .  i wondered whether it might not be  after all  just a game .  you must understand that i didn   t want merely to use you  i wanted a real and practical psychohistory .      so i sent you  as you put it  chasing all over the face of trantor with the dreaded demerzel close on your heels at all times .  that  i felt  would concentrate your mind powerfully .  it would make psychohistory something exciting and much more than a mathematical game .  you would try to work it our for the sincere idealist hummin  where you would not for the imperial flunky demerzel .  also  you would get a glimpse of various sides of trantor and that too would be helpful certainly more helpful than living in an ivory tower on a far off planet  surrounded entirely by fellow mathematicians .  was i right .  have you made progress .      seldon said     in psychohistory .  yes  i did  hummin .  i thought you knew .         how should i know .         i told dors .         but you hadn   t told me .  nevertheless  you tell me so now .  that is good news .         not entirely      said seldon .     i have made only the barest beginning .  but it is a beginning .         is it the kind of beginning that can be explained to a nonmathematician .         i think so .  you see  hummin  from the start i have seen psychohistory as a science that depends on the interaction of twentyfive million worlds  each with an average population of four thousand million .  it   s too much .  there   s no way of handling something that complex .  if d was to succeed at all  if there was to be any way of finding a useful psychohistory  i would first have to find a simpler system .      so i thought i would go back in time and deal with a single world  a world that was the only one occupied by humanity in the dim age before the colonization of the galaxy .  in mycogen they spoke of an original world of aurora and in dahl i heard word of an original world of earth .  i thought they might be the same world under different names  but they were sufficiently different in one key point  at least  to make that impossible .  and it didn   t matter .  so little was known of either one  and that little so obscured by myth and legend  that there was no hope of making use of psychohistory in connection with them .      he paused to sip at his cold juice  keeping his eyes firmly on hummin   s face .   hummin said     well .  what then .         meanwhile  dors had told me something i call the hand on thigh story .  it was of no innate significance  merely a humorous and entirely trivial tale .  as a result  though  dors mentioned the different sex mores on various worlds and in various sectors of trantor .  it occurred to me that she treated the different trantorian sectors as though they were separate worlds .  i thought  idly  that instead of twenty five million different worlds  i had twenty five million plus eight hundred to deal with .  it seemed a trivial difference  so i forgot it and thought no more about it .      but as i traveled from the imperial sector to streeling to mycogen to dahl to wye  i observed for myself how different each was .  the thought of trantor not as a world but as a complex of worlds grew stronger  but still i didn   t see the crucial point .      it was only when i listened to rashelle  you see  it was good that i was finally captured by wye and it was good that rashelle   s rashness drove her into the grandiose schemes that she imparted to me when i listened to rashelle  as i said  she told me that all she wanted was trantor and some immediately adjacent worlds .  it was an empire in itself  she said  and dismissed the outer worlds as    distant nothings .         it was then that  in a moment  i saw what i must have been harboring in my hidden thoughts for a considerable time .  on the one hand  trantor possessed an extraordinarily complex social system  being a populous world made up of eight hundred smaller worlds .  it was in itself a system complex enough to make psychohistory meaningful and yet it was simple enough  compared to the empire as a whole  to make psychohistory perhaps practical .      and the outer worlds  the twenty five million of them .  they were    distant nothings .     of course  they affected trantor and were affected by trantor  but these were second order effects .  if i could make psychohistory work as a first approximation for trantor alone  then the minor effects of the outer worlds could be added as later modifications .  do you see what i mean .  i was searching for a single world on which to establish a practical science of psychohistory and i was searching for it in the far past  when all the time the single world i wanted was under my feet now       hummin said with obvious relief and pleasure     wonderful .         but it   s all left to do  hummin .  i must study trantor in sufficient detail .  i must devise the necessary mathematics to deal with it .  if i am lucky and live out a full lifetime  i may have the answers before i die .  if not  my successors will have to follow me .  conceivably  the empire may have fallen and splintered before psychohistory becomes a useful technique .         i will do everything i can to help you .         i know it      said seldon .      you trust me  then  despite the fact i am demerzel .         entirely .  absolutely .  but i do so because you are not demerzel .         but i am      insisted hummin .      but you are not .  your persona as demerzel is as far removed from the truth as is your persona as hummin .         what do you mean .     hummin   s eyes grew wide and he backed away slightly from seldon .      i mean that you probably chose the name    hummin    out of a wry sense of what was fitting .     hummin    is a mispronunciation of    human      isn   t it .      hummin made no response .  he continued to stare at seldon .   and finally seldon said     because you   re not human  are you     hummin demerzel    .  you   re a robot .        dors    seldon  hari   .   .   .  it is customary to think of hari seldon only in connection with psychohistory  to see him only as mathematics and social change personified .  there is no doubt that he himself encouraged this for at no time in his formal writings did he give any hint as to how he came to solve the various problems of psychohistory .  his leaps of thought might have all been plucked from air  for all he tells us .  nor does he tell us of the blind alleys into which he crept or the wrong turnings he may have made  .    .   .   .  as for his private life  it is a blank .  concerning his parents and siblings  we know a handful of factors  no more .  his only son  raych seldon  is known to have been adopted  but how that came about is not known .  concerning his wife  we only know that she existed .  clearly  seldon wanted to be a cipher except where psychohistory was concerned .  it is as though he felt  or wanted it to be felt that he did not live  he merely psychohistorified .   encyclopedia galactica       .     hummin sat calmly  not a muscle twitching  still looking at hari seldon and seldon  for his part  waited .  it was hummin  he thought  who should speak next .   hummin did  but said merely     a robot .  me .   by robot  i presume you mean an artificial being such as the object you saw in the sacratorium in mycogen .         not quite like that      said seldon .      not metal .  not burnished .  not a lifeless simulacrum .     hummin said it without any evidence of amusement .      no .  to be of artificial life is not necessarily to be made of metal .  i speak of a robot indistinguishable from a human being in appearance .     .      if indistinguishable  hari  then how do you distinguish .         not by appearance .          explain .         hummin  in the course of my flight from yourself as demerzel  i heard of two ancient worlds  as i told you aurora and earth .  each seemed to be spoken of as a first world or an only world .  in both cases  robots were spoken of  but with a difference .      seldon was staring thoughtfully at the man across the table  wondering if  in any way  he would give some sign that he was less than a man  or more .  he said     where aurora was in question  one robot was spoken of as a renegade  a traitor  someone who deserted the cause .  where earth was in question  one robot was spoken of as a hero  one who represented salvation .  was it too much to suppose that it was the same robot .         was it .     murmured hummin .      this is what i thought  hummin .  i thought that earth and aurora were two separate worlds  co existing in time .  i don   t know which one preceded the other .  from the arrogance and the conscious sense of superiority of the mycogenians  i might suppose that aurora was the original world and that they despised the earthmen who derived from them  or who degenerated from them .      on the other hand  mother rittah  who spoke to me of earth  was convinced that earth was the original home of humanity and  certainly  the tiny and isolated position of the mycogenians in a whole galaxy of quadrillions of people who lack the strange mycogenian ethos might mean that earth was indeed the original home and that aurora was the aberrant offshoot .  i cannot tell  but i pass on to you my thinking  so that you will understand my final conclusions .      hummin nodded .     i see what you are doing .  please continue .         the worlds were enemies .  mother rittah certainly made it sound so .  when i compare the mycogenians  who seem to embody aurora  and the dahlites  who seem to embody earth  i imagine that aurora  whether first or second  was nevertheless the one that was more advanced  the one that could produce more elaborate robots  even ones indistinguishable from human beings in appearance .  such a robot was designed and devised in aurora  then .  but he was a renegade  so he deserted aurora .  to the earthpeople he was a hero  so he must have joined earth .  why he did this  what his motives were  i can   t say .      hummin said     surely  you mean why it did this  what its motives were .         perhaps  but with you sitting across from me      said seldon     i find it difficult to use the inanimate pronoun .  mother rittah was convinced that the heroic robot her heroic robot still existed  that he would return when he was needed .  it seemed to me that there was nothing impossible in the thought of an immortal robot or at least one who was immortal as long as the replacement of worn out parts was not neglected .         even the brain .     asked hummin .      even the brain .  i don   t really know anything about robots  but i imagine a new brain could be re recorded from the old .    and mother rittah hinted of strange mental powers .   i thought  it must be so .  i may  in some ways  be a romantic  but i am not so much a romantic as to think that one robot  by switching from one side to the other  can alter the course of history .  a robot could not make earth   s victory sure  nor aurora   s defeat certain unless there was something strange  something peculiar about the robot .      hummin said     does it occur to you  hari  that you are dealing with legends  legends that may have been distorted over the centuries and the millennia  even to the extent of building a veil of the supernatural over quire ordinary events .  can you make yourself believe in a robot that not only seems human  but that also lives forever and has mental powers .  are you not beginning to believe in the superhuman .         i know very well what legends are and i am not one to be taken in by them and made to believe in fairy tales .  still  when they are supported by certain odd events that i have seen  and even experienced myself          such as .         hummin  i met you and trusted you from the start .  yes  you helped me against those two hoodlums when you didn   t need to and that predisposed me in your favor  since i didn   t realize at the time that they were your hirelings  doing what you had instructed them to do .    but never mind that .         no      said hummin  a hint of amusement finally in his voice .      i trusted you .  i was easily convinced not to go home to helicon and to make myself a wanderer over the face of trantor .  i believed everything you told me without question .  i placed myself entirely in your hands .  looking back on it now  i see myself as not myself .  i am not a person to be so easily led  yet i was .  more than that  i did not even think it strange that i was behaving so far out of character .         you know yourself best  hari          it wasn   t only me .  how is it that dors venabili  a beautiful woman with a career of her own  should abandon that career in order to join me in my flight .  how is it that she should risk her life to save mine  seeming to take on  as a kind of holy duty  the cask of protecting me and becoming single minded in the process .  was it simply because you asked her to .         i did ask her to  hari .         yet she does not strike me as the kind of person to make such a radical changeover in her life merely because someone asks her to .  nor could i believe it was because she had fallen madly in love with me at first sight and could not help herself .  i somehow wish she had  but she seems quite the mistress of her emotional self  more i am now speaking to you frankly than i myself am with respect to her .         she is a wonderful woman      said hummin .     i don   t blame you .      seldon went on .     how is it  moreover  that sunmaster fourteen  a monster of arrogance and one who leads a people who are themselves stiff necked in their own conceit  should be willing to take in tribespeople like dors and myself and to treat us as well as the mycogenians could and did .  when we broke every rule  committed every sacrilege  how is it that you could still talk him into letting us go .      how could you talk the tisalvers  with their petty prejudices  into taking us in .  how can you be at home everywhere in the world  be friends with everyone  influence each person  regardless of their individual peculiarities .  for that matter  how do you manage to manipulate cleon too .  and if he is viewed as malleable and easily molded  then how were you able to handle his father  who by all accounts was a rough and arbitrary tyrant .  how could you do all this .      most of all  how is it that mannix iv of wye could spend decades building an army without peer  one trained to be proficient in every detail  and yet have it fall apart when his daughter tries to make use of it .  how could you persuade them to play the renegade  all of them  as you have done .      hummin said     might this mean no more than that i am a tactful person used to dealing with people of different types  that i am in a position to have done favors for crucial people and am in a position to do additional favors in the future .  nothing i have done  it might seem  requires the supernatural .         nothing you have done .  not even the neutralization of the wyan army .         they did not wish to serve a woman .         they must have known for years that any time mannix laid down his powers or any time he died  rashelle would be their mayor  yet they showed no signs of discontent until you felt it necessary that they show it .  dors described you at one time as a very persuasive man .  and so you are .  more persuasive than any man could be .  but you are not more persuasive than an immortal robot with strange mental powers might be .   well  hummin .      hummin said     what is it you expect of me  hari .  do you expect me to admit i   m a robot .  that i only look like a human being .  that i am immortal .  that i am a mental marvel .  .      seldon leaned toward hummin as he sat there on the opposite side of the table .     yes  hummin  i do .  i expect you to tell me the truth and i strongly suspect that what you have just outlined is the truth .  you  hummin  are the robot that mother rittah referred to as danee  friend of ba lee .  you must admit it .  you have no choice .           .     it was as though they were sitting in a tiny universe of their own .  there  in the middle of wye  with the wyan army being disarmed by imperial force  they sat quietly .  there  in the midst of events that all of trantor and perhaps all the galaxy was watching  there was this small bubble of utter isolation within which seldon and hummin were playing their game of attack and defense seldon trying hard to force a new reality  hummin making no move to accept that new reality .   seldon had no fear of interruption .  he was certain that the bubble within which they sat had a boundary that could not be penetrated  that hummin   s no  the robot   s powers would keep all at a distance rill the game was over .   hummin finally said     you are an ingenious fellow  hari  but i fail to see why i must admit that i am a robot and why i have no choice but to do so .  everything you say may be true as facts your own behavior  dors   s behavior  sunmaster   s  tisalver   s  the wyan generals    all  all may have happened as you said  but that doesn   t force your interpretation of the meaning of the events to be true .  surely  everything that happened can have a natural explanation .  you trusted me because you accepted what i said  dors felt your safety to be important because she felt psychohistory to be crucial  herself being a historian  sunmaster and tisalver were beholden to me for favors you know nothing of  the wyan generals resented being ruled by a woman  no more .  why must we flee to the supernatural .      seldon said     see here  hummin  do you really believe the empire to be falling and do you really consider it important that it not be allowed to do so with no move made to save it or  at the least  cushion its fall .         i really do .     somehow seldon knew this statement was sincere .     and you really want me to work out the details of psychohistory and you feel that you yourself cannot do it .         i lack the capability .         and you feel that only i can handle psychohistory even if i sometimes doubt it myself .         yes .         and you must therefore feel that if you can possibly help me in any way  you must .         i do .         personal feelings selfish considerations could play no part .      a faint and brief smile passed over hummin   s grave face and for a moment seldon sensed a vast and arid desert of weariness behind hummin   s quiet manner .     i have built a long career on paying no heed to personal feelings or to selfish considerations .         then i ask your help .  i can work out psychohistory on the basis of trantor alone  but i will run into difficulties .  those difficulties i may overcome  but how much easier it would be to do so if i knew certain key facts .  for instance  was earth or aurora the first world of humanity or was it some other world altogether .  what was the relationship between earth and aurora .  did either or both colonize the galaxy .  if one  why didn   t the other .  if both  how was the issue decided .  are there worlds descended from both or from only one .  how did robots come to be abandoned .  how did trantor become the imperial world  rather than another planet .  what happened to aurora and earth in the meantime .  there are a thousand questions i might ask right now and a hundred thousand that might arise as i go along .  would you allow me to remain ignorant  hummin  and fail in my task when you could inform me and help me succeed .      hummin said     if i were the robot  would i have room in my brain for all of twenty thousand years of history for millions of different worlds .         i don   t know the capacity of robotic brains .  i don   t know the capacity of yours .  but if you lack the capacity  then you must have that information which you cannot hold safely recorded in a place and in a way that would make it possible for you to call upon it .  and if you have it and i need information  how can you deny and withhold it from me .  and if you cannot withhold it from me  how can you deny that you are a robot that robot the renegade .      seldon sat back and took a deep breath .     so i ask you again  are you that robot .  if you want psychohistory  then you must admit it .  if you still deny you are a robot and if you convince me you are not  then my chances at psychohistory become much  much smaller .  it is up to you  then .  are you a robot .  are you da nee .      and hummin said  as imperturbable as ever .     your arguments are irrefutable .  i am r .  daneel olivaw .  the  r    stands for    robot .             .   r .  daneel olivaw still spoke quietly  but it seemed to seldon that there was a subtle change in his voice  as though he spoke more easily now that he was no longer playing a part .      in twenty thousand years      said daneel     no one has guessed i was a robot when it was not my intention to have him or her know .  in part  that was because human beings abandoned robots so long ago that very few remember that they even existed at one time .  and in part  it is because i do have the ability to detect and affect human emotion .  the detection offers no trouble  but to affect emotion is difficult for me for reasons having to do with my robotic nature although i can do it when i wish .  i have the ability but must deal with my will not to use it .  i try never to interfere except when i have no choice but to do so .  and when i do interfere  it is rarely that i do more than strengthen  as little as i can  what is already there .  if i can achieve my purposes without doing even so much  i avoid it .      it was not necessary to tamper with sunmaster fourteen in order to have him accept you i call it    tampering      you notice  because it is not a pleasant thing to do .  i did not have to tamper with him because he did owe me for favors rendered and he is an honorable man  despite the peculiarities you found in him .  i did interfere the second time  when you had committed sacrilege in his eyes  but it took very little .  he was not anxious to hand you over to the imperial authorities  whom he does not like .  i merely strengthened the dislike a trifle and he handed you over to my care  accepting the arguments i offered  which otherwise he might have considered specious .      nor did i tamper with you noticeably .  you distrusted the imperials too .  most human beings do these days  which is an important factor in the decay and deterioration of the empire .  what   s more  you were proud of psychohistory as a concept  proud of having thought of it .  you would not have minded having it prove to be a practical discipline .  that would have further fed your pride .      seldon frowned and said     pardon me  master robot  but i am not aware that i am quite such a monster of pride .      daneel said mildly     you are not a monster of pride at all .  you are perfectly aware that is neither admirable nor useful to be driven by pride  so you try to subdue that drive  but you might as well disapprove of having yourself powered by your heartbeat .  you cannot help either fact .  though you hide your pride from yourself for the sake of your own peace of mind  you cannot hide it from me .  it is there  however carefully you mask it over .  and i had but to strengthen it a touch and you were at once willing to take measures to hide from demerzel  measures that a moment before you would have resisted .  and you were eager to work at psychohistory with an intensity that a moment before you would have scorned .      i saw no necessity to touch anything else and so you have reasoned out your robothood .  had i foreseen the possibility of that  i might have stopped it  but my foresight and my abilities are not infinite .  nor am i sorry now that i failed  for your arguments are good ones and it is important that you know who i am and that i use what i am to help you .      emotions  my dear seldom are a powerful engine of human action  far more powerful than human beings themselves realize  and you cannot know how much can be dome with the merest touch and how reluctant i am to do it .      seldon was breathing heavily  trying to see himself as a man driven by pride and not liking it .     why reluctant .         because it would be so easy to overdo .  i had to stop rashelle from converting the empire into a feudal anarchy .  i might have bent minds quickly and the result might well have been a bloody uprising .  men are men  and the wyan generals are almost all men .  it does not actually take much to rouse resentment and latent fear of women in any man .  it may be a biological matter that i  as a robot  cannot fully understand .      i had but to strengthen the feeling to produce a breakdown in her plans .  if i had done it the merest millimeter too much  i would have lost what i wanted a bloodless takeover .  i wanted nothing more than to have them not resist when my soldiers arrived .      daneel paused  as though trying to pick his words  then said     i do not wish to go into the mathematics of my positronic brain .  it is more than i can understand  though perhaps not more than you can if you give it enough thought .  however  i am governed by the three laws of robotics that are traditionally put into words  or once were  long ago .  they are these         one .  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .        two .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law .          three .  a robot must protect its own existence  as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .         but i had a  .   .   .  a friend twenty thousand years ago .  another robot .  not like myself .  he could not be mistaken for a human being  but it was he who had the mental powers and it was through him that i gained mine .      it seemed to him that there should be a still more general rule than any of the three laws .  he called it the zeroth law  since zero comes before one .  it is         zero .  a robot may not injure humanity or  through inaction  allow humanity to come to harm .         then the first law must read        one .  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  except where that would conflict with the zeroth law .         and the other laws must be similarly modified .  do you understand .      daneel paused earnestly and seldon said     i understand .      daneel went on .     the trouble is  hari  that a human being is easy to identify .  i can point to one .  it is easy to see what will harm a human being and what won   t relatively easy  at least .  but what is humanity .  to what can we point when we speak of humanity .  and how can we define harm to humanity .  when will a course of action do more good than harm to humanity as a whole and how can one tell .  the robot who first advanced the zeroth law died became permanently inactive because he was forced into an action that he felt would save humanity  yet which he could not be cure would save humanity .  and as he became inactivated  he left the care of the galaxy to me .      since then  i have cried .  i have interfered as little as possible  relying on human beings themselves to judge what was for the good .  they could gamble  i could not .  they could miss their goals  i did not dare .  they could do harm unwittingly  i would grow inactive if i did .  the zeroth law makes no allowance for unwitting harm .      but at times i am forced to take action .  that i am still functioning shows that my actions have been moderate and discreet .  however  as the empire began to fail and to decline  i have had to interfere more frequently and for decades now i have had to play the role of demerzel  trying to run the government in such a way as to stave off ruin  and yet i will function  you see .      when you made your speech to the decennial convention  i realized at once that in psychohistory there was a tool that might make it possible to identify what was good and bad for humanity .  with it  the decisions we would make would be less blind .  i would even trust to human beings to make those decisions and again reserve myself only for the greatest emergencies .  so i arranged quickly to have cleon learn of your speech and call you in .  then  when i heard your denial of the worth of psychohistory  i was forced to think of some way to make you try anyway .  do you understand  hari .      more than a little daunted  seldon said     i understand  hummin .         to you  i must remain hummin on those rare occasions when i will be able to see you .  i will give you what information i have if it is something you need and in my persona as demerzel i will protect you as much as i can .  as daneel  you must never speak of me .         i wouldn   t want to      said seldon hurriedly .     since i need your help  it would ruin matters to have your plans impeded .         yes  i know you wouldn   t want to .     daneel smiled wearily .     after all  you are vain enough to want full credit for psychohistory .  you would not want anyone to know ever that you needed the help of a robot .      seldon flushed .     i am not          but you are  even if you carefully hide it from yourself .  and it is important  for i am strengthening that emotion within you minimally so that you will never be able to speak of me to others .  it will not even occur to you that you might do so .      seldon said     i suspect dors knows          she knows of me .  and she too cannot speak of me to others .  now that you both know of my nature  you can speak of me to each other freely  but not to anyone else .      daneel rose .   hari  i have my work to do now .  before long  you and dors will be taken back to the imperial sector          the boy raych must come with me .  i cannot abandon him .  and there is a young dahlite named yugo amaryl          i understand .  raych will be taken too and you can do with any friend as you will .  you will all be taken care of appropriately .  and you will work on psychohistory .  you will have a staff .  you will have the necessary computers and reference material .  i will interfere as little as possible and if there is resistance to your views that does not actually reach the point of endangering the mission  then you will have to deal with it yourself .         wait  hummin      said seldon urgently .     what if  despite all your help and all my endeavors  it turns out that psychohistory cannot be made into a practical device after all .  what if i fail .      daneel rose .     in that case  i have a second plan in hand .  one i have been working on a long time on a separate world in a separate way .  it too is very difficult and to some ways even more radical than psychohistory .  it may fail too  but there is a greater chance of success if two roads are open than if either one alone was .      take my advice  hari .  if the time comes when you are able to set up some device that may act to prevent the worst from happening see if you can think of two devices  so that if one fails  the other will carry on .  the empire must be steadied or rebuilt on a new foundation .  let there be two such  rather than one  if that is possible .      he rose     now i must return to my ordinary work and you must turn to yours .  you will be taken care of .      with one final nod  he rose and left .   seldon looked after him and said softly     first i must speak to dors .           .     dors said     the palace is cleared .  rashelle will not be physically harmed .  and you   ll return to the imperial sector  hari .         and you  dors .     said seldon in a low tight voice .      i presume i will go back to the university      she said .     my work is being neglected  my classes abandoned .         no  dors  you have a greater cask .         what is that .         psychohistory .  i cannot tackle the project without you .         of course you can .  i am a total illiterate in mathematics .         and i in history  and we need both .      dors laughed .     i suspect that  as a mathematician  you are one of a kind .  i  as a historian  am merely adequate  certainly not outstanding .  you will find any number of historians who will suit the needs of psychohistory better than i do .         in that case  dors  let me explain that psychohistory needs more than a mathematician and a historian .  it also needs the will to tackle what will probably be a lifetime problem .  without you  dors  i will not have that will .         of course you   ll have it .         dors  if you   re not with me  i don   t intend to have it .      dors looked at seldon thoughtfully .     this is a fruitless discussion  hari .  undoubtedly  hummin will make the decision .  if he sends me hack to the university     he won   t .         how can you be sure .         because i   ll put it to him plainly .  if he sends you back to the university  i   ll go back to helicon and the empire can go ahead and destroy itself .         you can   t mean it .         but i certainly do .         don   t you realize that hummin can arrange to have your feelings change so that you will work on psychohistory  even without me .      seldon shook his head .     hummin will not make such an arbitrary decision .  i   ve spoken to him .  he dares not do much to the human mind because he is bound by what he calls the laws of robotics .  to change my mind to the point where i will not want you with me  dors  would mean a change of the kind he can not risk .  on the other hand  if he leaves me alone and if you join me in the project  he will have what he wants a true chance at psychohistory .  why should he not settle for that .      dors shook her head .     he may not agree for reasons of his own .     .      why should he disagree .  you were asked to protect me  dors .  has hummin cancelled that request .         no .         then he wants you to continue your protection .  and i want your protection .         against what .  you now have hummin   s protection  both as demerzel and as daneel  and surely that is all you need .         if i had the protection of every person and every force in the galaxy  it would still be yours i would want .         then you don   t want me for psychohistory .  you want me for protection .      seldon scowled .     no .  why are you twisting my words .  why are you forcing me to say what you must know .  it is neither psychohistory nor protection i want you for .  those are excuses and i   ll use any other i need .  i want you just you .  and if you want the real reason  it is because you are you .         you don   t even know me .         that doesn   t matter .  i don   t care .    and yet i do know you in a way .  better than you think .         do you indeed .         of course .  you follow orders and you risk your life for without hesitation and with no apparent care for the consequences you learned how to play tennis so quickly .  you learned how to use knives even more quickly and you handled yourself perfectly in the fight with marron .  inhumanly  if i may say so .  your muscles are amazingly strong and your reaction time is amazingly fast .  you can somehow tell when a room is being eavesdropped and you can be in touch with hummin in some way that does not involve instrumentation .      dors said     and what do you think of all that .         it has occurred to me that hummin  in his persona as r .  daneel olivaw  has an impossible task .  how can one robot try to guide the empire .  he must have helpers .         that is obvious .  millions  i should imagine .  i am a helper .  you are a helper .  little raych is a helper .         you are a different kind of helper .         in what way .  hari  say it .  if you hear yourself say it  you will realize how crazy it is .      seldon looked long at her and then said in a low voice     i will not say it because  .   .   .  i don   t care .          you really don   t .  you wish to take me as i am .         i will take you as i must .  you are dors and  whatever else you are  in all the world i want nothing else .      dors said softly     hari  i want what is good for you because of what i am  but i feel that if i wasn   t what i am  i would still want what is good for you .  and i don   t think i am good for you .         good for me or bad  i don   t care .     here hari looked down as he paced a few steps  weighing what he would say next .     dors  have you ever been kissed .         of course  hari .  it   s a social part of life and i live socially .         no no .  i mean  have you ever really kissed a man .  you know  passionately .         well yes  hari  i have .         did you enjoy it .      dors hesitated .  she said     when i   ve kissed in that way  i enjoyed it more than i would have enjoyed disappointing a young man i liked  someone whose friendship meant something to me .     at this point  dors blushed and she turned her face away .     please  hari  this is difficult for me to explain .      but hari  more determined now than ever  pressed further .     so you kissed for the wrong reasons  then  to avoid hurt feelings .         perhaps everyone does  in a sense .      seldon mulled this over  then said suddenly     did you ever ask to be kissed .      dors paused  as though looking back on her life .     no .         or wish to be kissed again  once you had .         no .         have you ever slept with a man .     he asked softly  desperately .      of course .  i told you .  these things are a part of life .      hari gripped her shoulders as if he was going to shake her .     but have you ever felt the desire  a need for that kind of closeness with just one special person .  dors  have you ever felt love .      dors looked up slowly  almost sadly  and locked eyes with seldon .     i   m sorry  hari  but no .      seldon released her  letting his arms fall dejectedly to his sides .   then dors placed her hand gently on his arm and said     so you see  hari .  i   m not really what you want .      seldon   s head drooped and he stared at the floor .  he weighed the matter and tried to think rationally .  then he gave up .  he wanted what he wanted and he wanted it beyond thought and beyond rationality .   he looked up .     dors  dear  even so  i don   t care .      seldon put his arms around her and brought his head close to hers slowly  as though waiting for her to pull away  all the while drawing her nearer .   dors made no move and he kissed her slowly  lingeringly  and then passionately  and her arms suddenly tightened around him .   when he stopped at last  she looked at him with eyes that mirrored her smile and she said      kiss me again  hari   please .           end
