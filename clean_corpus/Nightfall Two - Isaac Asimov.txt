in       at the beginning of his writing career  isaac asimov published a story   nightfall   which almost immediately became an sf classic .  but  nightfall s  resounding success has irritated its author ever since .   as he reasonably says  thirty years of solid star studded professionalism  think of the world famous foundation trilogy  of    robot  the caves of steel  etc  etc  must surely have produced stories as fine as and possibly far superior to that early tale .  yet there are still people around   and people whose opinions asimov respects   to tell him that  nightfall  is the finest thing he ever wrote .  finally  in       in an effort to exorcise  nightfall s  ghost once and for all  he made his own selection of twenty stories from the scores he has written and presented them in chronological order in nightfall and other stories .  it was an instant bestseller .   for technical reasons this first paperback edition of nightfall and other stories is published as two companion volumes .  this volume  nightfall two  ranges across the asimov worlds from  in a good cause           to  segregationist         .   each volume is a self contained collection .  together they compose an unparalleled selection of the best of asimov chosen by asimov himself .    nightfall one  also available  ranges from  nightfall  itself        to  c chute         .   also by isaac

for making  nightfall  possible   and for thirty years of friendship  and  to the memory of anthony boucher  and groff conklin      there is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author .  the answer is   not necessarily   and yet one ought to add another short phrase    but usually .    when i write a story in which opposing characters have opposing viewpoints  i do my best  in so far as it lies within my capabilities  to let each character express his own viewpoint honestly .   there are few people who  like richard iii in shakespeare s play  are willing to say   since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair and well spoken days  i am determined to prove a villain .    no matter how villainous tom may appear to dick  tom undoubtedly has arguments  quite sincerely felt  to prove to himself that he is not villainous at all .  it is therefore quite ridiculous to have a villain act ostentatiously like a villain  unless you have the genius of shakespeare and can carry off anything   and i m afraid i haven t  .   still  no matter how i try to be fair  and how i try to present each person s views honestly  i cannot make myself be as convincing in presenting views that don t appeal to me  as in presenting those that do .  besides  the general working out of my story usually proceeds as i want it to  the victory  in one way or another  tends to lie with those characters whom i particularly like .  even if the ending is tragic  the point of the story  i hate to use the word  moral   is usually one that satisfies me .   in short  if you ignore the fine details of any of my stories and consider it as a whole  i think you will find that the feeling it leaves with you is the feeling that i myself feel .  it isn t a matter of conscious propaganda  it s just that i am a human being who feels something and who cannot help having that feeling show in the story .   but there are exceptions    in       mr .  raymond j .  healy  an anthologist of note  was planning a collection of original science fiction stories  and asked me to write one .  he made only one specification .  he wanted an upbeat story   something which  in my own more unsophisticated way  i called a  happy ending  story .   .  so i wrote a happy ending  but since i always try to beat the rules out of sheer bravado  i tried to write an unexpected happy ending  one in which the reader doesn t find out till the very end what the happy ending really is .   it was only after i had successfully  i think  managed this particular tour de force and had had the story published  that i realized that my interest in technique had for once blinded me to content .  somehow this particular story   in a good cause       doesn t quite reflect my own feelings .   groff conklin  the late perceptive science fiction critic  once said that he liked this story  even though he disagreed with its philosophy  and to my embarrassment  i find that that is exactly how i myself feel .   first appearance   new tales of space and time       .  copyright        by henry holt and company  inc .      in a good cause       in the great court    which stands as a patch of untouched peace among the fifty busy square miles devoted to the towering buildings that are the pulse beat of the united worlds of the galaxy  stands a statue .   it stands where it can look at the stars at night .  there are other statues ringing the court  but this one stands in the center and alone .   it is not a very good statue .  the face is too noble and lacks the lines of living .  the brow is a shade too high  the nose a shade too symmetrical  the clothing a shade too carefully disposed .  the whole bearing is by far too saintly to be true .  one can suppose that the man in real life might have frowned at times  or hiccuped  but the statue seemed to insist that such imperfections were impossible .   all this  of course  is understandable overcompensation .  the man had no statues raised to him while alive  and succeeding generations  with the advantage of hindsight  felt guilty .   the name on the pedestal reads  richard sayama altmayer  .  underneath it is a short phrase and  vertically arranged  three dates .  the phrase is   in a good cause  there are no failures .   the three dates are june           september          december             the years being counted in the usual manner of the period  that is  from the date of the first atomic explosion in      of the ancient era .   none of those dates represents either his birth or death .  they mark neither a date of marriage or of the accomplishment of some great deed or  indeed  of anything that the inhabitants of the united worlds can remember with pleasure and pride .  rather  they are the final expression of the feeling of guilt .   quite simply and plainly  they are the three dates upon which richard sayama altmayer was sent to prison for his opinions .       june          at the age of twenty two  certainly  dick altmayer was fully capable of feeling fury .  his hair was as yet dark brown and he had not grown the mustache which  in later years  would be so characteristic of him .  his nose was  of course  thin and high bridged  but the contours of his face were youthful .  it would be only later that the growing gauntness of his cheeks would convert that nose into the prominent landmark that it now is in the minds of trillions of school children .   geoffrey stock was standing in the doorway  viewing the results of his friend s fury .  his round face and cold  steady eyes were there  but he had yet to put on the first of the military uniforms in which he was to spend the rest of his life .   he said   great galaxy .    altmayer looked up .   hello  jeff .     what s been happening  dick .  i thought your principles  pal  forbid destruction of any kind .  here s a book viewer that looks somewhat destroyed .   he picked up the pieces .   altmayer said   i was holding the viewer when my wave receiver came through with an official message .  you know which one  too .     i know .  it happened to me  too .  where is it .     on the floor .  i tore it off the spool as soon as it belched out at me .  wait  let s dump it down the atom chute .     hey  hold on .  you can t      why not .     because you won t accomplish anything .  you ll have to report .     and just why .     don t be an ass  dick .     this is a matter of principle  by space .     oh  nuts .  you can t fight the whole planet .     i don t intend to fight the whole planet  just the few who get us into wars .    stock shrugged .   that means the whole planet .  that guff of yours of leaders tricking poor innocent people into fighting is just so much space dust .  do you think that if a vote were taken the people wouldn t be overwhelmingly in favor of fighting this fight .     that means nothing  jeff .  the government has control of      the organs of propaganda .  yes  i know .  i ve listened to you often enough .  but why not report  anyway .    altmayer turned away .   stock said   in the first place  you might not pass the physical examination .     i d pass .  i ve been in space .     that doesn t mean anything .  if the doctors let you hop a liner  that only means you don t have a heart murmur or an aneurysm .  for military duty aboard ship in space you need much more than just that .  how do you know you qualify .     that s a side issue  jeff  and an insulting one .  it s not that i m afraid to fight .     do you think you can stop the war this way .     i wish i could   altmayer s voice almost shook as he spoke .   it s this idea i have that all mankind should be a single unit .  there shouldn t be wars or space fleets armed only for destruction .  the galaxy stands ready to be opened to the united efforts of the human race .  instead  we have been factioned for nearly two thousand years  and we throw away all the galaxy .    stock laughed   we re doing all right .  there are more than eighty independent planetary systems .     and are we the only intelligences in the galaxy .     oh  the diaboli  your particular devils   and stock put his fists to his temples and extended the two forefingers  waggling them .    and yours  too  and everybody s .  they have a single government extending over more planets than all those occupied by our precious eighty independents .     sure  and their nearest planet is only fifteen hundred light years away from earth and they can t live on oxygen planets anyway .    stock got out of his friendly mood .  he said  curtly   look  i dropped by here to say that i was reporting for examination next week .  are you coming with me .     no .     you re really determined .     i m really determined .     you know you ll accomplish nothing .  there ll be no great flame ignited on earth .  it will be no case of millions of young men being excited by your example into a no war strike .  you will simply be put in jail .     well  then  jail it is .    and jail it was .  on june           of the atomic era  after a short trial in which richard sayama altmayer refused to present any defense  he was sentenced to jail for the term of three years or for the duration of the war  whichever should be longer .  he served a little over four years and two months  at which time the war ended in a definite though not shattering santan nian defeat .  earth gained complete control of certain disputed asteroids  various commercial advantages  and a limitation of the santannian navy .   the combined human losses of the war were something over two thousand ships with  of course  most of their crews  and in addition  several millions of lives due to the bombardment of planetary surfaces from space .  the fleets of the two contending powers had been sufficiently strong to restrict this bombardment to the outposts of their respective systems  so that the planets of earth and santanni  themselves  were little affected .   the war conclusively established earth as the strongest single human military power .   geoffrey stock fought throughout the war  seeing action more than once and remaining whole in life and limb despite that .  at the end of the war he had the rank of major .  he took part in the first diplomatic mission sent out by earth to the world of the diaboli  and that was the first step in his expanding role in earth s military and political life .         september s        they were the first diaboli ever to have appeared on the surface of earth itself .  the .  projection posters and the newscasts of the federalist party made that abundantly clear to any who were unaware of that .  over and over  they repeated the chronology of events .   it was toward the beginning of the century that human explorers first came across the diaboli .  they were intelligent and had discovered interstellar travel independently somewhat earlier than had the humans .  already the galactic volume of their dominions was greater than that which was human occupied .   regular diplomatic relationships between the diaboli and the major human powers had begun twenty years earlier  immediately after the war between santanni and earth .  at that time  outposts of diaboli power were already within twenty light years of the outermost human centers .  their missions went everywhere  drawing trade treaties  obtaining concessions on unoccupied asteroids .   and now they were on earth itself .  they were treated as equals and perhaps as more than equals by the rulers of the greatest center of human population in the galaxy .  the most damning statistic of all was the most loudly proclaimed by the federalists .  it was this  although the number of living diaboli was somewhat less than the total number of living humans  humanity had opened up not more than five new worlds to colonization in fifty years  while the diaboli had begun the occupation of nearly five hundred .    a hundred to one against us   cried the federalists   because they are one political organization and we are a hundred .   but relatively few on earth  and fewer in the galaxy as a whole  paid attention to the federalists and their demands for galactic union .   the crowds that lined the streets along which nearly daily the five diaboli of the mission traveled from their specially conditioned suite in the best hotel of the city to the secretariat of defense were  by and large  not hostile .  most were merely curious  and more than a little revolted .   the diaboli were not pleasant creatures to look at .  they were larger and considerably more massive than earthmen .  they had four stubby legs set close together below and two flexibly fingered arms above .  their skin was wrinkled and naked and they wore no clothing .  their broad  scaly faces wore no expressions capable of being read by earthmen  and from flattened regions just above each large pupilled eye there sprang short horns .  it was these last that gave the creatures their names .  at first they had been called devils  and later the politer latin equivalent .   each wore a pair of cylinders on its back from which flexible tubes extended to the nostrils  there they clamped on tightly .  these were packed with soda lime which absorbed the  to them  poisonous carbon dioxide from the air they breathed .  their own metabolism revolved about the reduction of sulfur and sometime those foremost among the humans in the crowd caught a foul whiff of the hydrogen sulfide exhaled by the diaboli .   the leader of the federalists was in the crowd .  he stood far back where he attracted no attention from the police who had roped off the avenues and who now maintained a watchful order on the little hoppers that could be maneuvered quickly through the thickest crowd .  the federalist leader was gaunt faced  with a thin and prominently bridged nose and straight  graying hair .   he turned away   i cannot bear to look at them .    his companion was more philosophic .  he said   no uglier in spirit  at least  than some of our handsome officials .  these creatures are at least true to their own .     you are sadly right .  are we entirely ready .     entirely .  there won t be one of them alive to return to his world .     good .  i will remain here to give the signal .    the diaboli were talking as well .  this fact could not be evident to any human  no matter how close .  to be sure  they could communicate by making ordinary sounds to one another but that was not their method of choice .  the skin between their horns could  by the actions of muscles which differed in their construction from any known to humans  vibrate rapidly .  the tiny waves which were transmitted in this manner to the air were too rapid to be heard by the human ear and too delicate to be detected by any but the most sensitive of human instrumentation .  at that time  in fact  humans remained unaware of this form of communication .   a vibration said   did you know that this is the planet of origin of the two legs .     no .   there was a chorus of such nos  and then one particular vibration said   do you get that from the two leg communications you have been studying  queer one .     because i study the communications .  more of our people should do so instead of insisting so firmly on the complete worthlessness of two leg culture .  for one thing  we are in a much better position to deal with the two legs if we know something about them .  their history is interesting in a horrible way .  i am glad i brought myself to view their spools .     and yet   came another vibration   from our previous contacts with two legs  one would be certain that they did not know their planet of origin .  certainly there is no veneration of this planet  earth  or any memorial rites connected with it .  are you sure the information is correct .     entirely so .  the lack of ritual  and the fact that this planet is by no means a shrine  is perfectly understandable in the light of two leg history .  the two legs on the other worlds would scarcely concede the honor .  it would somehow lower the independent dignity of their own worlds .     i don t quite understand .     neither do i  exactly  but after several days of reading i think i catch a glimmer .  it would seem that  originally  when interstellar travel was first discovered by the two legs  they lived under a single political unit .     naturally .     not for these two legs .  this was an unusual stage in their history and did not last .  after the colonies on the various worlds grew and came to reasonable maturity  their first interest was to break away from the mother world .  the first in the series of interstellar wars among these two legs began then .     horrible .  like cannibals .     yes  isn t it .  my digestion has been upset for days .  my cud is sour .  in any case  the various colonies gained independence  so that now we have the situation of which we are well aware .  all of the two leg kingdoms  republics  aristocracies  etc .   are simply tiny clots of worlds  each consisting of a dominant world and a few subsidiaries which  in turn  are forever seeking their independence or being shifted from one dominant to another .  this earth is the strongest among them and yet less than a dozen worlds owe it allegiance .     incredible that these creatures should be so blind to their own interests .  do they not have a tradition of the single government that existed when they consisted of but one world .     as i said that was unusual for them .  the single government had existed only a few decades .  prior to that  this very planet itself was split into a number of subplanetary political units .     never heard anything like it .   for a while  the supersonics of the various creatures interfered with one another .    it s a fact .  it is simply the nature of the beast .    and with that  they were at the secretariat of defense .   the five diaboli stood side by side along the table .  they stood because their anatomy did not admit of anything that could correspond to  sitting  .  on the other side of the table  five earthmen stood as well .  it would have been more convenient for the humans to sit but  understandably  there was no desire to make the handicap of smaller size any more pronounced than it already was .  the table was a rather wide one  the widest  in fact  that could be conveniently obtained .  this was out of respect for the human nose  for from the diaboli  slightly so as they breathed  much more so when they spoke  there came the gentle and continuous drift of hydrogen sulfide .  this was a difficulty rather unprecedented in diplomatic negotiations .   ordinarily the meetings did not last for more than half an hour  and at the end of this interval the diaboli ended their conversations without ceremony and turned to leave .  this time  however  the leave taking was interrupted .  a man entered  and the five human negotiators made way for him .  he was tall  taller than any of the other earthmen  and he wore a uniform with the ease of long usage .  his face was round and his eyes cold and steady .  his black hair was rather thin but as yet untouched by gray .  there was an irregular blotch of scar tissue running from the point of his jaw downward past the line of his high  leather brown collar .  it might have been the result of a hand energy ray  wielded by some forgotten human enemy in one of the five wars in which the man had been an active participant .    sirs   said the earthman who had been chief negotiator hitherto   may i introduce the secretary of defense .    the diaboli were somewhat shocked and  although their expressions were in response and inscrutable  the sound plates on their foreheads vibrated actively .  their strict sense of hierarchy was disturbed .  the secretary was only a two leg  but by two leg standards  he outranked them .  they could not properly conduct official business with him .   the secretary was aware of their feelings but had no choice in the matter .  for at least ten minutes  their leaving must be delayed and no ordinary interruption could serve to hold back the diaboli .    sirs   he said   i must ask your indulgence to remain longer this time .    the central diabolus replied in the nearest approach to english any diabolus could manage .  actually  a diabolus might be said to have two mouths .  one was hinged at the outermost extremity of the jawbone and was used in eating .  in this capacity  the motion of the mouth was rarely seen by human beings  since the diaboli much preferred to eat in the company of their own kind exclusively .  a narrower mouth opening  however  perhaps two inches in width  could be used in speaking .  it pursed itself open  revealing the gummy gap where a diabolus  missing incisors ought to have been .  it remained open during speech  the necessary consonantal blockings being performed by the palate and back of the tongue .  the result was hoarse and fuzzy  but understandable .   the diabolus said   you will pardon us  already we suffer .   and by his forehead  he twittered unheard   they mean to suffocate us in their vile atmosphere .  we must ask for larger poison absorbing cylinders .    the secretary of defense said   i am in sympathy with your feelings  and yet this may be my only opportunity to speak with you .  perhaps you would do us the honor to eat with us .    the earthmen next the secretary could not forbear a quick and passing frown .  he scribbled rapidly on a piece of paper and passed it to the secretary  who glanced momentarily at it .   it read   no .  they eat sulfuretted hay .  stinks unbearably .   the secretary crumpled the note and let it drop .   the diabolus said   the honor is ours .  were we physically able to endure your strange atmosphere for so long a time  we would accept most gratefully .    and via forehead  he said with agitation   they cannot expect us to eat with them and watch them consume the corpses of dead animals .  my cud would never be sweet again .     we respect your reasons   said the secretary .   let us then transact our business now .  in the negotiations that have so far proceeded  we have been unable to obtain from your government  in the persons of you  their representatives  any clear indication as to what the boundaries of your sphere of influence are in your own minds .  we have presented several proposals in this matter .     as far as the territories of earth are concerned  mr .  secretary  a definition has been given .     but surely you must see that this is unsatisfactory .  the boundaries of earth and your lands are nowhere in contact .  so far  you have done nothing but state this fact .  while true  the mere statement is not satisfying .     we do not completely understand .  would you have us discuss the boundaries between ourselves and such independent human kingdoms as that of vega .     why  yes .     that cannot be done  sir .  surely  you realize that any relations between ourselves and the sovereign realm of vega cannot possibly be any concern of earth .  they can be discussed only with vega .     then you will negotiate a hundred times with the hundred human world systems .     it is necessary .  i would point out  however  that the necessity is imposed not by us but by the nature of your human organization .     then that limits our field of discussion drastically .   the secretary seemed abstracted .  he was listening  not exactly to the diaboli opposite  but  rather  it would seem  to something at a distance .   and now there was a faint commotion  barely heard from outside the secretariat .  the babble of distant voices  the brisk crackle of energy guns muted by distance to nearly nothingness  and the hurried click clacking of police hoppers .   the diaboli showed no indication of hearing  nor was this simply another affectation of politeness .  if their capacity for receiving supersonic sound waves was far more delicate and acute than almost anything human ingenuity had ever invented  their reception for ordinary sound waves was rather dull .   the diabolus was saying   we beg leave to state our surprise .  we were of the opinion that all this was known to you .    a man in police uniform appeared in the doorway .  the secretary turned to him and  with the briefest of nods  the policeman departed .   the secretary said suddenly and briskly   quite .  i merely wished to ascertain once again that this was the case .  i trust you will be ready to resume negotiations tomorrow .     certainly  sir .    one by one  slowly  with a dignity befitting the heirs of the universe  the diaboli left .   an earthman said   i m glad they refused to eat with us .     i knew they couldn t accept   said the secretary  thoughtfully .   they re vegetarian .  they sicken thoroughly at the very thought of eating meat .  i ve seen them eat  you know .  not many humans have .  they resemble our cattle in the business of eating .  they bolt their food and then stand solemnly about in circles  chewing their cuds in a great community of thought .  perhaps they intercommunicate by a method we are unaware of .  the huge lower jaw rotates horizontally in a slow  grinding process     the policeman had once more appeared in the doorway .   the secretary broke off  and called   you have them all .     yes  sir .     do you have altmayer .     yes  sir .     good .    the crowd had gathered again when the five diaboli emerged from the secretariat .  the schedule was strict .  at      p . m .  each day they left their suite and spent five minutes walking to the secretariat .  at        they emerged therefrom once again and returned to their suite  the way being kept clear by the police .  they marched stolidly  almost mechanically  along the broad avenue .   halfway in their trek there came the sounds of shouting men .  to most of the crowd  the words were not clear but there was the crackle of an energy gun and the pale blue fluorescence split the air overhead .  police wheeled  their own energy guns drawn  hoppers springing seven feet into the air  landing delicately in the midst of groups of people  touching none of them  jumping again almost instantly .  people scattered and their voices were joined to the general uproar .   through it all  the diaboli  either through defective hearing or excessive dignity  continued marching as mechanically as ever .   at the other end of the gathering  almost diametrically opposing the region of excitement  richard sayana altmayer stroked his nose in a moment of satisfaction .  the strict chronology of the diaboli had made a split second plan possible .  the first diversionary disturbance was only to attract the attention of the police .  it was now    and he fired a harmless sound pellet into the air .   instantly  from four directions  concussion pellets split the air .  from the roofs of buildings lining the way  snipers fired .  each of the diaboli  torn by the shells  shuddered and exploded as the pellets detonated within them .  one by one  they toppled .   and from nowhere  the police were at altmayer s side .  he stared at them with some surprise .   gently  for in twenty years he had lost his fury and learned to be gentle  he said   you come quickly  but even so you come too iate .   he gestured in the direction of the shattered diaboli .   the crowd was in simple panic now .  additional squadrons of police  arriving in record time  could do nothing more than herd them off into harmless directions .    .  the policeman  who now held altmayer in a firm grip  taking the sound gun from him and inspecting him quickly for further weapons  was a captain by rank .  he said  stiffly   i think you ve made a mistake  mr .  altmayer .  you ll notice you ve drawn no blood .   and he  too  waved toward where the diaboli lay motionless .   altmayer turned  startled .  the creatures lay there on their sides  some in pieces  tattered skin shredding away  frames distorted and bent  but the police captain was correct .  there was no blood  no flesh .  altmayer s lips  pale and stiff  moved soundlessly .   the police captain interpreted the motion accurately enough .  he said   you are correct  sir  they are robots .    and from the great doors of the secretariat of defense  the true diaboli emerged .  clubbing policemen cleared the way  but another way  so that they need not pass the sprawled travesties of plastic and aluminium which for three minutes had played the role of living creatures .   the police captain said   i ll ask you to come without trouble  mr .  altmayer .  the secretary of defense would like to see you .     i am coming  sir .   a stunned frustration was only now beginning to overwhelm him .   geoffrey stock and richard altmayer faced one another for the first time in almost a quarter of a century  there in the defense secretary s private office .  it was a rather strait laced office  a desk  an armchair  and two additional chairs .  all were a dull brown in color  the chairs being topped by brown foamite which yielded to the body enough for comfort  not enough for luxury .  there was a micro viewer on the desk and a little cabinet big enough to hold several dozen opto spools .  on the wall opposite the desk was a trimensional view of the old dauntless  the secretary s first command .   stock said   it is a little ridiculous meeting like this after so many years .  i find i am sorry .     sorry about what  jeff .   altmayer tried to force a smile   i am sorry about nothing but that you tricked me with those robots .     you were not difficult to trick   said stock   and it was an excellent opportunity to break your party .  i m sure it will be quite discredited after this .  the pacifist tries to force war  the apostle of gentleness tries assassination .    war against the true enemy   said altmayer sadly .   but you are right .  it is a sign of desperation that this was forced on me .     then   how did you know my plans .     you still overestimate humanity  dick .  in any conspiracy the weakest points are the people that compose it .  you had twenty five co conspirators .  didn t it occur to you that at least one of them might be an informer  or even an employee of mine .    a dull red burned slowly on altmayer s high cheekbones .   which one .   he said .    sorry .  we may have to use him again .    altmayer sat back in his chair wearily .   what have you gained .     what have you gained .  you are as impractical now as on that last day i saw you  the day you decided to go to jail rather than report for induction .  you haven t changed .    altmayer shook his head   the truth doesn t change .    stock said impatiently   if it is truth  why does it always fail .  your stay in jail accomplished nothing .  the war went on .  not one life was saved .  since then  you ve started a political party  and every cause it has backed has failed .  your conspiracy has failed .  you re nearly fifty  dick  and what have you accomplished .  nothing .    altmayer said   and you went to war  rose to command a ship  then to a place in the cabinet .  they say you will be the next coordinator .  you ve accomplished a great deal .  yet success and failure do not exist in themselves .  success in what .  success in working the ruin of humanity .  failure in what .  in a good cause  there are no failures  there are only delayed successes .     even if you are executed for this day s work .     even if i am executed .  there will be someone else to carry on  and his success will be my success .     how do you envisage this success .  can you really see a union of worlds  a galactic federation .  do you want santanni running our affairs .  do you want a vegan telling you what to do .  do you want earth to decide its own destiny or to be at the mercy of any random combination of powers .     we would be at their mercy no more than they would be at ours .     except that we are the richest .  we would be plundered for the sake of the depressed worlds of the .  sirius sector .     and pay the plunder out of what we would save in the wars that would no longer occur .     do you have answers for all questions  dick .     in twenty years we have been asked all questions  jeff .     then answer this one .  how would you force this union of yours on unwilling humanity .     that is why i wanted to kill the diaboli .   for the first time  altmayer showed agitation .   it would mean war with them  but all humanity would unite against the common enemy .  our own political and ideological differences would fade in the face of that .     you really believe that .  even when the diaboli have never harmed us .  they cannot live on our worlds .  they must remain on their own worlds of sulfide atmosphere and oceans which are sodium sulfate solutions .     humanity knows better  jeff .  they are spreading from world to world like an atomic explosion .  they block space travel into regions where there are unoccupied oxygen worlds  the kind we could use .  they are planning for the future  making room for uncounted future generations of diaboli  while we are being restricted to one corner of the galaxy  and fighting ourselves to death .  in a thousand years we will be their slaves  in ten thousand we will be extinct .  oh  yes  they are the common enemy .  mankind knows that .  you will find that out sooner than you think  perhaps .    the secretary said   your party members speak a great deal of ancient greece of the preatomic age .  they tell us that the greeks were a marvelous people  the most culturally advanced of their time  perhaps of all times .  they set mankind on the road it has never left entirely .  they had only one flaw .  they could not unite .  they were conquered and eventually died out .  and we follow in their footsteps now  eh .     you have learned your lesson well  jeff .     but have you  dick .    what do you mean .     did the greeks have no common enemy against whom they could unite .    altmayer was silent .   stock said   the greeks fought persia  their great common enemy .  was it not a fact that a good proportion of the greek states fought on the persian side .    altmayer said finally   yes .  because they thought persian victory was inevitable and they wanted to be on the winning side .     human beings haven t changed  dick .  why do you suppose the diaboli are here .  what is it we are discussing .     i am not a member of the government .     no   said stock  savagely   but i am .  the vegan league has allied itself with the diaboli .     i don t believe you .  it can t be .     it can be and is .  the diaboli have agreed to supply them with five hundred ships at any time they happen to be at war with earth .  in return  vega abandons all claims to the nigellian star cluster .  so if you had really assassinated the diaboh   it would have been war  but with half of humanity probably fighting on the side of your so called common enemy .  we are trying to prevent that .    altmayer said slowly   i am ready for trial .  or am i to be executed without one .    stock said   you are still foolish .  if we shoot you  dick  we make a martyr .  if we keep you alive and shoot only your subordinates  you will be suspected of having turned state s evidence .  as a presumed traitor  you will be quite harmless in the future .    and so  on september  th        richard sayama altmayer  after the briefest of secret trials  was sentenced to five years in prison .  he served his full term .  the year he emerged from prison  geoffrey stock was elected coordinator of earth .         december           simon devoire was not at ease .  he was a little man  with sandy hair and a freckled  ruddy face .  he said   i m sorry i agreed to see you  altmayer .  it won t do you any good .  it might do me harm .    altmayer said   i am an old man .  i won t hurt you .   and he was indeed a very old man somehow .  the turn of the century found his years at two thirds of a century  but he was older than that  older inside and older outside .  his clothes were too big for him  as if he were shrinking away inside them .  only his nose had not aged  it was still the thin  aristocratic  high beaked altmayer nose .   devoire said   it s not you i m afraid of .     why not .  perhaps you think i betrayed the men of     .     no  of course not .  no man of sense believes that you did .  but the days of the federalists are over  altmayer .    altmayer tried to smile .  he felt a little hungry  he hadn t eaten that day   no time for food .  was the day of the federalists over .  it might seem so to others .  the movement had died on a wave of ridicule .  a conspiracy that fails  a  lost cause   is often romantic .  it is remembered and draws adherents for generations  if the loss is at least a dignified one .  but to shoot at living creatures and find the mark to be robots  to be outmaneuvered and outfoxed  to be made ridiculous   that is deadly .  it is deadlier than treason  wrong  and sin .  not many had believed  altmayer had bargained for his life by betraying his associates  but the universal laughter killed federalism as effectively as though they had .   but altmayer had remained stolidly stubborn under it all .  he said   the day of the federalists will never be over  while the human race lives .     words   said devoire impatiently .   they meant more to me when i was younger .  i am a little tired now .     simon  i need access to the subetheric system .    devoire s face hardened .  he said   and you thought of me .  i m sorry  altmayer  but i can t let you use my broadcasts for your own purposes .     you were a federalist once .     don t rely on that   said devoire .   that s in the past .  now i am   nothing .  i am a devoirist  i suppose .  i want to live .     even if it is under the feet of the diaboli .  do you want to live when they are willing  die when they are ready .     words .     do you approve of the all galactic conference .    devoire reddened past his usual pink level .  he gave the sudden impression of a man with too much blood for his body .  he said smolderingly   well  why not .  what does it matter how we go about establishing the federation of man .  if you re still a federalist  what have you to object to in a united humanity .     united under the diaboli .     what s the difference .  humanity can t unite by itself .  let us be driven to it  as long as the fact is accomplished .  i am sick of it all  altmayer  sick of all our stupid history .  i m tired of trying to be an idealist with nothing to be idealistic over .  human beings are human beings and that s the nasty part of it .  maybe we ve got to be whipped into line .  if so  i m perfectly willing to let the diaboli do the whipping .    altmayer said gently   you re very folish  devoire .  it won t be a real union  you know that .  the diaboli called this conference so that they might act as umpires on all current interhuman disputes to their own advantage  and remain the supreme court of judgment over us hereafter .  you know they have no intention of establishing a real central human government .  it will only be a sort of inter locking directorate  each human government will conduct its own affairs as before and pull in various directions as before .  it is simply that we will grow accustomed to running to the diaboli with our little problems .     how do you know that will be the result .     do you seriously think any other result is possible .    devoire chewed at his lower lip   maybe not .     then see through a pane of glass  simon .  any true independence we now have will be lost .     a lot of good this independence has ever done us .    besides  what s the use .  we can t stop this thing .  coordinator stock is probably no keener on the conference than you are  but that doesn t help him .  if earth doesn t attend  the union will be formed without us  and then we will face war with the rest of humanity and the diaboli .  and that goes for any other government that wants to back out .     what if all the governments back out .  wouldn t the conference break up completely .     have you ever known all the human governments to do anything together .  you never learn  altmayer .     there are new facts involved .     such as .  i know i am foolish for asking  but go ahead .    altmayer said   for twenty years most of the galaxy has been shut to human ships .  you know that .  none of us has the slightest notion of what goes on within the diaboli sphere of influence .  and yet some human colonies exist within that sphere .     so .     so occasionally  human beings escape into the small portion of the galaxy that remains human and free .  the government of earth receives reports  reports which they don t dare make public .  but not all officials of the government can stand the cowardice involved in such actions forever .  one of them has been to see me .  i can t tell you which one  of course   so i have documents  devoire  official  reliable  and true .    devoire shrugged   about what .   he turned the desk chronometer rather ostentatiously so that altmayer could see its gleaming metal face on which the red  glowing figures stood out sharply .  they read        and even as it was turned  the   faded and the new glow of a   appeared .   altmayer said   there is a planet called by its colonists chu hsi .  it did not have a large population  two million  perhaps .  fifteen years ago the diaboli occupied worlds on various sides of it  and in all those fifteen years  no human ship ever landed on the planet .  last year the diaboli themselves landed .  they brought with them huge freight ships filled with sodium sulfate and bacterial cultures that are native to their own worlds .     what .    you can t make me believe it .     try   said altmayer  ironically .   it is not difficult .  sodium sulfate will dissolve in the oceans of any world .  in a sulfate ocean  their bacteria will grow  multiply  and produce hydrogen sulfide in tremendous quantities which will fill the oceans and the atmosphere .  they can then introduce their plants and animals and eventually themselves .  another planet will be suitable for diaboli life   and unsuitable for any human .  it would take time  surely  but the diaboli have time .  they are a united people and  .  .  .     now  look   devoire waved his hand in disgust   that just doesn t hold water .  the diaboli have more worlds than they know what to do with .     for their present purposes  yes  but the diaboli are creatures that look toward the future .  their birth rate is high and eventually they will fill the galaxy .  and how much better off they would be if they were the only intelligence in the universe .     but it s impossible on purely physical grounds .  do you know how many millions of tons of sodium it would take to fill up the oceans to their requirements .     obviously a planetary supply .     well  then  do you suppose they would strip one of their own worlds to create a new one .  where is the gain .     simon  simon  there are millions of planets in the galaxy which through atmospheric conditions  temperature  or gravity are forever uninhabitable either to humans or to diaboli .  many of these are quite adequately rich in sulfur .    devoire considered   what about the human beings on the planet .     on chu hsi .  euthanasia   except for the few who escaped in time .  painless i suppose .  the diaboli are not needlessly cruel  merely efficient .    altmayer waited .  devoire s fist clenched and unclenched .   altmayer said   publish this news .  spread it out on the interstellar subetheric web .  broadcast the documents to the reception centers on the various worlds .  you can do it  and when you do  the all galactic conference will fall apart .    devoire s chair tilted forward .  he stood up .   where s your proof .     will you do it .     i want to see your proof .    altmayer smiled   come with me .    they were waiting for him when he came back to the furnished room he was living in .  he didn t notice them at first .  he was completely unaware of the small vehicle that followed him at a slow pace and a prudent distance .  he walked with his head bent  calculating the length of time it would take for devoire to put the information through the reaches of space  how long it would take for the receiving stations on vega and santanni and centaurus to blast out the news  how long it would take to spread it over the entire galaxy .  and in this way he passed  unheeding  between the two plain clothes men who flanked the entrance of the rooming house   it was only when he opened the door to his own room that he stopped and turned to leave but the plain clothes men were behind him now .  he made no attempt at violent escape .  he entered the room instead and sat down  feeling so old .  he thought   feverishly  i need only hold them off for an hour and ten minutes .   the man who occupied the darkness reached up and flicked the switch that allowed the wall lights to operate .  in the soft wall glow  the man s round face and balding gray fringed head were startlingly clear .   altmayer said gently   i am honored with a visit by the coordinator himself .    and stock said   we are old friends  you and i  dick .  we meet every once in a while .    altmayer did not answer .   stock said   you have certain government papers in your possession  dick .    altmayer said   if you think so  jeff  you ll have to find them .    stock rose wearily to his feet .   no heroics  dick .  let me tell you what those papers contained .  they were circumstantial reports of the sulfation of the planet  chu hsi .  isn t that true .    altmayer looked at the clock .   stock said .   if you are planning to delay us  to angle us as though we were fish  you will be disappointed .  we know where you ve been  we know devoire has the papers  we know exactly what s he planning to do with them .    altmayer stiffened .  the thin parchment of his cheeks trembled .  he said   how long have you known .     as long as you have  dick .  you are a very predictable man .  it is the very reason we decided to use you .  do you suppose the recorder would really come to see you as he did  without our knowledge .     i don t understand .    stock said   the government of earth  dick  is not anxious that the all galactic conference be continued .  however  we are not federalists  we know humanity for what it is .  what do you suppose would happen if the rest of the galaxy discovered that the diaboli were in the process of changing a salt oxygen world into a sulfate sulfide one .    no  don t answer .  you are dick altmayer and i m sure you d tell me that with one fiery burst of indignation  they d abandon the conference  join together in a loving and brotherly union  throw themselves at the diaboli  and overwhelm them .    stock paused such a long time that for a moment it might have seemed he would say no more .  then he continued in half a whisper   nonsense .  the other worlds would say that the government of earth for purposes of its own had initiated a fraud  had forged documents in a deliberate attempt to disrupt the conference .  the diaboli would deny everything  and most of the human worlds would find it to their interests to believe the denial .  they would concentrate on the iniquities of earth and forget about the iniquities of  the diaboli .  so you see  we could sponsor no such expose .    altmayer felt drained  futile .   then you will stop devoire .  it is always that you are so sure of failure beforehand  that you believe the worst of your fellow man      wait .  i said nothing of stopping devoire .  i said only that the government could not sponsor such an expose and we will not .  but the expose will take place just the same  except that afterward we will arrest devoire and yourself and denounce the whole thing as vehemently as will the diaboli .  the whole affair would then be changed .  the government of earth will have dissociated itself from the claims .  it will then seem to the rest of the human government that for our own selfish purposes we are trying to hide the actions of the diaboli  that we have  perhaps  a special understanding with them .  they will fear that special understanding and unite against us .  but then to be against us will mean that they are also against the diaboli .  they will insist on believing the expose to be the truth  the documents to be real   and the conference will break up .     it will mean war again   said altmayer hopelessly   and not against the real enemy .  it will mean fighting among the humans and a victory all the greater for the diaboli when it is all over .     no war   said stock .   no government will attack earth with the diaboli on our side .  the other governments will merely draw away from us and grind a permanent anti diaboli bias into their propaganda .  later  if there should be war between ourselves and the diaboli  the other governments will at least remain neutral .    he looks very old  thought altmayer .  we are all old  dying men .  aloud  he said   why would you expect the diaboli to back earth .  you may fool the rest of mankind by pretending to attempt suppression of the facts concerning the planet chu hsi  but you won t fool the diaboli .  they won t for a moment believe earth to be sincere in its claim that it believes the documents to be forgeries .     ah  but they will .   geoffrey stock stood up   you see  the documents are forgeries .  the diaboli may be planning sulfation of planets in the future  but to our knowledge  they have not tried it yet .    on december           richard sayama altmayer entered prison for the third and last time .  there was no trial  no definite sentence  and scarcely a real imprisonment in the literal sense of the word .  his movements were confined and only a few officials were allowed to communicate with him  but otherwise his comforts were looked to assiduously .  he had no access to news  of course  so that he was not aware that in the second year of this third imprisonment of his  the war between earth and the diaboli opened with the surprise attack near sirius by an earth squadron upon certain ships of the diaboli navy .   in       geoffrey stock came to visit altmayer in his confinement .  altmayer rose in surprise to greet him .    you re looking well  dick   stock said .   he himself was not .  his complexion had grayed .  he still wore his naval captain s uniform  but his body stooped slightly within it .  he was to die within the year  a fact of which he was not completely unaware .  it did not bother him much .  he thought repeatedly  i have lived the years i ve had to live .   altmayer  who looked the older of the two  had yet more than nine years to live .  he said   an unexpected pleasure  jeff  but this time you can t have come to imprison me .  i m in prison already .     i ve come to set you free  if you would like .     for what purpose  jeff .  surely you have a purpose .  a clever way of using me .    stock s smile was merely a momentary twitch .  he said   a way of using you  truly  but this time you will approve .  we are at war .    with whom .   altmayer was startled .    with the diaboli .  we have been at war for six months .    altmayer brought his hands together  thin fingers interlacing nervously   i ve heard nothing of this .     i know .   the coordinator clasped his hands behind his back and was distantly surprised to find that they were trembling .  he said   it s been a long journey for the two of us  dick .  we ve had the same goal  you and i   no  let me speak .  i ve often wanted to explain my point of view to you  but you would never have understood .  you weren t the kind of man to understand  until i had the results for you .    i was twenty five when i first visited a diaboli world  dick .  i knew then it was either they or we .     i said so   whispered altmayer   from the first .     merely saying so was not enough .  you wanted to force the human governments to unite against them and that notion was politically unrealistic and completely impossible .  it wasn t even desirable .  humans are not diaboli .  among the diaboli  individual consciousness is low  almost nonexistent .  ours is almost overpowering .  they have no such thing as politics  we have nothing else .  they can never disagree  can have nothing  but a single government .  we can never agree  if we had a single island to live on  we would split it in three .    but our very disagreements are our strength .  your federalist party used to speak of ancient greece a great deal once .  do you remember .  but your people always missed the point .  to be sure  greece could never unite and was therefore ultimately conquered .  but even in her state of disunion  she defeated the gigantic persian empire .  why .    i would like to point out that the greek city states over centuries had fought with one another .  they were forced to specialize in things military to an extent far beyond the persians .  even the persians themselves realized that  and in the last century of their imperial existence  greek mercenaries formed the most valued parts of their armies .    the same might be said of the small nation states of pre atornic europe  which in centuries of fighting had advanced their military arts to the point where they could overcome and hold for two hundred years the comparatively gigantic empires of asia .    so it is with us .  the diaboli  with vast extents of galactic space  have never fought a war .  their military machine is massive  but untried .  in fifty years  only such advances have been made by them as they have been able to copy from the various human navies .  humanity  on the other hand  has competed ferociously in warfare .  each government has raced to keep ahead of its neighbors in military science .  they ve had to .  it was our own disunion that made the terrible race for survival necessary  so that in the end almost any one of us was a match for all the diaboli  provided only that none of us would fight on their side in a general war .    it was toward the prevention of such a development that all of earth s diplomacy had been aimed .  until it was certain that in a war between earth and the diaboli  the rest of humanity would be at least neutral  there could be no war  and no union of human governments could be allowed  since the race for military perfection must continue .  once we were sure of neutrality  through the hoax that broke up the conference two years ago  we sought the war  and now we have it .    altmayer  through all this  might have been frozen .  it was a long time before he could say anything .   finally   what if the diaboli are victorious after all .    stock said   they aren t .  two weeks ago  the main fleets joined action and theirs was annihilated with practically no loss to ourselves  although we were greatly outnumbered .  we might have been fighting unarmed ships .  we had stronger weapons of greater range and more accurate sighting .  we had three times their effective speed since we had antiacceleration devices which they lacked .  since the battle a dozen of the other human governments have decided to join the winning side and have declared war on the diaboli .  yesterday the diaboli requested that negotiations for an armistice be opened .  the war is practically over  and henceforward the diaboli will be confined to their original planets with only such future expansions as we permit .    altmayer murmured incoherently .   stock said   and now union becomes necessary .  after the defeat of persia by the greek city states  they were ruined because of their continued wars among themselves  so that first macedon and then rome conquered them .  after europe colonized the americas  cut up africa  and conquered asia  a series of continued european wars led to european ruin .    disunion until conquest  union thereafter .  but now union is easy .  let one subdivision succeed by itself and the rest will clamor to become part of that success .  the ancient writer  toynbee  first pointed out this difference between what he called a  dominant minority  and a  creative minority  .    we are a creative minority now .  in an almost spontaneous gesture  various human governments have suggested the formation of a united worlds organization .  over seventy governments are willing to attend the first sessions in order to draw up a charter of federation .  the others will join later  i am sure .  we would like you to be one of the delegates from earth  dick .    altmayer found his eyes flooding   i   i don t understand your purpose .  is this all true .     it is all exactly as i say .  you were a voice in the wilderness  dick  crying for union .  your words will carry much weight .  what did you once say   in a good cause  there are no failures  .     no .   said altmayer  with sudden energy .   it seems your cause was the good one .    stock s face was hard and devoid of emotion   you were always a misunderstander of human nature  dick .  when the united worlds is a reality and when generations of men and women look back to these days of war through their centuries of unbroken peace  they will have forgotten the purpose of my methods .  to them they will represent war and death .  your calls for union  your idealism  will be remembered forever .    he turned away and altmayer barely caught his last words   and when they build their statues  they will build none for me .    in the great court  which stands as a patch of untouched peace among the fifty busy square miles devoted to the towering buildings that are the pulse beat of the united worlds of the galaxy  stands a statue  .  .  .     easily the most frequently asked question put to any writer of science fiction stories is   where do you get your ideas .    i imagine the person who asks the question is sure that there is some mysterious kind of inspiration that can only be produced by odd and possibly illicit means  or that the writer goes through an eldritch ritual that may even involve calling up the devil .   but the answer is only   you can get an idea from anything if you are willing to think hard enough and long enough .    that long and hard bit seems to disillusion people .  their admiration for you drops precipitously and you get the feeling you have exposed yourself as an imposter .  after all  if long and hard is all it takes  anyone can do it .   strange  then  that so few do .   anyway  my wife once broke down and asked me that question even though she knows i dislike having it asked .  we had moved to the boston area in       when i took  my position with boston university school of medicine  and periodically we made a train trip back to new york to visit our respective families .   once  on one of those train trips  perhaps out of boredom  she asked the question .  i said   from anything .  i can probably get one out of this train trip  if i try .     go ahead   she said  naturally enough .   so i thought hard and told her the story of a train trip which  when i got back home  i typed up in permanent form and called  what if     the story is unusual for me in another respect  too .  i am not strong on romance in my stories .  why that should be  i will leave to the parlor psychoanalyst .  i merely state the fact .   sometimes  i do have women in my stories .  on rare occasions  as in  hostess   the woman is even the protagonist .  but even then romance is a minor factor  if it appears at all .   in  what if     however  the story is all romance .  each time i think of that  the fact startles me .  i believe it is the only one of my many stories that is all serious  as opposed to ribald  romance .  heavens .   first appearance   fantastic  summer      .  copyright        by ziff davis publishing company .     what if     norman and livvy were late  naturally  since catching a train is always a matter of last minute delays  so they had to take the only available seat in the coach .  it was the one toward the front  the one with nothing before it but the seat that faced wrong way  with its back hard against the front partition .  while norman heaved the suitcase onto the rack  liwy found herself   chafing a little .   if a couple took the wrong way seat before them  they  would be staring self consciously into each other s faces air the hours it would take to reach new york  or else  which was scarcely better  they would have to erect synthetic barriers of newspaper .  still  there was no use in taking a chance on there being another unoccupied double seat elsewhere in the train .   norman didn t seem to mind  and that was a little disappointing to liwy .  usually they held their moods in common .  that  norman claimed  was why he remained sure that he had married the right girl .   he would say   we fit each other  liwy  and that s the key fact .  when you re doing a jigsaw puzzle and one piece fits another  that s it .  there are no other possibilities  and of course there are no other girls .    and she would laugh and say   if you hadn t been on the streetcar that day  you would probably never have met me .  what would you have done then .     stayed a bachelor .  naturally .  besides  i would have met you through georgette another day .     it wouldn t have been the same .     sure it would .     no  it wouldn t .  besides  georgette would never have introduced me .  she was interested in you herself  and she s the type who knows better than to create a possible rival .     what nonsense .    liwy asked her favorite question   norman  what if you had been one minute later at the streetcar corner and had taken the next car .  what do you suppose would have happened .     and what if fish had wings and all of them flew to the top of the mountains .  what would we have to eat on fridays then .    but they had caught the streetcar  and fish didn t have wings  so that now they had been married five years and ate fish on fridays .  and because they had been married five years  they were going to celebrate by spending a week in new york .   then she remembered the present problem .   i wish we could have found some other seat .    norman said   sure .  so do i .  but no one has taken it yet  so we ll have relative privacy as far as providence  anyway .    livvy was unconsoled  and felt herself justified when a plump little man walked down the central aisle of the coach .  now  where had he come from .  the train was halfway between boston and providence  and if he had had a seat  why hadn t he kept it .  she took out her vanity and considered her reflection .  she had a theory that if she ignored the little man  he would pass by .  so she concentrated on her light brown hair which  in the rush of catching the train  had become disarranged just a little  at her blue eyes  and at her little mouth with the plump lips which norman said looked like a permanent kiss .   not bad  she thought .   then she looked up  and the little man was in the seat opposite .  he caught her eye and grinned widely .  a series of lines curled about the edges of his smile .  he lifted his hat hastily and put it down beside him on top of the little black box he had been carrying .  a circle of white hair instantly sprang up stiffly about the large bald spot that made the center of his skull a desert .   she could not help smiling back a little  but then she caught sight of the black box again and the smile faded .  she yanked at norman s elbow .   norman looked up from his newspaper .  he had startlingly dark eyebrows that almost met above the bridge of his nose  giving him a formidable first appearance .  but they and the dark eyes beneath bent upon her now with only the usual look of pleased and somewhat amused affection .   he said  what s up .   he did not look at the plump little man opposite .   liwy did her best to indicate what she saw by a little unobtrusive gesture of her hand and head .  but the little man was watching and she felt a fool  since norman simply stared at her blankly .   finally she pulled him closer and whispered   don t you see what s printed on his box .    she looked again as she said it  and there was no mistake .  it was not very prominent  but the light caught it slantingly and it was a slightly more glistening area on a black background .  in flowing script it said   what if .    the little man was smiling again .  he nodded his head rapidly and pointed to the words and then to himself several times over .   norman said in an aside   must be his name .    livvy replied   oh  how could that be anybody s name .    norman put his paper aside .   i ll show you .   he leaned ovez .  and said   mr .  if .    the little man looked at him eagerly .    do you have the time  mr .  if .    the little man took out a large watch from his vest pocket and displayed the dial .    thank you  mr .  if   said norman .  and again in a whisper   see  liwy .    he would have returned to his paper  but the little man was opening his box and raising a ringer periodically as he did so  to enforce their attention .  it was just a slab of frosted glass that he removed   about six by nine inches in length and width and perhaps an inch thick .  it had beveled edges  rounded corners  and was completely featureless .  then he took out a little wire stand on which the glass slab fitted comfortably .  he rested the combination on his knees and looked proudly at them .   liwy said  with sudden excitement   heavens  norman  it s a picture of some sort .    norman bent close .  then he looked at the little man .   what s this .  a new kind of television .    the little man shook his head  and liwy said   no  norman  it s us .     what .     don t you see .  that s the streetcar we met on .  there you are in the back seat wearing that old fedora i threw away three years ago .  and that s georgette and myself getting on .  the fat lady s in the way .  now .  can t you see us .    he muttered   it s some sort of illusion .     but you see it too  don t you .  that s why he calls this  what if .   it will show us what if .  what if the streetcar hadn t swerved  .  .  .    she was sure of it .  she was very excited and very sure of it .  as she looked at the picture in the glass slab  the late afternoon sunshine grew dimmer and the inchoate chatter of the passengers around and behind them began fading .   how she remembered that day .  norman knew georgette and had been about to surrender his seat to her when the car swerved and threw livvy into his lap .  it was such a ridiculously corny situation  but it had worked .  she had been so embarrassed that he was forced first into gallantry and then into conversation .  an introduction from georgette was not even necessary .  by the time they got off the streetcar  he knew where she worked .   she could still remember georgette glowering at her  sulkily forcing a smile when they themselves separated .  georgette said   norman seems to like you .    livvy replied   oh  don t be silly .  he was just being polite .  but he is nice looking  isn t he .    it was only six months after that that they married .   and now here was that same streetcar again  with norman and herself and georgette .  as she thought that  the smooth train noises  the rapid clack clack of the wheels  vanished completely .  instead  she was in the swaying confines of the streetcar .  she had just boarded it with georgette at the previous stop .   livvy shifted weight with the swaying of the streetcar  as did forty others  sitting and standing  all to the same monotonous and rather ridiculous rhythm .  she said   somebody s motioning at you  georgette .  do you know him .     at me .   georgette directed a deliberately casual glance over her shoulder .  her artificially long eyelashes flickered .  she said   i know him a little .  what do you suppose he wants .     let s find out   said liwy .  she felt pleased and a little wicked .  georgette had a well known habit of hoarding her male acquaintances  and it was rather fun to annoy her this way .  and besides  this one seemed quite  .  .  .  interesting .   she snaked past the line of standees  and georgette followed without enthusiasm .  it was just as livvy arrived opposite the young man s seat that the streetcar lurched heavily as it rounded a curve .  liwy snatched desperately in the direction of the straps .  her fingertips caught and she held on .  it was a long moment before she could breathe .  for some reason  it had seemed that there were no straps close enough to be reached .  somehow  she felt that by all the laws of nature she should have fallen .   the young man did not look at her .  he was smiling at georgette and rising from his seat .  he had astonishing eyebrows that gave him a rather competent and self confident appearance livvy decided that she definitely liked him .   georgette was saying   oh no  don t bother .  we re getting off in about two stops .    they did .  livvy said   i thought we were going to sach s .     we are .  there s just something i remember having to attend to here .  it won t take but a minute .     next stop  providence .   the loud speakers were blaring .  the train was slowing and the world of the past had shrunk itself into the glass slab once more .  the little man was still smiling at them .   liwy turned to norman .  she felt a little frightened .   were you through all that  too .    he said   what happened to the time .  we can t be reaching providence yet .   he looked at his watch .   i guess we are .   then  to livvy   you didn t fall that time .     then you did see it .   she frowned .   now  that s like georgette .  i m sure there was no reason to get off the streetcar except to prevent my meeting you .  how long had you known georgette before then  norman .     not very long .  just enough to be able to recognize her at sight and to feel that i ought to offer her my seat .    liwy curled her lip .   norman grinned   you can t be jealous of a might have been  kid .  besides  what difference would it have made .  i d have been sufficiently interested in you to work out a way of meeting you .     you didn t even look at me .     i hardly had the chance .     then how would you have met me .     some way .  i don t know how .  but you ll admit this is a rather foolish argument we re having .    they were leaving providence .  liwy felt a trouble in her mind .  the little man had been following their whispered conversation  with only the loss of his smile to show that he understood .  she said to him   can you show us more .    norman interrupted   wait now  liwy .  what are you going to try to do .    she said   i want to see our wedding day .  what it would have been if i had caught the strap .    norman was visibly annoyed .   now  that s not fair .  we might not have been married on the same day  you know .    but she said   can you show it to me  mr .  if .   and the little man nodded .   the slab of glass was coming alive again  glowing a little .  then the light collected and condensed into figures .  a tiny sound of organ music was in livvy s ears  without there actually being sound .   norman said with relief   well  there i am .  that s our wedding .  are you satisfied .    the train sounds were disappearing again  and the last thing livvy heard was her own voice saying   yes  there you are .  but where am i .    liwy was well back in the pews .  for a while she had not expected to attend at all .  in the past months she had drifted further and further away from georgette  without quite knowing why .  she had heard of her engagement only through a mutual friend  and  of course  it was to norman .  she remembered very clearly that day  six months before  when she had first seen him on the streetcar .  it was the time georgette had so quickly snatched her out of sight .  she had met him since on several occasions  but each time georgette was with him  standing between .   well  she had no cause for resentment  the man was certainly none of hers .  georgette  she thought  looked more beautiful than she really was .  and he was very handsome indeed .   she felt sad and rather empty  as though something had gone wrong   something that she could not quite outline in her mind .  georgette had moved up the aisle without seeming to see her  but earlier she had caught his eyes and smiled at him .  liwy thought he had smiled in return .   she heard the words distantly as they drifted back to her   i now pronounce you     the noise of the train was back .  a woman swayed down the aisle  herding a little boy back to their seats .  there were intermittent bursts of girlish laughter from a set of four teenage girls halfway down the coach .  a conductor hurried past on some mysterious errand .   livvy was frozenly aware of it all .   she sat there  staring straight ahead  while the trees outside blended into a fuzzy  furious green and the telephone poles galloped past .   she said   it was she you married .    he stared at her for a moment and then one side of his mouth quirked a little .  he said lightly   i didn t really  olivia .  you re still my wife  you know .  just think about it for a few minutes .    she turned to him .   yes  you married me   because i fell in your lap .  if i hadn t  you would have married georgette .  if she hadn t wanted you  you would have married someone else .  you would have married anybody .  so much for your jigsaw puzzle pieces .    norman said very slowly   well   i ll   be   darned .   he put both hands to his head and smoothed down the straight hair over his ears where it had a tendency to tuft up .  for the moment it gave him the appearance of trying to hold his head together .  he said   now  look here  liwy  you re making a silly fuss over a stupid magician s trick .  you can t blame me for something i haven t done .     you would have done it .       how do you know .     you ve seen it .     i ve seen a ridiculous piece of   of hypnotism  i suppose .   his voice suddenly raised itself into anger .  he turned to the little man opposite .   off with you  mr .  if  or whatever your name is .  get out of here .  we don t want you .  get out before i throw your little trick out the window and you after it .    livvy yanked at his elbow .   stop it .  stop it .  you re in a crowded train .    the little man shrank back into the corner of the seat as far as he could go and held his little black bag behind him .  norman looked at him  then at liwy  then at the elderly lady across the way who was regarding him with patent disapproval .   he turned pink and bit back a pungent remark .  they rode in frozen silence to and through new london .   fifteen minutes past new london  norman said   livvy .    she said nothing .  she was looking out the window but saw nothing but the glass .   he said again   livvy .  livvy .  answer me .    she said dully   what do you want .    he said   look  this is all nonsense .  i don t know how the fellow does it  but even granting it s legitimate  you re not being fair .  why stop where you did .  suppose i had married georgette  do you suppose you would have stayed single .  for all i know  you were already married at the time of my supposed wedding .  maybe that s why i married georgette .     i wasn t married .     how do you know .     i would have been able to tell .  i knew what my own thoughts were .     then you would have been married within the next year .    liwy grew angrier .  the fact that a sane remnant within her clamored at the unreason of her anger did not soothe her .  it irritated her further  instead .  she said   and if i did  it would be no business of yours  certainly .     of course it wouldn t .  but it would make the point that in the world of reality we can t be held responsible for the  what ifs   .    livvy s nostrils flared .  she said nothing .   norman said   look .  you remember the big new year s celebration at winnie s place year before last .     i certainly do .  you spilled a keg of alcohol all over me .     that s beside the point  and besides  it was only a cocktail shaker s worth .  what i m trying to say is that winnie is just about your best friend and had been long before you married me .     what of it .     georgette was a good friend of hers too  wasn t she .     yes .     all right  then .  you and georgette would have gone to the party regardless of which one of you i had married .  i would have had nothing to do with it .  let him show us the party as it would have been if i had married georgette  and i ll bet you d be there with either your fiance or your husband .    liwy hesitated .  she felt honestly afraid of just that .   he said   are you afraid to take the chance .    and that  of course  decided her .  she turned on him furiously .   no  i m not .  and i hope i am married .  there s no reason i should pine for you .  what s more  i d like to see what happens when you spill the shaker all over georgette .  she ll fill both your ears for you  and in public  too .  i know her .  maybe you ll see a certain difference in the jigsaw pieces then .   she faced forward and crossed her arms angrily and firmly across her chest .   norman looked across at the little man  but there was no need to say anything .  the glass slab was on his lap already .  the sun slanted in from the west  and the white foam of hair that topped his head was edged with pink .   norman said tensely   ready .    livvy nodded and let the noise of the train slide away again .   livvy stood  a little flushed with recent cold  in the doorway .  she had just removed her coat  with its sprinkling of snow  and her bare arms were still rebelling at the touch of open air .   she answered the shouts that greeted her with  happy new years  of her own  raising her voice to make herself heard over the squealing of the radio .  georgette s shrill tones were almost the first thing she heard upon entering  and now she steered toward her .  she hadn t seen georgette  or norman  in weeks .   georgette lifted an eyebrow  a mannerism she had lately cultivated  and said   isn t anyone with you  olivia .   her eyes swept the immediate surroundings and then returned to liwy .   livvy said indifferently   i think dick will be around later .  there was something or other he had to do first .   she felt as indifferent as she sounded .   georgette smiled tightly .   well  norman s here .  that ought to keep you from being lonely  dear .  at least  it s turned out that way before .    and as she said so .  norman sauntered in from the kitchen .  he had a cocktail shaker in his hand  and the rattling of ice cubes castanetted his words .   line up  you rioting revelers  and get a mixture that will really revel your riots   why  livvy .    he walked toward her  grinning his welcome .   where ve you been keeping yourself .  i haven t seen you in twenty years  seems like .  what s the matter .  doesn t dick want anyone else to see you .     fill my glass  norman   said georgette sharply .    right away   he said  not looking at her   do you want one too  liwy .  i ll get you a glass .   he turned  and everything happened at once .   livvy cried .   watch out .   she saw it coming  even had a vague feeling that all this had happened before  but it played itself out inexorably .  his heel caught the edge of the carpet  he lurched  tried to right himself  and lost the cocktail shaker .  it seemed to jump out of his hands  and a pint of ice cold liquor drenched livvy from shoulder to hem .   she stood there  gasping .  the noises muted about her  and for a few intolerable moments she made futile brushing gestures at her gown  while norman kept repeating   damnation .   in rising tones .   georgette said coolly   it s too bad  liwy .  just one of those things .  i imagine the dress can t be very expensive .    livvy turned and ran .  she was in the bedroom  which was at least empty and relatively quiet .  by the light of the fringe shaded lamp on the dresser  she poked among the coats on the bed  looking for her own .   norman had come in behind her .   look  livvy  don t pay any attention to what she said .  i m really devilishly sorry .  i ll pay     that s all right .  it wasn t your fault .   she blinked rapidly and didn t look at him .   i ll just go home and change .     are you coming back .     i don t know .  i don t think so .     look  livvy  .  .  .   his warm fingers were on her shoulders    liwy felt a queer tearing sensation deep inside her  as though she were ripping away from clinging cobwebs and      and the train noises were back .   something did go wrong with the time when she was in there   in the slab .  it was deep twilight now .  the train lights were on .  but it didn t matter .  she seemed to be recovering from the wrench inside her .   norman was rubbing his eyes with thumb and forefinger .   what happened .    livvy said   it just ended .  suddenly .    norman said uneasily   you know  we ll be putting into new haven soon .   he looked at his watch and shook his head .   liwy said wonderingly   you spilled it on me .     well  so i did in real life .     but in real life i was your wife .  you ought to have spilled it on georgette this time .  isn t that queer .   but she was thinking of norman pursuing her  his hands on her shoulders    she looked up at him and said with warm satisfaction   i wasn t married .     no  you weren t .  but was that dick reinhardt you were going around with .     yes .     you weren t planning to marry him  were you  livvy .     jealous  norman .    norman looked confused .   of that .  of a slab of glass .  of course not .     i don t think i would have married him .    norman said   you know  i wish it hadn t ended when it did .  there was something that was about to happen  i think .   he stopped  then added slowly   it was as though i would rather have done it to anybody else in the room .     even to georgette .     i wasn t giving two thoughts to georgette .  you don t believe me  i suppose .     maybe i do .   she looked up at him .   i ve been silly  norman .  let s   let s live our real life .  let s not play with all the things that just might have been .    but he caught her hands .   no  livvy .  one last time .  let s see what we would have been doing right now  livvy .  this very minute .  if i had married georgette .    livvy was a little frightened .   let s not  norman .   she was thinking of his eyes  smiling hungrily at her as he held the shaker  while georgette stood beside her  unregarded .  she didn t want to know what happened afterward .  she just wanted this life now  this good life .   new haven came and went   norman said again   i want to try  livvy .    she said   if you want to  norman .   she decided fiercely that it wouldn t matter .  nothing would matter .  her hands reached out and encircled his arm .  she held it tightly  and while she held it she thought   nothing in the make believe can take him from me .    norman said to the little man   set  em up again .    in the yellow light the process seemed to be slower .  gently the frosted slab cleared  like clouds being torn apart and dispersed by an unfelt wind .   norman was saying   there s something wrong .  that s just the two of us  exactly as we are now .    he was right .  two little figures were sitting in a train on the seats which were farthest toward the front .  the field was enlarging now   they were merging into it .  norman s voice was distant and fading .    it s the same train   he was saying .   the window in back is cracked just as     livvy was blindingly happy .  she said   i wish we were in new york .    he said   it will be less than an hour  darling .   then he said   i m going to kiss you .   he made a movement  as though he were about to begin .    not here .  oh  norman  people are looking .    norman drew back .  he said   we should have taken a taxi .     from boston to new york .     sure .  the privacy would have been worth it .    she laughed .   you re funny when you try to act ardent .     it isn t an act .   his voice was suddenly a little somber .   it s not just an hour  you know .  i feel as though i ve been waiting five years .     i do  too .     why couldn t i have met you first .  it was such a waste .     poor georgette   liwy sighed .   norman moved impatiently .   don t be sorry for her  livvy .  we never really made a go of it .  she was glad to get rid of me .     i know that .  that s why i say  poor georgette .   i m just sorry for her for not being able to appreciate what she had .     well  see to it that you do   he said .   see to it that you re immensely appreciative  infinitely appreciative   or more than that  see that you re at least half as appreciative as i am of what i ve got .     or else you ll divorce me  too .     over my dead body   said norman .   livvy said   it s all so strange .  i keep thinking   what if you hadn t spilt the cocktails on me that time at the party .   you wouldn t have followed me out  you wouldn t have told me  i wouldn t have known .  it would have been so different  .  .  .  everything .     nonsense .  it would have been just the same .  it would have all happened another time .     i wonder   said livvy softly .   train noises merged into train noises .  city lights flickered outside  and the atmosphere of new york was about them .  the coach was astir with travelers dividing the baggage among themselves .   livvy was an island in the turmoil until norman shook her .   she looked at him and said   the jigsaw pieces fit after all .    he said   yes .    she put a hand on his .   but it wasn t good  just the same .  i was very wrong .  i thought that because we had each other  we should have all the possible each others .  but all the possibles are none of our business .  the real is enough .  do you know what i mean .    he nodded .   she said   there are millions of other what ifs .  i don t want to know what happened in any of them .  i ll never say  what if  again .    norman said   relax  dear .  here s your coat .   and he reached for the suitcases .   livv said with sudden sharpness   where s mr .  if .    norman turned slowly to the empty seat that faced them .  together they scanned the rest of the coach .    maybe   norman said   he went into the next coach .     but why .  besides  he wouldn t leave his hat .   and she bent to pick it up .   norman said  what hat .    and liwy stopped her fingers hovering over nothingness .  she said   it was here   i almost touched it .   she straightened and said   oh  norman  what if     norman put a finger on her mouth .   darling  .  .  .    she said   i m sorry .  here  let me help you with the suitcases .    the train dived into the tunnel beneath park avenue  and the noise of the wheels rose to a roar .     as long as i mentioned the parlor psychoanalyst in the introduction to  what if     i may as well go on to those fellows who analyze stories in freudian fashion .   give a freudian cast of mind and sufficient ingenuity  it is possible  i think  to translate any collection of words  rational  irrational  or nonsensical  into sexual symbolism  and then prate learnedly about the writer s unconscious .   i have said this before and i ll say it again .  i don t know what is in my unconscious mind and i don t care .  i don t even know for sure that i have one .   i am told that the contents of one s unconscious may so distort his personality that he can only straighten out by a close study of those hidden mental factors under the guidance of an analyst .   maybe so  but the only thing about myself that i consider to be severe enough to warrant psychoanalytic treatment is my compulsion to write .  perhaps if i vacuumed my mentality and got rid of the compulsion  i could spend more time sleeping in the sun and playing golf  or whatever it is that people do who have nothing better to do .   but i don t want to  thank you .  i know all about my compulsion and i like it and intend to keep it .  someone else can have my ticket for sleeping in the sun and playing golf .   so i hope no one ever has the impulse to psychoanalyze my stories and come to me with a complete examination of my compulsions and hangups and neuroses and expect me to be tearfully grateful .  i m not in the market .  nor am i interested in the hidden meanings of my stories .  if you find them  keep them .   which brings me to  sally  .  it is well known that the average american male loves his car with a pseudosexual passion  and who am i to be un american .   anyone reading  sally  can sense that i feel strongly attracted to the heroine of the story and that this probably reflects something of my own life .  toward the end of the story  in fact  sally does something which will allow the amateur freudian a field day .   oh  find it for yourself  it won t be hard .   the sexual symbolism is blatant and the parlor psychoanalyst can chuckle himself to death with what he will be sure exists in my unconscious mind .   except that he will be quite wrong  because none of that was put in by my unconscious mind .  it was all carefully and deliberately inserted by my conscious mind  because i wanted to .   first appearance   fantastic  may june       .  copyright        by ziff davis publishing company .     sally    sally was coming down the lake road  so i waved to her and called her by name .  i always liked to see sally .  i liked all of them  you understand  but sally s the prettiest one of the lot .  there just isn t any question about it .   she moved a little faster when i waved to her .  nothing undignified .  she was never that .  she moved just enough faster to show that she was glad to see me  too .   i turned to the man standing beside me .   that s sally   i said .   he smiled at me and nodded .   mrs .  hester had brought him in .  she said   this is mr .  gell horn  jake .  you remember he sent you the letter asking for an appointment .    that was just talk  really .  i have a million things to do around the farm  and one thing i just can t waste my time on is mail .  that s why i have mrs .  hester around .  she lives pretty close by  she s good at attending to foolishness without running to me about it  and most of all  she likes sally and the rest .  some people don t .    glad to see you  mr .  gellhorn   i said .    raymond j  gellhorn   he said  and gave me his hand  which i shook and gave back .   he was a largish fellow  half a head taller than i and wider  too .  he was about half my age  thirtyish .  he had black hair  plastered down slick  with a part in the middle  and a thin mustache  very neatly trimmed .  his jawbones got big under his ears and made him look as if he had a slight case of mumps .  on video he d be a natural to play the villain  so i assumed he was a nice fellow .  it goes to show that video can t be wrong all the time .    i m jacob folkers   i said .   what can i do for you .    he grinned .  it was a big  wide  white toothed grin .   you can tell me a little about your farm here  if you don t mind .    i heard sally coming up behind me and i put out my hand .  she slid right into it and the feel of the hard  glossy enamel of her fender was warm in my palm .    a nice automatobile   said gellhorn .   that s one way of putting it .  sally was a      convertible with a hennis carleton positronic motor and an armat chassis .  she had the cleanest  finest lines i ve ever seen on any model  bar none .  for five years  she d been my favorite  and i d put everything into her i could dream up .  in all that time  there d never been a human being behind her wheel .   not once .    sally   i said  patting her gently   meet mr .  gellhorn .    sally s cylinder purr keyed up a little .  i listened carefully for any knocking .  lately  i d been hearing motor knock in almost all the cars and changing the gasoline hadn t done a bit of good .  sally was as smooth as her paint job this time  however .    do you have names for all your cars .   asked gellhorn .   he sounded amused  and mrs .  hester doesn t like people to sound as though they were making fun of the farm .  she said  sharply   certainly .  the cars have real personalities  don t they  jake .  the sedans are all males and the convertibles are females .    gellhorn was smiling again .   and do you keep them in separate garages  ma am .    mrs .  hester glared at him .   gellhorn said to me   and now i wonder if i can talk to you alone  mr .  folkers .     that depends   i said .   are you a reporter .     no  sir .  i m a sales agent .  any talk we have is not for publication .  i assure you i am interested in strict privacy .     let s walk down the road a bit .  there s a bench we can use .    we started down .  mrs .  hester walked away .  sally nudged along after us .   i said   you don t mind if sally comes along  do you .     not at all .  she can t repeat what we say  can she .   he laughed at his own joke  reached over and rubbed sally s grille .   sally raced her motor and gellhorn s hand drew away quickly .    she s not used to strangers   i explained .   we sat down on the bench under the big oak tree where we could look across the small lake to the private speedway .  it was the warm part of the day and the cars were out in force  at least thirty of them .  even at this distance i could see that jeremiah was pulling his usual stunt of sneaking up behind some staid older model  then putting on a jerk of speed and yowling past with deliberately squealing brakes .  two weeks before he had crowded old angus off the asphalt altogether  and i had turned off his motor for two days .       it didn t help though  i m afraid  and it looks as though there s nothing to be done about it .  jeremiah is a sports model to begin with and that kind is awfully hot headed .    well  mr .  gellhorn   i said .   could you tell me why you want the information .    but he was just looking around .  he said   this is an amazing place  mr .  folkers .     i wish you d call me jake .  everyone does .     all right  jake .  how many cars do you have here .     fifty one .  we get one or two new ones every year .  one year we got five .  we haven t lost one yet .  they re all in perfect running order .  we even have a     model mat o mot in working order .  one of the original automatics .  it was the first car here .    good old matthew .  he stayed in the garage most of the day now  but then he was the granddaddy of all positronic motored cars .  those were the days when blind war veterans  paraplegics and heads of state were the only ones who drove automatics .  but samson harridge was my boss and he was rich enough to be able to get one .  i was his chauffeur at the time .   the thought makes me feel old .  i can remember when there wasn t an automobile in the world with brains enough to find its own way home .  i chauffeured dead lumps of machines that needed a man s hand at their controls every minute .  every year machines like that used to kill tens of thousands of people .   the automatics fixed that .  a positronic brain can react much faster than a human one  of course  and it paid people to keep hands off the controls .  you got in  punched your destination and let it go its own way .   we take it for granted now  but i remember when the first laws came out forcing the old machines off the highways and limiting travel to automatics .  lord  what a fuss .  they called it everything from communism to fascism  but it emptied the highways and stopped the killing  and still more people get around more easily the new way .   of course  the automatics were ten to a hundred times as expensive as the hand driven ones  and there aren t many that could afford a private vehicle .  the industry specialized in turning out omnibus automatics .  you could always call a company and have one stop at your door in a matter of minutes and take you where you wanted to go .  usually  you had to drive with others who were going your way  but what s wrong with that .   samson harridge had a private car though  and i went to him the minute it arrived .  the car wasn t matthew to me then .  i didn t know it was going to be the dean of the farm some day .  i only knew it was taking my job away and i hated it .   i said   you won t be needing me any more  mr .  harridge .    he said  what are you dithering about  jake .  you don t think i ll trust myself to a contraption like that  do you .  you stay right at the controls .    i said   but it works by itself  mr .  harridge .  it scans the road  reacts properly to obstacles  humans  and other cars  and remembers routes to travel .     so they say .  so they say .  just the same  you re sitting right behind the wheel in case anything goes wrong .    funny how you can get to like a car .  in no time i was calling it matthew and was spending all my time keeping it polished and humming .  a positronic brain stays in condition best when it s got control of its chassis at all times  which means it s worth keeping the gas tank filled so that the motor can turn over slowly day and night .  after a while  it got so i could tell by the sound of the motor how matthew felt .   in his own way  harridge grew fond of matthew  too .  he had no one else to like .  he d divorced or outlived three wives and outlived five children and three grandchildren .  so when he died  maybe it wasn t surprising that he had his estate converted into a farm for retired automobiles  with me in charge and matthew the first member of a distinguished line .   it s turned out to be my life .  i never got married .  you can t get married and still tend to automatics the way you should .   the newspapers thought it was funny  but after a while they stopped joking about it .  some things you can t joke about .  maybe you ve never been able to afford an automatic and maybe you never will  either  but take it from me  you get to love them .  they re hard working and affectionate .  it takes a man with no heart to mistreat one or to see one mistreated .  it got so that after a man had an automatic for a while  he would make provisions for having it left to the farm  if he didn t have an heir he could rely on to give it good care .  i explained that to gellhorn .   he said   fifty one cars .  that represents a lot of money .    fifty thousand minimum per automatic  original investment   i said .   they re worth a lot more now .  i ve done things for them .     it must take a lot of money to keep up the farm .     you re right there .  the farm s a non profit organization  which gives us a break on taxes and  of course  new automatics that come in usually have trust funds attached .  still  costs are always going up .  i have to keep the place landscaped  i keep laying down new asphalt and keeping the old in repair  there s gasoline  oil  repairs  and new gadgets .  it adds up .     and you ve spent a long time at it .     i sure have  mr .  gellhorn .  thirty three years .     you don t seem to be getting much out of it yourself .     i don t .  you surprise me  mr .  gellhorn .  i ve got sally and fifty others .  look at her .    i was grinning . i couldn t help it .  sally was so clean  it almost hurt .  some insect must have died on her windshield or one speck of dust too many had landed  so she was going to work .  a little tube protruded and spurted tergosol over the glass .  it spread quickly over the silicone surface film and squeegees snapped into place instantly  passing over the windshield and forcing the water into the little channel that led it  dripping  down to the ground .  not a speck of water got on to her glistening apple green hood .  squeegee and detergent tube snapped back into place and disappeared .   gellhorn said   i never saw an automatic do that .    i guess not   i said .   i fixed that up specially on our cars .  they re clean .  they re always scrubbing their glass .  they like it .  i ve even got sally fixed up with wax jets .  she polishes herself every night till you can see your face in any part of her and shave by it .  if i can scrape up the money  i d be putting it on the rest of the girls .  convertibles are very vain .     i can tell you how to scrape up the money  if that interests you .     that always does .  how .     isn t it obvious  jake .  any of your cars is worth fifty thousand minimum  you said .  i ll bet most of them top six figures .     so .     ever think of selling a few .    i shook my head .   you don t realize it  i guess  mr .  gellhorn  but i can t sell any of these .  they belong to the farm  not to me .    the money would go to the farm .     the incorporation papers of the farm provide that the cars receive perpetual care .  they can t be sold .     what about the motors  then .     i don t understand you .    gellhorn shifted position and his voice got confidential .   look here  jake  let me explain the situation .  there s a big market for private automatics if they could only be made cheaply enough .  right .     that s no secret .     and ninety five per cent of the cost is the motor .  right .  now  i know where we can get a supply of bodies .  i also know where we can sell automatics at a good price   twenty or thirty thousand for the cheaper models  maybe fifty or sixty for the better ones .  all i need are the motors .  you see the solution .     i don t  mr .  gellhorn .   i did  but i wanted him to spell it out .    it s right here .  you ve got fifty one of them .  you re an expert automatobile mechanic  jake .  you must be .  you could unhook a motor and place it in another car so that no one would know the difference .     it wouldn t be exactly ethical .     you wouldn t be harming the cars .  you d be doing them a favor .  use your older cars .  use that old mat o mot .     well  now  wait a while  mr .  gellhorn .  the motors and bodies aren t two separate items .  they re a single unit .  those motors are used to their own bodies .  they wouldn t be happy in another car .     all right  that s a point .  that s a very good point  jake .  it would be like taking your mind and putting it in someone else s skull .  right .  you don t think you would like that .    i don t think i would .  no .     but what if i took your mind and put it into the body of a young athlete .  what about that  jake .  you re not a youngster anymore .  if you had the chance  wouldn t you enjoy being twenty again .  that s what i m offering some of your positronic motors .  they ll be put into new     bodies .  the latest construction .    i laughed .   that doesn t make much sense  mr .  gellhorn .  some of our cars may be old  but they re well cared for .  nobody drives them .  they re allowed their own way .  they re retired  mr .  gellhorn .  i wouldn t want a twenty year old body if it meant i had to dig ditches for the rest of my new life and never have enough to eat .  what do you think  sally .    sally s two doors opened and then shut with a cushioned slam .    what s that .   said gellhorn .    that s the way sally laughs .    gellhorn forced a smile .  i guess he thought i was making a bad joke .  he said   talk sense  jake .  cars are made to be driven .  they re probably not happy if you don t drive them .    i said   sally hasn t been driven in five years .  she looks happy to me .     i wonder .    he got up and walked toward sally slowly .   hi  sally  how d you like a drive .    sally s motor reved up .  she backed away .    don t push her  mr .  gellhorn   i said .   she s liable to be a little skittish .    two sedans were about a hundred yards up the road .  they had stopped .  maybe  in their own way  they were watching .  i didn t bother about them .  i had my eyes on sally  and i kept them there .   gellhorn said   steady now  sally .   he lunged out and seized the door handle .  it didn t budge  of course .   he said   it opened a minute ago .    i said   automatic lock .  she s got a sense of privacy  sally has .    he let go  then said  slowly and deliberately   a car with a sense of privacy shouldn t go around with its top down .    he stepped back three or four paces  then quickly  so quickly i couldn t take a step to stop him  he ran forward and vaulted into the car .  he caught sally completely by surprise  because as he came down  he shut off the ignition before she could lock it in place .   for the first time in five years  sally s motor was dead .   i think i yelled  but gellhorn had the switch on  manual  and locked that in place  too .  he kicked the motor into action .  sally was alive again but she had no freedom of action .   he started up the road .  the sedans were still there .  they turned and drifted away  not very quickly .  i suppose it was all a puzzle to them .   one was giuseppe  from the milan factories  and the other was stephen .  they were always together .  they were both new at the farm  but they d been here long enough to know that our cars just didn t have drivers .   gellhorn went straight on  and when the sedans finally got it through their heads that sally wasn t going to slow down  that she couldn t slow down  it was too late for anything but desperate measures .   they broke for it  one to each side  and sally raced between them like a streak .  steve crashed through the lakeside fence and rolled to a halt on the grass and mud not six inches from the water s edge .  giuseppe bumped along the land side of the road to a shaken halt .   i had steve back on the highway and was trying to find out what harm  if any  the fence had done him  when gellhorn came back .   gellhorn opened sally s door and stepped out .  leaning back  he shut off the ignition a second time .    there   he said .   i think i did her a lot of good .    i held my temper .   why did you dash through the sedans .  there was no reason for that .     i kept expecting them to turn out .     they did .  one went through a fence .     i m sorry  jake   he said .   i thought they d move more quickly .  you know how it is .  i ve been in lots of buses  but i ve only been in a private automatic two or three times in my life  and this is the first time i ever drove one .  that just shows you  jake .  it got me  driving one  and i m pretty hard boiled .  i tell you  we don t have to go more than twenty per cent below list price to reach a good market  and it would be ninety per cent profit .     which we would split .     fifty fifty .  and i take all the risks  remember .     all right .  i listened to you .  now you listen to me .   i raised my voice because i was just too mad to be polite anymore .   when you turn off sally s motor  you hurt her .  how would you like to be kicked unconscious .  that s what you do to sally  when you turn her off .     you re exaggerating  jake .  the automatobuses get turned off every night .     sure  that s why i want none of my boys or girls in your fancy     bodies  where i won t know what treatment they ll get .  buses need major repairs in their positronic circuits every couple of years .  old matthew hasn t had his circuits touched in twenty years .  what can you offer him compared with that .     well  you re excited now .  suppose you think over my proposition when you ve cooled down and get in touch with me .     i ve thought it over all i want to .  if i ever see you again  i ll call the police .    his mouth got hard and ugly .  he said   just a minute  old timer .    i said   just a minute  you .  this is private property and i m ordering you off .    he shrugged .   well  then  good bye .    i said   mrs .  hester will see you off the property .  make that good bye permanent .    but it wasn t permanent .  i saw him again two days later .  two and a half days  rather  because it was about noon when i saw him first and a little after midnight when i saw him again .   i sat up in bed when he turned the light on  blinking blindly till i made out what was happening .  once i could see  it didn t take much explaining .  in fact  it took none at all .  he had a gun in his right fist  the nasty little needle barrel just visible between two fingers .  i knew that all he had to do was to increase the pressure of his hand and i would be torn apart .   he said   put on your clothes  jake .    i didn t move .  i just watched him .   he said   look  jake  i know the situation .  i visited you two days ago  remember .  you have no guards on this place  no electrified fences  no warning signals .  nothing .    i said   i don t need any .  meanwhile there s nothing to stop you from leaving  mr gellhorn .  i would if i were you .  this place can be very dangerous .    he laughed a little .   it is  for anyone on the wrong side of a fist gun .     i see it   i said .   i know you ve got one .     then get a move on .  my men are waiting .     no  sir  mr .  gellhorn .  not unless you tell me what you want  and probably not then .     i made you a proposition day before yesterday .     the answer s still no .    there s more to the proposition now .  i ve come here with some men and an automatobus .  you have your chance to come with me and disconnect twenty five of the positronic motors .  i don t care which twenty five you choose .  we ll load them on the bus and take them away .  once they re disposed of  i ll see to it that you get your fair share of the money .     i have your word on that  i suppose .    he didn t act as if he thought i was being sarcastic .  he said   you have .    i said   no .     if you insist on saying no  we ll go about it in our own way .  i ll disconnect the motors myself  only i ll disconnect all fifty one .  every one of them .     it isn t easy to disconnect positronic motors  mr .  gellhorn .  are you a robotics expert .  even if you are  you know  these motors have been modified by me .     i know that  jake .  and to be truthful  i m not an expert .  i may ruin quite a few motors trying to get them out .  that s why i ll have to work over all fifty one if you don t cooperate .  you see  i may only end up with twenty five when i m through .  the first few i ll tackle will probably suffer the most .  till i get the hang of it  you see .  and if i go it myself  i think i ll put sally first in line .    i said   i can t believe you re serious  mr .  gellhorn .    he said   i m serious  jake .   he let it all dribble in .   if you want to help  you can keep sally .  otherwise  she s liable to be hurt very badly .  sorry .    i said   i ll come with you  but i ll give you one more warning .  you ll be in trouble  mr .  gellhorn .    he thought that was very funny .  he was laughing very quietly as we went down the stairs together .   there was an automatobus waiting outside the driveway to the garage apartments .  the shadows of three men waited beside it  and their flash beams went on as we approached .   gellhorn said in a low voice   i ve got the old fellow .  come on .  move the truck up the drive and let s get started .    one of the others leaned in and punched the proper instructions on the control panel .  we moved up the driveway with the bus following submissively .    it won t go inside the garage   i said .   the door won t take it .  we don t have buses here .  only private cars .     all right   said gellhorn .   pull it over onto the grass and keep it out of sight .    i could hear the thrumming of the cars when we were still ten yards from the garage .   usually they quieted down if i entered the garage .  this time they didn t .  i think they knew that strangers were about  and once the face of gellhorn and the others were visible they got noisier .  each motor was a warm rumble  and each motor was knocking irregularly until the place rattled .   the lights went up automatically as we stepped inside .  gellhorn didn t seem bothered by the car noise  but the three men with him looked surprised and uncomfortable .  they had the look of the hired thug about them  a look that was not compounded of physical features so much as of a certain wariness of eye and hang dogness of face .  i knew the type and i wasn t worried .   one of them said   damn it  they re burning gas .     my cars always do   i replied stiffly .    not tonight   said gellhorn .   turn them off .     it s not that easy  mr .  gellhorn   i said .    get started .   he said .   i stood there .  he had his fist gun pointed at me steadily .  i said   i told you  mr .  gelhorn  that my cars have been well treated while they ve been at the farm .  they re used to being treated that way  and they resent anything else .     you have one minute   he said .   lecture me some other time .     i m trying to explain something .  i m trying to explain that my cars can understand what i say to them .  a positronic motor will learn to do that with time and patience .  my cars have learned .  sally understood your proposition two days ago .  you ll remember she laughed when i asked her opinion .  she also knows what you did to her and so do the two sedans you scattered .  and the rest know what to do about trespassers in general .     look  you crazy old fool      all i have to say is    i raised my voice .   get them .    one of the men turned pasty and yelled  but his voice was drowned completely in the sound of fifty one horns turned loose at once .  they held their notes  and within the four walls of the garage the echoes rose to a wild  metallic call .  two cars rolled forward  not hurriedly  but with no possible mistake as to their target .  two cars fell in line behind the first two .  all the cars were stirring in their separate stalls .   the thugs stared  then backed .   i shouted   don t get up against a wall .    apparently  they had that instinctive thought themselves .  they rushed madly for the door of the garage .   at the door one of gellhorn s men turned  brought up a fist gun of his own .  the needle pellet tore a thin  blue flash toward the first car .  the car was giuseppe .   a thin line of paint peeled up giuseppe s hood  and the right half of his windshield crazed and splintered but did not break through .   the men were out the door  running  and two by two the cars crunched out after them into the night  their horns calling the charge .   i kept my hand on gellhorn s elbow  but i don t think he could have moved in any case .  his lips were trembling .   i said   that s why i don t need electrified fences or guards .  my property protects itself .    gellhorn s eyes swiveled back and forth in fascination as  pair by pair  they whizzed by .  he said   they re killers .     don t be silly .  they won t kill your men .     they re killers .     they ll just give your men a lesson .  my cars have been specially trained for cross country pursuit for just such an occasion  i think what your men will get will be worse than an outright quick kill .  have you ever been chased by an automatobile .    gellhorn didn t answer .   i went on .  i didn t want him to miss a thing .   they ll be shadows going no faster than your men  chasing them here  blocking them there  blaring at them  dashing at them  missing with a screech of brake and a thunder of motor .  they ll keep it up till your men drop  out of breath and half dead  waiting for the wheels to crunch over their breaking bones .  the cars won t do that .  they ll turn away .  you can bet  though  that your men will never return here in their lives .  not for all the money you or ten like you could give them .  listen     i tightened my hold on his elbow .  he strained to hear .   i said   don t you hear car doors slamming .    it was faint and distant  but unmistakable .   i said   they re laughing .  they re enjoying themselves .    his face crumpled with rage .  he lifted his hand .  he was still holding his fist gun .   i said   i wouldn t .  one automatocar is still with us .    i don t think he had noticed sally till then .  she had moved up so quietly .  though her right front fender nearly touched me  i couldn t hear her motor .  she might have . been holding her breath .   gellhorn yelled .   i said   she won t touch you  as long as i m with you .  but if you kill me  you know  sally doesn t like you .    gellhorn turned the gun in sally s direction .    her motor is shielded   i said   and before you could ever squeeze the gun a second time she would be on top of you .     all right  then   he yelled  and suddenly my arm was bent behind my back and twisted so i could hardly stand .  he held me between sally and himself  and his pressure didn t let up .   back out with me and don t try to break loose  old tuner  or i ll tear your arm out of its stocket .    i had to move .  sally nudged along with us  worried  uncertain what to do .  i tried to say something to her and couldn t .  i could only clench my teeth and moan .   gellhorn s automatobus was still standing outside the garage .  i was forced in .  gellhorn jumped in after me  locking the doors .   he said   all right  now .  we ll talk sense .    i was rubbing my arm  trying to get life back into it  and even as i did i was automatically and without any conscious effort studying the control board of the bus .   i said   this is a rebuilt job .     so .   he said caustically .   it s a sample of my work .  i picked up a discarded chassis  found a brain i could use and spliced me a private bus .  what of it .    i tore at the repair panel  forcing it aside .   he said   what the hell .  get away from that .   the side of his palm came down numbingly on my left shoulder .   i struggled with him .   i don t want to do this bus any harm .  what kind of a person do you think i am .  i just want to take a look at some of the motor connections .    it didn t take much of a look .  i was boiling when i turned to him .  i said   you re a hound and a bastard .  you had no right installing this motor yourself .  why didn t you get a robotics man .    he said   do i look crazy .     even if it was a stolen motor  you had no right to treat it so .  i wouldn t treat a man the way you treated that motor .  solder  tape  and pinch clamps .  it s brutal .     it works  doesn t it .     sure it works  but it must be hell for the bus .  you could live with migraine headaches and acute arthritis  but it wouldn t be much of a life .  this car is suffering .     shut up .   for a moment he glanced out the window at sally  who had rolled up as close to the bus as she could .  he made sure the door and windows were locked .   he said   we re getting out of here now  before the other cars come back .  we ll stay away .     how will that help you .     your cars will run out of gas someday  won t they .  you haven t got them fixed up so they can tank tip on their own  have you .  we ll come back and finish the job .     they ll be looking for me   i said .   mrs .  hester will call the police .    he was past reasoning with .  he just punched the bus in gear .  it lurched forward .  sally followed .    he giggled .   what can she do if you re here with me .    sally seemed to realize that  too .  she picked up speed  passed us and was gone .  gellhorn opened the window next to him and spat through the opening .   the bus lumbered on over the dark road  its motor rattling unevenly .  gellhorn dimmed the periphery light until the phosphorescent green stripe down the middle of the highway  sparkling in the moonlight  was all that kept us out of the trees .  there was virtually no traffic .  two cars passed ours  going the other way  and there was none at all on our side of the highway  either before or behind .   i heard the door slamming first .  quick and sharp in the silence  first on the right and then on the left .  gellhorn s hands quivered as he punched savagely for increased speed .  a beam of light shot out from among a scrub of trees  blinding us .  another beam plunged at us from behind the guard rails on the other side .  at a crossover  four hundred yards ahead  there was a sque e e e e as a car darted across our path .    sally went for the rest   i said .   . i think you re surrounded .     so what .  what can they do .    he hunched over the controls  peering through the windshield .    and don t you try anything  old timer   he muttered .   i couldn t .  i was bone weary  my left arm was on fire .  the motor sounds gathered and grew closer .  i could hear the motors missing in odd patterns  suddenly it seemed to me that my cars were speaking to one another .   a medley of horns came from behind .  i turned and gellhorn looked quickly into the rear view mirror .  a dozen cars were following in both lanes .   gellhorn yelled and laughed madly .   i cried   stop .  stop the car .    because not a quarter of a mile ahead  plainly visible in the light beams of two sedans on the roadside was sally  her trim body plunked square across the road .  the cars shot into the opposite lane to our left  keeping perfect time with us and preventing gellhorn from turning out .   but he had no intention of turning out .  he put his finger on the full speed ahead button and kept it there .   he said   there ll be no bluffing here .  this bus outweighs her five to one  old timer  and we ll just push her off the road like a dead kitten .    i knew he could .  the bus was on manual and his finger was on the button .  i knew he would .   i lowered the window  and stuck my head out .   sally   i screamed .   get out of way .  sally .  the  it was drowned out in the agonized squeal of maltreated brake bands .  i felt myself thrown forward and heard gellhorn s breath puff out of his body .   i saidj  what happened .   it was a foolish question .  we had stopped .  that was what had happened .  sally and the bus were five feet apart .  with five times her weight tearing down on her  she had not budged .  the guts of her .   gellhorn yanked at the manual toggle switch .   it s got to   he kept muttering .   it s got to .    i said   not the way you hooked up the motor  expert .  any of the circuits could cross over .    he looked at me with a tearing anger and growled deep in his throat .  his hair was matted over his forehead .  he lifted his fist .    that s all the advice out of you there ll ever be  old timer .    and i knew the needle gun was about to fire .   i pressed back against the bus door  watching the fist come up  and when the door opened i went over backward and out  hitting the ground with a thud .  i heard the door slam closed again .   i got to my knees and looked up in time to see gellhorn struggle uselessly with the closing window  then aim his fist gun quickly through the glass .  he never fired .  the bus got under way with a tremendous roar  and gellhorn lurched backward .   sally wasn t in the way any longer  and i watched the bus s rear lights flicker away down the highway .   i was exhausted .  i sat down right there  right on the highway  and put my head down in my crossed arms  trying to catch my breath .   i heard a car stop gently at my side .  when i looked up  it was sally .  slowly   lovingly  you might say   her front door opened .   no one had driven sally for five years   except gellhorn  of course   and i know how valuable such freedom was to a car .  i appreciated the gesture  but i said   thanks  sally  but i ll take one of the newer cars .    i got up and turned away  but skillfully and neatly as a pirouette  she wheeled before me again .  i couldn t hurt her feelings .  i got in .  her front seat had the fine  fresh scent of an automato bile that kept itself spotlessly clean .  i lay down across it  thankfully  and with even  silent  and rapid efficiency  my boys and girls brought me home .   mrs .  hester brought me the copy of the radio transcript the next evening with great excitement .    it s mr .  gellhorn   she said .   the man who came to see you .    what about him .    i dreaded her answer .    they found him dead   she said .   imagine that .  just lying dead in a ditch .     it might be a stranger   i mumbled .    raymond j .  gellhorn   she said  sharply .   there can t be two  can there .  the description fits  too .  lord  what a way to die .  they found tire marks on his arms and body .  imagine .  i m glad it turned out to be a bus  otherwise they might have come poking around here .     did it happen near here .   i asked  anxiously .    no  .  .  .  near cooksville .  but  goodness  read about it yourself if you   what happened to giuseppe .    i welcomed the diversion .  giuseppe was waiting patiently for me to complete the repaint job .  his windshield had been replaced .   after she left  i snatched up the transcript .  there was no doubt about it .  the doctor reported he had been running and was in a state of totally spent exhaustion .  i wondered for how many miles the bus had played with him before the final lunge .  the transcript had no notion of anything like that  of course .   they had located the bus and identified it by the tire tracks .  the police had it and were trying to trace its ownership .   there was an editorial in the transcript about it .  it had been the first traffic fatality in the state for that year  and the paper warned strenuously against manual driving after night .   there was no mention of gellhorn s three thugs and for that  at least  i was grateful .  none of our cars had been seduced by the pleasure of the chase into killing .   that was all .  i let the paper drop .  gellhorn had been a criminal .  his treatment of the bus had been brutal .  there was no question in my mind he deserved death .  but still i felt a bit queasy over the manner of it .   a month has passed now and i can t get it out of my mind .   my cars talk to one another .  i have no doubt about it anymore .  it s as though they ve gained confidence  as though they re not bothering to keep it a secret anymore .  their engines rattle and knock continuously .   and they don t talk among themselves only .  they talk to the cars and buses that come into the farm on business .  how long have they been doing that .   they must be understood  too .  gellhorn s bus understood them  for all it hadn t been on the grounds more than an hour .  i can close my eyes and bring back that dash along the highway  with our cars flanking the bus on either side  clacking their motors at it till it understood  stopped  let me out  and ran off with gellhorn .   did my cars tell him to kill gellhorn .  or was that his idea .   can cars have such ideas .  the motor designers say no but they mean under ordinary conditions .  have they foreseen everything .   cars get ill used  you know .   some of them enter the farm and observe .  they get told things .  they find out that cars exist whose motors are never stopped  whom no one ever drives  whose every need is supplied .   then maybe they go out and tell others .  maybe the word is spreading quickly .  maybe they re going to think that the farm way should be the way all over the world .  they don t understand .  you couldn t expect them to understand about legacies and the whims of rich men .   there are millions of automobiles on earth  tens of millions .  if the thought gets rooted in them that they re slaves  that they should do something about it  .  .  .  if they begin to think the way gellhorn s bus did .  .  .  .   maybe it won t be till after my time .  and then they ll have to keep a few of us to take care of them  won t they .  they wouldn t kill us all .   and maybe they would .  maybe they wouldn t understand about how someone would have to care for them .  maybe they won t wait .   every morning i wake up and think  maybe today .  .  .  .   i don t get as much pleasure out of my cars as i used to .  lately  i notice that i m even beginning to avoid sally .     in late       a new magazine appeared on the newsstands  the magazine of fantasy .  by the second issue it had expanded its name to the magazine of fantasy and science fiction  and it is universally known by the initials f   sf .   i found f   sf daunting at first .  it stressed style  it seemed to me  even more than idea  and i wasn t at all sure that i could manage style  or that i even knew what style might be .  it was only a few months ago  indeed  that a reviewer  referring to me in her review of one of my books  said   he is no stylist .   i wrote at once to ask what a stylist was  but she never answered  so it looks as though i ll never find out .   as it happened  though  anthony boucher  the co editor of the magazine  wrote me a letter after the appearance of  hostess    the first communication on record between us .  in  hostess   i had spoken of the  the paler emotional surges of the late thirties  and tony wrote in mild expostulation  having himself just turned forty at the time .   i had just turned thirty .   he told me that i had a delightful surprise ahead of me  and he was entirely right .   this initiated a pleasant correspondence and i lost some of my fear of f   sf .  i thought i would try a story that stressed style but since i didn t  either then or now  know what style was  or how one went about getting it  i hadn t the faintest idea whether i had succeeded or not .  i guess i did  though  for it was  flies  i wrote and mr .  boucher accepted and published it .   i had no way of telling it at the time  but this began what turned out to be the happiest of all my associations with science fiction magazines .  i have no complaints about astounding  galaxy  or any of the rest  heaven knows  but f   sf has become something special to me  and it is only honest of me to say so .   by the way  if anyone thinks i am so arrogant that i can never accept any editorial correction  he is quite wrong .  i don t enjoy editorial correction  no writer does  but i accept it quite often .   this  actually  is intended for my brother  who is a newspaper editor and who seems to think that all writers are fiendishly anti editor out of sheer malevolent stupidity .    anyway  here is my example of how sweetly compliant i can be .  when i first wrote  flies   i named it  king lear  iv  i        .   mr .  boucher wrote me  somewhat in horror  and asked if i insisted on the title because nobody would look it up and it would be meaningless .   i thought it over and decided he was right and renamed the story  flies  .  after you read the story  however  you re welcome to look it up .  you ll find out what started the train of thought that ended in this particular story .   first appearance   the magazine of fantasy and science fiction  june      .  copyright        by fantasy house  inc .     flies     flies .   said kendell casey  wearily .  he swung his arm .  the fly circled  returned and nestled on casey s shirt collar .   from somewhere there sounded the buzzing of a second fly .   dr .  john polen covered the slight uneasiness of his chin by moving his cigarette quickly to his lips .   he said   i didn t expect to meet you  casey .  or you  win throp .  or ought i call you reverend winthrop .     ought i call you professor polen .   said winthrop  carefully striking the proper vein of rich toned friendship .   they were trying to snuggle into the cast off shell of twenty years back  each of them .  squirming and cramming and not fitting .   damn  thought polen fretfully  why do people attend college reunions .   casey s hot blue eyes were still filled with the aimless anger of the college sophomore who has discovered intellect  frustration  and the tag ends of cynical philosophy all at once .   casey .  bitter man of the campus .   he hadn t outgrown that .  twenty years later and it was casey  bitter ex man of the campus .  polen could see that in the way his finger tips moved aimlessly and in the manner of his spare body .   as for winthrop .  well  twenty years older  softer  rounder .  skin pinker  eyes milder .  yet no nearer the quiet certainty he would never find .  it was all there in the quick smile he never entirely abandoned  as though he feared there would be nothing to take its place  that its absence would turn his face into a smooth and featureless flesh .   polen was tired of reading the aimless flickering of a muscle s end  tired of usurping the place of his machines  tired of the too much they told him .   could they read him as he read them .  could the small restlessness of his own eyes broadcast the fact that he was damp with the disgust that had bred mustily within him .   damn  thought polen  why didn t i stay away .   they stood there  all three  waiting for one another to say something  to flick something from across the gap and bring it  quivering  into the present .   polen tried it .  he said   are you still working in chemistry  casey .     in my own way  yes   said casey  gruffly .   i m not the scientist you re considered to be .  i do research on insecticides for e .  j .  link at chatham .    winthrop said   are you really .  you said you would work on insecticides .  remember  polen .  and with all that  the flies dare still be after you  casey .    casey said   can t get rid of them .  i m the best proving ground in the labs .  no compound we ve made keeps them away when i m around .  someone once said it was my odor .  i attract them .    polen remembered the someone who had said that .   winthrop said   or else     polen felt it coming .  he tensed .    or else   said winthrop   it s the curse  you know .   his smile intensified to show that he was joking  that he forgave past grudges .   damn  thought polen  they haven t even changed the words .  and the past came back .    flies   said casey  swinging his arm  and slapping .   ever see such a thing .  why don t they light on you two .    johnny polen laughed at him .  he laughed often then .   it s something in your body odor  casey .  you could be a boon to science .  find but the nature of the odorous chemical  concentrate it  mix it with ddt  and you ve got the best fly killer in the world .     a fine situation .  what do i smell like .  a lady fly in heat .  it s a shame they have to pick on me when the whole damned world s a dung heap .    winthrop frowned and said with a faint flavor of rhetoric   beauty is not the only thing  casey  in the eye of the beholder .    casey did not deign a direct response .  he said to polen   you know what winthrop told me yesterday .  he said those damned flies were the curse of beelzebub .     i was joking   said winthrop .    why beelzebub .   asked polen .    it amounts to a pun   said winthrop .   the ancient hebrews used it as one of their many terms of derision for alien gods .  it comes from ba al  meaning lord and zevuv  meaning fly .  the lord of flies .    casey said   come on  winthrop  don t say you don t believe in beelzebub .     i believe in the existence of evil   said winthrop  stiffly .    i mean beelzebub .  alive .  horns .  hooves .  a sort of competition deity .     not at all  winthrop grew stiffer .   evil is a short term affair .  in the end it must lose    polen changed the subject with a jar .  he said   i ll be doing graduate work for venner  by the way .  i talked with him day before yesterday  and he ll take me on .     no .  that s wonderful .   winthrop glowed and leaped to the subject change instantly .  he held out a hand   with which to pump polen s .  he was always conscientiously eager to rejoice in another s good fortune .  casey often pointed that out .   casey said   cybernetics venner .  well  if you can stand him  i suppose he can stand you .    winthrop went on .   what did he think of your idea .  did you tell him your idea .     what idea .   demanded casey .   polen had avoided telling casey so far .  but now venner had considered it and had passed it with a cool   interesting .   how could casey s dry laughter hurt it now .   polen said   it s nothing much .  essentially  it s just a notion that emotion is the common bond of life  rather than reason or intellect .  it s practically a truism  i suppose .  you can t tell what a baby thinks or even if it thinks  but it s perfectly obvious that it can be angry  frightened or contented even when a week old  see .    same with animals .  you can tell in a second if a dog is happy or if a cat is afraid .  the point is that their emotions are the same as those we would have under the same circumstances .     so .   said casey .   where does it get you .     i don t know yet .  right now  all i can say is that emotions are universals .  now suppose we could properly analyze all the actions of men and certain familiar animals and equate them with the visible emotion .  we might find a tight relationship .  emotion a might always involve motion b .  then we could apply it to animals whose emotions we couldn t guess at by common sense alone .  like snakes  or lobsters .     or flies   said casey  as he slapped viciously at another and flicked its remains off his wrist in furious triumph .   he went on .   go ahead  johnny .  i ll contribute the flies and you study them .  we ll establish a science of flychology and labor to make them happy by removing their neuroses .  after all  we want the greatest good of the greatest number  don t we .  and there are more flies than men .     oh  well   said polen .   casey said   say  polen  did you ever follow up that weird idea of yours .  i mean  we all know you re a shining cybernetic light  but i haven t been reading your papers .  with so many ways of wasting time  something has to be neglected  you know .     what idea .   asked polen  woodenly .    come on .  you know .  emotions of animals and all that sort of guff .  boy  those were the days .  i used to know madmen .  now i only come across idiots .    winthrop said   that s right  polen .  i remember it very well .  your first year in graduate school you were working on dogs and rabbits .  i believe you even tried some of casey s flies .    polen said   it came to nothing in itself .  it gave rise to certain new principles of computing  however  so it wasn t a total loss .    why did they talk about it .   emotions .  what right had anyone to meddle with emotions .  words were invented to conceal emotions .  it was the dreadful ness of raw emotion that had made language a basic necessity .   polen knew .  his machines had by passed the screen of verbalization and dragged the unconscious into the sunlight .  the boy and the girl  the son and the mother .  for that matter  the cat and the mouse or the snake and the bird .  the data rattled together in its universality and it had all poured into and through polen until he could no longer bear the touch of life .   in the last few years he had so painstakingly schooled his thoughts in other directions .  now these two came  dabbling in his mind  stirring up its mud .   casey batted abstractedly across the tip of his nose to dislodge a fly .   too bad   he said .   i used to think you could get some fascinating things out of  say  rats .  well  maybe not fascinating  but then nonas boring as the stuff you would get out of our somewhat human beings .  i used to think     polen remembered what he used to think .   casey said   damn this ddt .  the flies feed on it  i think .  you know  i m going to do graduate work in chemistry and then get a job on insecticides .  so help me .  i ll personally get something that will kill the vermin .    they were in casey s room  and it had a somewhat keroseny odor from the recently applied insecticide .   polen shrugged and said   a folded newspaper will always kill .    casey detected a non existent sneer and said instantly   how would you summarize your first year s work  polen .  i mean aside from the true summary any scientist could state if he dared  by which i mean   nothing  .     nothing   said polen .   there s your summary .     go on   said casey .   you use more dogs than the physiologists  do and i bet the dogs mind the physiological experiments less .  i would .     oh  leave him alone   said winthrop .   you sound like a piano with    keys eternally out of order .  you re a bore .    you couldn t say that to casey .   he said  with sudden liveliness  looking carefully away from winthrop  i ll tell you what you ll probably find in animals  if you look closely enough .  religion .    what the dickens .   said winthrop  outraged .   that s a foolish remark .    casey smiled .   now  now  winthrop .  dickens is just a euphemism for devil and you don t want to be swearing .     don t teach me morals .  and don t be blasphemous .    what s blasphemous about it .  why shouldn t a flea consider the dog as something to be worshipped .  it s the source of warmth  food  and all that s good for a flea .     i don t want to discuss it .    why not .  do you good .  you could even say that to an ant  an anteater is a higher order of creation .  he would be too big for them to comprehend  too mighty to dream of resisting .  he would move among them like an unseen  inexplicable whirlwind  visiting them with destruction and death .  but that wouldn t spoil things for the ants .  they would reason that destruction was simply their just punishment for evil .  and the anteater wouldn t even know he was a deity .  or care .    winthrop had gone white .  he said   i know you re saying this only to annoy me and i am sorry to see you risking your soul for a moment s amusement .  let me tell you this   his voice trembled a little   and let me say it very seriously .  the flies that torment you are your punishment in this life .  beelzebub  like all the forces of evil  may think he does evil  but it s only the ultimate good after all .  the curse of beelzebub is on you for your good .  perhaps it will succeed in getting you to change your way of life before it s too late .    he ran from the room .   casey watched him go .  he said  laughing   i told you winthrop believed in beelzebub .  it s funny the respectable names you can give to superstition .   his laughter died a little short of its natural end .   there were two flies in the room  buzzing through the vapors toward him .   polen rose and left in heavy depression .  one year had taught him little  but it was already too much  and his laughter was thinning .  only his machines could analyze the emotions of animals properly  but he was already guessing too deeply concerning the emotions of men .   he did not like to witness wild murder yearnings where others could see only a few words of unimportant quarrel .   casey said  suddenly   say  come to think of it  you did try some of my flies  the way winthrop says .  how about that .     did i .  after twenty years  i scarcely remember   murmured polen .   winthrop said   you must .  we were in your laboratory and you complained that casey s flies followed him even there .  he suggested you analyze them and you did .  you recorded their motions and buzzings and wing wiping for half an hour or more .  you played with a dozen different flies .    polen shrugged .    oh  well   said casey .   it doesn t matter .  it was good seeing you  old man .   the hearty hand shake  the thump on the shoulder  the broad grin   to polen it all translated into sick disgust on casey s part that polen was a  success  after all .   polen said   let me hear from you sometimes .    the words were dull thumps .  they meant nothing .  casey knew that .  polen knew that .  everyone knew that .  but words were meant to hide emotion and when they failed  humanity loyally maintained the pretense .   winthrop s grasp of the hand was gentler .  he said   this brought back old times  polen .  if you re ever in cincinnati  why don t you stop in at the meeting house .  you ll always be welcome .    to polen  it all breathed of the man s relief at polen s obvious depression .  science  too  it seemed  was not the answer  and winthrop s basic and ineradicable insecurity felt pleased at the company .    i will   said polen .  it was the usual polite way of saying  i won t .   he watched them thread separately to other  groups .   winthrop would never know .  polen was sure of that .  he wondered if casey knew .  it would be the supreme joke if casey did not .   he had run casey s flies  of course  not that once alone  but many times .  always the same answer .  always the same unpub lishable answer .   with a cold shiver he could not quite control  polen was suddenly conscious of a single fly loose in the room  veering aimlessly for a moment  then beating strongly and reverently in the direction casey had taken a moment before .   could casey not know .  could it be the essence of the primal punishment that he never learn he was beelzebub .   casey .  lord of the flies .     i suppose that one of those stock phrases for which everyone is responsible at one time or another is   well  whatever does he see in her .   or   well  whatever does she see in him .    it s a ridiculous question because the sort of thing that he sees in her or she sees in him that isn t visible to the general population is probably you know very well what .   just the same  i m as prone to sneer as the next fellow and when i see a movie in which the girl falls in love with a fellow who has no visible advantages outside of being tall  lean  strong  fearless  and incredibly handsome  i am naturally disgusted .   whatever does she see in him .   i ask .   pressed for a reason for the sneer  i can point out that this tall  lean  strong  fearless  and incredibly handsome fellow almost invariably has the brain capacity of a gnat .  he speaks in an occasional grunt and views the world with dim eyes backed by a lackluster brain .  he is known to all and sundry  and particularly to the girl who is trying to mask her mad passion for him  as a  big lug   or  possibly  as a  big galoot  .   these lugs or galoots are particularly impervious to even subhuman understanding of feminine psychology and the more they display this the more desperately they are loved .   i tell you i can t stand it .  the fact that i know darned well that if i ever tried to compete for a girl with one of these tall  lean cretins  i would lose out  makes it worse .  so i took my revenge  i decided never to write a big lug into one of my stories .   as far as i know i never did .  as of yesterday  i would have sworn to that  and backed the oath with any sum of money .  yet when i read over  nobody here but   just now  prior to writing a fitting introduction  i realized with sinking heart and disbelieving mind that here was a story with a galoot .   good lord .   first appearance   star science fiction stories       .  copy  right        by ballantine books  inc .      nobody here but       you see  it wasn t our fault .  we had no idea anything was wrong until i called cliff anderson and spoke to him when he wasn t there .  what sxmore  i wouldn t have known he wasn t there  if it wasn t that hje walked in while i was talking to him .   no  no  no  no    i never seem to be able to tell this straight .  i get too excited .   look  i might as well begin at the beginning .  i m bill billings  my friend is cliff anderson .  i m an electrical engineer  he s a mathematician  and we re on the faculty of midwestern institute of technology .  now you know who we are .   ever since we got out of uniform  cliff and i have been working on calculating machines .  you know what they are .  norbert wiener popularized them in his book  cybernetics .  if you ve seen pictures of them  you know that they re great big things .  they take up a whole wall and they re very complicated  also expensive .   but cliff and i had ideas .  you see  what makes a thinking machine so big and  expensive is that it has to be full of relays and vacuum tubes just so that microscopic electric currents can be controlled and made to flicker on and off  here and there .  now the really important things are those little electric currents  so    i once said to cliff   why can t we control the currents without all the salad dressing .    cliff said   why not  indeed   and started working on the mathematics .   how we got where we did in two years is no matter .  it s what we got after we finished that made the trouble .  it turned out that we ended with something about this high and maybe so wide and just about this deep    no  no .  i forget that you can t see me .  i ll give you the figures .  it was about three feet high  six feet long  and two feet deep .  got that .  it took two men to carry it but it could be carried and that was the point .  and still  mind you  it could do anything the wall size calculators could .  not as fast  maybe  but we were still working .   we had big ideas about that thing  the very biggest .  we could put it on ships or airplanes  after a while  if we could make it small enough  an automobile could carry one .   we were especially interested in the automobile angle .  suppose you had a little thinking machine on the dashboard  hooked to the engine and battery and equipped with photo electric eyes .  it could choose an ideal course  avoid cars  stop at red lights  pick the optimum speed for the terrain .  everybody could sit in the back seat and automobile accidents would vanish .   all of it was fun .  there was so much excitement to it  so many thrills every time we worked out another consolidation  that i could still cry when i think of the time i picked up the telephone to call our lab and tumbled everything into the discard .   i was at mary ann s house that evening   or have i told you about mary ann yet .  no .  i guess i haven t .   mary ann was the girl who would have been my fiancee but for two ifs .  one  if she were willing  and two  if i had the nerve to ask her .  she has red hair and crams something like two tons of energy into about     pounds of body which fills out very nicely from the ground to five and a half feet up .  i was dying to ask her  you understand  but each time i d see her coming into sight  setting a match to my heart with every movement  i d just break down .   it s not that i m not good looking .  people tell me i m adequate .  i ve got all my hair  i m nearly six feet tall  i can even dance .  it s just that i ve nothing to offer .  i don t have to tell you what college teachers make .  with inflation and taxes  it amounts to just about nothing .  of course  if we got the basic patents rolled up on our little thinking machine  things would be different .  but i couldn t ask her to wait for that  either .  maybe  after it was all set    anyway  i just stood there  wishing  that evening  as she came into the living room .  my arm was groping blindly for the phone .   mary ann said   i m all ready  bill .  let s go .    i said   just a minute .  i want to ring up cliff .    she frowned a little   can t it wait .     i was supposed to call him two hours ago   i explained .   it only took two minutes .  i rang the lab .  cliff was putting in an evening of work and so he answered .  i asked something  then he said something  i asked some more and he explained .  the details don t matter  but as i said  he s the mathematician of the combination .  when i build the circuits and put things together in what look like impossible ways  he s the guy who shuffles the symbols and tells me whether they re really impossible .  then  just as i finished and hung up  there was a ring at the door .   for a minute  i thought mary ann had another caller and got sort of stiff backed as i watched her go to the door .  i was scribbling down some of what cliff had just told me while i watched .  but then she opened the door and it was only cliff anderson after all .   he said   i thought i d find you here   hello  mary ann .  say  weren t you going to ring me at six .  you re as reliable as a cardboard chair .   cliff is short and plump and always willing to start a fight  but i know him and pay no attention .   i said   things turned up and it slipped my mind .  but i just called  so what s the difference .     called .  me .  when .    i started to point to the telephone and gagged .  right then  the bottom fell out of things .  exactly five seconds before the doorbell had sounded i had been on the phone talking to cliff in the lab  and the lab was six miles away from mary ann s house .   i said   i   just spoke to you .    i wasn t getting across .  cliff just said   to me .   again .   i was pointing to the phone with both hands now   on the phone .  i called the lab .  on this phone here .  mary ann heard me .  mary ann  wasn t i just talking to     mary ann said   i don t know whom you were talking to .   well  shall we go .   that s mary ann .  she s a stickler for honesty .   i sat down  i tried to be very quiet and clear .  i said   cliff  i dialed the lab s phone number  you answered the phone  i asked you if you had the details worked out  you said yes  and gave them to me .  here they are .  i wrote them down .  is this correct or not .    i handed him the paper on which i had written the equations .   cliff looked at them .  he said   they re correct .  but where could you have gotten them .  you didn t work them out yourself  did you .     i just told you .  you gave them to me over the phone .    cliff shook his head .   bill  i haven t been in the lab since seven fifteen .  there s nobody there .     i spoke to somebody  i tell you .    mary ann was fiddling with her gloves .  we re getting late .   she said .   i waved my hands at her to wait a bit  and said to cliff   look  are you sure        there s nobody there  unless you want to count junior .   junior was what we called our pint sized mechanical brain .   we stood there  looking at one another .  mary ann s toe was still hitting the floor like a time bomb waiting to explode .   then cliff laughed .  he said   i m thinking of a cartoon i saw  somewhere .  it shows a robot answering the phone and saying   honest  boss  there s nobody here but us complicated thinking machines .     i didn t think that was funny .  i said   let s go to the lab .    mary ann said   hey .  we won t make the show .    i said   look  mary ann  this is very important .  it s just going to take a minute .  come along with us and we ll go straight to the show from there .    she said   the show starts    and then she stopped talking  because i grabbed her wrist and we left .   that just shows how excited i was .  ordinarily  i wouldn t ever have dreamed of shoving her around .  i mean  mary ann is quite a lady .  it s just that i had so many things on my mind .  i don t even really remember grabbing her wrist  come to think of it .  it s just that the next thing i knew  i was in the auto and so was cliff and so was she  and she was rubbing her wrist and muttering under her breath about big gorillas .   i said   did i hurt you  mary ann .    she said   no  of course not .  i have my arm yanked out of its socket every day  just for fun .   then she kicked me in the shin .   she only does things like that because she has red hair .  actually  she has a very gentle nature  but she tries very hard to live up to the redhead mythology .  i see right through that  of course  but i humor her  poor kid .   we were at the laboratory in twenty minutes .   the institute is empty at night .  it s emptier than a building would ordinarily be .  you see  it s designed to have crowds of students rushing through the corridors and when they aren t there  it s unnaturally lonely .  or maybe it was just that i was afraid to see what might be sitting in our laboratory upstairs .  either way  footsteps were uncomfortably loud and the self service elevator was downright dingy .   i said to mary ann   this won t take long .   but she just sniffed and looked beautiful .   she can t help looking beautiful .   cliff had the key to the laboratory and i looked over his shoulder when he opened the door .  there was nothing to see .  junior was there  sure  but he looked just as he had when i saw him last .  the dials in front registered nothing and except for that  there was just a large box  with a cable running back into the wall socket .   cliff and i walked up on either side of junior .  i think we were planning to grab it if it made a sudden move .  but then we stopped because junior just wasn t doing anything .  mary ann was looking at it  too .  in fact  she ran her middle finger along its top and then looked at the finger tip and twiddled it against her thumb to get rid of the dust .    i said   mary ann  don t you go near it .  stay at the other end of the room .    she said   it s just as dirty there .    she d never been in our lab before  and of course she didn t realize that a laboratory wasn t the same thing as a baby s bedroom  if you know what i mean .  the janitor comes in twice a day and all he does is empty the wastebaskets .  about once a week  he comes in with a dirty mop  makes mud on the floor  and shoves it around a little .   cliff said   the telephone isn t where i left it .    i said   how do you know .     because i left it there .   he pointed .   and now it s here .    if he were right  the telephone had moved closer to junior .  i swallowed and said   maybe you don t remember right .   i tried to laugh without sounding very natural and said   where s the screw driver .     what are you going to do .     just take a look inside .  for laughs .    mary ann said   you ll get yourself all dirty .   so i put on my lab coat .  she s a very thoughtful girl  mary ann .   i got to work with a screw driver .  of course  once junior was really perfected  we were going to have models manufactured in welded  one piece cases .  we were even thinking of molded plastic in colors  for home use .  in the lab model  though  we held it together with screws so that we could take it apart and put it together as often as we wanted to .   only the screws weren t coming out .  i grunted and yanked and said   some joker was putting his weight on these when he screwed  these things in .    cliff said   you re the only one who ever touches the thing .    he was right  too  but that didn t make it any easier .  i stood up and passed the back of my hand over my forehead .  i held out the screw driver to him   want to try .    he did  and didn t get any further than i did .  he said   that s funny .    i said   what s funny .    he said   i had a screw turning just now .  it moved about an eighth of an inch and then the screw driver slipped .     what s funny about that .    cliff backed away and put down the screw driver with two fingers   what s funny is that i saw the screw move back an eighth of an inch and tighten up again .    mary ann was fidgeting again .  she said   why don t your scientific minds think of a blowtorch  if you re so anxious .   there was a blowtorch on one of the benches and she was pointing to it .   well  ordinarily  i wouldn t think any more of using a blowtorch on junior than on myself .  but i was thinking something and cliff was thinking something and we were both thinking the same thing junior didn t want to be opened up .   cliff said   what do you think  bill .    and i said   i don t know  cliff .    mary ann said   well  hurry up  lunkhead  we ll miss the show .    so i picked up the blowtorch and adjusted the gauge on the oxygen cylinder .  it was going to be like stabbing a friend .   but mary ann stopped the proceedings by saying   well  how stupid can men be .  these screws are loose .  you must have been turning the screw driver the wrong way .    now there isn t much chance of turning a screw driver the wrong way .  just the same  i don t like to contradict mary ann  so i just said   mary ann  don t stay too close to junior .  why don t you wait by the door .    but she just said   well  look .   and there was a screw in her hand and an empty hole in the front of junior s case .  she had removed it by hand .   cliff said   holy smoke .    they were turning  all dozen screws .  they were doing it by themselves  like little forms crawling out of their holes  turning round and round  then dropping out .  i scrabbled them up and only one was left .  it hung on for a while  the front panel sagging from it  till i reached out .  then the last screw dropped and the panel fell gently into my arms .  i put it to one side .   cliff said   it did that on purpose .  it heard us mention the blowtorch and gave up .   his face is usually pink  but it was white then .   i was feeling a little queer myself .  i said   what s it trying to hide .     i don t know .    we bent before its open insides and for a while we just looked .  i could hear mary ann s toe begin to tap the floor again .  i looked at my wrist watch and i had to admit to myself we didn t have much time .  in fact  we didn t have any time left .   and then i said   it s got a diaphragm .    cliff said   where .   and bent closer .   i pointed   and a loud speaker .     you didn t put them in .     of course i didn t put them in .  i ought to know what i put in .  if i put it in  i d remember .     then how did it get in .    we were squatting and arguing .  i said   it made them itself  i suppose .  maybe it grows them .  look at that .   i pointed again .  inside the box at two different places  were coils of something that looked like thin garden hose  except that they were of metal .  they spiraled tightly so that they lay flat .  at the end of each coil  the metal divided into five or six thin filaments that were in little sub spirals .    you didn t put those in either .     no  i didn t put those in either .     what are they .    he knew what they were and i knew what they were .  something had to reach out to get materials for junior to make parts for itself  something had to snake out for the telephone .  i picked up the front panel and looked at it again .  there were two circular bits of metal cut out and hinged so that they could swing forward and leave a hole for something to come through .   i poked a finger through one and held it up for cliff to see  and said   i didn t put this in either .    mary ann was looking over my shoulder now  and without warning she reached out .  i was wiping my fingers with a paper towel to get off the dust and grease and didn t have time to stop her .  i should have known mary ann  though  she s always so anxious to help .   anyway  she reached in to touch one of the   well  we might as well say it   tentacles .  i don t know if she actually touched them or not .  later on she claimed she hadn t .  but anyway  what happened then was that she let out a little yell and suddenly sat down and began rubbing her arm .    the same one   she whimpered .   first you  and then that .    i helped her up .   it must have been a loose connection  mary ann .  i m sorry  but i told you     cliff said   nuts .  that was no loose connection .  junior s just protecting himself .    i had thought the same thing  myself .  i had thought lots of things .  junior was a new kind of machine .  even the mathematics that controlled it were different from anything anybody had worked with before .  maybe it had something no machine previously had ever had .  maybe it felt a desire to stay alive and grow .  maybe it would have a desire to make more machines until there were millions of them all over the earth  fighting with human beings for control .   i opened my mouth and cliff must have known what i was going to say  because he yelled   no .  no  don t say it .    but i couldn t stop myself .  it just came out and i said   well  look  let s disconnect junior   what s the matter .    cliff said bitterly   because he s listening to what we say  you jackass .  he heard about the blowtorch  didn t he .  i was going to sneak up behind it  but now it will probably electrocute me if i try .    mary ann was still brushing at the back of her dress and saying how dirty the floor was  even though i kept telling her i had nothing to do with that .  i mean  it s the janitor that makes the mud .   anyway  she said   why don t you put on rubber gloves and yank the cord out .    i could see cliff was trying to think of reasons why that wouldn t work .  he didn t think of any  so he put on the rubber gloves and walked towards junior .   i yelled   watch out .    it was a stupid thing to say .  he had to watch out  he had no choice .  one of the tentacles moved and there was no doubt what they were now .  it whirled out and drew a line between cliff and the power cable .  it remained there  vibrating a little with its six finger tendrils splayed out .  tubes inside junior were beginning to glow .  cliff didn t try to go past that tentacle .  he backed way and after a while  it spiraled inward again .  he took off his rubber gloves .    bill   he said   we re not going to get anywhere .  that s a smarter gadget than we dreamed we could make .  it was smart enough to use my voice as a model when it built its diaphragm .  it may become smart enough to learn how to   he looked over his shoulder  and whispered   how to generate its own power and become self contained .    bill  we ve got to stop it  or someday someone will telephone the planet earth and get the answer   honest  boss  there s nobody here anywhere but us complicated thinking machines  .     let s get in the police   i said .  we ll explain .  a grenade  or something     cliff snook his head   we can t have anyone else find out .  they ll build other juniors and it looks like we don t have enough answers for that kind of a project after all .     then what do we do .     i don t know .    i felt a sharp blow on my chest .  i looked down and it was mary ann  getting ready to spit fire .  she said   look  lunkhead  if we ve got a date  we ve got one  and if we haven t  we haven t .  make up your mind .    i said   now  mary ann     she said   answer me .  i never heard such a ridiculous thing .  here i get dressed to go to a play  and you take me to a dirty laboratory with a foolish machine and spend the rest of the evening twiddling dials .     mary ann  i m not     she wasn t listening  she was talking .  i wish i could remember what she said after that .  or maybe i don t  maybe it s just as well i can t remember  since none of it was very complimentary .  every once in a while i would manage a  but  mary ann    and each time it would get sucked under and swallowed up .   actually  as i said  she s a very gentle creature and it s only when she gets excited that she s ever talkative or unreasonable .  of course  with red hair  she feels she ought to get excited rather often .  that s my theory  anyway .  she just feels she has to live up to her red hair .   anyway  the next thing i do remember clearly is mary ann finishing with a stamp on my right foot and then turning to leave .  i ran after her  trying once again   but  mary ann     then cliff yelled at us .  generally  he doesn t pay any attention to us  but this time he was shouting .   why don t you ask her to marry you  you lunkhead .    mary ann stopped .  she was in the doorway by then but she didn t turn around .  i stopped too  and felt the words get thick and clogged up in my throat .  i couldn t even manage a  but  mary ann     cliff was yelling in the background .  i heard him as though he were a mile away .  he was shouting   i got it .  i got it .   over and over again .   then mary ann turned and she looked so beautiful   did i tell you that she s got green eyes with a touch of blue in them .  anyway she looked so beautiful that all the words in my throat jammed together very tightly and came out in that funny sound you make when you swallow .   she said   were you going to say something  bill .    well  cliff had put it in my head .  my voice was hoarse and i said   will you marry me  mary ann .    the minute i said it  i wished i hadn t  because i thought she would never speak to me again .  then two minutes after that i was glad i had  because she threw her arms around me and reached up to kiss me .  it was a while before i was quite clear what was happening  and then i began to kiss back .  this went on for quite a long time  until cliff s banging on my shoulder managed to attract my attention .   i turned and said  snappishly   what the devil do you want .   it was a little ungrateful .  after all  he had started this .   he said  look .    in his hand  he held the main lead that had connected junior to the power supply .   i had forgotten about junior  but now it came back .  i said   he s disconnected  then .     cold .     how did you do it .    he said   junior was so busy watching you and mary ann fight that i managed to sneak up on it .  mary ann put on one good show .    i didn t like that remark because mary ann is a very dignified and self contained sort of girl and doesn t put on  shows  .  however  i had too much in hand to take issue with him .   i said to mary ann   i don t have much to offer  mary ann  just a school teacher s salary .  now that we ve dismantled junior  there isn t even any chance of     mary ann said   i don t care  bill .  i just gave up on you  you lunkhead darling .  i ve tried practically everything      you ve been kicking my shins and stamping on my toes .     i d run out of everything else .  i was desperate .    the logic wasn t quite clear  but i didn t answer because i remembered about the show .  i looked at my watch and said   look  mary ann  if we hurry we can still make the second act .    she said   who wants to see the show .    so i kissed her some more  and we never did get to see the show at all .   there s only one thing that bothers me now .  mary ann and i are married  and we re perfectly happy .  i just had a promotion  i m an associate professor now .  cliff keeps working away at plans for building a controllable junior and he s making progress .   none of that s it .   you see  i talked to cliff the next evening  to tell him mary ann and i were going to marry and to thank him for giving me the idea .  and after staring at me for a minute  he swore he hadn t said it  he hadn t shouted for me to propose marriage .   of course  there was something else in the room with cliff s voice .   i keep worrying mary ann will find out .  she s the gentlest girl i know  but she has got red hair .  she can t help trying to live up to that  or have i said that already .   anyway  what will she say if she ever finds out that i didn t have the sense to propose till a machine told me to .     we all have our lovable eccentricities and i have a few that are all my own .   for instance  i hate nice days .  show me a day in which the temperature is just     and a light breeze has the lush foliage of june  or the just turning leaves of september  rustling with a soft murmur  a day in which there is a drowsy softness over the landscape  and a sweet freshness to the air  and a general peacefulness over the world  and i ll show you one unhappy fellow   namely  me .   there s a reason for it  a good one .   you don t think i m irrational  do you .   as i said in the preface to  sally   i am a compulsive writer .  that means that my idea of a pleasant time is to go up to my attic  sit at my electric typewriter  as i am doing right now   and bang away  watching the words take shape like magic before my eyes .  to minimize distractions  i keep the window shades down at all times and work exclusively by artificial light .   no one has any particular objection to this as long as we have the sleet of a typical new england late fall day darting through the air  or the blustering wind of a typical new england early spring day  or the leaden weight of gulf air that splats out over new england in the summer  or the dancing flakes of that third foot of snow that blankets new england in the winter .  everyone says   boy  you re lucky you don t have to go out in that weather .    and i agree with them .   but then comes a beautiful day in may june or september october and everyone says to me   what are you doing indoors on a day like this  you creep .   sometimes out of sheer indignation they pick me up and throw me out of the window so i can enjoy the nice day .   the niceness of being a writer  of course  is that you take all your frustrations and annoyances and spread them out on paper .  this prevents them from building up to dangerous levels and explains why writers in general are such lovable  normal people and are a joy to all who know them .   for instance  i wrote a novel in      which pictured a world in which everyone lived in underground cities  comfortably enclosed away from the open air .   people would say   how could you imagine such a nightmarish situation .    and i would answer in astonishment   what nightmarish situation .    but with me everything becomes a challenge .  having made my pitch in favor of enclosure  i wondered if i could reverse the situation .   so i wrote  it s such a beautiful day    and did such a good job at convincing myself  that very often these days  sometimes twice in one week  when i feel i ve put in a good day s work  i go out in the late afternoon and take a walk through the neighborhood .   but i don t know .  that thing you people have up there in the sky .  it s got quite a glare to it .   first appearance   star science fiction stories   .  copyright        by ballantine books  inc .     it s such a beautiful day    on april           the field modulator brake valve in the door belonging to mrs .  richard hanshaw depolarized for reasons unknown .  as a result  mrs .  hanshaw s day was completely upset and her son  richard  jr .   first developed his strange neurosis .   it was not the type of thing you would find listed as a neurosis in the usual textbooks and certainly young richard behaved  in most respects  just as a well brought up twelve year old in prosperous circumstances ought to behave .   and yet from april    on  richard hanshaw  jr .   could only with regret ever persuade himself to go through a door .   of all this  on april     mrs .  hanshaw had no premonition .  she woke in the morning  an ordinary morning  as her mek kano slithered gently into her room  with a cup of coffee on a small tray .  mrs .  hanshaw was planning a visit to new york in the afternoon and she had several things to do first that could not quite be trusted to a mekkano  so after one or two sips  she stepped out of bed .   the mekkano backed away  moving silently along the dia magnetic field that kept its oblong body half an inch above the floor  and moved back to the kitchen  where its simple computer was quite adequate to set the proper controls on the various kitchen appliances in order that an appropriate breakfast might be prepared .   mrs .  hanshaw  having bestowed the usual sentimental glance upon the cubograph of her dead husband  passed through the stages of her morning ritual with a certain contentment .  she could hear her son across the hall clattering through his  but she knew she need not interfere with him .  the mekkano was well adjusted to see to it  as a matter of course  that he was showered  that he had on a change of clothing  and that he would eat a nourishing breakfast .  the tergo shower she had had installed the year before made the morning wash and dry so quick and pleasant that  really  she felt certain dickie would wash even without supervision .   on a morning like this  when she was busy  it would certainly not be necessary for her to do more than deposit a casual peck on the boy s cheek before he left .  she heard the soft chime the mekkano sounded to indicate approaching school time and she floated  down the force lift to the lower floor  her hair style for the day only sketchily designed  as yet  in order to perform that motherly duty .   she found richard standing at the door  with his text reels and pocket projector dangling by their strap and a frown on his face .    say  mom   he said  looking up   i dialed the school s co ords but nothing happens .    she said  almost automatically   nonsense  dickie .  i never heard of such a thing .     well  you try .    mrs .  hanshaw tried a number of times .  strange  the school door was always set for general reception .  she tried other coordinates .  her friends  doors might not be set for reception  but there would be a signal at least  and then she could explain .   but nothing happened at all .  the door remained an inactive gray barrier despite all her manipulations .  it was obvious that the door was out of order   and only five months after its annual fall inspection by the company .   she was quite angry about it .   it would happen on a day when she had so much planned .  she thought petulantly of the fact that a month earlier she had decided against installing a subsidiary door on the ground that it was an unnecessary expense .  how was she to know that doors were getting to be so shoddy .   she stepped to the visiphone while the anger still burned in her and said to richard   you just go down the road  dickie  and use the williamsons  door .    ironically  in view of later developments  richard balked .   aw  gee  mom  i ll get dirty .  can t i stay home till the door is fixed .    and  as ironically  mrs .  hanshaw insisted .  with her finger on the combination board of the phone  she said   you won t get dirty if you put flexies on your shoes  and don t forget to brush yourself well before you go into their house .     but  golly     no back talk  dickie .  you ve got to be in school .  just let me see you walk out of here .  and quickly  or you ll be late .    the mekkano  an advanced model and very responsive  was already standing before richard with flexies in one appendage .   richard pulled the transparent plastic shields over his shoes and moved down the hall with visible reluctance .   i don t even know how to work this thing  mom .     you just push that button   mrs .  hanshaw called .   the red button .  where it says  for emergency use  .  and don t dawdle .  do you want the mekkano to go along with you .     gosh  no   he called back  morosely   what do you think i am .  a baby .  gosh .   his muttering was cut off by a slam .   with flying fingers  mrs .  hanshaw punched the appropriate combination on the phone board and thought of the things she intended saying to the company about this .   joe bloom  a reasonable young man  who had gone through technology school with added training in force field mechanics  was at the hanshaw residence in less than half an hour .  he was really quite competent  though mrs .  hanshaw regarded his youth with deep suspicion .   she opened the movable house panel when he first signaled and her sight of him was as he stood there  brushing at himself vigorously to remove the dust of the open air .  he took off his flexies and dropped them where he stood .  mrs .  hanshaw closed the house panel against the flash of raw sunlight that had entered .  she found herself irrationally hoping that the step by step trip from the public door had been an unpleasant one .  or perhaps that the public door itself had been out of order and the youth had had to lug his tools even farther than the necessary two hundred yards .  she wanted the company  or its representative at least  to suffer a bit .  it would teach them what broken doors meant .   but he seemed cheerful and unperturbed as he said   good morning  ma am .  i came to see about your door .     i m glad someone did   said mrs .  hanshaw  ungraciously .   my day is quite ruined .     sorry  ma am .  what seems to be the trouble .     it just won t work .  nothing at all happens when you adjust co ords   said mrs .  hanshaw .   there was no warning at all .  i had to send my son out to the neighbors through that   that thing .    she pointed to the entrance through which the repair man had come .   he smiled and spoke out of the conscious wisdom of his own specialized training in doors .   that s a door  too  ma am .  you don t give that kind a capital letter when you write it .  it s a hand door  sort of .  it used to be the only kind once .     well  at least it works .  my boy s had to go out in the dirt and germs .     it s not bad outside today  ma am   he said  with the connoisseur like air of one whose profession forced him into the open nearly every day .   sometimes it is real unpleasant .  but i guess you want i should fix this here door  ma am  so i ll get on with it .    he sat down on the floor  opened the large tool case he had brought in with him and in half a minute  by use of a point demagnetizer  he had the control panel removed and a set of intricate vitals exposed .   he whistled to himself as he placed the fine electrodes of the field analyzer on numerous points  studying the shifting needles on the dials .  mrs .  hanshaw watched him  arms folded .   finally  he said   well  here s something   and with a deft twist  he disengaged the brake valve .   he tapped it with a fingernail and said   this here brake valve is depolarized  ma am .  there s your whole trouble .   he ran his finger along the little pigeonholes in his tool case and liften out a duplicate of the object he had taken from the door mechanism .   these things just go all of a sudden .  can t predict it .    he put the control panel back and stood up .   it ll work now  ma am .    he punched a reference combination  blanked it  then punched another .  each time  the dull gray of the door gave way to a deep  velvety blackness .  he said   will you sign here  ma am .  and put down your charge number  too  please .  thank you  ma am .    he punched a new combination  that of his home factory  and with a polite touch of finger to forehead  he stepped through the door .  as his body entered the blackness  it cut off sharply .  less and less of him was visible and the tip of his tool case was the last thing that showed .  a second after he had passed through completely  the door turned back to dull gray .   half an hour later  when mrs .  hanshaw had finally completed her interrupted preparations and was fuming over the misfortune of the morning  the phone buzzed annoyingly and her real troubles began .   miss elizabeth robbins was distressed .  little dick hanshaw had always been a good pupil .  she hated to report him like this .  and yet  she told herself  his actions were certainly queer .  and she would talk to his mother  not to the principal .   she slipped out to the phone during the morning study period  leaving a student in charge .  she made her connection and found herself staring at mrs .  hanshaw s handsome and somewhat formidable head .   miss robbins quailed  but it was too late to turn back .  she said  diffidently   mrs .  hanshaw  i m miss robbins .   she ended on a rising note .   mrs .  hanshaw looked blank  then said   richard s teacher .   that  too  ended on a rising note .    that s right .  i called you  mrs .  hanshaw   miss robbins plunged right into it   to tell you that dick was quite late to school this morning .     he was .  but that couldn t be .  i saw him leave .    miss robbins looked astonished .  she said   you mean you saw him use the door .    mrs .  hanshaw said quickly   well  no .  our door was temporarily out of order .  i sent him to a neighbor and he used that door .     are you sure .     of course i m sure .  i wouldn t lie to you .     no  no  mrs .  hanshaw .  i wasn t implying that at all .  i meant are you sure he found the way to the neighbor .  he might have got lost .     ridiculous .  we have the proper maps  and i m sure richard knows the location of every house in district a   .   then  with the quiet pride of one who knows what is her due  she added   not that he ever needs to know  of course .  the co ords are all that are necessary at any time .    miss robbins  who came from a family that had always had to economize rigidly on the use of its doors  the price of power being what it was  and who had therefore run errands on foot until quite an advanced age  resented the pride .  she said  quite clearly   well  i m afraid  mrs .  hanshaw  that dick did not use the neighbor s door .  he was over an hour late to school and the condition of his flexies made it quite obvious that he tramped cross country .  they were muddy .     muddy .   mrs .  hanshaw repeated the emphasis on the word .   what did he say .  what was his excuse .    miss robbins couldn t help but feel a little glad at the discomfiture of the other woman .  she said   he wouldn t talk about it .  frankly  mrs .  hanshaw  he seems ill .  that s why i called you .  perhaps you might want to have a doctor look at him .     is he running a temperature .   the mother s voice went shrill .    oh  no .  i don t mean physically ill .  it s just his attitude and the look in his eyes .   she hesitated  then said with every attempt at delicacy   i thought perhaps a routine checkup with a psychic probe     she didn t finish .  mrs .  hanshaw  in a chilled voice and with what was as close to a snort as her breeding would permit  said   are you implying that richard is neurotic .     oh  no  mrs .  hanshaw  but      it certainly sounded so .  the idea .  he has always been per fectly healthy .  i ll take this up with him when he gets home .  i m sure there s a perfectly normal explanation which he ll give me   the connection broke abruptly  and miss robbins felt hurt and uncommonly foolish .  after all she had only tried to help  to fulfill what she considered an obligation to her students .    she hurried back to the classroom with a glance at the metal face of the wall clock .  the study period was drawing to an end .  english composition next .   but her mind wasn t completely on english composition .  automatically  she called the students to have them read selections from their literary creations .  and occasionally she punched one of those selections on tape and ran it through the small vocalizer to show the students how english should be read .   the vocalizer s mechanical voice  as always  dripped perfection  but  again as always  lacked character .  sometimes  she wondered if it was wise to try to train the students into a speech that was divorced from individuality and geared only to a mass average accent and intonation .   today  however  she had no thought for that .  it was richard hanshaw she watched .  he sat quietly in his seat  quite obviously indifferent to his surroundings .  he was lost deep in himself and just not the same boy he had been .  it was obvious to her that he had had some unusual experience that morning and  really  she was right to call his mother  although perhaps she ought not to have made the remark about the probe .  still it was quite the thing these days .  all sorts of people got probed .  there wasn t any disgrace attached to it .  or there shouldn t be  anyway .   she called on richard  finally .  she had to call twice  before he responded and rose to his feet .   the general subject assigned had been   if you had your choice of traveling on some ancient vehicle  which would you choose  and why .   miss robbins tried to use the topic every semester .  it was a good one because it carried a sense of history with it .  it forced the youngster to think about the manner of living of people in past ages .   she listened while richard hanshaw read in a low voice .    if i had my choice of ancient vehicles   he said  pronouncing the  h  in vehicles   i would choose the stratoliner .  it travels slow like all vehicles but it is clean .  because it travels in the stratosphere  it must be all enclosed so that you are not likely to catch disease .  you can see the stars if it is night time almost as good as in a planetarium .  if you look down you can see the earth like a map or maybe see clouds    he went on for several hundred more words .   she said brightly when he had finished reading   it s pronounced vee ick ulls  richard .  no  h  .  accent on the first syllable .  and you don t say  travels slow  or  see good  .  what do you say  class .    there was a small chorus of responses and she went on  that s right .  now what is the difference between an adjective and an adverb .  who can tell me .    and so it went .  lunch passed .  some pupils stayed to eat  some went home .  richard stayed .  miss robbins noted that  as usually he didn t .   the afternoon passed  too  and then there was the final bell and the usual upsurging hum as twenty five boys and girls rattled their belongings together and took their leisurely place in line .       miss robbins clapped her hands together .   quickly  children .  come  zelda  take your place .     i dropped my tape punch  miss robbins   shrilled the girl  defensively .    well  pick it up  pick it up .  now children  be brisk  be brisk .    she pushed the button that slid a section of the wall into a recess and revealed the gray blankness of a large door .  it was not the usual door that the occasional student used in going home for lunch  but an advanced model that was one of the prides of this well to do private school .   in addition to its double width  it possessed a large and impressively gear filled  automatic serial finder  which was capable of adjusting the door for a number of different co ordinates at automatic intervals .   at the beginning of the semester  miss robbins always had to spend an afternoon with the mechanic  adjusting the device for the co ordinates of the home of the new class .  but then  thank goodness  it rarely needed attention for the remainder of the term .   the class lined up alphabetically  first girls  then boys .  the door went velvety black and hester adams waved her hand and stepped through .   by y y     the  bye  was cut off in the middle  as it almost always was .   the door went gray  then black again  and theresa cant rocchi went through .  gray  black  zelda charlowicz .  gray  black  patricia coombs .  gray  black  sara may evans .   the line grew smaller as the door swallowed them one by one  depositing each in her home .  of course  an occasional mother forgot to leave the house door on special reception at the appropriate time and then the school door remained gray .  automatically  after a minute long wait  the door went on to the next combination in line and the pupil in question had to wait till it was all over  after which a phone call to the forgetful parent would set things right .  this was always bad for the pupils involved  especially the sensitive ones who took seriously the implication that they were little thought of at home .  miss rob bins always tried to impress this on visiting parents  but it happened at least once every semester just the same .   the girls were all through now .  john abramowitz stepped through and then edwin byrne    of course  another trouble  and a more frequent one was the boy or girl who got into line out of place .  they would do it despite the teacher s sharpest watch  particularly at the beginning of the term when the proper order was less familiar to them .   when that happened  children would be popping into the wrong houses by the half dozen and would have to be sent back .  it always meant a mixup that took minutes to straighten out and parents were invariably irate .   miss robbins was suddenly aware that the line had stopped .  she spoke sharply to the boy at the head of the line .      step through  samuel .  what are you waiting for .    samuel jones raised a complacent countenance and said   it s not my combination  miss robbins .     well  whose it is .   she looked impatiently down the line of five remaining boys .  who was out of place .    it s dick hanshaw s  miss robbins .     where is he .    another boy answered  with the rather repulsive tone of self righteousness all children automatically assume in reporting the deviations of their friends to elders in authority   he went through the fire door  miss robbins .    what .    the schoolroom door had passed on to another combination and samuel jones passed through .  one by one  the rest followed .   miss robbins was alone in the classroom .  she stepped to the fire door .  it was a small affair  manually operated  and hidden behind a bend in the wall so that it would not break up the uniform structure of the room .   she opened it a crack .  it was there as a means of escape from the building in case of fire  a device which was enforced by an anachronistic law that did not take into account the modern methods of automatic fire fighting that all public buildings used .  there was nothing outside  but the   outside .  the sunlight was harsh and a dusty wind was blowing .   miss robbins closed the door .  she was glad she had called mrs .  hanshaw .  she had done her duty .  more than ever  it was obvious that something was wrong with richard .  she suppressed the impulse to phone again .   mrs .  hanshaw did not go to new york that day .  she remained home in a mixture of anxiety and an irrational anger  the latter directed against the impudent miss robbins .   some fifteen minutes before school s end  her anxiety drove her to the door .  last year she had had it equipped with an automatic device which activated it to the school s co ordinates at five of three and kept it so  barring manual adjustment  until richard arrived .   her eyes were fixed on the door s dismal gray  why couldn t an inactive force field be any other color  something more lively and cheerful .   and waited .  her hands felt cold as she squeezed them together .   the door turned black at the precise second but nothing happened .  the minutes passed and richard was late .  then quite late .  then very late .   it was a quarter of four and she was distracted .  normally  she would have phoned the school  but she couldn t  she couldn t .  not after that teacher had deliberately cast doubts on richard s mental well being .  how could she .   mrs .  hanshaw moved about restlessly  lighting a cigarette with fumbling fingers  then smudging it out .  could it be something quite normal .  could richard be staying after school for some reason .  surely he would have told her in advance .  a gleam of light struck her  he knew she was planning to go to new york and might not be back till late in the evening    no  he would surely have told her .  why fool herself .   her pride was breaking .  she would have to call the school  or even  she closed her eyes and teardrops squeezed through between the lashes  the police .   and when she opened her eyes  richard stood before her  eyes on the ground and his whole bearing that of someone waiting for a blow to fall .    hello  mom .    mrs .  hanshaw s anxiety transmitted itself instantly  in a manner known only to mothers  into anger .   where have you been  richard .    and then  before she could go further into the refrain concerning careless  unthinking sons and broken hearted mothers  she took note of his appearance in greater detail  and gasped in utter horror .   she said   you ve been in the open .    her son looked down at his dusty shoes  minus flexies   at the dirt marks that streaked his lower arms and at the small  but definite tear in his shirt  he said   gosh  mom  i just thought i d        and he faded out .   she said   was there anything wrong with the school door .     no  mom .     do you realize i ve been worried sick about you .   she waited vainly for an answer .   well  i ll talk to you afterward  young man .  first  you re taking a bath  and every stitch of your clothing is being thrown out .  mekkano .    but the mekkano had already reacted properly to the phrase  taking a bath  and was off to the bathoom in its silent glide .    you take your shoes off right here   said mrs .  hanshaw   then march after mekkano .    richard did as he was told with a resignation that placed him beyond futile protest .   mrs .  hanshaw picked up the soiled shoes between thumb and forefinger and dropped them down the disposal chute which hummed in faint dismay at the unexpected load .  she dusted her hands carefully on a tissue which she allowed to float down the chute after the shoes .   she did not join richard at dinner but let him eat in the worse than lack of company of the mekkano .  this  she thought  would be an active sign of her displeasure and would do more than any amount of scolding or punishment to make him realize that he had done wrong .  richard  she frequently told herself  was a sensitive boy .   but she went up to see him at bedtime .   she smiled at him and spoke softly .  she thought that would be the best way .  after all  he had been punished already .   she said   what happened today  dickie boy .   she had called him that when he was a baby and just the sound of the name softened her nearly to tears .   but he only looked away and his voice was stubborn and cold .   i just don t like to go through those darn doors  mom .     but why ever not .    he shuffled his hands over the filmy sheet  fresh  clean  antiseptic and  of course  disposable after each use  and said   i just don t like them .     but then how do you expect to go to school  dickie .     i ll get up early   he mumbled .    but there s nothing wrong with doors .     don t like  em .   he never once looked up at her .   she said  despairingly   oh  well  you have a good sleep and tomorrow morning you ll feel much better .    she kissed him and left the room  automatically passing her hand through the photo cell beam and in that manner dimming the room lights .   but she had trouble sleeping herself that night .  why should dickie dislike doors so suddenly .  they had never bothered him before .  to be sure  the door had broken down in the morning but that should make him appreciate them all the more .   dickie was behaving so unreasonably .   unreasonably .  that reminded her of miss robbins and her diagnosis and mrs .  hanshaw s soft jaw set in the darkness and privacy of her bedroom .  nonsense .  the boy was upset and a night s sleep was all the therapy he needed .   but the next morning when she arose  her son was not in the house .  the mekkano could not speak but it could answer questions with gestures of its appendages equivalent to a yes or no  and it did not take mrs .  hanshaw more than half a minute to ascertain that the boy had arisen thirty minutes earlier than usual  skimped his shower  and darted out of the house .   but not by way of the door .   out the other way   through the door .  small  d  .   mrs .  hanshaw s visiphone signaled genteelly at      p . m .  that day .  mrs .  hanshaw guessed the caller and having activated the receiver  saw that she had guessed correctly .  a quick glance in the mirror to see that she was properly calm after a day of abstracted concern and worry and then she keyed in her own transmission .    yes  miss robbins   she said coldly .   richard s teacher was a bit breathless .  she said   mrs .  hanshaw  richard has deliberately left through the fire door although i told him to use the regular door .  i do not know where he went .    mrs .  hanshaw said  carefully   he left to come home .    miss robbins looked dismayed   do you approve of this .    pale faced  mrs .  hanshaw set about putting the teacher in her place .   i don t think it is up to you to criticize .  if my son does not choose to use the door  it is his affair and mine .  i don t think there is any school ruling that would force him to use the door  is there .   her breathing quite plainly intimated that if there were she would see to it that it was changed .   miss robbins flushed and had time for one quick remark before contact was broken .  she said   i d have him probed .  i really would .    mrs .  hanshaw remained standing before the quartzinium plate  staring blindly at its blank face .  her sense of family placed her for a few moments quite firmly on richard s side .  why did he have to use the door if he chose not to .  and then she settled down to wait and pride battled with gnawing anxiety that something after all was wrong with richard .   he came home with a look of defiance on his face  but his mother  with a strenuous effort at self control  met him as though nothing were out of the ordinary .   for weeks  she followed that policy .  it s nothing  she told herself .  it s a vagary .  he ll grow out of it .   it grew into an almost normal state of affairs .  then  too  every once in a while  perhaps three days in a row  she would come down to breakfast to find richard waiting sullenly at the door  then using it when school time came .  she always refrained from commenting on the matter .   always  when he did that  and especially when he followed it up by arriving home via the door  her heart grew warm and she thought   well  it s over .   but always with the passing of one day  two or three  he would return like an addict to his drug and drift silently out by the door   small  d    before she woke .   and each time she thought despairingly of psychiatrists and probes  and each time the vision of miss robbins  low bred satisfaction at  possibly  learning of it  stopped her  although she was scarcely aware that that was the true motive .   meanwhile  she lived with it and made the best of it .  the mekkano was instructed to wait at the door   small  d    with a tergo kit and a change of clothing .  richard washed and changed without resistance .  his underthings  socks and flexies were disposable in any case  and mrs .  hanshaw bore uncomplainingly the expense of daily disposal of shirts .  trousers she finally allowed to go a week before disposal on condition of rigorous nightly cleansing .   one day she suggested that richard accompany her on a trip to new york .  it was more a vague desire to keep him in sight than part of any purposeful plan .  he did not object .  he was even happy .  he stepped right through the door  unconcerned .  he didn t hesitate .  he even lacked the look of resentment he wore on those mornings he used the door to go to school .   mrs .  hanshaw rejoiced .  this could be a way of weaning him back into door usage  and she racked her ingenuity for excuses to make trips with richard .  she even raised her power bill to quite unheard of heights by suggesting  and going through with  a trip to canton for the day in order to witness a chinese festival .   that was on a sunday  and the next morning richard marched directly to the hole in the wall he always used .  mrs .  hanshaw  having wakened particularly early  witnessed that .  for once  badgered past endurance  she called after him plaintively   why not the door  dickie .    he said  briefly   it s all right for canton   and stepped out of the house .   so that plan ended in failure .  and then  one day  richard came home soaking wet .  the mekkano hovered about him uncertainly and mrs .  hanshaw  just returned from a four hour visit with her sister in iowa  cried   richard hanshaw .    he said  hang dog fashion   it started raining .  all of a sudden  it started raining .    for a moment  the word didn t register with her .  her own school days and her studies of geography were twenty years in the past .  and then she remembered and caught the vision of water pouring recklessly and endlessly down from the sky   a mad cascade of water with no tap to turn off  no button to push  no contact to break .   she said   and you stayed out in it .    he said   well  gee  mom  i came home fast as i could .  i didn t know it was going to rain .    mrs .  hanshaw had nothing to say .  she was appalled and the sensation filled her too full for words to find a place .   two days later  richard found himself with a running nose  and a dry  scratchy throat .  mrs .  hanshaw had to admit that the virus of disease had found a lodging in her house  as though it were a miserable hovel of the iron age .   it was over that that her stubbornness and pride broke and she admitted to herself that  after all  richard had to have psychiatric help .   mrs .  hanshaw chose a psychiatrist with care .  her first impulse was to find one at a distance .  for a while  she considered stepping directly into the san francisco medical center and choosing one at random .   and then it occurred to her that by doing that she would become merely an anonymous consultant .  she would have no way of obtaining any greater consideration for herself than would be forthcoming to any public door user of the city slums .  now if she remained in her own community  her word would carry weight    she consulted the district map .  it was one of that excellent series prepared by doors  inc .   and distributed free of charge to their clients .  mrs .  hanshaw couldn t quite suppress that little thrill of civic pride as she unfolded the map .  it wasn t a fine print directory of door co ordinates only .  it was an actual map  with each house carefully located .   and why not .  district a   was a name of moment in the world  a badge of aristocracy .  it was the first community on the planet to have been established on a completely doored basis .  the first  the largest  the wealthiest  the best known .  it needed no factories  no stores .  it didn t even need roads .  each house was a little secluded castle  the door of which had entry anywhere the world over where other doors existed .   carefully  she followed down the keyed listing of the five thousand families of district a   .  she knew it included several psychiatrists .  the learned professions were well represented in a   .   doctor hamilton sloane was the second name she arrived at and her finger lingered upon the map .  his office was scarcely two miles from the hanshaw residence .  she liked his name .  the fact that he lived in a   was evidence of worth .  and he was a neighbor  practically a neighbor .  he would understand that it was a matter of urgency   and confidential .   firmly  she put in a call to his office to make an appointment .   doctor hamilton sloane was a comparatively young man  not quite forty .  he was of good family and he had indeed heard of mrs .  hanshaw .   he listened to her quietly and then said   and this all began with the door breakdown .     that s right  doctor .     does he show any fear of the doors .     of course not .  what an idea .   she was plainly startled .    it s possible  mrs .  hanshaw  it s possible .  after all  when you stop to think of how a door works it is rather a frightening thing  really .  you step into a door  and for an instant your atoms are converted into field energies  transmitted to another part of space and reconverted into matter .  for that instant you re not alive .     i m sure no one thinks of such things .     but your son may .  he witnessed the breakdown of the door .  he may be saying to himself   what if the door breaks down just as i m half way through .      but that s nonsense .  he still uses the door .  he s even been to canton with me  canton  china .  and as i told you  he uses it for school about once or twice a week .     freely .  cheerfully .     well   said mrs .  hanshaw  reluctantly   he does seem a bit put out by it .  but really  doctor  there isn t much use talking about it  is there .  if you would do a quick probe  see where the trouble was   and she finished on a bright note   why  that would be all .  i m sure it s quite a minor thing .    dr .  sloane sighed .  he detested the word  probe  and there was scarcely any word he heard oftener .    mrs .  hanshaw   he said patiently   there is no such thing as a quick probe .  now i know the mag strips are full of it and it s a rage in some circles  but it s much overrated .     are you serious .     quite .  the probe is very complicated and the theory is that it traces mental circuits .  you see  the cells of the brains are interconnected in a large variety of ways .  some of those interconnected paths are more used than others .  they represent habits of thought  both conscious and unconscious .  theory has it that these paths in any given brain can be used to diagnose mental ills early and with certainty .     well  then .     but subjection to the probe is quite a fearful thing  especially to a child .  it s a traumatic experience .  it takes over an hour .  and even then  the results must be sent to the central psychoanalytical bureau for analysis  and that could take weeks .  and on top of all that  mrs .  hanshaw  there are many psychiatrists who think the theory of probe analysis to be most uncertain .    mrs .  hanshaw compressed her lips .   you mean nothing can be done .    dr .  sloane smiled .   not at all .  there were psychiatrists for centuries before there were probes .  i suggest that you let me talk to the boy .     talk to him .  is that all .     i ll come to you for background information when necessary  but the essential thing  i think  is to talk to the boy .     really  dr .  sloane  i doubt if he ll discuss the matter with you .  he won t talk to me about it and i m his mother .     that often happens   the psychiatrist assured her .   a child will sometimes talk more readily to a stranger .  in any case  i cannot take the case otherwise .    mrs .  hanshaw rose  not at all pleased .   when can you come  doctor .     what about this coming saturday .  the boy won t be in school .  will you be busy .     we will be ready .    she made a dignified exit .  dr .  sloane accompanied her through the small reception room to his office door and waited while she punched the co ordinates of her house .  he watched her pass through .  she became a half woman  a quarter woman  an isolated elbow and foot  a nothing .   it was frightening .   did a door ever break down during passage  leaving half a body here and half there .  he had never heard of such a case  but he imagined it could happen .   he returned to his desk and looked up the time of his next appointment .  it was obvious to him that mrs .  hanshaw was annoyed and disappointed at not having arranged for a psychic probe treatment .   why  for god s sake .  why should a thing like the probe  an obvious piece of quackery in his own opinion  get such a hold on the general public .  it must be part of this general trend toward machines .  anything man can do  machines can do better .  machines .  more machines .  machines for anything and everything  .  o tempora .  o mores .   oh  hell .   his resentment of the probe was beginning to bother him .  was it fear of technological unemployment  a basic insecurity on his part  a mechanophobia  if that was the word    he made a mental note to discuss this with his own analyst .   dr .  sloane had to feel his way .  the boy wasn t a patient who had come to him  more or less anxious to talk  more or less anxious to be helped .   under the circumstances it would have been best to keep his first meeting with richard short and noncommittal .  it would have been sufficient merely to establish himself as something less than a total stranger .  the next time he would be someone richard had seen before .  the time after he would be an acquaintance  and after that a friend of the family .   unfortunately  mrs .  hanshaw was not likely  to accept a long drawn out process .  she would go searching for a probe and  of course  she would find it .   and harm the boy .  he was certain of that .   it was for that reason he felt he must sacrifice a little of the proper caution and risk a small crisis .   an uncomfortable ten minutes had passed when he decided he must try .  mrs .  hanshaw was smiling in a rather rigid way  eyeing him narrowly  as though she expected verbal magic from him .  richard wriggled in his seat  unresponsive to dr .  sloane s tentative comments  overcome with boredom and unable not to show it .   dr .  sloane said  with casual suddenness   would you like to take a walk with me  richard .    the boy s eyes widened and he stopped wriggling .  he looked directly at dr .  sloane .   a walk  sir .     i mean  outside .     do you go   outside .     sometimes .  when i feel like it .    richard was on his feet  holding down a squirming eagerness .   i didn t think anyone did .     i do .  and i like company .    the boy sat down  uncertainly .   mom .      mrs .  hanshaw had stiffened in her seat  her compressed lips radiating horror  but she managed to say   why certainly  dickie .  but watch yourself .    and she managed a quick and baleful glare at dr .  sloane .   in one respect  dr .  sloane had lied .  he did not go outside  sometimes  .  he hadn t been in the open since early college days .  true  he had been athletically inclined  still was to some extent  but in his time the indoor ultra violet chambers  swimming pools and tennis courts had flourished .  for those with the price  they were much more satisfactory than the outdoor equivalents  open to the elements as they were  could possibly be .  there was no occasion to go outside .   so there was a crawling sensation about his skin when he felt wind touch it  and he put down his flexied shoes on bare grass with a gingerly movement .    hey  look at that .   richard was quite different now  laughing  his reserve broken down .   dr .  sloane had time only to catch a flash of blue that ended in a tree .  leaves rustled and he lost it .    what was it .     a bird   said richard .   a blue kind of bird .    dr .  sloane looked about him in amazement .  the hanshaw residence was on a rise of ground  and he could see for miles .  the area was only lightly wooded and between clumps of trees  grass gleamed brightly in the sunlight .   colors set in deeper green made red and yellow patterns .  they were flowers .  from the books he had viewed in the course of his lifetime and from the old video shows  he had learned enough so that all this had an eerie sort of familiarity .   and yet the grass was so trim  the flowers so patterned .  dimly  he realized he had been expecting something wilder .  he said   who takes care of all this .    richard shrugged .   i dunno .  maybe the mekkanos do it .     mekkanos .     there s loads of them around .  sometimes they got a sort of atomic knife they hold near the ground .  it cuts the grass .  and they re always fooling around with the flowers and things .  there s one of them over there .    it was a small object  half a mile away .  its metal skin cast back highlights as it moved slowly over the gleaming meadow  engaged in some sort of activity that dr .  sloane could not identify .   dr .  sloane was astonished .  here it was a perverse sort of estheticism  a kind of conspicuous consumption     what s that .   he asked suddenly .   richard looked .  he said   that s a house .  belongs to the froehlichs .  co ordinates  a            .  that little pointy building over there is the public door .    dr .  sloane was staring at the house .  was that what it looked like from the outside .  somehow he had imagined something much more cubic  and taller .    come along   shouted richard  running ahead .   dr .  sloane followed more sedately .   do you know all the houses about here .     just about .     where is a            .   it was his own house  of course .   richard looked about .   let s see .  oh  sure  i know where it is   you see that water there .     water .   dr .  sloane made out a line of silver curving across the green .    sure .  real water .  just sort of running over rocks and things .  it keeps running all the time .  you can get across it if you step on the rocks .  it s called a river .    more like a creek  thought dr .  sloane .  he had studied geography  of course  but what passed for the subject these days was really economic and cultural geography .  physical geography was almost an extinct science except among specialists .  still  he knew what rivers and creeks were  in a theoretical sort of way .   richard was still talking .   well  just past the river  over that hill with the big clump of trees and down the other side a way is a             .  it s a light green house with a white roof .     it is .   dr .  sloane was genuinely astonished .  he hadn t known it was green .   some small animal disturbed the grass in its anxiety to avoid the oncoming feet .  richard looked after it and shrugged .   you can t catch them .  i tried .    a butterfly flitted past  a wavering bit of yellow .  dr .  sloane s eyes followed it .   there was a low hum that lay over the fields  interspersed with an occasional harsh  calling sound  a rattle  a twittering  a chatter that rose  then fell .  as his ear accustomed itself to listening  dr .  sloane heard a thousand sounds  and none were man made .   a shadow fell upon the scene  advancing toward him  covering him .  it was suddenly cooler and he looked upward  startled .   richard said   it s just a cloud .  it ll go away in a minute  look at these flowers .  they re the kind that smell .    they were several hundred yards from the hanshaw residence .  the cloud passed and the sun shone once more .  dr .  sloane looked back and was appalled at the distance they had covered .  if they moved out of sight of the house and if richard ran off  would he be able to find his way back .   he pushed the thought away impatiently and looked out toward the line of water  nearer now  and past it to where his own house must be .  he thought wonderingly  light green .   he said   you must be quite an explorer .    richard said  with a shy pride   when i go to school and come back  i always try to use a different route and see new things .     but you don t go outside every morning  do you .  sometimes you use the doors  i imagine .     oh  sure .     why is that  richard .   somehow  dr .  sloane felt there might be significance in that point .   but richard quashed him .  with his eyebrows up and a look of astonishment on his face  he said   well  gosh  some mornings it rains and i have to use the door .  i hate that  but what can you do .  about two weeks ago  i got caught in the rain and i    he looked about him automatically  and his voice sank to a whisper   caught a cold  and wasn t mom upset  though .    dr .  sloane sighed .   shall we go back now .    there was a quick disappointment on richard s face .   aw  what for .     you remind me that your mother must be waiting for us .     i guess so .   the boy turned reluctantly .   they walked slowly back .  richard was saying  chattily   i wrote a composition at school once about how if i could go on some ancient vehicles   he pronounced it with exaggerated care   i d go in a stratoliner and look at stars and clouds and things .  oh  boy  i was sure nuts .     you d pick something else now .     you bet .  i d go in an aut m bile  real show .  then i d see everything there was .    mrs .  hanshaw seemed troubled  uncertain .   you don t think it s abnormal  then  doctor .     unusual  perhaps  but not abnormal .  he likes the outside .     but how can he .  it s so dirty  so unpleasant .     that s a matter of individual taste .  a hundred years ago our ancestors were all outside most of the time .  even today  i dare say there are a million africans who have never seen a door .     but richard s always been taught to behave himself the way a decent person in district a   is supposed to behave   said mrs .  hanshaw  fiercely .   not like an african or   or an ancestor .     that may be part of the  . trouble  mrs .  hanshaw .  he feels this urge to go outside and yet he feels it to be wrong .  he s ashamed to talk about it to you or to his teacher .  it forces him into sullen retreat and it could eventually be dangerous .     then how can we persuade him to stop .    dr .  sloane said   don t try .  channel the activity instead .  the day your door broke down  he was forced outside  found he liked it  and that set a pattern .  he used the trip to school and back as an excuse to repeat that first exciting experience .  now suppose you agree to let him out of the house for two hours on saturdays and sundays .  suppose he gets it through his head that after all he can go outside without necessarily having to go anywhere in the process .  don t you think he ll be willing to use the door to go to school and back thereafter .  and don t you think that will stop the trouble he s now having with his teacher and probably with his fellow pupils .     but then will matters remain so .  must they .  won t he ever be normal again .    dr .  sloane rose to his feet .   mrs .  hanshaw  he s as normal as need be right now .  right now  he s tasting the joys of the forbidden .  if you co operate with him  show that you don t disapprove  it will lose some of its attraction right there .  then  as he grows older  he will become more aware of the expectations and demands of society .  he will learn to conform .  after all  there is a little of the rebel in all of us  but it generally dies down as we grow old and tired .  unless  that is  it is unreasonably suppressed and allowed to build up pressure .  don t do that .  richard will be all right .    he walked to the door .   mrs .  hanshaw said   and you don t think a probe will be necessary  doctor .    he turned and said vehemently   no  definitely not .  there is nothing about the boy that requires it .  understand .  nothing .    his fingers hesitated an inch from the combination board and the expression on his face grew lowering .    what s the matter  dr .  sloane .   asked mrs .  hanshaw .   but he didn t hear her because he was thinking of the door and the psychic probe and all the rising  choking tide of machinery .  there is a little of the rebel in all of us  he thought .   so he said in a soft voice  as his hand fell away from the board and his feet turned away from the door   you know  it s such a beautiful day that i think i ll walk .      surprises work both ways  i explained in my introduction to  nightfall  that its success had been completely unexpected .  well  in the case of  strikebreaker   i thought i had a blockbuster .  it seemed to me to be fresh and original  i felt it contained a stirring sociological theme  with lots of meaning  and with considerable pathos .  yet  as nearly as i can make out  it dropped silently into the sea of audience reaction without as much as marking out a single circular ripple on its surface .   but i can be stubborn about such things .  if i like a story  i like it  and i include it here to give the audience a second chance .   this is one of those stories where i can remember the exact occasion that put it into my mind .  it involved one of my periodic trips to new york which have  more and more  become a kind of highlight to my life .  they are the only occasions on which i can stop writing for as much as three or four days at a time without feeling either guilty or restless .   naturally  anything that would tend to interfere with one of my trips would ruffle my otherwise imperturbable sang froid .  actually  i would throw a fit .  it was bad enough when something enormous would get in my way   a hurricane or a blizzard  for instance .  but a subway strike .  and not of all the subway employees  but only a few key men  say thirty five .  they would stall the entire subway and  with that  the entire city .  and if the strike came to pass  i could scarcely venture into a stalled city .    where will this all end .   i apostrophized the heavens in my best tragical manner  one fist raised high and the other clenched in my hair .   a mere handful of men can paralyze an entire megalopolis .  where will it end .    my gesture remained frozen as  in thought  i carried the situation to its logical extreme .  i carefully unhooked the gesture  went upstairs  and wrote  strikebreaker .    the happy ending is that the threatened strike did not come to pass  and i went to new york .   one more point about this story .  it represents my personal record for stupid title changes .  the editor of the magazine in which this story first appeared was robert w .  lowndes  as sweet and as erudite a man as i have ever known .  he had nothing to do with it .  some idiot in the higher echelons decided to call the story  male strikebreaker  .   why  male  .  what possible addition to the sense of the title can be made by that adjective .  what illumination .  what improvement .  heavens  i can understand  though not approve  a ridiculous title change which the publisher felt would imply something salacious and thus increase sales  but the modified title doesn t even do that .   oh  well    i ll just change it back .   first appearance   the original science fiction stories  january       under the title  male strikebreaker  .  copyright        by columbia publications  inc .     strikebreaker    elvis blei rubbed his plump hands and said   self containment is the word .   he smiled uneasily as he helped steven lamorak of earth to a light .  there was uneasiness all over his smooth face with its small wide set eyes .   lamorak puffed smoke appreciatively and crossed his lanky legs .   his hair was powdered with gray and he had a large and powerful jawbone .   home grown .   he asked  staring critically at the cigarette .  he tried to hide his own disturbance at the other s tension .    quite   said blei .    i wonder   said lamorak   that you have room on your small world for such luxuries .     lamorak thought of his first view of elsevere from the spaceship visiplate .  it was a jagged  airless planetoid  some hundred miles in diameter   just a dust gray rough hewn rock  glimmering dully in the light of its sun              miles distant .  it was the only object more than a mile in diameter that circled that sun  and now men had burrowed into that miniature world and constructed a society in it .  and he himself  as a sociologist  had come to study the world and see how humanity had made itself fit into that queerly specialized niche .    blei s polite fixed smile expanded a hair .  he said   we are not a small world  dr .  lamorak  you judge us by two dimensional standards .  the surface area of elsevere is only three quarters that of the state of new york  but that s irrelevant .  remember  we can occupy  if we wish  the entire interior of elsevere .  a sphere of    miles radius has a volume of well over half a million cubic miles .  if all of elsevere were occupied by levels    feet apart  the total surface area within the planetoid would be            square miles  and that is equal to the total land area of earth .  and none of these square miles  doctor  would be unproductive .    lamorak said   good lord   and stared blankly for a moment .   yes  of course you re right .  strange i never thought of it that way .  but then  elsevere is the only thoroughly exploited planetoid world in the galaxy  the rest of us simply can t get away from thinking of two dimensional surfaces  as you pointed out .  well  i m more than ever glad that your council has been so cooperative as to give me a free hand in this investigation of mine .    blei nodded conclusively at that .   lamorak frowned slightly and thought  he acts for all the world as though he wished i had not come .  something s wrong .   blei said   of course  you understand that we are actually much smaller than we could be  only minor portions of elsevere have as yet been hollowed out and occupied .  nor are we particularly anxious to expand  except very slowly .  to a certain extent we are limited by the capacity of our pseudo gravity engines and solar energy converters .     i understand .  but tell me  councillor blei   as a matter of personal curiosity  and not because it is of prime importance to my project   could i view some of your farming and herding levels first .  i am fascinated by the thought of fields of wheat and herds of cattle inside a planetoid .     you ll find the cattle small by your standards  doctor  and we don t have much wheat .  we grow yeast to a much greater extent .  but there will be some wheat to show you .  some cotton and tobacco  too .  even fruit trees .     wonderful .  as you say  self containment .  you recirculate everything  i imagine .    lamorak s sharp eyes did not miss the fact that this last remark twinged blei .  the elseverian s eyes narrowed to slits that hid his expression .   he said   we must recirculate  yes .  air  water  food  minerals  everything that is used up   must be restored to its original state  waste products are reconverted to raw materials .  all that is needed is energy  and we have enough of that .  we don t manage with one hundred per cent efficiency  of course  there is a certain seepage .  we import a small amount of water each year  and if our needs grow  we may have to import some coal and oxygen .    lamorak said   when can we start our tour  councillor blei .    blei s smile lost some of its negligible warmth .   as soon as we can  doctor .  there are some routine matters that must be arranged .    lamorak nodded  and having finished his cigarette  stubbed it out .   routine matters .  there was none of this hesitancy during the preliminary correspondence .  elsevere had seemed proud that its unique planetoid existence had attracted the attention of the galaxy .   he said   i realize i would be a disturbing influence in a tightly knit society   and watched grimly as blei leaped at the explanation and made it his own .    yes   said blei   we feel marked off from the rest of the galaxy .  we have our own customs .  each individual elseverian fits into a comfortable niche .  the appearance of a stranger without fixed caste is unsettling .     the caste system does involve a certain inflexibility .     granted   said blei quickly   but there is also a certain self assurance .  we have firm rules of intermarriage and rigid inheritance of occupation .  each man  woman and child knows his place  accepts it  and is accepted in it  we have virtually no neurosis  or mental illness .     and are there no misfits .   asked lamorak .   blei shaped his mouth as though to say no  then clamped it suddenly shut  biting the word into silence  a frown deepened on his forehead .  he said  at length   i will arrange for the tour  doctor .  meanwhile  i imagine you would welcome a chance to freshen up and to sleep .    they rose together and left the room  blei politely motioning the earthman to precede him out the door .   lamorak felt oppressed by the vague feeling of crisis that had pervaded his discussion with blei .   the newspaper reinforced that feeling .  he read it carefully before getting into bed  with what was at first merely a clinical interest .  it was an eight page tabloid of synthetic paper .  one quarter of its items consisted of  personals   births  marriages  deaths  record quotas  expanding habitable volume  not area .  three dimensions .   .  the remainder included scholarly essays  educational material  and fiction .  of news  in the sense to which lamorak was accustomed  there was virtually nothing .   one item only could be so considered and that was chilling in its incompleteness .   it said  under a small headline  demands unchanged  there has been no change in his attitude of yesterday .  the chief councillor  after a second interview  announced that his demands remain completely unreasonable and cannot be met under any circumstances .   then  in parenthesis  and in different type  there was the statement  the editors of this paper agree that elsevere cannot and will not jump to his whistle  come what may .   lamorak read it over three times .  his attitude .  his demands .  his whistle .   whose .   he slept uneasily  that night .   he had no time for newspapers in the days that followed  but spasmodically  the matter returned to his thoughts .   blei  who remained his guide and companion for most of the tour  grew ever more withdrawn .   on the third day  quite artificially clock set in an earthlike twenty four hour pattern   blei stopped at one point  and said   now this level is devoted entirely to chemical industries .  that section is not important     but he turned away a shade too rapidly and lamorak seized his arm .   what are the products of that section .     fertilizers .  certain organics   said blei stiffly .   lamorak held him back  looking for what sight blei might be evading .  his gaze swept over the close by horizons of lined rock and the buildings squeezed and layered between the levels .   lamorak said .   isn t that a private residence there .    blei did not look in the indicated direction .   lamorak said   i think that s the largest one i ve seen yet .  why is it here on a factory level .   that alone made it noteworthy .  he had already seen that the levels on elsevere were divided rigidly among the residential  the agricultural and the industrial .   he looked back and called   councillor blei .    the councillor was walking away and lamorak pursued him with hasty steps .   is there something wrong  sir .    blei muttered   i am rude  i know .  i am sorry .  there are matters that prey on my mind    he kept up his rapid pace .    concerning his demands .    blei came to a full halt .   what do you know about that .     no more than i ve said .  i read that much in the newspaper .    blei muttered something to himself .   lamorak said   ragusnik .  what s that .    blei sighed heavily .   i suppose you ought to be told .  it s humiliating  deeply embarrassing .  the council thought that matters would certainly be arranged shortly and that your visit need not be interfered with  that you need not know or be concerned .  but it is almost a week now .  i don t know what will happen and  appearances notwithstanding  it might be best for you to leave .  no reason for an outworlder to risk death .    the earthman smiled incredulously .   risk death .  in this little world  so peaceful and busy .  i can t believe it .    the elseverian councillor said   i can explain .  i think it best i should .   he turned his head away .   as i told you  everything on elsevere must recirculate .  you understand that .     yes .     that includes   uh  human wastes .     i assumed so   said lamorak .    water is reclaimed from it by distillation and absorption .  what remains is converted into fertilizer for yeast use  some of it is used as a source of fine organics and other by products .  these factories you see are devoted to this .     well .   lamorak had experienced a certain difficulty in the drinking of water when he first landed on elsevere  because he had been realistic enough to know what it must be reclaimed from  but he had conquered the feeling easily enough .  even on earth  water was reclaimed by natural processes from all sorts of unpalatable substances .   blei  with increasing difficulty  said   igor ragusnik is the man who is in charge of the industrial processes immediately involving the wastes .  the position has been in his family since elsevere was first colonized .  one of the original settlers was mikhail ragusnik and he     he     was in charge of waste reclamation .     yes .  now that residence you singled out is the ragusnik residence  it is the best and most elaborate on the planetoid .  ragusnik gets many privileges the rest of us do not have  but  after all    passion entered the councillor s voice with great suddenness   we cannot speak to him .     what .     he demands full social equality .  he wants his children to mingle with ours  and our wives to visit   oh .   it was a groan of utter disgust .   lamorak thought of the newspaper item that could not even bring itself to mention ragusnik s name in print  or to say anything specific about his demands .  he said   i take it he s an outcast because of his job .     naturally .  human wastes and    words failed blei .  after a pause  he said more quietly   as an earthman  i suppose you don t understand .     as a sociologist  i think i do .   lamorak thought of the untouchables in ancient india  the ones who handled corpses .  he thought of the position of swineherds in ancient judea .   he went on   i gather elsevere will not give in to those demands .     never   said blei  energetically .   never .     and so .     ragusnik has threatened to cease operations .     go on strike  in other words .     yes .    would that be serious .     we have enough food and water to last quite a while  reclamation is not essential in that sense .  but the wastes would accumulate  they would infect the planetoid .  after generations of careful disease control  we have low natural resistance to germ diseases .  once an epidemic started   and one would   we would drop by the hundred .     is ragusnik aware of this .     yes  of course .     do you think he is likely to go through with his threat  then .     he is mad .  he has already stopped working  there has been no waste reclamation since the day before you landed .   blei s bulbous nose sniffed at the air as though it already caught the whiff of excrement .   lamorak sniffed mechanically at that  but smelled nothing .   blei said   so you see why it might be wise for you to leave .  we are humiliated  of course  to have to suggest it .    but lamorak said   wait  not just yet .  good lord  this is a matter of great interest to me professionally .  may i speak to the ragusnik .     on no account   said blei  alarmed .    but i would like to understand the situation .  the sociological conditions here are unique and not to be duplicated elsewhere .  in the name of science      how do you mean  speak .  would image reception do .     yes .     i will ask the council   muttered blei .   they sat about lamorak uneasily  their austere and dignified expressions badly marred with anxiety .  blei  seated in the midst of them  studiously avoided the earthman s eyes .   the chief councillor  gray haired  his face harshly wrinkled  his neck scrawny  said in a soft voice   if in any way you can persuade him  sir  out of your own convictions  we will welcome that .  in no case  however  are you to imply that we will  in any way  yield .    a gauzy curtain fell between the council and lamorak .  he could make out the individual councillors still  but now he turned sharply toward the receiver before him .  it glowed to life .   a head appeared in it  in natural color and with great realism .  a strong dark head  with massive chin faintly stubbled  and thick  red lips set into a firm horizontal line .   the image said  suspiciously   who are you .    lamorak said   my name is steven lamorak  i am an earth man .     an outworlder .     that s right .  i am visiting elsevere .  you are ragusnik .     igor ragusnik  at your service   said the image  mockingly .   except that there is no service and will be none until my family and i are treated like human beings .    lamorak said   do you realize the danger that elsevere is in .  the possibility of epidemic disease .     in twenty four hours  the situation can be made normal  if they allow me humanity .  the situation is theirs to correct .     you sound like an educated man  ragusnik .     so .     i am told you re denied of no material comforts .  you are housed and clothed and fed better than anyone on elsevere .  your children are the best educated .     granted .  but all by servo mechanism .  and motherless girl babies are sent us to care for until they grow to be our wives .  and they die young for loneliness .  why .   there was sudden passion in his voice .  why must we live in isolation as if we were all monsters  unfit for human beings to be near .  aren t we human beings like others  with the same needs and desires and feelings .  don t we perform an honorable and useful function   .    there was a rustling of sighs from behind lamorak .  ragusnik heard it  and raised his voice .   i see you of the council behind there .  answer me  isn t it an honorable and useful function .  it is your waste made into food for you .  is the man who purifies corruption worse than the man who produces it .    listen  councillors  i will not give in .  let all of elsevere die of disease  including myself and my son  if necessary   but i will not give in .  my family will be better dead of disease  than living as now .    lamorak interrupted .   you ve led this life since birth  haven t you .     and if i have .    surely you re used to it .     never .  resigned  perhaps .  my father was resigned  and i was resigned for a while  but i have watched my son  my only son  with no other little boy to play with .  my brother and i had each other  but my son will never have anyone  and i am no longer resigned .  i am through with elsevere and through with talking .    the receiver went dead .   the chief councillor s face had paled to an aged yellow .  he and blei were the only ones of the group left with lamorak .  the chief councillor said  the man is deranged  i do not know how to force him .    he had a glass of wine at his side  as he lifted it to his lips  he spilled a few drops that stained his white trousers with purple splotches .   lamorak said   are his demands so unreasonable .  why can t he be accepted into society .    there was momentary rage in blei s eyes .   a dealer in excrement .   then he shrugged .   you are from earth .    incongruously  lamorak thought of another unacceptable  one of the numerous classic creations of the medieval cartoonist  al capp .  the variously named  inside man at the skonk works .    he said   does ragusnik really deal with excrement .  i mean  is there physical contact .  surely  it is all handled by automatic machinery .     of course   said the chief councillor .    then exactly what is ragusnik s function .     he manually adjusts the various controls that assure the proper functioning of the machinery .  he shifts units to allow repairs to be made  he alters functional rates with the time of day  he varies end production with demand .   he added sadly   if we had the space to make the machinery ten times as complex  all this could be done automatically  but that would be such needless waste .     but even so   insisted lamorak   all ragusnik does he does simply by pressing buttons or closing contacts or things like that .     yes .     then his work is no different from any elseverian s .    blei said  stiffly   you don t understand .     and for that you will risk the death of your children .    we have no other choice   said blei .  there was enough agony in his voice to assure lamorak that the situation was torture for him  but that he had no other choice indeed .   lamorak shrugged in disgust .   then break the strike .  force him .     how .   said the chief councillor .   who would touch him or go near him .  and it we kill him by blasting from a distance  how will that help us .    lamorak said  thoughtfully   would you know how to run his machinery .    the chief councillor came to his feet .   i .   he howled .    i don t mean you   cried lamorak at once .   i used the pronoun in its indefinite sense .  could someone learn how to handle ragusnik s machinery .    slowly  the passion drained out of the chief councillor .   it is in the handbooks  i am certain   though i assure you i have never concerned myself with it .     then couldn t someone learn the procedure and substitute for ragusnik until the man gives in .    blei said   who would agree to do such a thing .  not i  under any circumstances .    lamorak thought fleetingly of earthly taboos that might be almost as strong .  he thought of cannibalism  incest  a pious man cursing god .  he said   but you must have made provision for vacancy in the ragusnik job .  suppose he died .     then his son would automatically succeed to his job  or his nearest other relative   said blei .    what if he had no adult relatives .  what if all his family died at once .     that has never happened  it will never happen .    the chief councillor added   if there were danger of it  we might  perhaps  place a baby or two with the ragusniks and have it raised to the profession .     ah .  and how would you choose that baby .     from among children of mothers who died in childbirth  as we choose the future ragusnik bride .     then choose a substitute ragusnik now  by lot   said lamorak .   the chief councillor said   no .  impossible .  how can you suggest that .  if we select a baby  that baby is brought up to the life  it knows no other .  at this point  it would be necessary to choose an adult and subject him to ragusnik hood .  no  dr .  lamorak  we are neither monsters nor abandoned brutes .    no use  thought lamorak helplessly .  no use  unless    he couldn t bring himself to face that unless just yet .   that night  lamorak slept scarcely at all .  ragusnik asked for only the basic elements of humanity .  but opposing that were thirty thousand elseverians who faced death .   the welfare of thirty thousand on one side  the just demands of one family on the other .  could one say that thirty thousand who would support such injustice deserved to die .  injustice by what standards .  earth s .  elsevere s .  and who was lamorak that he should judge .   and ragusnik .  he was willing to let thirty thousand die  including men and women who merely accepted a situation they had been taught to accept and could not change if they wished to .  and children who had nothing at all to do with it .   thirty thousand on one side  a single family on the other .   lamorak made his decision in something that was almost despair  in the morning he called the chief councillor .   he said   sir  if you can find a substitute  ragusnik will see that he has lost all chance to force a decision in his favor and will return to work .     there can be no substitute   sighed the chief councillor   i have explained that .     no substitute among the elseverians  but i am not an else verian  it doesn t matter to me .  i will substitute .    they were excited  much more excited than lamorak himself .  a dozen times they asked him if he was serious .   lamorak had not shaved  and he felt sick   certainly  i m serious .  and any time ragusnik acts like this  you can always import a substitute .  no other world has the taboo and there will always be plenty of temporary substitutes available if you pay enough .     he was betraying a brutally exploited man  and he knew it .  but he told himself desperately  except for ostracism  he s very well treated .  very well .    they gave him the handbooks and he spent six hours  reading and re reading .  there was no use asking questions .  none of the elseverians knew anything about the job  except for what was in the handbook .  and all seemed uncomfortable if the details were as much as mentioned .    maintain zero reading of galvanometer a   at all times during red signal of the lunge howler   read lamorak .   now what s a lunge howler .     there will be a sign   muttered blei  and the elseverians looked at each other hang dog and bent their heads to stare at their finger ends .   they left him long before he reached the small rooms that were the central headquarters of generations of working ragus niks  serving their world .  he had specific instructions concerning which turnings to take and what level to reach  but they hung back and let him proceed alone .   he went through the rooms painstakingly  identifying their instruments and controls  following the schematic diagrams in the handbook .   there s a lunge howler  he thought  with gloomy satisfaction .  the sign did indeed say so .  it had a semicircular face bitten into holes that were obviously designed to glow in separate colors .  why a  howler  then .   he didn t know .   somewhere  thought lamorak  somewhere wastes are accumulating  pushing against gears and exits  pipelines and stills  waiting to be handled in half a hundred ways .  now they just accumulate .   not without a tremor  he pulled the first switch as indicated by the handbook in its directions for  initiation  .  a gentle murmur of life made itself felt through the floors and walls .  he turned a knob and lights went on .   at each step  he consulted the handbook  though he knew it by heart  and with each step  the rooms brightened and the dial indicators sprang into motion and a humming grew louder .   somewhere deep in the factories  the accumulated wastes were being drawn into the proper channels .   a high pitched signal sounded and startled lamorak out of his painful concentration .  it was the communications signal and lamorak fumbled his receiver into action .  ragusnik s head showed  startled  then slowly  the incredulity and outright shock faded from his eyes .   that s how it is  then .     i m not an elseverian  ragusnik  i don t mind doing this .     but what business is it of yours .  why do you interfere .     i m on your side  ragusnik  but i must do this .       why  if you re on my side .  do they treat people on your world as they treat me here .     not any longer .  but even if you are right  there are thirty thousand people on elsevere to be considered .     they would have given in  you ve ruined my only chance .     they would not have given in .  and in a way  you ve won  they know now that you re dissatisfied .  until now  they never dreamed a ragusnik could be unhappy  that he could make trouble .     what if they know .  now all they need do is hire an out worlder anytime .    lamorak shook his head violently .  he had thought this through in these last bitter hours .   the fact that they know means that the elseverians will begin to think about you  some will begin to wonder if it s right to treat a human so .  and if outworlders are hired  they ll spread the word that this goes on upon elsevere and galactic public opinion will be in your favor .     and .     things will improve .  in your son s time  things will be much better .     in my son s time   said ragusnik  his cheeks sagging .   i might have had it now .  well  i lose .  i ll go back to the job .    lamorak felt an overwhelming relief .   if you ll come here now  sir  you may have your job and i ll consider it an honor to shake your hand .    ragusnik s head snapped up and filled with a gloomy pride .   you call me  sir  and offer to shake my hand .  go about your business  earthman  and leave me to my work  for i would not shake yours .    lamorak returned the way he had come  relieved that the crisis was over  and profoundly depressed  too .   he stopped in surprise when he found a section of corridor cordoned off  so he could not pa ss .  he looked about for alternate routes  then started at a magnified voice above his head .   dr .  lamorak  do you hear me .  this is councillor blei .    lamorak looked up .  the voice came over some sort of public address system  but he saw no sign of an outlet .   he called out   is anything wrong .  can you hear me .     i hear you .    instinctively  lamorak was shouting .   is anything wrong .  there seems to be a block here .  are there complications with ragusnik .     ragusnik has gone to work   came blei s voice .   the crisis is over  and you must make ready to leave .     leave .     leave elsevere  a ship is being made ready for you now .     but wait a bit .   lamorak was confused by this sudden leap of events .   i haven t completed my gathering of data .    blei s voice said   this cannot be helped .  you will be directed to the ship and your belongings will be sent after you by servo mechanisms .  we trust   we trust     something was becoming clear to lamorak .   you trust what .     we trust you will make no attempt to see or speak directly to any elseverian .  and of course we hope you will avoid embarrassment by not attempting to return to elsevere at any time in the future .  a colleague of yours would be welcome if further data concerning us is needed  .     i understand   said lamorak  tonelessly .  obviously  he had himself become a ragusnik .  he had handled the controls that in turn had handled the wastes  he was ostracized .  he was a corpse handler  a swineherd  an inside man at the skonk works .    . he said   good bye .    blei s voice said   before we direct you  dr .  lamorak   .  on behalf of the council of elsevere  i thank you for your help in this crisis .     you re welcome   said lamorak  bitterly .     in some ways  this story has the strangest background of any i ever wrote .  it is also the shortest story i ever wrote   only     words .  the two go together .   it came about this way .  on august             took part in a panel discussion on means of communicating science on wgbh  boston s educational tv station .  with me were john hansen  a technical writer of directions for using machinery  and david o .  woodbury  the well known science writer .   we all bemoaned the inadequacy of most science writing and technical writing and there was some comment on my prolificity .  with my usual modesty  i attributed my success entirely to an incredible fluency of ideas and a delightful facility in writing .  i stated incautiously that i could write a story anywhere  any time  under any conditions within reason .  i was instantly challenged to write one right then and there with the television cameras on me .   i accepted the challenge and began to write  taking for my theme the subject of discussion .  the other two did not try to make life easier for me  either .  they deliberately kept interrupting in order to drag me into their discussion and interrupt my  line of thought  and i was just vain enough to try to answer sensibly while i continued scribbling .   before that half hour program was over i had finished and read the story  which is why it is so short  by the way  and it was the one you see here as  insert knob a in hole b .   in his own introduction to the story  when it appeared in f  sf  mr .  boucher said he was printing it just as it was  i had sent him the handwritten script  after typing a copy for myself   even to the retention of its one grammatical error .   i have kept that error here  too .  it s yours for the finding .   i cheated  though .   would i lie to you .   the three of us were talking before the program started and somehow i got the idea they might ask me to write a story on the program .  so  just in case they did  i spent a few minutes before its start blocking out something .   consequently  when they asked me  i had it roughly in mind .  all i had to do was work out the details  write it down  and then read it .  after all  i had twenty minutes .   first appearance   the magazine of fantasy and science fiction  december      .            by fantasy house  inc .     insert knob a in hole b    dave woodbury and john hansen  grotesque in their spacesuits  supervised anxiously as the large crate swung slowly out and away from the freight ship and into the airlock .  with nearly a year of their hitch on space station a  behind them  they were understandably weary of filtration units that clanked  hydro ponic tubs that leaked  air generators that hummed constantly and stopped occasionally .    nothing works     woodbury would say mournfully   because everything is hand assembled by ourselves .     following directions   hansen would add   composed by an idiot .    there were undoubtedly grounds for complaint there .  the most expensive thing about a spaceship was the room allowed for freight so all equipment had to be sent across space disassembled and nested .  all equipment had to be assembled at the station itself with clumsy hands  inadequate tools and with blurred and ambiguous direction sheets for guidance .   painstakingly woodbury had written complaints to which hansen had added appropriate adjectives  and formal requests for relief of the situation had made its way back to earth .   and earth had responded .  a special robot had been designed  with a positronic brain crammed with the knowledge of how to assemble properly any disassembled machine in existence .   that robot was in the crate being unloaded now and wood bury was trembling as the airlock closed behind it .    first   he said   it overhauls the food assembler and adjusts the steak attachment knob so we can get it rare instead of burnt .    they entered the station and attacked the crate with dainty touches of the demoleculizer rods in order to make sure that not a precious metal atom of their special assembly robot was damaged .   the crate fell open .   and there within it were five hundred separate pieces   and one blurred and ambiguous direction sheet for assemblage .     i have frequently  rather to my own uneasy surprise  been accused of writing humorously .  oh  i try  i try  but only very cautiously  and for a long time i thought nobody noticed .   you see  there is no margin for error in humor .  you can try to write suspense and not quite hit the mark  and have a story that is only moderately suspenseful .  in analogous manner  you can have a story be only moderately romantic  moderately exciting  moderately eerie  even moderately science fictiony .   but what happens when you miss the mark in humor .  is the result moderately humorous .  of course not .  the not quite humorous remark  the not quite witty rejoinder  the not quite farcical episode are  respectively  dreary  stupid  and ridiculous .   well  with a target that is all bull s eye and no larger than a bull s eye at that  am i going to blaze away carelessly .  certainly not .  i m fantastically courageous  but i m not stupid .   so i have tried being funny only occasionally  and usually only gently and unobtrusively  as in  nobody here but        on the few occasions in which i tried to write a purely funny story  i wasn t completely satisfied .   mostly  therefore  i kept my stories grave and sober  as you can tell  .   yet  i never quite gave up  either .  one day  at the prodding of mr .  boucher  i tried my hand at a gilbert and sullivan parody and finally  in my own eyes  at any rate  i clicked without reservation .  i read the story over and laughed heartily .   that was it .  i had found my metier in humor .  all i had to do was to assume a very slightly exaggerated pseudo victorian style and i found i had no trouble at all in being funny .   did i enter a full fledged career as science fiction humorist at once .  not at all .  i kept the humor at the previous level and remained  for the most part  grave and sober .  that s still what i do best .   however  in the middle     s  i took to writing a series of articles for tv guide which are nothing but this kind of humor  and i love them .   i am sometimes taken to task  by the way  for saying  in my artless way  that i like my own material  but why shouldn t i .  is it conceivable that i would spend seventy hours a week on writing and related reading if i didn t like what i wrote .  come on .    by the way  a final word about  the up to date sorcerer    it is not essential to read gilbert and sullivan s the sorcerer first  but it would make my story funnier if you did  i think   and i would like to give it every break .   first appearance   the magazine of fantasy and science fiction  july      .            by mercury press  inc .     the up to date sorcerer    it always puzzled me that nicholas nitely  although a justice of the peace  was a bachelor .  the atmosphere of his profession  so to speak  seemed so conducive to matrimony that surely he could scarcely avoid the gentle bond of wedlock .   when i said as much over a gin and tonic at the club recently  he said   ah  but i had a narrow escape some time ago   and he sighed .    oh  really .     a fair young girl  sweet  intelligent  pure yet desperately ardent  and withal most alluring to the physical sense of even such an old fogy as myself .    i said   how did you come to let her go .     i had no choice .   he smiled gently at me and his smooth  ruddy complexion  his smooth gray hair  his smooth blue eyes  all combined to give him an expression of near saintliness .  he said   you see  it was really the fault of her fiance       ah  she was engaged to someone else .       and of professor wellington johns  who was  although an endocrinologist  by way of being an up to date sorcerer .  in fact  it was just that   he sighed  sipped at his drink  and turned on me the bland and cheerful face of one who is about to change the subject .   i said firmly   now  then  nitely  old man  you cannot leave it so .  i want to know about your beautiful girl   the flesh that got away .    he winced at the pun  one  i must admit  of my more abominable efforts  and settled down by ordering his glass refilled .   you understand   he said   i learned some of the details later  professor wellington johns had a large and prominent nose  two sincere eyes and a distinct talent for making clothes appear too large for him .  he said   my dear children  love is a matter of chemistry .    his dear children  who were really students of his  and not his children at all  were named alexander dexter and alice sanger .  they looked perfectly full of chemicals as they sat there holding hands .  together  their age amounted to perhaps     evenly split between them  and alexander said  fairly inevitably   vive la chemie .    professor johns smiled reprovingly .   or rather endocrinology .  hormones  after all  affect our emotions and it is not surprising that one should  specifically  stimulate that feeling we call love .     but that s so unromantic   murmured alice .   i m sure i don t need any .   she looked up at alexander with a yearning glance .    my dear   said the professor   your blood stream was crawling with it at that moment  as the saying is  fell in love .  its secretion had been stimulated by    for a moment he considered his words carefully  being a highly moral man    by some environ   mental factor involving your young man  and once the hormonal action had taken place  inertia carried you on .  i could duplicate the effect easily .     why  professor   said alice  with gentle affection .   it would be delightful to have you try   and she squeezed alexander s hand shyly .    i do not mean   said the professor  coughing to hide his embarrassment   that i would personally attempt to reproduce  or  rather  to duplicate   the conditions that created the natural secretion of the hormone .  i mean  instead  that i could inject the hormone itself by hypodermic or even by oral ingestion  since it is a steroid hormone .  i have  you see   and here he removed his glasses and polished them proudly   isolated and purified the hormone .    alexander sat erect .   professor .  and you have said nothing .     i must know more about it first .     do you mean to say   said alice  her lovely brown eyes shimmering with delight   that you can make people feel the wonderful delight and heaven surpassing tenderness of true love by means of a  .  .  .  a pill .    the professor said   i can indeed duplicate the emotion to which you refer in those rather cloying terms .    then why don t you .    alexander raised a protesting hand .   now  darling  your ardor leads you astray .  our own happiness and forthcoming nuptials make you forget certain facts of life .  if a married person were  by mistake  to accept this hormone     professor john said  with a trace of hauteur   let me explain right now that my hormone  or my amatogenic principle  as i call it     for he  in common with many practical scientists  enjoyed a proper score for the rarefied niceties of classical philology  .    call it a love philtre  professor   said alice  with a melting sigh .    my amatogenic cortical principle   said professor johns  sternly   has no effect on married individuals .  the hormone cannot work if inhibited by other factors  and being married is certainly a factor that inhibits love .     why  so i have heard   said alexander  gravely   but i intend to disprove that callous belief in the case of my own alice .    alexander   said alice .   my love .    the professor said   i mean that marriage inhibits extramarital love .    alexander said   why  it has come to my ears that sometimes it does not .    alice said  shocked   alexander .     only in rare instances  my dear  among those who have not gone to college .    the professor said   marriage may not inhibit a certain paltry sexual attraction  or tendencies toward minor trifling  but true love  as miss sanger expressed the emotion  is something which cannot blossom when the memory of a stern wife and various unattractive children hobbles the subconscious .     do you mean to say   said alexander   that if you were to feed your love philtre   beg pardon  your amatogenic principle   to a number of people indiscriminately  only the unmarried individuals would be affected .     that is right .  i have experimented on certain animals which  though not going through the conscious marriage rite  do form monogamous attachments .  those with the attachments already formed are not affected .     then  professor  i have a perfectly splendid idea .  tomorrow night is the night of the senior dance here at college .  there will be at least fifty couples present  mostly unmarried .  put your philtre in the punch .     what .  are you mad .    but alice had caught fire .   why  it s a heavenly idea  professor .  to think that all my friends will feel as i feel .  professor  you would be an angel from heaven .    but oh  alexander  do you suppose the feelings might be a trifle uncontrolled .  some of our college chums are a little wild and if  in the heat of the discovery of love  they should  well  kiss     professor johns said  indignantly   my dear miss sanger .  you must not allow your imagination to become overheated .  my hormone induces only those feelings which lead to marriage and not to the expression of anything that might be considered indecorous .     i m sorry   murmured alice  in confusion .   i should remember  professor  that you are the most highly moral man i know  excepting always dear alexander   and that no scientific discovery of yours could possibly lead to immorality .    she looked so woebegone that the professor forgave her at once .    then you ll do it  professor .   urged alexander .   after all  assuming there will be a sudden urge for mass marriage afterwards  i can take care of that by having nicholas nitely  an old and valued friend of the family  present on some pretext .  he is a justice of the peace and can easily arrange for such things as licenses and so on .     i could scarcely agree   said the professor  obviously weakening   to perform an experiment without the consent of those experimented upon .  it would be unethical .     but you would be bringing only joy to them .  you would be contributing to the moral atmosphere of the college .  for surely  in the absence of overwhelming pressure toward marriage  it sometimes happens even jn college that the pressure of continuous propinquity breeds a certain danger of   of      yes  there is that   said the professor .   well  i shall try a dilute solution .  after all  the results may advance scientific knowledge tremendously and  as you say  it will also advance morality .    alexander said   and  of course  alice and i will drink the punch  too .    alice said   oh  alexander  surely such love as ours needs no artificial aid .     but it would not be artificial  my soul s own .  according to the professor  your love began as a result of just such a hormonal effect  induced  i admit  by more customary methods .    alice blushed rosily .   but then  my only love  why the need for the repetition .     to place us beyond all vicissitudes of fate  my cherished one .     surely  my adored  you don t doubt my love .     no  my heart s charmer  but      but .  is it that you do not trust me  alexander .     of course i trust you  alice  but      but .  again but .   alice rose  furious .   if you cannot trust me  sir  perhaps i had better leave    and she did leave indeed  while the two men stared after her  stunned .   professor johns said   i am afraid my hormone has  quite indirectly  been the occasion of spoiling a marriage rather than of causing one .    alexander swallowed miserably  but his pride upheld him .   she will come back   he said  hollowly .   a love such as ours is not so easily broken .    the senior dance was  of course  the event of the year .  the young men shone and the young ladies glittered .  the music lilted and the dancing feet touched the ground only at intervals .  joy was unrestrained .   or  rather  it was unrestrained in most cases .  alexander dexter stood in one corner  eyes hard  expression icily bleak .  straight and handsome he might be  but no young woman approached him .  he was known to belong to alice s anger  and under such circumstances  no college girl would dream of poaching .  yet where was alice .   she had not come with alexander and alexander s pride prevented him from searching for her .  from under grim eyelids  he could only watch the circulating couples cautiously .   professor johns  in formal clothes that did not fit although made to measure  approached him .  he said   i will add my hormone to the punch shortly before the midnight toast .  is mr .  nitejy still here .     i saw him a moment ago .  in his capacity as chaperon he was busily engaged in making certain that the proper distance between dancing couples was maintained .  four fingers  i believe  at the point of closest approach .  mr .  nitely was most diligently making the necessary measurements .     very good .  oh  i had neglected to ask  is the punch alcoholic .  alcohol would affect the workings of the amatogenic principle adversely .    alexander  despite his sore heart  found spirit to deny the unintended slur upon his class .   alcoholic  professor .  this punch is made along those principles firmly adhered to by all .  young college students .  it contains only the purest of fruit juices  refined sugar  and a certain quantity of lemon peel  enough to stimulate but not inebriate .     good   said the professor .   now i have added to the hormone a sedative designed to put our experimental subjects to sleep for a short time while the hormone works .  once they awaken  the first individual each sees   that is  of course  of the opposite sex   will inspire that individual with a pure and noble ardor that can end only in marriage .    then  since it was nearly midnight  he made his way through the happy couples  all dancing at four fingers distance  to the punch bowl .   alexander  depressed nearly to tears  stepped out to the balcony .  in doing so  he just missed alice  who entered the ballroom from the balcony by another door .    midnight   called out a happy voice .   toast .  toast .  toast to the life ahead of us .    they crowded about the punch bowl  the little glasses were passed round .    to the life ahead of us   they cried out and  with all the enthusiasm of young college students  downed the fiery mixture of pure fruit juices  sugar  and lemon peel  with   of course  the professor s sedated amatogenic principle .   as the fumes rose to their brains  they slowly crumpled to the floor .   alice stood there alone  still holding her drink  eyes wet with unshed tears .   oh  alexander  alexander  though you doubt  yet are you my only love .  you wish me to drink and i shall drink .   then she  too  sank gracefully downward .   nicholas nitely had gone in search of alexander  for whom his warm heart was concerned .  he had seen him arrive without alice and he could only assume that a lovers  quarrel had taken place .  nor did he feel any dismay at leaving the party to its own devices .  these were not wild youngsters  but college boys and girls of good family and gentle upbringing .  they could be trusted to the full to observe the four finger limit  as he well knew .   he found alexander on the balcony  staring moodily out at a star riddled sky .    alexander  my boy .   he put his hand on the young man s shoulder .   this is not like you .  to give way so to depression  chut  my young friend  chut .    alexander s head bowed at the sound of the good old man s voice .   it is unmanly  i know  but i yearn for alice .  i have been cruel to her and i am justly treated now .  and yet  mr .  nitely  if you could but know    he placed his clenched fist on his chest  next his heart .  he could say no more .   nitely said  sorrowfully   do you think because i am unmarried that i am unacquainted with the softer emotions .  be undeceived .  time was when i  too  knew love and heartbreak .  but do not do as i did once and allow pride to prevent your reunion .  seek her out  my boy  seek her out and apologize .  do not allow yourself to become a solitary old bachelor such as i  myself .    but  tush  i am puling .    alexander s back had straightened .   i will be guided by you  mr .  nitely .  i will seek her out .    then go on in .  for shortly before i came out  i believe i saw her there .    alexander s heart leaped .   perhaps she searches for me even now .  i will go   but  no .  go you first  mr .  nitely  while i stay behind to recover myself .  i would not have her see me a prey to womanish tears .     of course  my boy .    nitely stopped at the door into the ballroom in astonishment .  had a universal catastrophe struck all low .  fifty couples were lying on the floor  some heaped together most indecorously .   but before he could make up his mind to see if the nearest were dead  to sound the fire alarm  to call the police  to anything  they were rousing and struggling to their feet .   only one still remained .  a lonely girl in white  one arm outstretched gracefully beneath her fair head .  it was alice sanger and nitely hastened to her  oblivious to the rising clamor about him .   he sank to his knees .   miss sanger .  my dear miss sanger .  are you hurt .    she opened her beautiful eyes slowly  and said   mr .  nitely .  i never realized you were such a vision of loveliness .     i .   nitely started back with horror  but she had now risen to her feet and there was a light in her eyes such as nitely had not seen in a maiden s eyes for thirty years   and then only weakly .   she said   mr .  nitely  surely you will not leave me .     no  no   said nitely  confused .   if you need me  i shall stay .     i need you .  i need you with all my heart and soul .  i need you as a thirsty flower needs the morning dew .  i need you as thisbe of old needed pyramus .    nitely  still backing away  looked about hastily  to see if anyone could be hearing this unusual declaration  but no one seemed to be paying any attention .  as nearly as he could make out  the air was filled with other declarations of similar sort  some being even more forceful and direct .   his back was up against a wall  and alice approached him so closely as to break the four finger rule to smithereens .  she broke  in fact  the no finger rule  and at the resulting mutual pressure  a certain indefinable something seemed to thud away within nitely .    miss sanger .  please .     miss sanger .  am i miss sanger to you .   exclaimed alice  passionately .   mr .  nitely .  nicholas .  make me your alice  your own .  marry me .  marry me .    all around there was the cry of  marry me .  marry me .   and young men and women crowded around nitely  for they knew well that he was a justice of the peace .  they cried out   marry us  mr nitely .  marry us .    he could only cry in return   i must get you all licenses .    they parted to let him leave on that errand of mercy .  only alice followed him .   nitely met alexander at the door of the balcony and turned him back toward the open and fresh air .  professor johns came at that moment to join them all .   nitely said   alexander .  professor johns .  the most extraordinary thing has occurred      yes   said the professor  his mild face beaming with joy .   the experiment has been a success .  the principle is far more effective on the human being  in fact  than on any of my experimental animals .   noting nitely s confusion  he explained what had occurred in brief sentences .   nitely listened and muttered   strange  strange .  there is a certain elusive familiarity about this .   he pressed his forehead with the knuckles of both hands  but it did not help .   alexander approached alice gently  yearning to clasp her to his strong bosom  yet knowing that no gently nurtured girl could consent to such an expression of emotion from one who had not yet been forgiven .   he said   alice  my lost love  if in your heart you could find     but she shrank from him  avoiding his arms though they were outstretched only in supplication .  she said   alexander  i drank the punch .  it was your wish .     you needn t have .  i was wrong  wrong .     but i did  and oh  alexander  i can never be yours .     never be mine .  but what does this mean .   and alice  seizing nitely s arm  clutched it avidly .   my soul is intertwined indissolubly with that of mr .  nitely  of nicholas  i mean .  my passion for him   that is  my passion for marriage with him   cannot be withstood .  it racks my being .     you are false .   cried alexander  unbelieving .    you are cruel to say  false    said alice  sobbing .   i cannot help it .     no  indeed   said professor johns  who had been listening to this in the greatest consternation  after having made his explanation to nitely .   she could scarcely help it .  it is simply an endocrinological manifestation .     indeed that is so   said nitely  who was struggling with en docrinological manifestations of his own .   there  there  my   my dear .   he patted alice s head in a most fatherly way and when she held her enticing face up toward his  swooningly  he considered whether it might not be a fatherly thing   nay  even a neighborly thing   to press those lips with his own  in pure fashion .   but alexander  out of his heart s despair  cried   you are false  false   false as cressid   and rushed from the room .   and nitely would have gone after him  but that alice had seized him about the neck and bestowed upon his slowly melting lips a kiss that was not daughterly in the least .   it was not even neighborly .   they arrived at nitely s small bachelor cottage with its chaste sign of justice of the peace in old english letters  its air of melancholy peace  its neat serenity  its small stove on which the small kettle was quickly placed by nitely s left hand  his right arm being firmly in the clutch of alice  who  with a shrewdness beyond her years  chose that as one sure method of rendering impossible a sudden bolt through the door on his part  .   nitely s study could be seen through the open door of the dining room  its walls lined with gentle books of scholarship and joy .   again nitely s hand  his left hand  went to his brow .   my dear   he said to alice   it is amazing the way   if you would release your hold the merest trifle  my child  so that circulation might be restored   the way in which i persist in imagining that all this has taken place before .     surely never before  my dear nicholas   said alice  bending her fair head upon his shoulder  and smiling at him with a shy tenderness that made her beauty as bewitching as moonlight upon still waters   could there have been so wonderful a modern day magician as our wise professor johns  so up to date a sorcerer .     so up to date   nitely had started so violently as to lift the fair alice a full inch from the floor .   why  surely that must be it .  dickens take me  if that s not it .    for on rare occasions  and under the stress of overpowering emotions  nitely used strong language .     nicholas .  what is it .  you frighten me  my cherubic one .    but nitely walked rapidly into his study  and she was forced to run with him .  his face was white  his lips firm  as he reached for a volume from the shelves and reverently blew the dust from it .    ah   he said with contrition   how i have neglected the innocent joys of my younger days .  my child  in view of this continuing incapacity of my right arm  would you be so kind as to turn the pages until i tell you to stop .    together they managed  in such a tableau of preconnubial bliss as is rarely seen  he holding the book with his left hand  she turning the pages slowly with her right .    i am right .   nitely said with sudden force .   professor johns  my dear fellow  do come here .  this is the most amazing coincidence   a frightening example of the mysterious unfelt power that must sport with us on occasion for some hidden purpose .    professor johns  who had prepared his own tea and was sipping it patiently  as befitted a discreet gentleman of intellectual habit in the presence of two ardent lovers who had suddenly retired to the next room  called out   surely you do not wish my presence .     but i do  sir .  i would fain consult one of your scientific attainments .     but you are in a position     alice screamed  faintly   professor .     a thousand pardons  my dear   said professor johns  entering .   my cobwebby old mind is filled with ridiculous fancies .  it is long since i    and he pulled mightily at his tea  which he had made strong  and was himself again at once .    professor   said nitely .   this dear child referred to you as an up to date sorcerer and that turned my mind instantly to gilbert and sullivan s the sorcerer .     what   asked professor johns  mildly   are gilbert and sullivan .    nitely cast a devout glance upward  as though with the intention of gauging the direction of the inevitable thunderbolt and dodging .  he said in a hoarse whisper   sir william schwenck gilbert and sir arthur sullivan wrote  respectively  the words and music of the greatest musical comedies the world has ever seen .  one of these is entitled the sorcerer .  in it  too  a philtre was used  a highly moral one which did not affect married people  but which did manage to deflect the young heroine away from her handsome young lover and into the arms of an elderly man .     and   asked professor johns   were matters allowed to remain so .     well  no .    really  my dear  the movements of your fingers in the region of the nape of my neck  while giving rise to undeniably pleasurable sensations  do rather distract me .    there is a reunion of the young lovers  professor .     ah   said professor johns .   then in view of the close resemblance of the fictional plot to real life  perhaps the solution in the play will help point the way to the reunion of alice and alexander .  at least  i presume you do not wish to go through life with one arm permanently useless .    alice said   i have no wish to be reunited .  i want only my own nicholas .     there is something   said nitely   to be said for that refreshing point of view  but tush   youth must be served .  there is a solution in the play  professor johns  and it is for that reason that i most particularly wanted to talk to you .   he smiled with a gentle benevolence .   in the play  the effects of the potion were completely neutralized by the actions of the gentleman who administered the potion in the first place  the gentleman  in other words  analogous to yourself .     and those actions were .     suicide .  simply that .  in some manner unexplained by the authors  the effect of this suicide was to break the sp     but by now professor johns had recovered his equilibrium and said in the most sepulchrally forceful tone that could be imagined   my dear sir  may i state instantly that  despite my affection for the young persons involved in this sad dilemma  i cannot under any circumstances consent to self immolation .  such a procedure might be extremely efficacious in connection with love potions of ordinary vintage  but my amatogenic principle  i assure you  would be completely unaffected by my death .    nitely sighed .   i feared that .  as a matter of fact  between ourselves  it was a very poor ending for the play  perhaps the poorest in the canon   and he looked up briefly in mute apology to the spirit of william s .  gilbert .   it was pulled out of a hat .  it had not been properly foreshadowed earlier in the play .  it punished an individual who did not deserve the punishment .  in short  it was  alas  completely unworthy of gilbert s powerful genius .    professor johns said   perhaps it was not gilbert .  perhaps some bungler had interfered and botched the job .     there is no record of that .    but professor johns  his scientific mind keenly aroused by an unsolved puzzle  said at once   we can test this .  let us study the mind of this   this gilbert .  he wrote other plays  did he .     fourteen  in collaboration with sullivan .     were there endings that resolved analogous situations in ways which were more appropriate .    nitely nodded   one  certainly .  there was ruddigore .         who was he .     ruddigore is a place .  the main character is revealed as the true bad baronet of ruddigore and is  of course  under a curse .    to be sure   muttered professor johns  who realized that such an eventuality frequently befell bad baronets and was even inclined to think it served them right .   nitely said   the curse compelled him to commit one crime or more each day .  were one day to pass without a crime  he would inevitably die in agonizing torture .     how horrible   murmured the soft hearted alice .    naturally   said nitely   no one can think up a crime each day  so our hero was forced to use his ingenuity to circumvent the curse .     how .     he reasoned thus  if he deliberately refused to commit a crime  he was courting death by his own act .  in other words  he was attempting suicide  and attempting suicide is  of course a crime   and so he fulfills the conditions of the curse .     i see .  i see   said professor johns .   gilbert obviously believes in solving matters by carrying them forward to their logical conclusions .   he closed his eyes  and his noble brow clearly bulged with the numerous intense thought waves it contained .   he opened them .   nitely  old chap  when was the sorcerer first produced .     in eighteen hundred and seventy seven .     then that is it  my dear fellow .  in eighteen seventy seven  we were faced with the victorian age .  the institution of marriage was not to be made sport of on the stage .  it could not be made a comic matter for the sake of the plot .  marriage was holy  spiritual  a sacrament      enough   said nitely   of this apostrophe .  what is in your mind .     marriage .  marry the girl  nitely .  have all your couples marry  and that at once .  i m sure that was gilbert s original intention .     but that   said nitely  who was strangely attracted by the notion   is precisely what we are trying to avoid .     i am not   said alice  stoutly  though she was not stout  but  on the contrary  enchantingly lithe and slender  .   professor johns said   don t you see .  once each couple is married  the amatogenic principle   which does not affect married people   loses its power over them .  those who would have been in love without the aid of the principle remain in love  those who would not are no longer in love   and consequently apply for an annulment .     good heaveris   said nitely .   how admirably simple .  of course .  gilbert must have intended that until a shocked producer or theater manager   a bungler  as you say   forced the change .     and did it work .   i asked .   after all  you said quite distinctly that the professor had said its effect on married couples was only to inhibit extra marital re     it worked   said nitely  ignoring my comment .  a tear trembled on his eyelid  but whether it was induced by memories or by the fact that he was on his fourth gin and tonic  i could not tell .    it worked   he said .   alice and i were married  and our marriage was almost instantly annulled by mutual consent on the grounds of the use of undue pressure .  and yet  because of the incessant chaperoning to which we were subjected  the incidence of undue pressure between ourselves was  unfortunately  virtually nil .   he sighed again .   at any rate  alice and alexander were married soon after and she is now  i understand  as a result of various concomitant events  expecting a child .    he withdrew his eyes from the deep recesses of what was left of his drink and gasped with sudden alarm .   dear me .  she again .    i looked up  startled .  a vision in pastel blue was in the doorway .  imagine  if you will  a charming face made for kissing  a lovely body made for loving .   she called .   nicholas .  wait .     is that alice .   i asked .    no  no .  this is someone else entirely  a completely different story .    but i must not remain here .    he rose and  with an agility remarkable in one so advanced in years and weight  made his way through a window .  the feminine vision of desirability  with an agility only slightly less remarkable  followed .   i shook my head in pity and sympathy .  obviously  the poor man was continually plagued by these wondrous things of beauty who  for one reason or another  were enamored of him .  at the thought of this horrible fate  i downed my own drink at a gulp and considered the odd fact that no such difficulties had ever troubled me .   and at that thought  strange to tell  i ordered another drink savagely  and a scatological exclamation rose  unbidden  to my lips .     not long after the appearance of  the up to date sorcerer   mr .  boucher retired as editor of f   sf  and was succeeded in the post by robert p .  mills .   mr .  mills proceeded to do me the largest single favor of my writing life since mr .  campbell had started the discussion that had led to  nightfall  .  mr .  mills asked me to write a monthly column on science for f   sf and i complied at once .  since the november      issue  in which my first column appeared  i have kept right on going  month after month  and  as i write this  i am about to celebrate my tenth anniversary as monthly columnist for the magazine .   of all the writing i do  fiction  non fiction  adult  or juvenile  these f   sf articles are by far the most fun  and in them  during mr .  mills  tenure i never referred to him as other than the  kindly editor  .   anyway  over lunch one day  mr .  mills said he had seen the name lefkowitz on several different and unrelated occasions that day  which struck him as a curious coincidence .  could i make a story out of it .  in my usual offhand manner  i said   sure .   and gave it a little thought .   the result was a story that served as a tribute to mr .  boucher  too .  he was  you see  a devout catholic .   i must say  was   for he died in april      to the heartfelt grief of all who knew him .  he was so kind a man that he was loved by the very authors he rejected  even while he was rejecting them  and there simply isn t any harsher test of true love than that .   and because mr .  boucher was a sincere catholic  there was very often a faintly catholic air about f   sf under his leadership  always a pleasant and liberal one  though  for that was the kind of man he was .   so i thought thai as my tribute to mr .  boucher s editorship  i would try my hand at that kind of flavor myself .  i couldn t handle it catholic fashion  of course  for i am not catholic .  i did it the only way i could manage  and wrote a jewish story  the only jewish story it ever occurred to me to write  i think .   and i made mr .  mills  remark about lefkowitz become  unto the fourth generation .    first appearance   the magazine of fantasy and science fiction  april      .           by mercury press  inc .     unto the fourth generation    at ten of noon  sam marten hitched his way out of the taxi cab  trying as usual to open the door with one hand   . hold his briefcase in another and reach for his wallet with a third .  having only two hands  he found it a difficult job and  again as usual  he thudded his knee against the cab door and found himself still groping uselessly for his wallet when his feet touched pavement .   the traffic of madison avenue inched past .  a red truck slowed its crawl reluctantly  then moved on with a rasp as the light changed .  white script on its side informed an unresponsive world that its ownership was that of f .  lewkowitz and sons  wholesale clothiers .   levkowich  thought marten with brief inconsequence  and finally fished out his wallet .  he cast an eye on the meter as he clamped his briefcase under his arm .  dollar sixty five  make that twenty cents more as a tip  two singles gone would leave him only one for emergencies  better break a fiver .    okay   he said   take out one eighty five  bud .     thanks   said the cabbie with mechanical insincerity and made the change .   marten crammed three singles into his wallet  put it away  lifted his briefcase and breasted the human currents on the sidewalk to reach the glass doors of the building .   levkovicht he thought sharply  and stopped .  a passerby glanced off his elbow .    sorry   muttered marten  and made for the door again .   levkovich .  that wasn t what the sign on the truck had said .  the name had read lewkowitz  loo koh itz .  why did he think levkovich .  even with his college german in the near past changing the w s to v s  where did he get the   ich  from .   levkovich .  he shrugged the whole matter away roughly .  give it a chance and it would haunt him like a hit parade tinkle .   concentrate on business .  he was here for a luncheon appointment with this man  naylor .  he was here to turn a contract into an account and begin  at twenty three  the smooth business rise which  as he planned it  would marry him to elizabeth in two years and make him a paterfamilias in the suburbs in ten .   he entered the lobby with grim firmness and headed for the banks of elevators  his eye catching at the white lettered directory as he passed .   it was a silly habit of his to want to catch suite numbers as he passed  without slowing  or  heaven forbid  coming to a full halt .  with no break in his progress  he told himself  he could maintain the impression of belonging  of knowing his way around  and that was important to a man whose job involved dealing with other human beings .   kulin etts was what he wanted  and the word amused him .  a firm specializing in the production of minor kitchen gadgets  striving manfully for a name that was significant  feminine  and coy  all at once    his eyes snagged at the m s and moved upward as he walked .  mandel  lusk  lippert publishing company  two full floors   lafkowitz  kulin etts .  there it was        .  tenth floor .  ok .   and then  after all  he came to a dead halt  turned in reluctant fascination  returned to the directory  and stared at it as though he were an out of towner .   lafkowitz .   what kind of spelling was that .   it was clear enough .  lafkowitz  henry j .       .  with an a .  that was no good .  that was useless .   useless .  why useless .  he gave his head one violent shake as though to clear it of mist .  damn it  what did he care how it was spelled .  he turned away  frowning and angry  and hastened to an elevator door  which closed just before he reached it  leaving him flustered .   another  door opened and he stepped in briskly .  he tucked his briefcase under his arm and tried to look bright alive   junior executive in its finest sense .  he had to make an impression on alex naylor  with whom so far he had communicated only by telephone .  if he was going to brood about lewkowitzes and laf kowitzes    the elevator slid noiselessly to a halt at seven .  a youth in shirtsleeves stepped off  balancing what looked like a desk drawer in which were three containers of coffee and three sandwiches .   then  just as the doors began closing  frosted glass with black lettering loomed before marten s eyes .  it read        henry j .  lefkowitz   importer and was pinched off by the inexorable coming together of the elevator doors .   marten leaned forward in excitement .  it was  his impulse to say  take me back down to   .   but there were others in the car .  and after all  he had no reason .   yet there was a tingle of excitement within him .  the directory had been wrong .  it wasn t a  it was e .  some fool of a non spelling menial with a packet of small letters to go on the board and only one hind foot to do it with .   lefkowitz .  still not right  though .   again  he shook his head .  twice .  not right for what .   the elevator stopped at ten and marten got off .   alex naylor of kulin etts turned out to be a bluff  middle aged man with a shock of white hair  a ruddy complexion  and a broad smile .  his palms were dry and rough  and he shook hands with a considerable pressure  putting his left hand on marten s shoulder in an earnest display of friendliness .   he said   be with you in two minutes .  how about eating right here in the building .  excellent restaurant  and they ve got a boy who makes a good martini .  that sound all right .     fine .  fine .   marten pumped up enthusiasm from a somehow clogged reservoir .   it was nearer ten minutes than two  and marten waited with the usual uneasiness of a man in a strange office .  he stared at the upholstery on the chairs and at the little cubby hole within which a young and bored switchboard operator sat .  he gazed at the pictures on the wall and even made a half hearted attempt to glance through a trade journal on the table next to him .   what he did not do was think of lev    he did not think of it .   the restaurant was good  or it would have been good if marten had been perfectly at ease .  fortunately  he was freed of the necessity of carrying the burden of the conversation .  naylor talked rapidly and loudly  glanced over the menu with a practiced eye  recommended the eggs benedict  and commented on the weather and the miserable traffic situation .   on occasion  martin tried to snap out of it  to lose that edge of fuzzed absence of mind .  but each time the restlessness would return .  something was wrong .  the name was wrong .  it stood in the way of what he had to do .   with main force  he tried to break through the madness .  in sudden verbal clatter  he led the conversation into the subject of wiring .  it was reckless of him .  there was no proper foundation  the transition was too abrupt .   but the lunch had been a good one  the dessert was on its way  and naylor responded nicely .   he admitted dissatisfaction with existing arrangements .  yes  he had been looking into marten s firm and  actually  it seemed to him that  yes  there was a chance  a good chance  he thought  that    a hand came down on naylor s shoulder as a man passed behind his chair .   how s the boy  alex .    naylor looked up  grin ready made and flashing .   hey  lefk  how s business .     can t complain .  see you at the    he faded into the distance .   marten wasn t listening .  he felt his knees trembling  as he half rose .   who was that man .   he asked  intensely .  it sounded more peremptory than he intended .    who .  lefk .  jerry lefkovitz .  you know him .   naylor stared with cool surprise at his lunch companion .    no .  how do you spell his name .     l e f k o v i t z  i think .  why .    with a v .     an f oh  there s a v in it  too .   most of the good nature  had left naylor s face .   marten drove on .   there s a lefkowitz in the building .  with a w .  you know  lef cow itz .     oh .     room     .  this is not the same one .     jerry doesn t work in this building .  he s got a place across the street .  i don t know this other one .  this is a big building  you know .  i don t keep tabs on every one in it .  what is all this  anyway .    marten shook his head and sat back .  he didn t know what all this was  anyway .  or at least  if he did  it was nothing he dared explain .  could he say  i m being haunted by all manner of lef kowitzes today .   he said   we were talking about wiring .    naylor said   yes .  well  as i said  i ve been considering your company .  i ve got to talk it over with the production boys  you understand .  i ll let you know .     sure   said marten  infinitely depressed .  naylor wouldn t let him know .  the whole thing was shot .   and yet  through and beyond his depression  there was still that restlessness .   the hell with naylor .  all marten wanted was to break this up and get on with it .   get on with what .  but the question was only a whisper .  whatever did the questioning inside him was ebbing away  dying down  .  .  .    the lunch frayed to an ending .  if they had greeted each other like long separated friends at last reunited  they parted like strangers .   marten felt only relief .   he left with pulses thudding  threading through the tables  out of the haunted building  onto the haunted street .   haunted .  madison avenue at      p . m .  in an early fall afternoon with the sun shining brightly and ten thousand men and women be hiving its long straight stretch .   but marten felt the haunting .  he tucked his briefcase under his arm and headed desperately northward .  a last sigh of the normal within him warned him he had a three o clock appointment on   th street .  never mind .  he headed uptown .  northward .   at   th street  he crossed madison and walked west  came abruptly to a halt and looked upward .   there was a sign on the window  three stories up .  he could make it out clearly  a .  s .  lefkowich  certified accountant .   it had an f and an ew  but it was the first   ich  ending he had seen .  the first one .  he was getting closer .  he turned north again on fifth avenue  hurrying through the unreal streets of an unreal city  panting with the chase of something  while the crowds about him began to fade .   a sign in a ground floor window  m .  r .  lefkowich  m . d .   a small gold leaf semi circle of letters in a candy store window   jacob levkow .    half a name  he thought savagely .  why is he disturbing me with half a name .    the streets were empty now except for the varying clan of lefkowitz  levkowitz  lefkowicz to stand out in the vacuum .   he was dimly aware of the park ahead  standing out in painted motionless green .  he turned west .  a piece of newspaper fluttered at the corner of his eyes  the only movement in a dead world .  he veered  stooped  and picked it up  without slackening his pace .   it was yiddish  a torn half page .   he couldn t read it .  he couldn t make out the blurred hebrew letters  and could not have read it if they were clear .  but one word was clear .  it stood out in dark letters in the center of the page  each letter clear in its every serif .  and it said lefkovitsch  he knew  and as he said it to himself  he placed its accent on the second syllable  lef kuh vich .   he let the paper flutter away and entered the empty park .   the trees were still and the leaves hung in odd  suspended attitudes .  the sunlight was dead weight upon him and gave no warmth .   he was running  but his feet kicked up no dust and a tuft of grass on which he placed his weight did not bend .   and there on a bench was an old man  the only man in the desolate park .  he wore a dark felt cap  with a visor shading his eyes .  from underneath it  tufts of gray hair protruded .  his grizzled beard reached the uppermost button of his rough jacket .  his old trousers were patched  and a strip of burlap was wrapped about each worn and shapeless shoe .   marten stopped .  it was difficult to breathe .  he could only say one word and he used it to ask his question   levkovich .    he stood there  while the old man rose slowly to his feet  brown old eyes peering close .    marten   he sighed .   samuel marten .  you have come .   the words sounded with an effect of double exposure  for under the english  marten heard the faint sigh of a foreign tongue under  the  samuel  was the unheard shadow of a  schmuel  .   the old man s rough  veined hands reached out  then withdrew as though he were afraid to touch .  t have been looking but there are so many people in this wilderness of a city that is to come .  so many martins and marlines and mortons and mertons .  i stopped at last when i found greenery  but for a moment only   i would not commit the sin of losing faith .  and then you came .     it is i   said marten  and knew it was .   and you are phinehas levkovich .  why are we here .     i am phinehas ben jehudah  assigned the name levkovich by the ukase of the tsar that ordered family names for all .  and we are here   the old man said  softly   because i prayed .  when i was already old  leah  my only daughter  the child of my old age  left for america with her husband  left the knouts of the old for the hope of the new .  and my sons died  and sarah  the wife of my bosom  was long dead and i was alone .  and the time came when i  too  must die .  but i had not seen leah since her leaving for the far country and word had come but rarely .  my soul yearned that i might see sons born unto her  sons of my seed  sons in whom my soul might yet live and not die .    his voice was steady and the soundless shadow or sound beneath ms words was the stately roll of an ancient language .    and i was answered and two hours were given me that i might see the first son of my line to be born in a new land and in a new time .  my daughter s daughter s daughter s son  have i found you  then  amidst the splendor of this city .     but why the search .  why not have brought us together at once .     because there is pleasure in the hope of the seeking  my son  said the old man  radiantly   and in the delight of the finding .  i was given two hours in which i might seek  two hours in which i might find  .  .  .  and behold  thou art here  and i have found that which i had not looked to see in life .   his voice was old  caressing .   is it well with thee  my son .     it is well  my father  now that i have found thee   said marten  and dropped to his knees .   give me thy blessing  my father  that it may be well with me all the days of my life  and with the maid whom i am to take to wife and the little ones yet to be born of my seed and thine .    he felt the old hand resting lightly on bis head and there was only the soundless whisper .   marten rose .   the old man s eyes gazed into his yearningly .  were they losing focus .    i go to my fathers now in peace  my son   said the old man  and marten was alone in the empty park .   there was an instant of renewing motion  of the sun taking up its interrupted task  of the wind reviving  and even with that first instant of sensation  all slipped back    at ten of noon  sam marten hitched his way out of the taxicab  and found himself groping uselessly for his wallet while traffic inched on .   a red truck slowed  then moved on .  a white script on its side announced  f .  lewkowitz and sons  wholesale clothiers .  .  .  .   marten didn t see it .  yet somehow he knew that all would be well with him .  somehow  as never before  he knew .  .  .  .     this one is complicated .  it goes back to         when  for some half a dozen issues or so  a magazine i won t name tried to make a go of what i can only call  spicy science fiction stories .   considering the sexual freedom allowed the writers of today  those old spicy s . f .  stories read like  the bobbsey twins in outer space  now  but they were sizzlers to the magazine s few readers then .   the stories dealt very heavily with the hot passion of alien monsters for earth women .  clothes were always getting ripped off and breasts were described in a variety of elliptical phrases .   yes  i know that s a pun .   the magazine died a deserved death  not so much for its sex and sadism  as for the deadly sameness of its stories and the abysmal quality of its  writing .    the curtain falls  and rises again in      .  the magazine playboy decided to have a little fun with science fiction .  they published an article entitled  girls for the slime god  in which they pretended  good naturedly  that all science fiction was sex and sadism .  they could find very little real stuff to satirize  however  for until      there was no branch of literature anywhere  except perhaps for the children s stories in sunday school bulletins  as puritanical as science fiction .  since       to be sure  sexual libertarianism has penetrated even science fiction .   playboy therefore had to illustrate its article with the funny  sexy covers of fictitious magazines and had to draw all its quotations from only one source   that         magazine i mentioned above .   cele goldsmith  the editor of amazing stories  read the article and called me at once .  she suggested i write a story entitled  playboy and the slime god  satirizing the satire .  i was strongly tempted to do so for several reasons      miss goldsmith had to be seen to be believed .  she was the only science fiction editor i ve ever seen who looked like a show girl  and i happen to be aesthetically affected  or something  by show girl types .      i take science fiction seriously and i was annoyed that that         magazine should have given playboy a handle for satire .  i wanted to satire back at them .      i quickly thought up exactly what i wanted to say .   so i wrote  playboy and the slime god  using some of the same quotes that playboy had .  used and trying to show what an encounter between sex interested aliens and an earth woman might really be like .     might say that miss goldsmith wrote the final three paragraphs of the story .  i had a quite pretentious ending and miss goldsmith s was much better .  so   let it stand  not only in the magazine  but here .    the title was a problem  though .  it s disgusting .  when the late  alas .   groff conklin  who was one of the most indefatigable anthologizers in the business  was considering the story for one of his collections  he asked rather piteously if i had an alternate title .   you bet .   i said .   how about  what is this thing called love .     mr .  conklin was delighted and so was i  and that is the title that he used  and the one that i am now using .   first appearance   amazing stories  march       under the title  playboy and the slime god .   copyright          by ziff davis publishing company .     what is this thing called love .      but there are two species   said captain garm  peering closely at the creatures that had been brought up from the planet below .  his optic organs adjusted focus to maximum sharpness  bulging outwards as they did so .  the color patch above them gleamed in quick flashes .   botax felt warmly comfortable to be following color changes once again  after months in a spy cell on the planet  trying to make sense out of the modulated sound waves emitted by the natives .  communication by flash was almost like being home in the far off perseus arm of the galaxy .   not two species   he said   but two forms of one species .     nonsense  they look quite different .  vaguely perse like  thank the entity  and not as disgusting in appearance as so many out forms are .  reasonable shape  recognizable limbs .  but no color patch .  can they speak .     yes  captain garm   botex indulged in a discreetly disapproving prismatic interlude .   the details are in my report .  these creatures form sound waves by way of throat and mouth  something like complicated coughing .  i have learned to do it myself .   he was quietly proud .   it is very difficult .     it must be stomach turning .  well  that accounts for their flat  unextensible eyes .  not to speak by color makes eyes largely useless .  meanwhile  how can you insist these are a single species .  the one on the left is smaller and has longer tendrils  or whatever it is  and seems differently proportioned .  it bulges where this other does not .  are they alive .     alive but not at the moment conscious  captain .  they have been psycho treated to repress fright in order that they might be studied easily .     but are they worth study .  we are behind our schedule and have at least five worlds of greater moment than this one to check and explore .  maintaining a time stasis unit is expensive and i would like to return them and go on     but botax s moist spindly body was fairly vibrating with anxiety .  his tubular tongue flicked out and curved up and over his flat nose  while his eyes sucked inward .  his splayed three fingered hand made a gesture of negation as his speech went almost entirely into the deep red .    entity save us .  captain  for no world is of greater moment to us than this one .  we may be facing a supreme crisis .  these creatures could be the most dangerous life forms in the galaxy  captain  just because there are two forms .    i don t follow you .     captain  it has been my job to study this planet  and it has been most difficult  for it is unique .  it is so unique that i can scarcely comprehend its facets .  for instance  almost all life on the planet consists of species in two forms .  there are no words to describe it  no concepts even .  i can only speak of them as first form and second form .  if i may use their sounds  the little one is called  female   and the big one  here   male   so the creatures themselves are aware of the difference .    garm winced   what a disgusting means of communication .    and  captain  in order to bring forth young  the two forms must cooperate .    the captain  who had bent forward to examine the specimens closely with an expression compounded of interest and revulsion  straightened at once .   cooperate .  what nonsense is this .  there is no more fundamental attribute of life than that each living creature bring forth its young in innermost communication with itself .  what else makes life worth living .     the one form does bring forth life but the other form must cooperate .     how .     that has been difficult to determine .  it is something very private and in my search through the available forms of literature i could find no exact and explicit description .  but i have been able to make reasonable deductions .    garm shook his head .   ridiculous .  budding is the holiest  most private function in the world .  on tens of thousands of worlds it is the same .  as the great photo bard  levuline  said   in budding time  in budding time  in sweet  delightful budding time  when       captain  you don t understand .  this cooperation between forms brings about somehow  and i am not certain exactly how  a mixture and recombination of genes .  it is a device by which in every generation  new combinations of characteristics are brought into existence .  variations are multiplied  mutated genes hastened into expression almost at once where under the usual budding system  millennia might pass first .     are you trying to tell me that the genes from one individual can be combined with those of another .  do you know how completely ridiculoijs that is in the light of all the principles of cellular physiology .     it must be so   said botax nervously under the other s pop eyed glare .   evolution is hastened .  this planet is a riot of species .  there are supposed to be a million and a quarter different species of creatures .     a dozen and a quarter more likely .  don t accept too completely what you read in the native literature .     i ve seen dozens of radically different species myself in just a small area .  i tell you  captain  give these creatures a short space of time and they will mutate into intellects powerful enough to overtake us and rule the galaxy .    trove that this cooperation you speak of exists  investigator  and i shall consider your contentions .  if you cannot  i shall dismiss all your fancies as ridiculous and we will move on .     i can prove it .   botax s color flashes turned intensely yellow green .   the creatures of this world are unique in another way .  they foresee advances they have not made yet  probably as a consequence of their belief in rapid change which  after all  they constantly witness .  they therefore indulge in a type of literature involving the space travel they have never developed .  i have translated their term for the literature as  science fiction  .  now i have dealt in my readings almost exclusively with science fiction  for there i thought  in their dreams and fancies  they would expose themselves and their danger to us .  and it was from that science fiction that i deduced the method of their inter forrn cooperation .     how did you do that .     there is a periodical on this world which sometimes publishes science fiction which is  however  devoted almost entirely to the various aspects of the cooperation .  it does not speak entirely freely  which is annoying  but persists in merely hinting .  its name as nearly as i can put into flashes is  recreationlad  .  the creature in charge  i deduce  is interested in nothing but inter form cooperation and searches for it everywhere with a systematic and scientific intensity that has roused my awe .  he has found instances of cooperation described in science fiction and i let material in his periodical guide me .  from the stories he instanced i have learned how to bring it about .    and captain  i beg of you  when the cooperation is accomplished and the young are brought forth before your eyes  give orders not to leave an atom of this world in existence .     well   said captain garni  wearily   bring them into full consciousness and do what you must do quickly .    marge skidmore was suddenly completely aware of her surroundings .  she remembered very clearly the elevated station at the beginning of twilight .  it had been almost empty  one man standing near her  another at the other end of the platform .  the approaching train had just made itself known as a faint rumble in the distance .   there had then come the flash  a sense of turning inside out  the half seen vision of a spindly creature  dripping mucus  a rushing upward  and now       oh  god   she said  shuddering .   it s still here .  and there s another one  too .    she felt a sick revulsion  but no fear .  she was almost proud of herself for feeling no fear .  the man next to her  standing quietly as she herself was  but still wearing a battered fedora  was the one that had been near her on the platform .    they got you too .   she asked .   who else .    charlie grimwold  feeling flabby and paunchy  tried to lift his hand to remove his hat and smooth the thin hair that broke up but did not entirely cover the skin of his scalp and found that it moved only with difficulty against a rubbery but hardening resistance .  he let his hand drop and looked morosely at the thin faced woman facing him .  she was in her middle thirties  he decided  and her hair was nice and her dress fit well  but at the moment  he just wanted to be somewhere else and it did him no good at all that he had company  even female company .   he said   i don t know  lady .  i was just standing on the station platform .     me  too .     and then i see a flash .  didn t hear nothing .  now here i am .  must be little men from mars or venus or one of them places .    marge nodded vigorously   that s what i figure .  a flying saucer .  you scared .     no .  that s funny  you know .  i think maybe i m going nuts or i would be scared .     funny thing .  i ain t scared  either .  oh  god  here comes one of them now .  if he touches me  i m going to scream .  look at those wiggly hands .  and that wrinkled skin  all slimy  makes me nauseous .    botax approached gingerly and said  in a voice at once rasping and screechy  this being the closest he could come to imitating the native timbre   creatures .  we will not hurt you .  but we must ask you if you would do us the favor of cooperating .     hey  it talks .   said charlie .   what do you mean  cooperate .     both of you .  with each other   said botax .    oh .   he looked at marge .   you know what he means  lady .     ain t got no idea whatsoever   she answered loftily .   botax said   what i mean    and he used the short term he had once heard employed as a synonym for the process .   marge turned red and said   what .   in the loudest scream she could manage .  both botax and captain garm put their hands over the mid regions to cover the auditory patches that trembled painfully with the decibels .   marge went on rapidly  and nearly incoherently .   of all things .  i m a married woman  you .  if my ed was here  you d hear from him .  and you  wise guy   she twisted toward charlie against rubbery resistance   whoever you are  if you think      lady  lady   said  charlie in uncomfortable desperation .   it ain t my idea .  i mean  far be it from me  you know  to turn down some lady  you know  but me  i m married  too .  i got three kids .  listen     captain garm said   what s happening  investigator botax .  these cacophonous sounds are awful .     well   botax flashed a short purple patch of embarrassment .   this forms a complicated ritual .  they are supposed to be reluctant at first .  it heightens the subsequent result .  after that initial stage  the skins must be removed .     they have to be skinned .     not really skinned .  those are artificial skins that can be removed painlessly  and must be .  particularly in the smaller form .     all right  then .  tell it to remove the skins .  really  botax  i don t find this pleasant .     i don t think i had better tell the smaller form to remove the skins .  i think we had better follow the ritual closely .  i have here sections of those space travel tales which the man from the  re creationlad  periodical spoke highly of .  in those tales the skins are removed forcibly .  here is a description of an accident  for instance  which played havoc with the girl s dress  ripping it nearly off her slim body .  for a second  he felt the warm firmness of her half bared bosom against his cheek    it goes on that way .  you see  the ripping  the forcible removal  acts as a stimulus .     bosom .   said the captain .   i don t recognize the flash .     i invented that to cover the meaning .  it refers to the bulges on the upper dorsal region of the smaller form .     i see .  well  tell the larger one to rip the skins off the smaller one .  what a dismal thing this is .    botax turned to charlie .   sir   he said   rip the girl s dress nearly off her slim body  will you .  i will release you for the purpose .    marge s eyes widened and she twisted toward charlie in instant outrage .   don t you dare do that  you .  don t you dost touch me  you sex maniac .     me .   said charlie plaintively .   it ain t my idea .  you think i go around ripping dresses .  listen   he turned to botax   i got a wife and three kids .  she finds out i go around ripping dresses  i get clobbered .  you know what my wife does when i just look at some dame .  listen     is he still reluctant .   said the captain impatiently .    apparently   said botax .   the strange surroundings  you know  may be extending that stage of the cooperation .  since i know this is unpleasant for you  i will perform this stage of the ritual myself .  it is frequently written in the space travel tales that an outer world species performs the task .  for instance  here   and he riffled through his notes finding the one he wanted   they describe a very awful such species .  the creatures on the planet have foolish notions you understand .  it never occurs to them to imagine handsome individuals such as ourselves  with a fine mucous cover .     go on .  go on .  don t take all day   said the captain .    yes  captain .  it says here that the extraterrestrial  came forward to where the girl stood .  shrieking hysterically  she was cradled in the monster s embrace .  talons ripped blindly at her body  tearing the kirtle away in rags .   you see  the native creature is shrieking with stimulation as her skins are removed .     then go ahead  botax  remove it .  but please  allow no shrieking .  i m trembling all over with the sound waves .    botax said politely to marge   if you don t mind     one spatulate finger made as though to hook on to the neck of the dress .   marge wiggled desperately .   don t touch .  don t touch .  you ll get slime on it .  listen  this dress cost     .    at ohrbach s .  stay away  you monster .  look at those eyes on him .   she was panting in her desperate efforts to dodge the groping  extraterrestrial hand .   a slimy  bug eyed monster  that s what he is .  listen  i ll take it off myself .  just don t touch it with slime  for god s sake .    she fumbled at the zipper  and said in a hot aside to charlie   don t you dast look .    charlie closed his eyes and shrugged in resignation .   she stepped out of the dress .   all right .  you satisfied .    captain garm s fingers twitched with unhappiness .   is that the bosom .  why does the other creature keep its head turned away .     reluctance .  reluctance   said botax .   besides  the bosom is still covered .  other skins must be removed .  when bared  the bosom is a very strong stimulus .  it is constantly described as ivory globes  or white spheres  or otherwise after that fashion .  i have here drawings  visual picturizations  that come from the outer covers of the space travel magazines .  if you will inspect them  you will see that upon every one of them  a creature is present with a bosom more or less exposed .    the captain looked thoughtfully from the illustrations to marge and back .   what is ivory .     that is another made up flash of my own .  it represents the tusky material of one of the large sub intelligent creatures on the planet .     ah   and captain garm went into a pastel green of satisfaction .   that explains it .  this small creature is one of a warrior sect and those are tusks with which to smash the enemy .     no  no .  they are quite soft  i understand .   botax s small brown hand flicked outward in the general direction of the objects under discussion and marge screamed and shrank away .    then what other purpose do they have .     i think   said botax with considerable hesitation   that they are used to feed the young .     the young eat them .   asked the captain with every evidence of deep distress .    not exactly .  the objects produce a fluid which the young consume .     consume a fluid from a living body .  yech h h .   the captain covered his head with all three of his arms  calling the central supernumerary into use for the purpose  slipping it out of its sheath so rapidly as almost to knock botax over .    a three armed  slimy  bug eyed monster   said marge .    yeah   said charlie .    all right you  just watch those eyes .  keep them to yourself .     listen  lady .  i m trying not to look .    botax approached again .   madam  would you remove the rest .    marge drew herself up as well as she could against the pinioning field .   never .     i ll remove it  if you wish .     don t touch .  for god s sake  don t touch .  look at the slime on him  will you .  all right  i ll take it off .   she was muttering under her breath and looking hotly in charlie s direction as she did so .    nothing is happening   said the captain  in deep dissatisfaction   and this seems an imperfect specimen .    botax felt the slur on his own efficiency .   i brought you two perfect specimens .  what s wrong with the creature .     the bosom does not consist of globes or spheres .  i know what globes or spheres are and in these pictures you have shown me  they are depicted .  those are large globes .  on this creature  though  what we have are nothing but small flaps of dry tissue .  and they re discolored  too  partly .     nonsense   said botax .   you must allow room for natural variation .  i will put it to the creature herself .    he turned to marge   madam  is your bosom imperfect .   .   marge s eyes opened wide and she struggled vainly for moments without doing anything more than gasp loudly .   really .   she finally managed .   maybe i m no gina lpllobrigida or anita ekberg  but i m perfectly all right  thank you .  oh boy  if my ed were only here .   she turned to charlie .   listen  you  you tell this bug eyed slimy thing here  there ain t nothing wrong with my development .     lady   said charlie  softly .   i ain t looking  remember .     oh  sure  you ain t looking .  you been peeking enough  so you might as well just open your crummy eyes and suck up for a lady  if you re the least bit of a gentleman  which you probably ain t .     well   said charlie  looking sideways at marge  who seized the opportunity to inhale and throw her shoulders back   i don t like to get mixed up in a kind of delicate matter like this  but you re all right   i guess .     you guess  .  you blind or something .  i was once runner up for miss brooklyn  in case you don t happen to know  and where i missed out was on waist line  not on     charlie said   all right  all right .  they re fine .  honest .   he nodded vigorously in botax s direction .   they re okay .  i ain t that much of an expert  you understand  but they re okay by me .    marge relaxed .   botax felt relieved .  he turned to garm .   the bigger form expresses interest  captain .  the stimulus is working .  now for the final step .     and what is that .     there is no flash for it  captain .  essentially  it consists of placing the speaking and eating apparatus of one against the equivalent apparatus of the other .  i have made up a flash for the process  thus  kiss .     will nausea never cease .   groaned the captain .    it is the climax .  in all the tales  after the skins are removed by force  they clasp each other with limbs and indulge madly in burning kisses  to translate as nearly as possible the phrase most frequently used .  here is one example  just one  taken at random    he held the girl  his mouth avid on her lips .       maybe one creature was devouring the other   said the captain .    not at all   said botax impatiently .   those were burning kisses .     how do you mean  burning .  combustion takes place .     i don t think literally so .  i imagine it is a way of expressing the fact that the temperature goes up .  the higher the temperature  i suppose  the more successful the production of young .  now that the big form is properly stimulated  he need only place his mouth against hers to produce young .  the young will not be produced without that step .  it is the cooperation i have been speaking of .     that s all .  just this    the captain s hands made motions of coming together  but he could not bear to put the thought into flash form .    that s all   said botax .   in none of the tales  not even in  re creationlad   have i found a description of any further physical activity in connection with young bearing .  sometimes after the kissing  they write a line of symbols like little stars  but i suppose that merely means more kissing  one kiss for each star  when they wish to produce a multitude of young .     just one  please  right now .     certainly  captain .    botax said with distinctiveness   sir  would you kiss the lady .    charlie said   listen  i can t move .     i will free you  of course .     the lady might not like it .    marge glowered .   you bet your damn boots  i won t like it .  you just stay away .     i would like to  lady  but what do they do if i don t .  look  i don t want to get them mad .  we can just   you know   make like a little peck .    she hesitated  seeing the justice of the caution .   all right .  no funny stuff  though .  i ain t in the habit of standing around like this in front of every tom  dick and harry  you know .     i know that  lady .  it was none of my doing .  you got to admit that .    marge muttered angrily   regular slimy monsters .  must think they re some kind of gods or something  the way they order people around .  slime gods is what they are .    charlie approached her .   if it s okay now  lady .   he made a vague motion as though to tip his hat .  then he put his hands awkwardly on her bare shoulders and leaned over in a gingerly pucker .   marge s head stiffened so that lines appeared in her neck .  their lips met .   captain garm flashed fretfully .   i sense no rise in temperature .   his heat detecting tendril had risen to full extension at the top of his head and remained quivering there .    i don t either   said botax  rather at a loss   but we re doing it just as the space travel stories tell us to .  i think his limbs should be more extended   ah  like that .  see  it s working .    almost absently  charlie s arm had slid around marge s soft  nude torso .  for a moment  marge seemed to yield against him and then she suddenly writhed hard against the pinioning field that still held her with fair firmness .    let go .   the words were muffled against the pressure of charlie s lips .  she bit suddenly  and charlie leaped away  with a wild cry  holding his lower lip  then looking at his fingers for blood .    what s the idea  lady .   he demanded plaintively .   she said   we agreed just a peck  is all .  what were you starting there .  you some kind of playboy or something .  what am i surrounded with here .  playboy and the slime gods .    captain garm flashed rapid alternations of blue and yellow .   is it done .  how long do we wait now .     it seems to me it must happen at once .  throughout all the universe  when you have to bud  you bud  you know .  there s no waiting .     yes .  after thinking of the foul habits you have been describing  i don t think i ll ever bud again .  please get this over with .     just a moment  captain .    but the moments passed and the captain s flashes turned slowly to a brooding orange  while botax s nearly dimmed out altogether .   botax finally asked hesitantly   pardon me  madam  but when will you bud .     when will i what .     bear young .     i ve got a kid .     i mean bear young now .     i should say not .  i ain t ready for another kid yet .     what .  what .   demanded the captain .   what s she saying .     it seems  said botax  weakly   she does not intend to have young at the moment .    the captain s color patch blazed brightly .   do you know what i think  investigator .  i think you have a sick  perverted mind .  nothing s happening to these creatures .  there is no cooperation between them  and no young to be borne .  i think they re two different species and that you re playing some kind of foolish game with me .     but  captain    said botax .    don t but captain me   said garm   i ve had enough .  you ve upset me  turned my stomach  nauseated me  disgusted me with the whole notion of budding and wasted my time .  you re just looking for headlines and personal glory and i ll see to it that you don t get them .  get rid of these creatures now .  give that one its skins back and put them back where you found them .  i ought to take the expense of maintaining time stasis all this time out of your salary .     but  captain      back  i say .  put them back in the same place and at the same instant of time .  i want this planet untouched  and i ll see to it that it stays untouched .   he cast one more furious glance at bo tax .   one species  two forms  bosoms  kisses  cooperation  bah  you are a fool  investigator  a dolt as well  and most of all a sick  sick  sick creature .    there was no arguing .  botax  limbs trembling  set about returning the creatures .   they stood there at the elevated station  looking around wildly .  it was twilight over them  and the approaching train was just making itself known as a faint rumble in the distance .   marge said  hesitantly   mister  did it really happen .    charlie nodded   i remember it .    marge said   we can t tell anybody .     sure not .  they d say we was nuts .  know what i mean .     uh huh .  well   she edged away .   charlie said   listen .  i m sorry you was embarrassed .  it was none of my doing .     that s all right .  i know .   marge s eyes considered the wooden platform at her feet .  the sound of the train was louder .    i mean  you know  lady  you wasn t really bad .  in fact  you looked good  but i was kind of embarrassed to say that .    suddenly  she smiled .   it s all right .     you want maybe to have a cup of coffee with me just to relax you .  my wife  she s not expecting me for a while .     oh .  well  ed s out of town for the weekend so i got only an empty apartment to go home to .  my little boy is visiting at my mother s   she explained .    come on  then .  we been kind of introduced .     i ll say .   she laughed .   the train pulled in  but they turned away  walking down the narrow stairway to the street .   they had a couple of cocktails actually  and then charlie couldn t let her go home in the dark alone  so he saw her to her door .  marge was bound to invite him in for a few moments  naturally .   meanwhile  back in the space ship  the crushed botax was making a final effort to prove his case .  while garm prepared the ship for departure botax hastily set up the tight beam viviscreen for a last look at his specimens .  he focused in on charlie and marge in her apartment .  his tendril stiffened and he began flashing in a coruscating rainbow of colors .   captain garm .  captain .  look what they re doing now .   but at that very instant the ship winked out of time stasis .     toward the end of the     s some rather unexpected changes took place in my life .  my writing career had been constantly expanding .  i had been driven on by my own compulsion and by editorial cooperation to undertake more and more tasks in greater and greater variety and by      i found that i could no longer do the writing i wanted to do and maintain a full academic schedule .   the medical school and i came to an amicable understanding  therefore .  i kept my title  associate professor of biochemistry  if you re curious   and continued to do odd jobs  like giving several lectures a year  sitting on committees  and so on .  in the main  however  i became a full time writer  . and relieved them of the trouble of paying me a salary .   for a while  it seemed to me that with virtually no academic duties and an infinite amount of time each and every day  i could finally do all the writing i had to do with plenty of time left over for fun and games .   it didn t work out .  one of parkinson s laws is   work expands to fill the time available .   it did in my case .  in no time at all  i found i was typing as assiduously full time as i had previously been typing half time and i quickly discovered the asimov corollary to parkinson s law   in ten hours a day you have time to fall twice as far behind your commitments as in five hours a day .    the worst of it was that just about the time i was arranging to make myself a full time writer  the soviet union sent up sputnik i and the united states went into a kind of tizzy  and so did i .   i was overcome by the ardent desire to write popular science for an america that might be in great danger through its neglect of science  and a number of publishers got an equally ardent desire to publish popular science for the same reason .  as a result of combining the two ardencies i found myself plunging into a shoreless sea in which i am still immersed .   the trouble is   it s all non fiction .  in the last ten years  i ve done a couple of novels  some collections  a dozen or so stories  but that s nothing .   from the aggrieved letters i get  one would think i was doing this on purpose .  i m not .  i try desperately not to lose touch with science fiction altogether .  it s my life in a way that nothing else can quite be .  there s my monthly article in f   sf  of course  but that s not quite the same thing .   and so it happens that each short individual piece of fiction i manage to get the typewriter to put out for me is dearer to me in the nowadays of my dimness  than in the old times when i did two dozen or more long ones a year .    the machine that won the war  is one of those that serves as my periodic proof to the world of fandom that i am  too  alive .   first appearance   the magazine of fantasy and science fiction  october      .            by mercury press inc .     the machine that won the war    the celebration had a long way to go and even in the silent depths of multivac s underground chambers  it hung in the air .   if nothing else  there was the mere fact of isolation and silence .  for the first time in a decade  technicians were not scurrying about the vitals of the giant computer  the soft lights did not wink out their erratic patterns  the flow of information in and out had halted .   it would not be halted long  of course  for the needs of peace would be pressing .  yet now  for a day  perhaps for a week  even multivac might celebrate the great time  and rest .   lamar swift took off the military cap he was wearing and looked down the long and empty main corridor of the enormous computer .  he sat down rather wearily in one of the technician s swing stools  and his uniform  in which he had never been comfortable  took on a heavy and wrinkled appearance .   he said   i ll miss it all after a grisly fashion .  it s hard to remember when we weren t at war with deneb  and it seems against nature now to be at peace and to look at the stars without anxiety .    the two men with the executive director of the solar federation were both younger than swift .  neither was as gray .  neither looked quite as tired .   john henderson  thin lipped and finding it hard to control the relief he felt in the midst of triumph  said   they re destroyed .  they re destroyed .  it s what i keep saying to myself over and over and i still can t believe it .  we all talked so much  over so many years  about the menace hanging over earth and all its worlds  over every human being  and all the time it was true  every word of it .  and now we re alive and it s the dene bians who are shattered and destroyed .  they ll be no menace now  ever again .     thanks to multivac   said swift  with a quiet glance at the imperturbable jablonsky  who through all the war had been chief interpreter of science s oracle .   right  max .    jablonsky shrugged .  automatically  he reached for a cigarette and decided against it .  he alone  of all the thousands who had lived in the tunnels within multivac  had been allowed to smoke  but toward the end he had made definite efforts to avoid making use of the privilege .   he said .   well  that s what they say .   his broad thumb moved in the direction of his right shoulder  aiming upward .    jealous  max .     because they re shouting for multivac .  because multivac is the big hero of mankind in this war .   jablonsky s craggy face took on an air of suitable contempt .  what s that to me .  let multivac be the machine that won the war  if it pleases them .    henderson looked at the other two out of the corners of his eyes .  in this short interlude that the three had instinctively sought out in the one peaceful corner of a metropolis gone mad  in this entr acte between the dangers of war and the difficulties of peace  when  for one moment  they might all find surcease  he was conscious only of his weight of guilt .   suddenly  it was as though that weight were too great to be borne longer .  it had to be thrown off  along with the war  now .   henderson said   multivac had nothing to do with victory .  it s just a machine .     a big one   said swift .    then just a big machine .  no better than the data fed it .   for a moment  he stopped  suddenly unnerved at what he was saying .   jablonsky looked at him  his thick fingers once again fumbling for a cigarette and once again drawing back .   you should know .  you supplied the data .  or is it just that you re taking the credit .     no   said henderson  angrily .   there is no credit .  what do you know of the data multivac had to use  predigested from a hundred subsidiary computers here on earth  on the moon  on mars  even on titan .  with titan always delayed and always that feeling that its figures would introduce an unexpected bias .     it would drive anyone triad   said swift  with gentle sympathy .   henderson shook his head .   it wasn t just that .  i admit that eight years ago when i replaced lepont as chief programmer  i was nervous .  but there was an exhilaration about things in those days .  the war was still long range  an adventure without real danger .  we hadn t reached the point where manned vessels had had to take over and where interstellar warps could swallow up a planet clean  if aimed correctly .  but then  when the real difficulties began     angrily   he could finally permit anger   he said   you know nothing about it .     well   said swift .   tell us .  the war is over .  we ve won .     yes .   henderson nodded his head .  he had to remember that .  earth had won so all had been for the best .   well  the data be came meaningless .       meaningless .  you mean that literally .   said jablonsky .    literally .  what would you expect .  the trouble with you two was that you weren t out in the thick of it .  you never left multi vac  max  and you  mr .  director  never left the mansion except on state visits where you saw exactly what they wanted you to see .     i was not as unaware of that  said swift   as you may have thought .     do you know   said henderson   to what extent data concerning our production capacity  our resource potential  our trained man power   everything of importance to the war effort  in fact   had become unreliable and untrustworthy during the last half of the war .  group leaders  both civilian and military  were intent on projecting their own improved image  so to speak  so they obscured the bad and magnified the good .  whatever the machines might do  the men who programed them and interpreted the results had their own skins to think of and competitors to stab .  there was no way of stopping that .  i tried  and failed .     of course   said swift  in quiet consolation .   i can see that you would .    this time jablonsky decided to light his cigarette .   yet i presume you provided multivac with data in your programing .  you said nothing to us about unreliability .     how could i tell you .  and if i did  how could you afford to believe me .   demanded henderson  savagely .   our entire war effort was geared to multivac .  it was the one great weapon on our side  for the denebians had nothing like it .  what else kept up morale in the face of doom but the assurance that multivac would always predict and circumvent any denebian move  and would always direct and prevent the circumvention of our moves .  great space  after our spy warp was blasted out of hyp erspace we lacked any reliable denebian data to feed multivac and we didn t dare make that public .     true enough  said swift .     well  then   said henderson   if i d told you the data was unreliable  what could you have done but replace me and refuse to believe me .  i couldn t allow that .     what did you do .   said jablonsky .    since the war is won  i ll tell you what i did .  i corrected the data .     how .   asked swift .    intuition  i presume .  i juggled them till they looked right .  at first  i hardly dared .  i changed a bit here and there to correct what were obvious impossibilities .  when the sky didn t collapse about us  i got braver .  toward the end  i scarcely cared .  i just wrote out the necessary data as it was needed .  i even had the multivac annex prepare data for me according to a private programming pattern i had devised for the purpose .     random figures .   said jablonsky .    not at all .  i introduced a number of necessary biases .    jablonsky smiled  quite unexpectedly  his dark eyes sparkling behind the crinkling of the lower lids .   three times a report was brought me about unauthorized uses of the annex  and i let it go each time .  if it had mattered  i would have followed it up and spotted you  john  and found out what you were doing .  but  of course  nothing about multivac mattered in those days  so you got away with it .     what do you mean  nothing mattered .   asked henderson  suspiciously .    nothing did .  i suppose if i had told you this at the time  it would have spared you your agony  but then if you had told me what you were doing  it would have spared me mine .  what made you think multivac was in working order  whatever the data you supplied it .     not in working order .   said swift .    not really .  not reliably .  after all  where were my technicians in the last years of the war .  i ll tell you  they were feeding computers on a thousand different space devices .  they were gone .  i had to make do with kids i couldn t trust and veterans who were out of date .  besides  do you think i could trust the solid state components coming out of cryogenics in the last years .  cryogenics wasn t any better placed as far as personnel was concerned than i was .  to me  it didn t matter whether the data being supplied multivac were reliable or not .  the results weren t reliable .  that much i knew .     what did you do .   asked henderson .    i did what you did  john .  i introduced the bugger factor .  i adjusted matters in accordance with intuition   and that s how the machine won the war .    swift leaned back in the chair and stretched his legs out before him .   such revelations .  it turns out then that the material handed me to guide me in my decision making capacity was a man made interpretation of man made data .  isn t that right .     it looks so   said jablonsky .    then i perceive i was correct in not placing too much reliance upon it   said swift .    you didn t .   jablonsky  despite what he had just said  managed to look professionally insulted .    i m afraid i didn t .  multivac might seem to say  strike here  not there  do this  not that  wait  don t act .  but i could never be certain that what multivac seemed to say  it really did say  or what it really said  it really meant .  i could never be certain .     but the final report was always plain enough  sir   said jablonsky .    to those who did not have to make the decision  perhaps .  not to me .  the horror of the responsibility of such decisions was unbearable and not even multivac was sufficient to remove the weight .  but the point is i was justified in doubting and there is tremendous relief in that .    caught up in the conspiracy of mutual confession  jablonsky put titles aside .   what was it you did then  lamar .  after all  you did make decisions .  how .     well  it s time to be getting back perhaps but   i ll tell you first .  why not .  i did make use of a computer  max  but an older one than multivac  much older .    he groped in his own pocket for cigarettes  and brought out a package along with a scattering of small change  old fashioned coins dating to the first years before the metal shortage had brought into being a credit system tied to a computer complex .   swift smiled rather sheepishly .   i still need these to make money seem substantial to me .  an old man finds it hard to abandon the habits of youth .   he put a cigarette between his lips and dropped the coins one by one back into his pocket .   he held the last coin between his fingers  staring absently at it .   multivac is not the first computer  friends  nor the best known  nor the one that can most efficiently lift the load of decision from the shoulders of the executive .  a machine did win the war  john  at least a very simple computing device did  one that i used every time i had a particularly hard decision to make .    with a faint smile of reminiscence  he flipped the coin he held .  it glinted in the air as it spun and came down in swift s outstretched palm .  his hand closed over it and brought it down on the back of his left hand .  his right hand remained in place  hiding the coin .    heads or tails  gentlemen .   said swift .     one of the side effects of the growing respectability of science fiction was that it began to appear in markets where  a few short years earlier  the sanitation department would have been called in to remove any such manuscripts that had inadvertently found their way into the editorial office .   i ll never forget the shock that rumbled through the entire world of science fiction fandom when  after world war ii  our own robert a .  heinlein broke the  slicks  barrier by having an undiluted science fiction story of his published in the saturday evening post .   nowadays  it is routine to find science fiction writers and their science fiction in such wide circulation markets as playboy .  indeed  the competition of the mass markets is such that the small speciality science fiction magazines find it hard to hold on to the more experienced writers and they do not benefit  as they ought  from the field s new won respectability .  it is unjust .   but the strangest market for science fiction  in my opinion  was the advertising columns of that excellent and  for me  indispensable  periodical  scientific american .  it seems that a company called hoffman electronics corporation got the idea of running a series of advertisements that would include a two page  minus one column  illustrated science fiction story   real science fiction stories by the acknowledged masters .  the final column would then be used to promote their product in a dignified manner .  there was no direct tie in between story and advertising and the writer was to have carte blanche  except that it would be nice to have the story involve communications in one form or another  since communications technology was what hoffman was selling  .   the challenge was interesting and artistic integrity was preserved  so when i was asked to do a story for the program  i accepted and wrote  my son  the physicist .   as you see  it deals with communications but is in no way a  commercial  for such things .  hoffman accepted the story without changing a word or a comma and it ran not only in the ad columns of scientific american but in fortune as well .   it was an experience  you may be sure  because it is not likely that my by line would ever have appeared in either magazine otherwise .  not under a piece of science fiction  anyway .   i am a little uneasy  though  as to how well the idea worked out .  there were only six such advertisements altogether  as far as i know  and then they stopped .  well  maybe they just had difficulty getting appropriate stories .  i don t know .   first appearance   scientific american  february      .            hoffman electronics corporation .     my son  the physicist    her hair was a light apple green in color  very subdued  very old fashioned .  you could see she had a delicate hand with the dye  the way they did thirty years ago  before the streaks and stipples came into fashion .   she had a sweet smile on her face  too  and a calm look that made something serene out of elderliness .   arid  by comparison  it made something shrieking out of the confusion that enfolded her in the huge government building .   a girl passed her at a half run  stopped and turned toward her with a blank stare of astonishment .   how did you get in .    the woman smiled .   i m looking for my son  the physicist .     your son  the      he s a communications engineer  really .  senior physicist gerard cremona .     dr .  cremona .  well  he s   where s your pass .     here it is .  i m his mother .     well  mrs .  cremona  i don t know .  i ve got to   his office is down there .  you just ask someone .   she passed on  running .   mrs .  cremona shook her head slowly .  something had happened  she supposed .  she hoped gerard was all right .   she heard voices much farther down the corridor and smiled happily .  she could tell gerard s .   she walked into the room and said   hello  gerard .    gerard was a big man  with a lot of hair still and the gray just beginning to show because he didn t use dye .  he said he was too busy .  she was very proud of him and the way he looked .   right now  he was talking volubly to a man in army uniform .  she couldn t tell the rank  but she knew gerard could handle him .   gerard looked up and said   what do you   mother .  what are you doing here .    i was coming to visit you today .     is today thursday .  oh lord  i forgot .  sit down  mother  i can t talk now .  any seat .  any seat .  look  general .    general reiner looked over his shoulder and one hand slapped against the other in the region of the small of his back .   your mother .     yes .     should she be here .     right now  no  but i ll vouch for her .  she can t even read a thermometer so nothing of this will mean anything to her .  now look  general .  they re on pluto .  you see .  they are .  the radio signals can t be of natural origin so they must originate from human beings  from our men .  you ll have to accept that .  of all the expeditions we ve sent out beyond the planetoid belt  one turns out to have made it .  and they ve reached pluto .     yes  i understand what you re saying  but isn t it impossible just the same .  the men who are on pluto now were launched four years ago with equipment that could not have kept them alive more than a year .   that is my understanding .  they werex aimed at ganymede and seem to have gone eight times the proper distance .     exactly .  and we ve got to know how and why .  they may  just   have   had   help .     what kind .  how .    cremona clenched his jaws for a moment as though praying inwardly .   general   he said   i m putting myself out on a limb but it is just barely possible non humans are involved .  extraterrestrials .  we ve got to find out .  we don t know how long contact can be maintained .     you mean   the general s grave face twitched into an almost smile   they may have escaped from custody and they may be recaptured again at any time .     maybe .  maybe .  the whole future of the human race may depend on our knowing exactly what we re up against .  knowing it now .     all right .  what is it you want .     we re going to need army s multivac computer at once .  rip out every problem it s working on and start programing our general semantic problem .  every communications engineer you have must be pulled off anything he s on and placed into coordination with our own .     but why .  i fail to see the connection .    a gentle voice interrupted .   general  would you like a piece of fruit .  i brought some oranges .    cremona said  mother .  please .  later .  general  the point is a simple one .  at the present moment pluto is just under four billion miles away .  it takes six hours for radio waves  traveling at the speed of light  to reach from here to there .  if we say something  we must wait twelve hours for an answer .  if they say something and we miss it and say  what  and they repeat   bang goes a day .     there s no way to speed it up .   said the general .    of course not .  it s the fundamental law of communications .  no information can be transmitted at more than the speed of light .  it will take months to carry on the same conversation with pluto that would take hours between the two of us right now .     yes  i see that .  and you really think extra terrestrials are involved .     i do .  to be honest  not everyone here agrees with me .  still  we re straining every nerve  ever fiber  to devise some method of concentrating communication .  we must get in as many bits per second as possible and pray we get what we need before we lose contact .  and there s where i need multivac and your men .  there must be some communications strategy we can use that will reduce the number of signals we need send out .  even an increase of ten per cent in efficiency can mean perhaps a week of time saved .    the gentle voice interrupted again .   good grief  gerard  are you trying to get some talking done .     mother .   there was a hysterical edge to cremona s voice .    well  all right  but if you re going to say something and then wait twelve hours for an answer  you re silly .  you shouldn t .    the general snorted .   dr .  cremona  shall we consult      just one moment  general   said cremona .   what are you getting at  mother .     while you re waiting for an answer   said mrs .  cremona  earnestly   just keep on transmitting and tell them to do the same .  you talk all the time and they talk all the time .  you have someone listening all the time and they do  too .  if either one of you says anything that needs an answer  you can slip one in at your end  but chances are  you ll get all you need without asking .    both men stared at her .   cremona whispered   of course .  continuous conversation .  just twelve hours out of phase  that s all .  god  we ve got to get going .    he strode out of the room  virtually dragging the general with him  then strode back in .    mother   he said   if you ll excuse me  this will take a few hours  i think .  i ll send in some girls to talk to you .  or take a nap  if you d rather .     i ll be all right  gerard   said mrs .  cremona .    only  how did you think of this  mother .  what made you suggest this .     but  gerard  all women know it .  any two women   on the video phone  or on the stratowire  or just face to face   know that the whole secret to spreading the news is  no matter what  to just keep talking .    cremona tried to smile .  then  his lower lip trembling  he turned and left .   mrs .  cremona looked fondly after him .  such a fine man  her son  the physicist .  big as he was and important as he was  he still knew that a boy should always listen to his mother .     i have a rule which i state loudly on every possible occasion .  the rule is that i never write anything unless i am asked to do so .  that sounds awfully haughty and austere  but it s a fake .  as a matter of fact  i take it for granted that the various science fiction magazines and certain of my book publishers have standing requests for material  so i write  for them freely .  it s just the scattering of others that have to ask .   in       i was finally asked by playboy to write a story for them .  they sent me a dim photograph of a clay head  without ears  and with the other features labeled in block letters  and asked me to write a story based on that photo .  two other writers were also asked to write a story based on that same photo and all three stories were to be published together .   it was an interesting challenge and i was tempted .  i wrote  eyes do more than see  .   in case i have given the impression in the previous introductions in this volume that my writing career has been one long succession of triumphs ever since  nightfall   that with me  to write is to sell  that i wouldn t recognize a rejection slip if some fellow writer showed me one   rest easy  it is not so .    eyes do more than see  was rejected with muscular vigor .  the manuscript came flying through my window all the way from chicago  bounced off the wall and lay there quivering .   at least that s how it seemed .   the other two stories were accepted by playboy  and a third story  by someone hastily called in to backstop me  was also accepted .   fortunately  i am a professional of enviable imperturbability and these things do not bother me .  i doubt whether anyone could have guessed that i was disturbed except for the short screaming fit of rage i indulged myself with .   i checked with playboy and made sure the story was mine to do with as i pleased  despite the fact that it was based on their photo .  it was .   my next step was to send the story to f   sf explaining to them  as is my wont in such cases   that it was a reject and giving them the exact circumstances .  they took it  anyway .   fortunately  f   sf works reasonably quickly and playboy works abominably slowly .  consequently  eyes do more than see  appeared in f   sf a year and a half before the story triad appeared in playboy .  i spent an appreciable length of time hoping playboy would get indignant letters complaining that the situations in the triad had been stolen from an asimov story .  i was even tempted to write such a letter myself under a false name  but i didn t  .   i contented myself  instead  with the thought that by the time playboy had published its triad  my little story had not only been published elsewhere but had been reprinted twice and was slated to appear in still a third anthology .   and this collection represents a fourth  and how do you like that  mr .  hefner .    first appearance   the magazine of fantasy and science fiction  april      .            by mercury press  inc .     eyes do more than see    after hundreds of billions of years  he suddenly thought of himself as ames .  not the wavelength combination which  through all the universe was now the equivalent of ames   but the sound itself .  a faint memory came back of the sound waves he no longer heard and no longer could hear .   the new project was sharpening his memory for so many more of the old  old  eons old things .  he flattened the energy vortex that made up the total of his individuality and its lines of force stretched beyond the stars .   brock s answering signal came .   surely  ames thought  he could tell brock .  surely he could tell somebody .   brock s shifting energy pattern communed   aren t you coming  ames .     of course .     will you take part in the contest .     yes .   ames  lines of force pulsed eratically .   most certainly .  i have thought of a whole new art form .  something really unusual .     what a waste of effort .  how can you think a new variation can be thought of after two hundred billion years .  there can be nothing new .    for a moment brock shifted out of phase and out of communion  so that ames had to hurry to adjust his lines of force .  he caught the drift of other thoughts as he did so  the view of the powdered galaxies against the velvet of nothingness  and the lines of force pulsing in endless multitudes of energy life  lying between the galaxies .   ames said   please absorb my thoughts  brock .  don t close out .  i ve thought of manipulating matter .  imagine .  a symphony of matter .  why bother with energy .  of course  there s nothing new in energy  how can there be .  doesn t that show we must deal with matter .     matter .    ames interpreted brock s energy vibrations as those of disgust .   he said   why not .  we were once matter ourselves back  back   oh  a trillion years ago anyway .  why not build up objects in a matter medium  or abstract forms or   listen  brock   why not build up an imitation of ourselves in matter  ourselves as we used to be .    brock said   i don t remember how that was .  no one does .     i do   said ames with energy   i ve been thinking of nothing else and i am beginning to remember .  brock  let me show you .  tell me if i m right .  tell me .     no .  this is silly .  it s   repulsive .     let me try  brock .  we ve been friends  we ve pulsed energy together from the beginning   from the moment we became what we are  brock  please .     then  quickly .    ames had not felt such a tremor along his own lines of force in   well  in how long .  if he tried it now for brock and it worked he could dare manipulate matter before the assembled energy beings who had so drearily waited over the eons for something new .   the matter was thin out there between the galaxies  but ames gathered it  scraping it together over the cubic light years  choosing the atoms  achieving a clayey consistency and forcing matter into an ovoid form that spread out below .    don t you remember  brock .   he asked softly .   wasn t it something like this .    brock s vortex trembled in phase .   don t make me remember .  i don t remember .     that was the head .  they called it the head .  i remember it so clearly  i want to say it .  i mean with sound .   he waited  then said   look  do you remember that .    on the upper front of the ovoid appeared head .    what is that .   asked brock .    that s the word for head .  the symbols that meant the word in sound .  tell me you remember  brock .     there was something   said brock hesitantly   something in the middle .   a vertical bulge formed .   ames said   yes .  nose  that s it .   and nose appeared upon it .   and those are eyes on either side   left eye   right eye .   ames regarded what he had formed  his lines of force pulsing slowly .  was he sure he liked this .    mouth   he said  in small quiverings   and chin and adam s apple  and the collarbones .  how the words come back to me .   they appeared on the form .   brock said   i haven t thought of them for hundreds of billions of years .  why have you reminded me .  why .    ames was momentarily lost in his thoughts   something else .  organs to hear with  something for the sound waves .  ears .  where do they go .  i don t remember where to put them .    brock cried out   leave it alone .  ears and all else .  don t remember  .    ames said  uncertainly   what is wrong with remembering .     because the outside wasn t rough and cold like that but smooth and warm .  because the eyes were  tender and alive and the lips of the mouth trembled and were soft on mine .   brock s lines of force beat and wavered  beat and wavered .   ames said   i m sorry .  i m sorry .     you re reminding me that once i was a woman and knew love  that eyes do more than see and i have none to do it for me .   with violence  she added matter to the rough hewn head and said   then let them do it  and turned and fled .   and ames saw and remembered  too  that once he had been a man .  the force of his vortex split the head in two and he fled back across the galaxies on the energy track of brock   back to the endless doom of life .   and the eyes of the shattered head of matter still glistened with the moisture that brock had placed there to represent tears .  the head of matter did that which the energy beings could do no longer and it wept for all humanity  and for the fragile beauty of the bodies they had once given up  a trillion years ago .     in the spring of        received an interesting request .   it seems there is a periodical called abbottempo  supported by abbott laboratories  a respected pharmaceutical firm .  it is a slick paper  impressively designed job  with excellent articles on various medical and near medical subjects .  it is printed in the netherlands and is distributed free of charge to physicians in great britain and on the continent .  it is not distributed in the united states .   the editor of abbottempo wrote to ask me to write a      word  science fiction story on a subject of medical interest that physicians would find at once interesting  amusing  and thought provoking .   i was just as swamped with work at that moment as i am at all other moments  so i sighed and put a piece of letter paper in the typewriter  intending to write out a polite refusal .   unfortunately  or fortunately  it takes time to pick up letter paper and a yellow second sheet  put a piece of carbon paper in the typewriter .  it takes additional time to center the paper properly  type the date  address  and salutation .   what with all that time  i happened to think up a story i couldn t resist  so when i actually got past  dear sir   i found myself typing a polite acceptance .   i wrote  segregationist  in april       on a theme that was completely and entirely science fictional .  it appeared in december       just in time to be slightly behind the headlines in some respects .   the nicest result of t . he publication of the story  by the way  was that abbottempo published it in each of their eight editions .  they sent me a boxed collection of each set in    english     french     spanish     german     italian     japanese     greek  and    turkish  and the set remains one of the more interesting oddities of my personal library of asimoviana .   first appearance   abbottempo  book         .  copyright        by isaac asimov .     segregationist    the surgeon looked up without expression .   is he ready .     ready is a relative term  said the med eng .   we re ready .  he s restless .     they always are well  it s a serious operation .     serious or not  he should be thankful .  he s been chosen for it over an enormous number of possibles and frankly  i don t think .  .  .  .     don t say it   said the surgeon .   the decision is not ours to make .     we accept it .  but do we have to agree .     yes   said the surgeon  crisply .   we agree .  completely and wholeheartedly .  the operation is entirely too intricate to approach with mental reservations .  this man has proven his worth in a number of ways and his profile is suitable for the board of mortality .     all right   said the med eng  unmollified .   the surgeon said  til see him right in here  i think .  it is small enough and personal enough to be comforting .     it won t help .  he s nervous  and he s made up his mind .     has he indeed .     yes .  he wants metal  they always do .    the surgeon s face did not change expression .  he stared at his hands .   sometimes one can talk them out of it .     why bother .   said the med eng  indifferently .   if he wants metal  let it be metal .     you don t care .    why should i .   the med eng said it almost brutally .   either way it s a medical engineering problem and i m a medical engineer .  either way  i can handle it .  why should i go beyond that .    the surgeon said stolidly   to me  it is a matter of the fitness of things      fitness .  you can t use that as an argument .  what does the patient care about the fitness of things .     i care .     you care in a minority .  the trend is against you .  you have no chance .     i have to try .   the surgeon waved the med eng into silence with a quick wave of his hand   no impatience to it  merely quickness .  he had already informed the nurse and he had already been signaled concerning her approach .  he pressed a small button and the double door pulled swiftly apart .  the patient moved inward in his motor chair  the nurse stepping briskly along beside him .    you may go  nurse   said the surgeon   but wait outside .  i will be calling you .   he nodded to the med eng  who left with the nurse  and the door closed behind them .   the man in the chair looked over his shoulder and watched them go .  his neck was scrawny and there were fine wrinkles about his eyes .  he was freshly shaven and the fingers of his hands  as they gripped the arms of the chair tightly  showed manicured nails .  he was a high priority patient and he was being taken care of .  but there was a look of settled peevishness on his face .   he said   will we be starting today .   the surgeon nodded .   this afternoon  senator .     i understand it will take weeks .     not for the operation itself  senator .  but there are a number of subsidiary points to be taken care of .  there are some circulatory renovations that must be carried through  and hormonal adjustments .  these are tricky things .     are they dangerous .   then  as though feeling the need for establishing a friendly relationship  but patently against his will  he added   .  .  .  doctor .    the surgeon paid no attention to the nuances of expression .  he said  flatly   everything is dangerous .  we take our time in order that it be less dangerous .  it is the time required  the skill of many individuals united  the equipment  that makes such operations available to so few  .  .  .     i know that   said the patient  restlessly .   i refuse to feel guilty about that .  or are you implying improper pressure .     not at all  senator .  the decisions of the board have never been questioned .  i mention the difficulty and intricacy of the operation merely to explain my desire to have it conducted in the best fashion possible .     well  do so  then .  that is my desire  also .    then i must ask you to make a decision .  it is possible to supply you with either of two types of cyber hearts  metal or  .  .  .    plastic .   said the patient  irritably .   isn t that the alternative you were going to offer  doctor .  cheap plastic .  i don t want that .  i ve made my choice .  i want the metal .     but .  .  .     see here .  i ve been told the choice rests with me .  isn t that so .    the surgeon nodded .   where two alternate procedures are of equal value from a medical standpoint  the choice rests with the patient .  in actual practice  the choice rests with the patient even when the alternate procedures are not of equal value  as in this case .    the patient s eyes narrowed .   are you trying to tell me the plastic heart is superior .     it depends on the patient .  in my opinion  in your individual case  it is .  and we prefer not to use the term  plastic .  it  . is a fibrous cyber heart .     it s plastic as far as i am concerned .     senator   said the surgeon  infinitely patient   that material is not plastic in the ordinary sense of the word .  it is a polymeric material true  but one that is far more complex than ordinary plastic .  it is a complex protein like fiber designed to imitate  as closely as possible  the natural structure of the human heart you now have within your chest .     exactly  and the human heart i now have within my chest is worn out although i am not yet sixty years old .  i don t want another one like it  thank you .  i want something better .     we all want something better for you  senator .  the fibrous cyber heart will be better .  it has a potential life of centuries .  it is absolutely non allergic  .  .  .     isn t that so for the metallic heart  too .     yes  it is   said the surgeon .   the metallic cyber is of titanium alloy that .  .  .     and it doesn t wear out .  and it is stronger than plastic .  or fiber or whatever you want to call it .     the metal is physically stronger  yes  but mechanical strength is not a point at issue .  its mechanical strength does you no particular good since the heart is well protected .  anything capable of reaching the heart will kill you for other reasons even if the heart stands up under manhandling .    the patient shrugged .   if i ever break a rib  i ll have that replaced by titanium  also .  replacing bones is easy .  anyone can have that done anytime .  i ll be as metallic as i want to be  doctor .    that is your right  if you so choose .  however  it is only fair to tell you that although no metallic cyber heart has ever broken down mechanically  a number have broken down electronically .     what does that mean .     it means that every cyber heart contains a pacemaker as part of its structure .  in the case of the metallic variety  this is an electronic device that keeps the cyber in rhythm .  it means an entire battery of miniaturized equipment must be included to alter the heart s rhythm to suit an individual s emotional and physical state .  occasionally something goes wrong there and people have died before that wrong could be corrected .     i never heard of such a thing .     i assure you it happens .     are you telling me it happens often .     not at all .  it happens very rarely .     well  then  i ll take my chance .  what about the plastic heart .  doesn t that contain a pacemaker .     of course it does  senator .  but the chemical structure of a fibrous cyber heart is quite close to that of human tissue .  it can respond to the ironic and hormonal controls of the body itself .  the total complex that need be inserted is far simpler than in the case of the metal cyber .     but doesn t the plastic heart ever pop out of hormonal control .     none has ever yet done so .     because you haven t been working with them long enough .  isn t that so .    the surgeon hesitated .   it is true that the fibrous cybers have not been used nearly as long as the metallic .     there you are .  what is it anyway  doctor .  are you afraid i m making myself into a robot  .  .  .  into a metallo  as they call them since citizenship went through .     there is nothing wrong with a metallo as a metallo .  as you say  they are citizens .  but you re not a metallo .  you re  a human being .  why not stay a human being .     because i want the best and that s a metallic heart .  you see to that .    the surgeon nodded .   very well .  you will be asked to sign the necessary permissions and you will then be fitted with a metal heart .     and you ll be the surgeon in charge .  they tell me you re the best .     i will do what i can to make the changeover an easy one .   the door opened and the chair moved the patient out to the waiting nurse .   the med eng came in  looking over his shoulder at the receding patient until the doors had closed again .   he turned to the surgeon .   well  i can t tell what happened just by looking at you .  what was his decision .    the surgeon bent over his desk  punching out the final items for his records .   what you predicted .  he insists on the metallic cyber heart .     after all  they are better .     not significantly .  they ve been around longer  no more than that .  it s this mania that s been plaguing humanity ever since metallos have become citizens .  men have this odd desire to make metallos out of themselves .  they yearn for the physical strength and endurance one associates with them .     it isn t one sided  doc .  you don t work with metallos but i do  so i know .  the last two who came in for repairs have asked for fibrous elements .     did they get them .     in one case  it was just a matter of supplying tendons  it didn t make much difference there  metal or fiber .  the other wanted a blood system or its equivalent .  i told him i couldn t  not without a complete rebuilding of the structure of his body in fibrous material i suppose it will come to that some day .  metallos that aren t really metallos at all  but a kind of flesh and blood .     you don t mind that thought .     why not .  and metallized human beings  too .  we have two varieties of intelligence on earth now and why bother with two .  let them approach each other and eventually we won t be able to tell the difference .  why should we want to .  we d have the best of both worlds  the advantages of man combined with those of robot .     you d get a hybrid   said the surgeon  with something that approached fierceness .   you d get something that is not both  but neither .  isn t it logical to suppose an individual would be too proud of his structure and identity to want to dilute it with something alien .  would he want mongrelization .     that s segregationist talk .    then let it be that .   the surgeon said with calm emphasis   i believe in being what one is .  i wouldn t change a bit of my own structure for any reason .  if some of it absolutely required replacement  i would have that replacement as close to the original in nature as could possibly be managed .  i am myself  well pleased to be myself  and would not be anything else .    he had finished now and had to prepare for the operation .  he placed his strong hands into the heating oven and let them reach the dull red hot glow that would sterilize them completely .  for all his impassioned words  his voice had never risen  and on his burnished metal face there was  as always  no sign of expression .
