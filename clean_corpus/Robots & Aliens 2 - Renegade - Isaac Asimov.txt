notable robots  by isaac asimov    my robot stories and novels seem to have become classics in their own right  and  with the advent of the    robot city    series of novels  to have become the wider literary universe of other writers as well .  under those circumstances  it might be useful to go over my robot stories and describe some of those which i think are particularly significant and to explain why i think they are .     .     robbie       this is the first robot story i wrote .  i turned it out between may    and may    of       when i was    years old and was just about to graduate college .  i had a little trouble placing it  for john campbell rejected it and so did amazing stories .  however  fred pohl accepted it on march          and it appeared in the september      issue of super science stories  which he edited .  fred pohl  being fred pohl  changed the title to    strange playfellow    but i changed it back when i included it in my book i  robot and it has appeared as    robbie    in every subsequent incarnation .   aside from being my first robot story     robbie    is significant because in it george weston says to his wife in defense of a robot that is fulfilling the role of nursemaid     he just can t help being faithful and loving and kind .  he s a machine   made so .     this is the first indication  in my first story  of what eventually became the    first law of robotics    and of the basic fact that robots were made with built in safety rules .     .     reason         robbie    would have meant nothing in itself  if i had written no more robot stories  particularly since it appeared in one of the minor magazines .  however  i wrote a second robot story     reason     and that one  john campbell liked .  after a bit of revision  it appeared in the april      issue of astounding science fiction and there it attracted notice .  readers became aware that there was such a thing as the    positronic robots     and so did campbell .  that made everything afterward possible .     .     liar .       in the very next issue of astounding  that of may       my third robot story     liar .     appeared .  the importance of this story was that it introduced susan calvin  who became the central character in my early robot stories .  this story was originally rather clumsily done  largely because it dealt with the relationship between the sexes at a time when i had not yet had my first date with a young lady .  fortunately  i m a quick learner and it is one story in which i made significant changes before allowing it to appear in i  robot .     .     runaround      the next important robot story appeared in the march      issue of astounding .  it was the first story in which i listed the three laws of robotics explicitly instead of making them implicit .  in it  i have one character  gregory powell  say to another  michael donovan     now  look  let s start with the three fundamental rules of robotics   the three rules that are built most deeply into a robot s positronic brain .     he then recites them .   later on  i called them the laws of robotics  and their importance to me is three fold .   a   they guided me in forming my plots and made it possible to write many short stories  and several novels in addition  based on robots .  in these  i constantly studied the consequences of the three laws   b   it was by all odds my most famous literary invention  quoted in season and out by others .  if all i have written is someday to be forgotten  the three laws of robotics will surely be the last to go   c    the passage in    runaround    quoted above happens to be the very first time the word    robotics    was used in print in the english language .  i am therefore credited with the invention of the word  and also    robotic         positronic    and    psychohistory     by the oxford english dictionary  which takes the trouble   and the space   to quote the three laws .   all these things were created by my   nd birthday and i seem to have created nothing since  which gives rise to grievous thoughts within me .      .     evidence      this was the one and only story i wrote while i spent   months and    days in the army .  at one point i persuaded a kindly librarian to let me remain in the locked library over lunch so that i could work on the story .  it is the first story in which i made use of a humanoid robot .  stephen byerley  the humanoid robot in question  though in the story i don t make it absolutely clear whether he is a robot or not  represents my first approach toward r .  daneel olivaw  the humaniform robot who appears in a number of my novels .     evidence    appeared in the september      issue of astounding science fiction .     .     little lost robot      my robots tend to be benign entities .  in fact  as the stories progressed they gradually gained in moral and ethical qualities until they far surpassed human beings and  in the case of daneel  approached the god like .  nevertheless  i had no intention of limiting myself to robots as saviors .  i followed wherever the wild winds of my imagination led me and i was quite capable of seeing the uncomfortable sides of the robot phenomena .   it was only a few weeks ago  as i write this  that i received a letter from a reader that scolded me because  in a robot story of mine that had just been published  i showed the dangerous side of robots .  he accused me of a failure of nerve .   that he was wrong is shown by    little lost robot     in which a robot is the villain  even though it appeared nearly half a century ago .  the seamy side of robots is not the result of a failure in nerve that comes of my advancing age and decrepitude .  it has been a constant concern of mine all through my career .     .     the evitable conflict      this was a sequel to    evidence    and appeared in the june      issue of astounding .  it was the first story i wrote that dealt primarily with computers    called them    machines    in the story  rather than with robots per se .  the difference is not a great one .  you might define a robot as a    computerized machine    or as a    mobile computer .     you might consider a computer as an    immobile robot .     in any case  i clearly did not distinguish between the two  and although the machines  which don t make an actual physical appearance in the story  are clearly computers  i included the story  without hesitation  in my robot collection  i  robot  and neither the publisher nor the readers objected .  to be sure  stephen byerley is in the story but the question of his roboticity plays no role .     .     franchise      this was the first story in which i dealt with computers as computers  and had no thought in mind of their being robots .  it appeared in the august      issue of if  worlds of science fiction  and by that time i had grown familiar with the existence of computers .  my computer is    multivac     designed as an obviously larger and more complex version of the actually existing    univac .     in this story  and in some others of the period that dealt with multivac  i described it as an enormously large machine  missing the chance of predicting the miniaturization and etherealization of computers .     .     the last question      my imagination didn t betray me for long  however .  in    the last question     which appeared first in the november      issue of science fiction quarterly  i discussed the miniaturization and etherealization of computers and followed it through a trillion years of evolution  of both computer and man  to a logical conclusion that you will have to read the story to find .  it is  beyond question  my favorite among all the stories i have written in my career .      .     the feeling of power      the miniaturization of computers played a small role as a side issue in this story .  it appeared in the february      issue of if  and is also one of my favorites .  in this story i dealt with pocket computers  which were not to make their appearance in the marketplace until ten to fifteen years after the story appeared .  moreover  it was one of the stories in which i foresaw accurately a social implication of technological advance rather than the technological advance itself .   the story deals with the possible loss of ability to do simple arithmetic through the perpetual use of computers . i wrote it as a satire that combined humor with passages of bitter irony  but i wrote more truly than i knew .  these days i have a pocket computer and i begrudge the time and effort it would take me to subtract     from     .  i use the darned computer .     the feeling of power    is one of the most frequently anthologized of my stories .   in a way  this story shows the negative side of computers  and in this period i also wrote stories that showed the possible vengeful reactions of computers or robots that are mistreated .  for computers  there is    someday     which appeared in the august      issue of infinity science fiction  and for robots  in automobile form  see    sally     which appeared in the may june      issue of fantastic .      .     feminine intuition      my robots are almost always masculine  though not necessarily in an actual sense of gender .  after all  i give them masculine names and refer to them as    he .     at the suggestion of a female editor  judy lynn del rey  i wrote    feminine intuition     which appeared in the october      issue of the magazine of fantasy and science fiction .  it showed  for one thing  that i could do a feminine robot  too .  she was still metal  but she had a narrower waistline than my usual robots and had a feminine voice  too .  later on  in my book robots and empire  there was a chapter in which a humanoid female robot made her appearance .  she played a villainous role  which might surprise those who know of my frequently displayed admiration of the female half of humanity .      .     the bicentennial man      this story  which first appeared in      in a paperback anthology of original science fiction  stellar     edited by judy lynn del rey  was my most thoughtful exposition of the development of robots .  it followed them in an entirely different direction from that in    the last question .     what it dealt with was the desire of a robot to become a man and the way in which he carried out that desire  step by step .  again  i carried the plot all the way to its logical conclusion .  i had no intention of writing this story when i started it .  it wrote itself  and turned and twisted in the typewriter .  it ended as the third favorite of mine among all my stories .  ahead of it come only    the last question     mentioned above  and    the ugly little boy     which is not a robot story .      .  the caves of steel   meanwhile  at the suggestion of horace l .  gold  editor of galaxy  i had written a robot novel .  i had resisted doing so at first for i felt that my robot ideas only fit the short story length .  gold  however  suggested i write a murder mystery dealing with a robot detective .  i followed it partway .  my detective was a thoroughly human elijah baley  perhaps the most attractive character i ever invented  in my opinion  but he had a robot sidekick  r .  daneel olivaw .  the book  i felt  was the perfect fusion of mystery and science fiction .  it appeared as a three part serial in the october  november  and december      issues of galaxy and doubleday published it as a novel in      .   what surprised me about the book was the reaction of the readers .  while they approved of lije baley  their obvious interest was entirely with daneel  whom i had viewed as a mere subsidiary character .  the approval was particularly intense in the case of the women who wrote to me .   thirteen years after i had invented daneel  the television series star trek came out  with mr .  spock resembling daneel quite closely in character   something which did not bother me   and i noticed that women viewers were particularly interested in him  too .  i won t pretend to analyze this .       .  the naked sun   the popularity of lije and daneel led me to write a sequel     the naked sun     which appeared as a three part serial in the october  november  and december      issues of astounding and was published as a novel by doubleday in      .  naturally  the repetition of the success made a third novel seem the logical thing to do .  i even started writing it in       but things got in the way and  what with one thing and another  it didn t get written till      .      .  the robots of dawn   this  the third novel of the lije baley r .  daneel series  was published by doubleday in      .  in it  i introduced a second robot  r .  giskard reventlov  and this time i was not surprised when he turned out to be as popular as daneel .      .  robots and empire   when it was necessary to allow lije baley to die  of old age   i felt i would have no problem in doing a fourth book in the series provided i allowed daneel to live .  the fourth book  robots and empire  was published by doubleday in      .  lije s death brought some reaction  but nothing at all compared to the storm of regretful letters i received when the exigencies of the plot made it necessary for r .  giskard to die .   so it turns out that my robot stories have been almost as successful as my foundation books  and if you want to know the truth  in a whisper  of course  and please keep this confidential   i like my robot stories better .     here  in renegade  cordell scot ten has written an excellent example of why i like the robot stories .  a simple question arising from the laws      what is good for humans .       is developed into a complex and intriguing story .     chapter    the ceremyons    gently soaring   basking under the sun   the two blackbodies circled far above the shimmering atmospheric irregularity that was nearing completion on the planet s surface .  as high as a small mountain  the iridescent transparency  viewed from outside  covered a smooth hemispherical excavation in the planet s surface two kilometers in diameter  except for an open pie cut  a not yet covered sector ten degrees wide .  looking into the open sector  structures   built on ground not excavated  paradoxically    covered the entire inner area .  the most striking of these structures was a tall  stepped pyramid centered under the dome .   the blackbodies floated a wingspread apart  five times the armspread of an avery robot .  those beings   the avery robots   were even then streaming out of the incomplete sector  evacuating the dome .  the blackbodies had learned the name    avery robot     but the name lacked meaning beyond its intonation .      the construction was slowed by your absence yesterday  sarco     one blackbody said to the other     and i thank you for that .  you needed the day off .  unfortunately  the effort was only slowed .  it would have benefited by a complete interruption .         you are a rascal     the other said  his red eyes gleaming like bumming embers set deep in a black demonic body .     i ll bet you arranged for an avery to cut me loose during tether last night .  at least they ve learned not to blow us up .      the blackbodies appeared identical in form  a large white hook protruding from above deep set  luminous red eyes  a lacy silver frond languidly waving at the other end  but bodies otherwise devoid of visible detail except as flying winged silhouettes .  wrinkles in the skin  if any  and other possible lines of demarcation were lost in the soft blackness .      you were cut loose .     the first said .      don t play the innocent  synapo .  someone cut my tether last night  and by the time i drifted into sunrise  i was over barneup .  it took me all day to get back .  have you ever tried to grow a new hook while underway .         you do look a little beat .  but then so am i .  trying to make sense of wohler   is exhausting  and so far he s the best of the averies .  i learned very little today .  we could both do with early tether .  i ll see you in the morning  sarco .         wait up .  you re not getting off that easy .      but synapo had already balled and was dropping  if not like a rock  still at an appreciable rate that put him out of earshot in a trice .  sarco sighed   a soft gentle emission of pure oxygen with a faint trace of unreacted ammonia   but did not follow immediately .   as synapo approached the surface of the planet  he began braking  unfurling from his collar the tough filmy hide of his reflector  letting it flap and rattle in his wake as it dragged at him like a sea anchor .  as he neared the trees on the side of the domed transparency away from the open sector  he sealed the gores of the thin  shiny reflector  sealing all but his head inside  leaving his hook and eyes protruding from the underside .   with gentle bursts of compressed hydrogen  he began to inflate the reflector  dissipating his momentum and slowing his descent until he was barely drifting downward .  ten meters above the top of a tall conifer  he let go his chitinous hook  letting out the tether of tough  stringy hide until the hook was dangling below a sturdy limb .  a final burst of hydrogen filled the reflector  erasing the last crease to leave a smooth  unblemished  mirrorlike surface .  the tether twanged taut  caught between the now buoyant silvery balloon and the hooked limb of the tree .   synapo began the luxurious process of uncoiling his tense fibers  drifting into deep tether as he lay suspended within his own skin .  his storage cells were not sated with a day s thermoelectric output from the sun s radiant heat as they normally would have been if the aliens had not been disturbing the atmosphere  but little of the radiation he had been exposed to that day had escaped the nearly perfect blackbody absorption of his other skin .  that energy was all there  save only the small expenditure for intense thought and languid motion  and the large expenditure for electrolyzing water and compressing hydrogen  and the unusual expenditure that day to converse   if it could be called that   with wohler   .  still  he had a sufficient reserve of juice left in his cells .  it would take little to get him through the night  just that amount needed to maintain body temperature  to make up for the minuscule amount of energy lost by radiation from his silvery hide .   sarco stayed aloft until synapo tethered .  then he balled and dropped and tethered nearby so as to confront synapo the next morning  first thing .   the avery robots continued to stream from the open sector of the dome like ants abandoning an anthill .  dusk was coming on rapidly  but night would not hamper their operations .   wohler   stood just outside the open sector .  he had watched synapo and sarco drop  but had not distinguished them from the rest of the blackbodies which  a half hour later  began to fall from the sky like the gentle descent of a black snow that melted to bright raindrops as it neared the surface  raindrops inversely and miraculously suspended above the trees in defiance of gravity .     when the tiny amount of absorbed sunshine began to warm synapo s reflector the next morning  he awoke and began to deflate .  when his hook dangled free  he sucked in his tether and drifted to the ground  gently bouncing off the outer foliage of the tree .   when he reached the ground  he unsealed the front seam of his reflector and pulled it around him like a bathrobe to preserve his body heat .  on his two short legs  he waddled through the forest to a small brook .  sarco was already there  having breakfast and waiting for him .  his hook was turned to the back in nonaggressive posture  which was a good sign .  still  he was having breakfast .  you could hardly expect anything else .  anger cannot abide alongside intense creature satisfactions .   during the night  the feathery cold junction that protruded from synapo s rump had warmed  and the millions of hot junctions distributed throughout his lampblack hide had cooled  so that both cold and hot junctions were now at the same median temperature  and he had fasted throughout the night .  now as he backed up to the brook beside sarco  drew his reflector tight across his back to bunch it in front of him  and squatted to dip his cold junction into the icy water  he sighed contentedly as the fresh juice flowed into his storage cells .  that fresh shot each morning was the best juice to be had all day .   neither spoke  which was the custom at breakfast  nor would they speak until they were again on the wing .  speaking  unless forced by exigencies   such as the discussion with wohler     was strictly a waste process  using the oxygen discarded from the electrolytic production of vital hydrogen .  electrolyzing when their hydrogen sacs were full  merely to generate oxygen for speaking  was a luxury they seldom permitted themselves and a necessity only under the rarest of circumstances .   that morning  however  synapo again planned to allow himself only an hour on the wing before he resumed his discussion with wohler   .  he timed it so that he could watch the myostrians at work  as he had for the past several days .  he was depleting his cells to well below what he found comfortable   he went around continually hungry   but at least he would be generating hydrogen during the discussion and not wasting juice as he would be otherwise .  that was small comfort as his store of vital energy dropped lower and lower .  but synapo felt that discussion was vital  not for what it had revealed so far  but for what it promised to reveal in the future .   with breakfast over and the gores of their reflectors tightly rolled into black ruffled collars  they began the long climb to charge altitude .  synapo  with sarco following  slowly circled upward with languid but powerful strokes of his great wings .  he kept the hemispherical iridescence centered below  so that when he finished his short charge  he could drop rapidly to the open sector where he could see wohler   still standing vigil  right where he had been as synapo dropped to tether the evening before .   when they reached a comfortable altitude  synapo slowed his flapping and rolled onto his back  a wingspread below sarco  giving the other the dominant position as was his right as interrogator .  that had been the status of their conversation the afternoon before when synapo had terminated it unilaterally .      now  sarco  you were saying .         forget that     sarco said .     my tether was cut  and i was fuming yesterday evening  but it s no big deal .  a new hook and a night s rest and it s the same as forgotten .      good  synapo thought  but it wasn t an avery  it was my own burning breath which sent you into far sunrise .  he wouldn t have stooped to such a childish trick if the situation hadn t warranted it .  the thought of that piece of unstatesmanship lingered  unsettling his conscience .      what is important     sarco continued     is getting the weather back under control and stopping the godawful screeching of those tin aliens on hyperwave .  the weather i ll have under control as soon as my people finish neutralizing that node below .  i figure to have the compensator complete day after tomorrow .      but the hyperwave noise is about to drive us all nuts  synapo .  haven t those metal morons heard of continuous modulation .         of course .  that s the way they arrived     synapo said .     but their discrete modulation of hyperwave and our small discomfort with the crosstalk on our continuous channels is a minor problem .  the real problem is your construction of the node compensator .  it s a mistake  sarco .  you ll have deactivated the aliens only temporarily .  and if i m right  as i am more and more sure i am  you ll have succeeded merely in deactivating a bunch of servants  and probably not for long  but you will have irritated their masters sure as the great petero is our guide .         and the cerebrons  what have they come up with .  the myostrians are at least taking action .       in some contexts  the plural myostrian tribal name is better translated as myostria  and the racial name ceremyon is better translated as myoceron to reflect the myostrian point of view .       we had a caucus yesterday afternoon     synapo said .     all agree i m close to a breakthrough with wohler   .  whatever you do  don t close the compensator .  you ve already achieved better than     compensation .  meteorologically  you ve already won .         you ve got until sunpeak day after tomorrow to achieve your breakthrough  synapo .      there was no point in arguing further .  synapo rolled out from under sarco and drifted off to the left while climbing a temperature gradient to a slightly cooler stratum .  that inverted gradient so early in the day was a measure of the meteorological disturbance   the residual effects of the alien creations   the completed dome would eliminate .   after an hour of charge  he was still quite hungry  but nonetheless he balled and dropped  wind whistling through the feathery frond of his cold junction  until he neared the top of the dome .  then he slowly spread his wings  braking in a swoop that carried him on a complete circular inspection of the dome .   he made one more pass around the dome  lower now  looking for any sign of spacetime instability .  why did he care .  the dome could nave leaked like nimbar and it wouldn t have mattered to him .  it was a habit  though  a matter of professional pride  pride in his race  pride in sarco s people and the technology they shared with the cerebrons .   as he rounded again toward the open sector  he braked to a slow gentle glide and  stirring hardly a wisp of dust  came to rest beside the avery robot who called himself wohler   .   he now had a fairly good idea what an avery robot was .  he had a modest grasp of the language called galactic standard  and even though it was certainly not standard in their part of the galaxy  they had become aware of it from the occasional bursts of discrete hyperwave that had reached them beginning centuries before .  translation of the language had been slow and incomplete  lacking anything that might have served as a rosetta stone  but they had acquired a feeling for the language  in terms of the mathematical development of the species  and then with wohler   on hand   not quite an analogue of the rosetta stone   their fluency had progressed to the modest state synapo now claimed .      good morning  wohler       synapo said .   the robot slowly swiveled his head until the eyes bore intently on synapo  but otherwise he gave no sign of recognition .  that did not distress synapo .  in fact he expected it .  he now knew that the robot did not consider him a master  and so he was not worthy of attention unless he somehow violated the robot s basic programming  a prime directive and three guiding principles .   the prime directive was to erect the monstrosities that had played such havoc with their weather by energy and particulate emissions  and which were now covered and almost neutralized by the compensator .  the disturbance had been almost as great as that caused by the impact of a giant meteor a quarter century before .   the function of the monstrosities was still not clear  other than being creations for the masters .  with their benign weather   brought under control eons before   the notion of shelter and buildings  if it had ever existed  had long since disappeared from the racial memory of the blackbodies  lost in prehistory .      you properly informed your masters of our interference and asked for assistance more than a hand of days ago  if we translated your message correctly .  each day i have asked if you have received further instructions among the numerous messages that we have monitored in both directions .  your responses thus far have not been reassuring .  but now we have reason to suspect that you have received some clarification of the situation  if we understand a message you received yesterday morning .  i informed you of that message yesterday afternoon .  i now ask again .  have you received further instructions .      still the robot did not answer .  he had swiveled his head back to watch the procession of robots and vehicles passing out of the dome  heading north across the plain bordered by the forest .      we will complete the compensator   the dome   tomorrow  thwarting your prime directive     synapo added .   that brought a response .  wohler   turned to face synapo .      miss ariel welsh will deal with you when she arrives this afternoon     wohler   said  and swiveled back to watch the evacuation .   there was no point in attempting further dialogue .  synapo took off and headed for charge altitude and a cerebron caucus .     chapter    the domed pit    ariel welsh  in her typical fashion  came in too fast on a trajectory that was accordingly too flat  and she skipped off the planet s atmosphere like a flat stone hitting the surface of a millpond .      darn     she said  which seemed to understate the situation somewhat .  she turned the controls over to jacob winterson  saying     here  you do it .         you should have asked me earlier  miss ariel     the robot said .     you must save yourself for the negotiations with the aliens .  but i do have a few suggestions with regard to your approach trajectories in general  which should benefit .  .  .         put a lid on it  jake .     ariel said impatiently .  nonetheless she watched the robot closely and with a great deal of admiration  not only for his style of piloting but for his superb appearance as well .  she particularly liked to watch his biceps flex .   she had acquired the robot only months before  the whim of a spoiled rich girl  teasing a jealous boyfriend and rebelling against the mores of a bigoted auroran society .   robots like r .  jacob winterson were not popular on the planet of aurora .  neither the men nor the women of aurora wanted to be upstaged by the perfect comeliness and superhuman strength of a humaniform robot .  humaniform was the term their creator  dr .  han fastolfe  had used to describe them  searching for a better term than humanoid  which hardly sufficed to describe jacob .  the avery robots  like the one she had once known as wohler on the planet robot city  could also be described as humanoid  but they were a far cry from jacob .   the simulation of a well muscled body that was jacob winterson was a reflection of that era when bodybuilding was the vogue of a stagnant auroran society .   she watched him now as he plugged himself into the ship  a small two man jumper with a cockpit just big enough for the two of them .  she should have used the ship s computer to set up the proper approach trajectory  just as he was about to do  instead of coming in cowboy fashion  hands on .   she watched the thick muscles at work in his bull like neck  watched the flexing of biceps the size of piano legs  corded by thick veins reaching across his powerful forearms .   she had prevailed upon the ancient vasilia fastolfe  the estranged daughter of the famed or .  ran  to delve deep into the catacombs below aurora s robotics institute and bring out jacob from among the thirteen humaniforms left over from the aborted campaign to sell them to a recalcitrant auroran public .   she had never seen jacob naked  though derec didn t know that .  vasilia had brought him up from the depths fully clothed .  and then he seemed so real   so alive in the human sense   that ariel had never explored beneath the surface of the ample wardrobe she had provided him .  it seemed too much an invasion of privacy .   the idea appealed to her  she had to admit  but not so strongly as to overcome her loyalty to derec .  in her mind  her teasing was not a form of disloyalty  no matter how miserable it made derec .  like the myriads of young women who preceded her  she had no idea how miserable it really made him or she wouldn t have teased him .   on their third orbit  jacob located their destination  the beleaguered robot city wohler   had described by radio after they had jumped into the system .  derec was apparently not in the city at the time .  ariel had counted on hearing derec s voice .   their destination was the second largest iridescent domed pit they had seen on the planet  and the only one with a pie cut of city buildings that extended to the center of the shimmering pit .   jacob laid in a trajectory that would bring them through the atmosphere to a landing on the open plain half a kilometer north of the dome and near the path of evacuation of the avery robots  and then  with the help of the jumper s computer  he executed the maneuver flawlessly .  they disembarked less than fifty meters from the line of evacuation and commandeered a large courier robot carrying two packages .      return to the city   ariel said as she sat down on one of the packages and motioned jacob to sit down on the other one .  she would like to have said     take me to wohler     but the non positronic brain of the courier would not have been capable of interpreting and executing that command .   as they neared the open sector of the dome  towering a kilometer above them  ariel said     can you raise wohler on the radio  jacob .         i have  miss ariel     jacob replied .     he is standing over to the right of the opening in the dome .     the robot pointed and said     there by that large open lorry .      up close  the paradoxical nature of the huge iridescent bubble became more dramatic as ariel looked down through the flickering wall of the dome into a pit that seemed to underlie a city built on solid ground .  looking through the wall and the opening at the same time  the city seemed to float above the excavation .  it left her feeling decidedly uneasy .      take us to wohler     she said to the courier .  they disembarked at the lorry and walked up to wohler    an imposing gold machine standing at the front of the lorry and facing the stream of evacuating robots .      i am ariel welsh     she said .      i know     said wohler   .      what is going on here .     ariel asked .      we are moving the necessary materiel for construction of a second compass tower and city on the other side of the plain  five kilometers away .         why .         this dome will soon be closed by the aliens  blocking all traffic into and out of the city .         why .         that is not clear .         where is derec avery .         i do not know  since he is not on this planet .      ariel took a moment to absorb that .     when did he leave .         he has never been here     the golden robot replied .   now she felt slightly ill .  she had misunderstood that weak relay from a central computer  which had led her to believe derec would be here .  she had to keep talking  or scream .  she had thought she would see him so soon .      are all the supervisors here ninth generation .     she asked .      no .  i am the only ninth .  all others are eighth generation .         how did that come about .         wohler l sacrificed himself to rescue you from the side of robot city s compass tower during a life threatening thunderstorm  miss welsh .      the burundi s fever dr .  avery had exposed her to   amnemonic plague  so called   had robbed her of the links to her memory .  the memory had still been there  but she had lost the connections to it .  derec had helped restore those links by providing clues from their mutual experiences .  that particular experience involving wohler l must have been exceptionally potent  for now her mind orchestrated that clue into an unnerving symphony of emotion as the experience condensed into consciousness .  the guilt of causing the termination of that magnificent golden robot  laid on top of her misunderstanding of the relayed message from this planet  left her momentarily faint .   she swallowed hard to regain her composure and then said brusquely     what is the nature of the dome .  why not simply destroy it .         a simple demonstration will suffice to answer your question  miss welsh     wohler   replied .   he unclipped a meter long  chrome plated crowbar from the side of the lorry and started walking toward the edge that bordered the right side of the opening in the dome s glimmer .   ariel and jacob followed him  and as ariel approached the interior of the dome  getting a little ahead of wohler   in her impetuous fashion  she could see up close the soft blackness of the lining  a blackness that demarcated the end of the ground and the beginning of what seemed open space .  looking down at it sent her into a dizzying subjective vertigo .  she seemed to spin in that black space as it drew her down  sucking at her mind .      under no circumstances come closer than half a meter  miss welsh     wohler   said as he casually moved his arm in front of her .  with that warning she seemed to come to her senses  and she moved back out so that she was facing the edge from a distance of a few meters  her head cleared  and from that position she could now see along both the inside and outside walls .   wohler   then approached the edge of the wall to almost that half meter limit himself .  he stopped then  facing the inner wall  and said     and don t become confused .  the wall may seem deceptively far away .       he took a baseball batter s stance then  and with a lusty swing that brought the crowbar around in a horizontal arc perpendicular to the wall  he struck the edge of the dome with the middle of the crowbar .  without a sound  the edge of the dome  like the edge of a supersharp tool  cut the crowbar neatly in half .  the far end of the crowbar sailed off .  the near end stayed firmly in wohler   s hands as he completed his swing .   then he casually tossed the remnant toward the inside wall .   ariel s eyes had naturally followed the flight of the far end of the crowbar until it hit the ground and stopped skidding .  she looked back just as wohler   tossed the piece left in his hand toward the interior blackness .   that piece seemed to curve in toward the blackness a fraction of the distance it would have traveled if he had tossed it straight up in the air with the same force  and then it came shooting back out on a parabolic course obviously calculated to hit no one .  it landed behind him a distance equal to the distance it would have traveled in front of him if the wall had not been there .      now  a second demonstration will point up and clarify the dome s external characteristics     wohler   said .   he picked up the half crowbar that had just sailed back out of the blackness  walked over  tossed it into the lorry  and then unclipped two sections of a tubular pole from the side of the vehicle .  when he fitted the two sections together  he had a pole about five meters long .  from a locker he took a large piece of white cloth that he unfolded and tied to the pole to form a square flag a little less than four meters on a side .  with the flagpole in hand  he walked along the outside of the dome until he was three or four meters from the edge of the opening .  ariel followed him .   they were walking along the edge of a deep  shimmering hemispherical pit two kilometers across and a kilometer deep .  from that viewpoint there was no evidence of the city that they knew existed inside the shimmer .      under no circumstances let any part of your body touch or project into the transparent dome     wohler   said .     that part of you would go through and never be the same again .  now observe the flag .      he pushed the flag through the dome s glimmer .  it seemed to disappear .      perhaps it appears to be gone     he said  waving the pole     but look carefully at the far side of the pit .      at first ariel could see nothing unusual on the other side  but after a moment  after looking more carefully  she finally saw a tiny white flag waving  far away  two kilometers away  on the other side of the pit .   wohler   laid down the pole so that it still projected into the dome .  it did not lie flat on the ground .  the near end hung suspended  slanting into the dome at the ground .  the tiny flag on the other side of the pit had disappeared into the grass .      two further observations     wohler   said     for which we ll use the lorry .      he left the pole projecting into the dome  retrieved the other half of the crowbar from the deep grass  tossed it into the lorry beside the first half  and stepped in to stand at the driver s station .  ariel took a seat immediately behind the golden robot and jacob stepped up to stand beside wohler    who immediately took off down the west side of the dome  staying well away from the edge of the pit .   they were almost halfway around the dome before wohler   spoke again .      we should be coming to it now     he said .   and then ariel saw the white flag lying in the grass with the pole sticking out of the dome a few centimeters above the ground .   wohler   stopped the lorry .      you don t need to get out .      he stepped down from the lorry  picked up the pole carefully  as though it were a fragile memento  walked back  and offered the flag end to ariel .      take hold of the end     he said .   when she did  he moved his end as though to bend it in her grip  and it snapped in two .      passing through the dome distorts the crystal structure  setting up fault lines with very little strength .  now one last observation  this time inside the dome .      he drove back the way they had come and then drove through the opening  close to the right side .  the traffic pouring out of the dome gave way smoothly  shifting to its right to accommodate the lorry  as though a computer were directing all the traffic   which it was  of course  the city central computer .      we ll take the perimeter route to avoid bucking the traffic coming down main street     wohler   said     even though it will be a little longer this way  half pi times longer .      wohler   drove rapidly to a point half way around the perimeter of the dome .  he stopped at the same wide street  main street  which approached the dome as close as any .  ariel looked back down the street and saw the compass tower framed in the opening of the dome .   wohler   led them now to the dome wall opposite the end of the street and handed ariel a pair of binoculars as he pointed to a small bright object in the soft darkness of the inner wall .   ariel put the binoculars to her eyes  and with the focus wheel at the infinite setting  she could just barely make out a shape that had the appearance of a small two man flier headed toward them with its landing lights on .      this is our final test of the dome  which we began earlier this afternoon     wohler   said .     right now the flier is held by the gravity of the black concavity at a virtual distance of four kilometers .  it is headed toward us  but held motionless by the black concavity with the flier s impulse engines throttled back to     capacity  equivalent to an acceleration of ten gees .  we plan to bring it in now .  its fuel is almost depleted .      ariel had a hard time taking the binoculars away from her eyes .  she turned to hand them to jacob .      here  i want you to record this     she said .     i want you as a witness .  derec   s not apt to believe any of this .          thank you  miss ariel     jacob said     but with my    power binocular vision i have already recorded the unusual operation of this flier .      ariel was tired .  it had been a long day already .  altogether too much for one day .  too much sensory stimulation  too many strange ideas  too much emotion .  she missed derec and felt inadequate to the challenge presented by this alien world .      unless you have further exhibits and demonstrations  wohler     ariel said     i would like to shower and freshen up .  later  after some dinner  you can give me a detailed report .         i have just ordered in the flier  miss welsh     wohler   said .     we shall now proceed immediately to your apartment .      as they drove down the broad street toward the compass tower  the faint sound of the flier grew louder .  ariel turned to watch its lights growing brighter now in the soft darkness surrounding the city .  she had a hard time taking in everything she had seen in the short time she had known wohler   .   then she could see the flier growing larger with her naked eye  until it came hurtling out of the wall and screamed by overhead  spiraling up over the compass tower and out the opening in the dome .     chapter    wohler   s story    the laws of robotics      .  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .     .  a robot must protect its own existence  as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .     han fastolfe  an introduction to robotics   chapter    ancient technology .        now  wohler  i would like to hear this from the very beginning     ariel said .   she had just sat down to eat dinner .  they had arrived at the apartment an hour before   a small two bedroom flat on the second and top floor of a small building on main street  halfway toward the opening in the dome from the compass tower .   jacob stood quietly in a wall niche near the entrance to the apartment .  wohler   was standing attentively on the other side of the table from ariel .      i was the seventh and last of the supervisors to arrive by key teleportation on the morning of .  .  .     wohler intoned when ariel interrupted him .      no  wohler  not in quite that much detail     she said .      you do not want it from the very beginning  miss welsh .  you would like more of a summary .         yes .  and confine the summary to your interactions with the aliens and their erection of the dome .         very well .  we began cityforming the planetary surface with construction of the compass tower on the open plain one point zero two kilometers from the nearest forest vegetation .      we had progressed to the third floor of the compass tower when an unusual incident involving a witness occurred at the edge of the forest .      ariel interrupted him .     a witness robot .         yes  miss welsh .  to alert us to the migration of planetary life into the construction arena  we had established a rapid circular patrol of twelve witnesses on a perimeter two kilometers in diameter centered on the compass tower .      the unusual incident involved destructive bisection of a witness as it passed near the forest .         bisection  wohler .         yes  miss welsh .  the witness was cut in half .  just before the incident  that same witness had been observing the flight of several of the aliens we now call blackbodies to a point near the forest about twenty meters above where the incident occurred .      those observations by the witness constitute its last transmissions to core memory over the comlink .         switch to memory detail  wohler     ariel said quietly .      the blackbody flight pattern began just after the preceding witness had passed by .  a blackbody would fly to a point about twenty meters above the incident point  stall out  collapse into a ball  and drop to five meters above the ground .  at that point it would spread its wings and resume flight  swooping down and back up into the air  narrowly missing a collision with the ground .      a careful inspection of the witness s transmission shows a faint shimmering in the air coincident with the blackbody s resumption of flight .  the shimmering progressed rapidly toward the ground from the point of flight resumption .  the performance was repeated by a succession of blackbodies  and as the witness approached closer  it became apparent that on each cycle  the shimmering proceeded not only to the ground  but also back up  traversing the perimeter of a thin vertical area that grew taller with each successive pass .  the pattern was repeated rapidly by twenty one blackbodies before the witness arrived .  the blackness we see from the inside was not visible to the witness as he approached .  he was looking at the blackbody construction almost edge on  but slightly outside  moving in for a close up view .         the record ended at that point  of course     ariel said .      yes .  since that time  witness records show that to be the pattern of blackbody operation in constructing the dome .  as the construction progressed  the intersecting arcs traversed by the shimmer  and the point to which the blackbodies flew to begin each pass  rose in the air until it reached its present location .  that operation now begins at midmorning at a height of a little more than a kilometer directly over the compass tower and lasts for one hundred twenty passes of the blackbodies  which generally takes a little over an hour .         hour .         an ancient term from the vocabulary file .  it means one twenty fourth part .  the blackbody i conversed with used my access to central s files to search for an exact translation of their terminology  one twenty fourth part of the period of planetary rotation .         and do they divide that further  as we do with our centads .         yes .  their next division  into sixty parts  can be labeled  minutes  according to central .  the conversion of those units into our decads and centads gives  for the hour .  .  .         i am quite capable of making that conversion  wohler .         thus construction of the dome begins each day at ten am  and .  .  .         ten am .         at ten hours antemidday  or more exactly in the ancient terminology  ante meridiem  being before noon .  their day is divided into two twelve hour parts  am  before noon  and pm for post midday or after noon .         didn t it seem odd to your alien that he could find terms that seem to describe their technology in our ancient history files .         no .  by my recording  specifically in that regard  he remarked   how satisfying to find our own circadian rhythms   the metabolic divisions of our natural clocks   so faithfully reproduced in another species .            it seems darn odd to me     ariel said .     but to get on with this  at the time of the incident  the witness robot was sliced in half by the first elements of the present dome as its momentum carried it past the edge  just as the crowbar was cut in half earlier today .         yes     wohler replied .      you had had no interaction with the blackbodies until then     ariel said .      that is correct .         but then you began a dialogue .         no .  not immediately .         but not to do so was to violate the third law  wohler .         on the contrary  miss welsh  we chose to comply with the third law by retaliation .         but  wohler  that violated the first law  which protects intelligent life .         no  miss welsh  it does not .  it protects humans .         it protects wolruf .       wolruf was a dog like alien  a friend of both ariel and derec .  they had been through several unpleasant experiences together  starting with an alien pirate by the name of aranimus who had held all three of them prisoner at one time .  that was when they had first met wolruf .      but only because master derec chose to make an exception     wohler   said .     dr .  avery s original programming made no such exceptions .  the first law now protects humans and wolruf .  but our definition of a human being is quite narrow .  it certainly does not include the blackbodies .      dr .  avery was derec avery s father and the erratic  egocentric scientist who had created the original planetary robot city .  he had suppressed his teenage son s memory and subjected him to irrational experiments in bizarre situations on and off the robot city planet .  derec had learned a great deal about himself  but avery left robot city without restoring derec s memory .      proceed  wohler     ariel said .     how did you retaliate .         we attempted to stop construction of the dome by intercepting the flight path of the aliens  ramming them with a one man flier  but it was not entirely successful .  the alien was destroyed  but so was the flier and the robot pilot .  spectrographic and flame temperature records support a hydrogen explosion as the cause of failure .         so then you started a dialogue     ariel said .      no .  logic dictated that we determine why a hydrogen explosion caused the failure  so we decided to trap and examine an alien .      at night  the blackbodies convert into silver balloons which they anchor to the tops of trees .  we successfully captured one which had anchored to a tree on the very edge of the forest five kilometers away .  we easily unhooked its anchor line after cutting the tree down .      however  in order to examine the alien  it was necessary to first remove the balloon which surrounded it .  again a hydrogen explosion destroyed the alien and the surgeon when he attempted to cut the balloon away with a laser scalpel .         it figures     ariel said with a sigh .     so then you initiated a dialogue .  surely .         no .  one or more of the aliens had been confronting robots all around the compass tower construction site for three and a half days  but our programming did not require us to grant recognition  and we were  of course  quite busy erecting the compass tower  which had to be completed before work on the general city could begin .  understandably  we paid no attention to their confrontations  until i personally was confronted by one of the blackbodies .  that happened immediately after we lost the surgeon and his laser scalpel .  it then occurred to me  when i was confronted  that by conversing with the alien  i might find out what the surgeon was seeking  and i was then compelled by the third law to do so .  the third law says .  .  .         i know  i know     ariel said .     so then you initiated the dialogue .         no .  surely it is clear by now  miss welsh  that the alien initiated the dialogue .         so it seems     ariel said with resignation coloring her voice .     i wouldn t want it any other way .         on the contrary .  it is now quite apparent that if i had initiated the dialogue earlier .  .  .         you re quite right  wohler .  but you need not feel bad for all that .         i understand technically that you can be affected in that manner  but i am incapable of experiencing such an emotion  miss welsh .         clearly     ariel said .     clearly .  now what has your dialogue with this alien revealed .         not a great deal  miss welsh .  i have spent most of the time teaching him galactic standard  since i have no linguistic capacity for understanding his language .  and teaching him has been most difficult because of that lack of linguistic knowledge .  but he seems now to have a rudimentary knowledge of our language  which should prove useful in your dialogue with him .         i take it you are speaking of a male alien  then .         i loosely ascribe that gender  but it is more a description of his manner and conduct  a similarity to the attributes of a male human  which i perceive by the behavioral differences between the males and females of the human species .         male chauvinism in a robot .  is that what i am detecting  wohler .         not at all  miss welsh .  my analysis is quite objective .         on the contrary  wohler .  i would say it is quite programmed  and of the dr .  avery variety .  but let s get on .  what else did you learn .         in reviewing my records     wohler replied     i found that i taught the alien our language and much about humans  but learned little about them  other than the fact that the construction of our city is disturbing their equilibrium .  he used the terms inversions and puncture nodes and abnormal thermoclines  but the terms have little meaning for me  and so little meaning for me to pass on to you .         the terms do not help me a great deal  either     ariel said .     do they mean anything to you  jacob .      up to that point  jacob in his niche had not entered into the conversation  nor moved at all .  he had appeared frozen in position .  now his head gave a little twitch .  a glimmer came into his eyes .      they are meteorological terms  miss ariel     jacob said .     like in weather .         yes .         we re disturbing their weather .     she exclaimed .      it would seem so  miss ariel     jacob confirmed .      wohler  i must speak to this alien   now  tonight .         that will not be possible  miss welsh     wohler said .     he has already retired to his balloon .         what to do  jacob .     she said in exasperation  as much to herself as to jacob .     what to do .         it appears you can do nothing until morning  miss ariel     jacob said .      how do we contact him in the morning  wohler .     ariel asked .      i know of no way to contact him  miss welsh  nor to lead you to him .  i can t tell one of the blackbodies from another .  and even if i could  they are seldom on the ground except at night  and then they are isolated in a hydrogen filled balloon .         so what do we do .     ariel asked .      we must wait for him to come to us .         and when will that be .         he generally comes to the west side of the opening in the dome each morning .         that reminds me  wohler  pass the word over the comlink that all future references to time of day and passage of time in general are to be expressed in alien terminology .  i want to become accustomed to their way of thinking .  when in rome  do as the romans do .      so when will this blackbody come to the dome .      there was a pause before wohler replied .      i beg your pardon  miss welsh  but the encyclopedic file shows nothing regarding behavior under either rome or romans .          forget that  wohler .  just an old saying .  i wouldn t know a roman if i saw one .  answer my question please .         he comes to the dome near ten am each morning  just before the aliens begin their construction work .  he seems to be inspecting that effort .          a good supervisor     ariel said .      no .  i have the impression that he does not approve of the construction  that it is being performed by a tribe to which he does not belong .  his terse comments seem to be more a critique of their work in an artistic sense .      ariel did not sleep well that night .  she longed for derec to be there beside her  and she was homesick as well .  compared to this alien planet with its insidious dome and its blackbody creatures straight out of hell  aurora seemed the most desirable of places  comfortable and quiet  typical of spacer worlds .  she longed for its cultivated farms and green fields  its open  hardly discernible cities with their manicured lawns and gardens  its junk food shops and underground malls where she and derec had had such fun with their friends .  it startled her then to realize she had had fun .  she had ignored the old friends who had ostracized her  but the new ones   though they might still covet her wealth as much as those old ones   had been genuine fun .   and fun with derec .  she yearned to see him intensely  she missed him so .   she had become quite fond of jacob and didn t think of him as a robot with her fun mind  for he was fun to be with .  he had a wry way of saying things that was quite amusing  and ariel suspected he had cultivated it for that very reason  but of course  he would never admit that he had the faintest conception of human humor .  yes  she had become quite fond of jacob .   but it was derec she longed for  his pinched face  his skinny frame .  typically male  his rapid teen growth had sacrificed meat and breadth to bones and height .  yet she could still look down on him by several centimeters .  but she had stopped growing  while he would probably reach and pass her as he filled out .  for the time she had  she was going to enjoy being taller than he and use it to advantage whenever that seemed appropriate .  she loved teasing him .  he was so loveable .   and she slipped off into a lonely  scary dream .     chapter    dialogue    synapo had never drained himself quite so low before .  the musculature of the legs particularly seemed weak as he walked toward the brook that morning .  he had exhausted the fat juice cells for long term storage around his chest and waist and buttocks and now he was drawing on the prompt supply cells that fed his muscles .  and those in his legs were nowhere near as plentiful as those that supplied the large pectoral muscles that powered the downbeat of his wings .  the legs were always the first to go .  that was an old myostrian saying that sarco and his ilk were fond of iterating for some reason beyond the fact that it was true .   and the truth of that adage was never more apparent than when he had started for the brook that morning .  he had actually felt sort of faint after the long inactivity of a night s tether .   sarco had already left .  that became apparent after breakfast as synapo climbed to optimum charge altitude .  sarco was already on station in synapo s favorite space immediately over the center of the compensator .  naturally  sarco would be the only one of both tribes not to recognize that and defer to him .  it was the first time he had violated that space without permission .   yet  the times were unusual  old  little used protocols were easier to violate than those reinforced by continual use .  the concept of preferred location was not a natural one with the cerebrons as it was with the myostrians  who tended to stay in one location for long periods in the process of constructing and destroying weather node compensators like the domed glimmer below .  the cerebrons did not normally spend the night on the ground  but instead tethered their reflectors together in large drifting nightpacks by interlacing their hooks .  they were normally nomads  continually roaming allover the world in the state of deep cogitation that had brought their race to the intellectual heights it now enjoyed .   the last time they had anchored for any significant period of time was when both tribes were battling the weather effects of the great meteor fall a quarter century before the aliens arrived .   thus  preferred space was the cerebron equivalent to the myostrian preferred location .  the preferred space was naturally toward the center of the pack  and the most exalted was dead center where the less taxing audio communication reached the greatest number of cerebrons   and the surrounding elite first   and where the more taxing radio communication reached all the cerebrons with the least expenditure of energy .   when the two tribes interacted   as they were doing now  and as they had during the meteor incident   the dominant tribe tended to be the cerebrons unless the myostrians had an unusually aggressive leader  and up until that morning  synapo had been the more aggressive in their interaction despite the fact that it was sarco and his myostrians who were aggressively building the compensator .  that was to be expected .  synapo would have been a little alarmed   contrary to the tenor of his words   if the myostrians had performed otherwise .   so in the context of past behavior  it was surprising to find sarco   with his hook pointed aggressively forward   on station in synapo s space .  the natural disposition of both tribes was peaceful  so synapo meekly left his hook pointed aft and took up his station two wingspreads to the right of sarco as sarco circled around the center of the dome far below .      you are on the wing a tad early  sarco     synapo said .      i watched the alien land last night     sarco said .     and monitored its jump into our zone two days before .  that  perhaps  explains their discrete modulation of hyperwave .  but not entirely .  the metal monsters phased in with continuous modulation .  how do you explain the jump .  do we have two different sets of aliens .         no .  not if i understand what wohler   was telling me .  this new being is clearly a master of the metal ones .         well  this morning  i m joining you .  i ll be able to observe the construction almost as well from your station as from mine .  and though i care not a whit for either set of aliens  it would be a shame to destroy life unnecessarily .  i want to see for myself how you handle them .      synapo said nothing further for the rest of the short charge .  he was already exhausted by the endless days of talk and the surfeit of poisonous oxygen that he felt compelled to hold in his sacs .  but he continued to carry his hook aft so that sarco would know that his silence was not intended as an affront .  he could afford to allow sarco to dominate this brief morning charge .  but that was all he could allow him .   they balled and dropped as sarco s people were forming up for construction .  synapo had not intended for sarco to get ahead of him  but from habit set by the short time the aliens had been on their world  synapo opened on glide path in his usual manner  which took him on a high circular pass around the dome .   sarco chose to go in directly .  by the time synapo realized that sarco was not following  it was too late to correct his error  but he circled tight  high up  and began to dive well before he had completed half the circle .  synapo watched him through the transparent dome as sarco made a fast  powered approach and an aggressive landing  a powered stall a half meter above the ground with his wings spread to their full ten meter breadth as he came to rest only two meters from the aliens .   synapo mentally cursed sarco  but restrained himself and did not radiate his feelings as he might well have had he known the aliens could not receive his broadcast .  a cloud of dust obscured sarco and the aliens as synapo came in on a flat gentle glide path and settled to the ground well inside the cloud .  he knew he was more majestic in the air  but he also knew his approach would be obscured by sarco s dust  so he chose to come in closer even than sarco .  still  his approach was executed so adroitly he added not a whit to the ball of dust that was already rapidly dissipating .   there were three aliens  wohler    a nonmetallic being a head shorter  and a third being as tall as wohler   that synapo took to be nonmetallic until he detected the neutrino radiation that characterized wohler   and microfusion in general .  he had to conclude that despite the deceptive appearance  the third alien must be of the servant tribe  although he knew that quick generalization might be diplomatically embarrassing if it proved wrong .   sarco at least had the good sense not to open his oxygen vent prematurely .  and it was apparent that wohler   was confused and not able to distinguish between synapo and sarco .  the robot s eyes kept flicking back and forth between the two of them .      good morning  wohler       synapo said .   there was no hesitation  no ignoring synapo this morning .  wohler   swiveled his head and rolled his eyes around ahead of that motion so that they came to rest on synapo well before the head caught up .      this is miss ariel welsh     the robot said as he gestured with a rather grand motion toward the diminutive alien  who stood hardly as high as synapo s shoulder joints .   and with a nod  wohler   dismissed the other alien as a servant beneath consideration  a fact confirmed by his words .      and this is the humaniform jacob winterson  miss welsh s personal robot .      the validity of synapo s generalization was reassuring as was his initial reaction to the small alien s unimpressive appearance .  but wohler   had failed to introduce synapo  a breach of etiquette not easily forgiven  which was not reassuring .   still  the robot was only a servant and perhaps not as well schooled in diplomacy as the small master  who was a she  a member of the subordinate clan of the dominant tribe .  synapo had guessed she would be from his earlier conversations with wohler   .   yet that was also disappointing since he would still not know  after all the interminable discussion that would surely take place  how dominant that other clan was and whether that other clan would also dominate the tribes of his world if this miss welsh did not prove to do so .  she was certainly not very imposing .   but her personal robot was imposing  and he was only a servant .  that left synapo with nothing to go on at that point but superficial appearances  which he knew from long experience to be untrustworthy .   and then  to synapo s astonishment  sarco was talking .      welcome to our world  miss ariel welsh     sarco said .     my name is sarco  which is as close as we can come to a translation into your language .  i am leader of the myostria .      that caught synapo by surprise .  he had not really expected sarco to be fluent in the language .  sarco had a better command of the language than synapo would have thought possible from the brief radiated lessons he had given the cerebrons .  sarco had obviously monitored those lessons  but he could only have picked up the audio patterns by special tutoring from one of the cerebron elite .   and that  too  disturbed synapo .  someone of the elite must be striking for dominance  and hard enough to risk undercutting synapo in his rivalry with sarco .   synapo was so caught by surprise that before he could say anything  sarco  with a gesture every bit as grand as wohler   s  said     and this is synapo  leader of the cerebrons .       sarco s introduction could be taken two ways .  synapo hoped the small alien placed sarco s relationship to him in the same pattern as wohler   to her .  had sarco intended that to be the case .  had he misjudged sarco s behavior during charge that morning .      yes  miss ariel welsh .  welcome to our world     synapo said .   the small alien turned away  shaking allover  after suddenly putting her hand over her primary and secondary vents .  she was obviously caught in a fit of ague .   wohler   studiously ignored her condition .  the only reaction of the other  the humaniform  was a slight upward curvature at the corners of the robot s primary vent .  her behavior and theirs confused synapo and led him to wonder about the efficacy of the robots as suitable servants .  surely one of them should have done something to ease her paroxysm .   she recovered quickly  however  and turned and said     i am pleased to meet both of you     and then she put one hand to her front  the other to her back  and doubled over at the waist  which led synapo to wonder if she had now suddenly been caught by a cramp like that which sometimes caught him when he was carrying too large an inventory of oxygen  as he was at that moment .  but unlike her  if a cramp hit him in this situation he would suffer through and ignore it .  that gave him a nice feeling of superiority .     chapter    impasse    ariel finally got control of herself and with a sober face  turned back to face the aliens .  their frightening appearance had almost paralyzed her until that first one  sarco  had spoken .   wohler   had pointed them out before they began their drop  while they were still lazily circling above the center of the dome .   and then that first one had landed  coming in so fast it seemed like he could not possibly stop in time  and then unexpectedly spreading his wings so wide he engulfed them all in a jet black space absolutely devoid of any detail  as though they were suddenly and inexplicably thrown into the featureless black concavity of the dome .   when he retracted his wings  they seemed to melt into his sides and disappear in the soft blackness .  the contrasts of color    or lack of it   heightened the disturbing appearance of the alien  the vicious white hook that could obviously disembowel a human in one neat stroke  and the disconcerting red glow of the sunken eyes that gave her the feeling she was peering deep into the bowels of hell .   then the other one arrived  much more decorously than the first  and when he opened his mouth  she was immediately transported back to earth  to webster groves  one of the caves of steel that she and derec had once visited .  and then the first one so confirmed that impression  she could hardly contain herself .   and when the second one  the one called synapo  had said     yas  wekkom to ah wuld  miz ahyahl wilsh     she had to turn away to suppress her laughter and an incipient sneeze caused by the tingling in her nose from the faint odor of ammonia they exuded .   she could hardly contain the delightful relief that came with the knowledge that these demons had a comic side .  they were just naturally provincials of a webster grove persuasion .  wohler   could not possibly have given them that accent .   she recovered quickly  however  and without sneezing  she turned and said     i am pleased to meet you both     and then she bowed .     this is an historic occasion  which we shall surely carry with us always .  it saddens me that such an important meeting must be marred by discussion of the discordant incidents that have occurred before we can explore the great potential for harmony in the future relations of our two species .      she steeled herself to put his reply in the framework he surely intended  and she found she could quite easily ignore the thick accent and concentrate on only the meaning .      we are equally saddened     synapo replied .      the protocol of my species in this situation suggests that you should select the first topic for discussion     she said .   immediately synapo said     explain the square root of minus one .      his reply seemed completely at odds with the discussion she thought was going to take place .  she was not schooled in mathematics and was expecting more diplomatic double talk .  she hesitated for just a moment  and then turned toward jacob and said     jacob .      immediately jacob said     the square root of minus one is a member of a class of numbers that cannot be given substance except in a specific context .  in this case  one such context is the interrelationship of space and time  in which the measurements of time must be multiplied by the square root of minus one in order to properly relate them to the measurements of space .         or the reverse     synapo said .     a quite satisfactory answer to a simple question  but then one must start simple and work toward the complex .  and now what is your pleasure  miss ariel welsh .      that sort of drivel isn t going to get us anywhere  ariel thought .  let s get right to it .      why have you isolated our city  enclosed it under this big dome .      and as she gestured toward the dome  the first shimmer that morning   the first pass of the myostrian construction   shot down the edge of the wall with a faint crackling and disappeared into the ground .   ariel jumped  startled .  with the edge of the dome off to her left and to the rear  she had turned slightly as she gestured and had caught the shimmer at the corner of her eye before the sound reached her ears .  being to her back  though  it had startled her more than if she had been facing the edge .   sarco said     ah  my people have started work .      synapo said     my colleague sarco informed me yesterday that the node compensator   this dome   will be completed tomorrow  so that leaves us little time for negotiation .  he further informs me that the dome is necessary in order to properly control meterological conditions .  the particulate emissions and the radiation and convection of thermal energy from your creations are seriously disrupting the weather of our planet  and thereby disturbing our mental processes and our emotional equanimity .      the source of synapo s linguistic training came sharply into focus .  he talked exactly like a robot city supervisor .  only wohler   could have downloaded all those big words .   what had he said about work on the dome .  it escaped her as she zeroed in on his last sentence .   jacob was right .  the aliens were concerned about the weather and talked as though they were actually controlling it .  spacers and settlers also talked about the weather a great deal  but so far had not been able to do much about it .      you control the weather .     she said .      of course .  it is essential that unruly airflow not disturb our cerebrations .  how can one think when he is being bounced about in a turbulence .  your creations generate a puncture node of the worst sort .      but now i believe it is our turn .  and i suppose we must dispense with going methodically from the simple to the complex  as i had intended .      what vital purpose do your creations serve .  what ends justify the killing of two of our people   first  a myostrian in legitimate pursuit of an assigned task  and then a cerebron who was peacefully tethered and surely in no way interfering with your obscure endeavor .      ariel knew that  on balance  the destruction of a witness robot was hardly equal to the death of two intelligent beings .  but she had heard that a good offense was the best defense .      and in the pursuit of that task of questionable legitimacy     ariel replied     your myostrians created something that sliced one of my people in half .      she didn t really think of a witness robot as people but the black bats   or as wohler   termed them  the blackbodies   didn t need to know that .      i respectfully remind you that it was your creations that caused the myostrians to start construction of the compensator     synapo said .     i ask again  what purpose do those creations serve .  what further threat to our equilibrium lies beyond the disturbance of our weather .      it was a legitimate point  which caused her to reevaluate what was serious and what was not  who had provoked whom  and when  and how .  perhaps the weather was of equal importance to sentient life in their minds   perhaps the weather was their life .   that thought  coupled with the observation that  while he was talking  he had slued his hook around so that it pointed forward  like that of his companion  caused ariel to reconsider the gravity of the situation .  even though she didn t know for sure what that rotation meant  it didn t seem to bode any good and might even be considered somewhat ominous  taken with the quiet way he had made his last pronouncement .   she had let their provincial accent distract her  which may have caused her to consider this confrontation less serious than it really was .  she had known how serious the situation was well before the meeting  and her anxiety had steadily increased until the moment of confrontation .  how had she let the circumstances of their meeting so distract and deceive her .   the shimmer at the corner of her eye at that moment and the crackling sound that accompanied it marked the pass of a myostrian far above and brought her attention back to the construction of the dome .  she noticed then that  while they had been talking  the edge of the dome had progressed toward the center of main street  closing the opening by at least two more meters on that one side  probably four meters considering both sides .   the city robots had extended main street into a road across the plain to facilitate their exodus .  the two edges of the wall were not far from the edge of the road itself  four lanes wide where it exited the dome .   it was then synapo s earlier comment came to the front of her mind  my colleague sarco informed me yesterday that the node compensator   this dome   will be completed tomorrow  so that leaves us little time for negotiation .   she had not forgotten it .  it had simply been overlaid by a surfeit of sensory stimuli .  it was difficult to take in all the data and digest it in proper order .  but clearly they were in the midst of a negotiation in which she had reasoned herself into a corner  a fact that she must honorably acknowledge in the presence of these aliens  and time was running out .   perhaps that acknowledgement alone would buy her some time .  a diplomat might have been duplicitous at that point  but ariel had recognized earlier that she was no diplomat .  you take in the data  you analyze it  and you proceed accordingly .      your argument is sound     ariel said .     it takes only a brief moment   having now all the facts   to recognize that we are the offenders and you are the offended .  we ask for your patience .  we ask that you stop construction of the dome while we consider how we may resolve this dilemma  leaving neither of our peoples with further injury and with harmonious relations restored .      she recognized that wasn t quite right .  their relations had never been harmonious .  that was her minor concession to the duplicity of diplomacy .   neither of the aliens said anything  but ariel knew something was going on .  standing side by side  they had turned their top sections so that their hooks and eyes confronted one another briefly .  then they turned back to confront ariel .      we agree to a one day delay in the construction of the compensator following completion of today s effort .  we will meet again tomorrow as we met today .      ariel felt a touch on her elbow and half turned as jacob bent over to say softly     would it be helpful to know the present stability of their weather .         i don t understand     she said  just as softly .      how effective is the dome in its present state .     jacob asked .     that data will enter into our reckoning of possibilities for resolution of the dilemma .         ninety nine point two percent compensation including the improvement allowed by consideration of both positive edge effects     sarco said before ariel could ask .   ariel understood then why jacob had asked the question .      could you live with that if we caused no further deleterious effects .     she asked .      yes     synapo said .   as though not to be outdone by ariel s lieutenant  sarco asked     why do you discrete or jump modulate hyperwave when the signal fidelity and freedom from noise is so much better with continuous modulation .      that time ariel didn t hesitate a second .  she looked at jacob and said simply     jacob .      the reply by jacob was delayed by a distraction at that point .  a small  tight  luminous green flame  no more than ten centimeters long  bloomed in the blackness a few centimeters below synapo s eyes .  but he said nothing .   jacob was distracted only momentarily   just long enough to register the spectrum and flame temperature of pure hydrogen co blended with pure oxygen and a trace of ammonia .      we are not familiar with continuous modulation     jacob said .      strange .  you teleport with both types of transition     sarco said .  he seemed not to be disturbed by fire from synapo .     you yourself jumped here in discrete mode  and wohler   phase condensed here in continuous mode .  do you not recognize the parallel with hyperwave .         i am not an expert in these technologies     jacob replied .     we can only take your question under advisement .      as though to avoid further discussion  synapo turned abruptly  and with a short wobbling run and an awkward hop  he flapped into the air and started gracefully into a great climbing turn .  sarco hesitated only a moment and then turned  wobbled  and with an even more awkward hop  quickly followed him .  they were soon far above the dome .   at the end of the dome construction activity that day  the edges of the dome had just started cutting into the four lane road .     chapter    intrigue    immediately after the meeting  synapo climbed more rapidly than usual to charge altitude .  he kept his hook aggressively forward   something he almost never did when he was climbing to charge  and he paid no attention to sarco  who was climbing in his wake   again something neither a cerebron nor a myostrian did when there was the least possibility of someone sharing the climb .   in short  he was exceedingly irritated with sarco  and he wanted sarco to know it .  as he climbed  he radioed the local myostrian weather station for the optimum altitude in the compensator s zone  the corresponding stability quotient  and the forecast for the afternoon .  he had some deep cogitation to do  and he wanted optimum conditions in which to do it .   first  there was the matter of internal tribal dominance .  that took precedence over sarco s unsettling behavior   he would get to that   and the assurance he had given the aliens that he could live with a compensator efficiency of    .    .  sarco had not questioned his conclusion   by nimbar  he better not have   but synapo wasn t all that sure in his own mind how the cerebrons might react to it .  they were much more sensitive to small disturbances in the weather than were the myostria .   the weather was important  but in the short term  it was the possibility of one of the elite striking for tribal dominance that had him most concerned .  there was a definite hierarchy throughout the cerebron pack  but it was exceptionally rigid among the members of the elite  who currently numbered eleven .  if one of them were striking and involved him now  it could seriously undermine his relations with sarco and his negotiations with the aliens .  that was his primary concern .  he thought of himself more as a statesman than as a mere politician .  by the time synapo had climbed to charge altitude  he knew how to proceed .   when he leveled off on station  he radioed neuronius  his second in command  and as he summoned him for conference  he noted with satisfaction that sarco had taken up his customary station  fifty meters below in a fifty percent tighter circle .  sarco had called to him only once on the way up  and synapo had ignored him .   now as neuronius approached  did synapo note a more casual  less deferential stroking of his wings .  the striker would surely be his second in command .  yet  unlikely as it might be  it could be anyone in the pack .  once  a hand of centuries ago  a young  midpack rabble rouser had struck successfully  destroying the elite   that is  the elite structure   and generally upsetting the entire hierarchy as he brought in his own lieutenants from up and down the pack .  he had proved to be one of the better administrators .  and synapo was in his egg line  twice removed .   neuronius rolled into conference beneath him  hook properly reversed .  synapo s hook was still set aggressively .  it would stay that way the rest of the day .  there would be no more meek  deferential conferences with sarco or anyone else until these affronts and possible strikes were resolved .   synapo got right to work on neuronius .      it comes to me on a zephyr that someone is trying to supplant you in the hierarchy  neuronius .     he put it casually as though he were an unconcerned  indifferent observer .   he was looking for neuronius s immediate reaction  a slight tremble twitch in the hook  a faint flicker in the redness of the eyes  an ever so slight fanning of the cold junction  the uncontrollable body language that one displays before one can steel himself to the shock of the unexpected .   and there it was  a slight wave in the silhouette on the right  a bunching of the right deltoid muscle   the one that pulled up the right wing and readied it for the power downbeat .  that was a typical guilt reaction .  not a reaction in response to fear  the fear that someone was trying to supplant himself  neuronius  but instead a response to guilt concerning his own ambitious plans .  that guilt could lead to fear later as neuronius pondered what synapo s remarkable intuition might lead to  but at the moment it was only a symptom of guilt .   synapo knew then the shape of things within and without his tribe .  he could scheme up suitable responses .  anticipation of the cerebral exercise involved  the challenge  filled him with keen anticipation .  nowhere was there room for fear  for anticipation that he might fail .   neuronius was a threat he could meet head on .  and sarco was an excellent engineer and an able administrator  but not the political animal that he faced in a tussle with neuronius .   synapo listened keenly to neuronius s answer to the needling remark .      i do not fear such a change if that cerebron can serve you as ably as i     neuronius replied .   ah  suitably servile .  he was not yet ready  not quite sure of himself .  that called for a less aggressive response  at least for the moment .      we meet again with the aliens tomorrow morning     synapo said .     i want you and axonius to accompany me .      axonius was third in the elite hierarchy  next in command after neuronius .  it was essential that axonius witness the ineptitude of neuronius and discredit him with the elite .  exactly how that would come about synapo was not sure  but he did not lack confidence in his ability to carry it out in some fashion during their meeting with the aliens or later .  neuronius was not yet ready for command decisions and might never be .  synapo had merely to show that to axonius and simultaneously educate axonius in the difficulty of command .   further  it would not hurt to condition neuronius in the direction that would encourage ineptitude  that was not statesmanlike  perhaps  but certainly the political thing to do .  synapo had only to enhance what was already natural .  neuronius was by nature a haughty beast who acted as though he were infinitely superior to all those below him in the cerebron pecking order .  synapo had only to encourage and assure him that the aliens were also to be included in that inferior category .   he made it seem as though he were asking neuronius  s advice  confiding in him  passing confidential information to him beyond that which he had provided the cerebrons in caucus  and by bits and pieces he led neuronius to the conclusion that the aliens were weak and ready to capitulate and leave the planet .  he was careful  however  never to say that directly but merely to imply it by innuendo .   synapo was ready then for the next meeting with the aliens .     chapter    crisis       how do we stand right now  wohler .     ariel asked .   she and the two robots had just left the meeting with the aliens and were traveling down main street in the lorry  heading for the apartment .  the street lights stretched ahead toward the compass tower like a string of illuminated pearls in the dim light of a late dusk  the permanent dusk created by the dome .      in what respect  miss ariel .     wohler asked .      with respect to the city  wohler .  the dome will be closed day after tomorrow unless we can get through to those monsters .  what are you doing about it .         we are moving the necessary materiel for construction of a second compass tower and city on the other side of the plain  five kilometers away .         yes  i believe those were the very words you used earlier     she said .  how could she be irritated by a machine that  given the same stimulus  came up with the same answer .     so your grand plan is to hop allover the planet  a jump ahead of the aliens  constructing compass towers and cities   weather nodes   while they follow along behind neutralizing them with their domes .      was she still feeling guilty about wohler   and taking it out on this poor machine that wouldn t know it even if she were .      we tried first to neutralize them and lost a pilot robot and flier     wohler   said     and then we tried to learn more about them and lost a surgeon and laser scalpel .         you could have learned a lot more about them by just talking to them .         that has not proved to be true  miss ariel  and did not seem to be necessary at first since they destroyed only that one witness .  they did not interfere with our endeavor once we enlarged the patrol circle to avoid construction of the dome .  it did not appear they were violating our governing laws nor interfering with the prime directive until their construction work began to circle inward   to close the dome .  then we did begin to talk  and they succeeded in learning our language  but we learned very little except specialized terminology which you have now determined to be meteorological in nature .         what about the central core .     ariel said .     you ll surely not leave that behind .         no  miss ariel .  our control computer s mainframe is mobile .  when the blackbodies begin construction on the last day  we ll move it out to serve the new city .         which will then shortly be covered by a dome .         yes .  that was why we hyperwaved robot city for help .         come upstairs with us  wohler     ariel said as wohler   pulled to the curb in front of the apartment building .   when they walked into the apartment  both jacob and wohler   headed for wall storage niches .       jacob     ariel said     would you rassle up some lunch for me .  see if you can get a crisp garden salad out of that thing .  and then sit down at the table .  i ll freshen up and be right out .      when she came out  the salad and a glass of milk were waiting on the table  jacob sat across the table from where he had set her place  and wohler   was standing in his niche .   she felt uncomfortable when the humaniform  jacob  stood in a niche .  her auroran upbringing made it seem natural for wohler   to do so .  that was where he was supposed to be when he wasn t doing some task for her .  and she should have felt exactly the same way about jacob  but his appearance didn t allow it .      now     she said as she began eating     our most pressing problem is how to carry out the objective of making this planet suitable for human life and at the same time avoid disrupting the weather .  the weather does seem to be the main concern of the aliens .      however  that s too tough to handle during lunch .  it will ruin my appetite and upset my digestion .      let s talk instead about the hyperwave noise  the other way we re apparently disturbing them .  i can understand the weather problem  sort of  and even have a glimmer of what a puncture node is   hot air punching up through a cold air layer  i suppose    but i ve got no idea what they mean by discrete and continuous modulation .  what s that all about  jacob .         i m not sure myself  miss ariel     jacob said .     i am aware of only one type of modulation of hyperwave  that which the alien called discrete .  nor had i drawn the connection of hyperwave modulation with jump technology  which permits us to travel through hyperspace .  were you aware of such a connection  wohler .         no     wohler   replied     but i was aware that teleportation using a key to perihelion is technologically different from jump teleportation .         this seems to me a minor problem involving new technology that we obviously should have been aware of     ariel said in true managerial style .     get to work on it  jacob .         very well  miss ariel     jacob said .     where would you suggest i start .      for a moment ariel thought that perhaps jacob was being sarcastic  and then she realized that could not be the case .  he was just a robot .  still  could the robotics institute have included an optional sarcastic module for the positronic brain of their humaniforms .  not likely .  but it was an interesting thought that diverted her from these pesky engineering problems .  they were more derec s forte than hers .  social problems  people problems  sarcastic positronic modules  all those .  she doted on .  not pesky problems with meteorology and hyperwave .   she was quiet for awhile .  jacob at the table  and wohler   in his niche  said nothing .   then she said     wohler  is there a keymo on the planet .         yes     wohler   said .     keymo  eighth generation  is in charge of key control .         there s your lead then  jacob     she said .  it was merely a people problem   robot problem   after all .     we want to develop continuous hyperwave modulation .  synapo said there was a connection between continuous hyperwave modulation and key teleportation .  keymo on robot city manufactured the keys .  keymo here  in charge of key control  of all those here  should be most familiar with key teleportation and the one most likely to fathom continuous modulation .  see if the two of you can t cobble up some equipment to implement it .         very well  miss ariel     jacob replied .      wohler     ariel said     find jacob a comlink cartridge  plug it into him so he can find keymo on his own  and then come back and help me .  with your knowledge of the aliens  we ve got to figure out a solution to this dome problem .      jacob and wohler    when not conversing audibly  close at hand  had been communicating with their cumbersome  long distance  radio frequency systems .  the comlink cartridge would hook jacob into their more sophisticated  short range  microwave telephone network .      very well  miss welsh     wohler   said .   ariel did not hold out much hope that keymo and jacob would come up with anything significant .  in her experience  ordinary robots just weren t creative .  yet there was that extraordinary exception  that brief period on robot city when shakespeare s hamlet had lived again  supported by robot actors  and the robot lucius had created his artistic masterpiece  the dynamically chromatic edifice called circuit breaker .   a half hour later wohler   returned .      did jacob locate keymo .     ariel asked .      i believe so     wohler   said .     he had contacted keymo over the comlink before i left .         good .  does this apartment have a memory projector .         yes .  the niches are equipped with sockets  and that wall serves as the screen .         just what we need .  how many times did you meet with the alien synapo .         thirty four .         how long each time .      when wohler   began reciting the list that contained the time for each meeting  ariel interrupted him .      on the average .     she said .      forty two minutes     wohler said .      i ll not have time to go over all that before tomorrow morning .  yet i desperately need some clue as to how we may resolve this dilemma .      wohler  while i m thinking how to screen that material rapidly  download to central core just the dialogue of your meetings with synapo  and get a printout back to me as soon as possible .         download in progress     wohler   said .   a fraction of a minute later  while ariel was still pondering her problem  wohler   said     download complete .      a couple of minutes later  she said     i really don t know what i m looking for  but i do know what i m not looking for .  wohler  delete all sections of the meetings dealing with linguistics and play back the rest at double speed .      she could understand neither wohler   nor the alien at that speed .  then when she slowed it down so she could understand wohler    she still couldn t understand synapo s webster grove accent .  she finally slowed it down to normal and could understand most of what synapo said  but not all .  she refused to slow it any further .   just as she didn t hope for much from keymo and jacob  she really didn t expect to get anything much out of listening to wohler   and synapo .  but it did keep her conscious mind actively on the problem and left her subconscious mind to freewheel on all the correlated branches of the main subject .   neither her conscious mind nor her subconscious mind contributed anything of significance during an inquiry that became dull and dragging after the novelty of watching and listening to a giant bat wore off .   the courier from central core arrived with the printout of the dialogue late in the afternoon  and with that interruption  ariel decided to take a break and eat an early dinner .  she had heard nothing from jacob and realized she had been expecting him to return for dinner  when there was really no reason why he should  since he didn t eat and merely kept her company when she did .  still  it was a habit she had become accustomed to  and she missed him now that she was deprived of that pleasure .   was it jacob she missed  or really derec .  she had only to ask herself that question  and the longing to see derec and the flood of homesickness for the beautiful estates and green farmlands of aurora overwhelmed her .   she tried to put it out of her mind as she ate a lonely dinner  but it was not possible .  her mind rebelled from the magnitude of the problem that faced her on this alien world  and while she ate  she wallowed in her loneliness and homesickness  and before she finished eating  tears of self pity were trickling down her face .   as she finished eating  wohler   asked     are you in pain  miss welsh .      ariel wiped her tears away with a napkin .     no  wohler .  just lonely .          does my presence relieve your loneliness to any degree .         no .         to what degree did my assistance this afternoon serve in the preservation of the city  miss welsh .         very little  i m sorry to say     ariel said .     why do you ask .  did you expect otherwise .         certainly i had hoped otherwise  miss welsh .  i proceed at all times in the direction that best serves the prime directive  if that does not violate the more compelling laws that govern my behavior .      i have been neglecting my supervisory duties in the construction and operation of the city  miss welsh  for i concluded that your imperative best served the prime directive .  if that seems no longer to be the case  i must return to my duties  which are currently spread among the other six supervisors .         very well  wohler .  return to duty .         i will clear the dinner table  request a maid to serve you in the future  and then take my leave .         i ll clear the table  wohler .  and a maid won t be necessary .  jacob will suffice .          but he is on another assignment  miss welsh .         we ll handle it  wohler .  just raise jacob on the comlink  tell him to get back here no later than ten pm  and then leave .      she was anxious to be alone .  wohler had begun to get on her nerves  wohler and that alien she had felt compelled to watch and listen to all afternoon .      will you be needing me at the meeting tomorrow morning .     wohler asked .      no .  did you get hold of jacob while you were chattering there .         yes  miss welsh .  he will be here by ten pm .         then leave  wohler .      despite her warm feelings for wohler l  she was fed up with this wohler   .  yet in his dialogue with the alien  she felt there had to be some clue to the aliens  to their behavior  to their needs  to their culture  a clue to something that would make the aliens and humans compatible so that this desirable planet did not have to be abandoned and bypassed in the future .   she turned to the printout the courier had delivered before dinner .   strange how that archaic form of transmitting information   the printed word   had stayed around so long .  yet was it so strange when that marvelous instrument  the human brain  was taken into account  the speed with which she could assimilate the words and conjure related images  the speed with which she could scan the pages .   she quickly thumbed to where wohler had left off in his projection that afternoon and scanned through the rest of the dialogue   ten times the volume they had covered that afternoon   and she did it in less than two hours .  and got more out of it  by being able to easily and quickly replay  fast forward  skip  and ponder over the significance of a phrase  a word .   it was true that central core had eliminated the alien s accent    and certainly that had speeded things up   but the true efficiency came with the printed word itself  the strange archaic telepathy that extracted alien ideas from an alien mind and moved them into hers .   yet despite the ancient beauty of the printout  nothing of significance came from its perusal  no more than had come from the boring afternoon with wohler and the memory projector .   still  her intuition told her there had to be a solution .  she just wasn t looking at it right  or with the proper frame of mind  or in the proper place .  if not the dome  where on this weird world was she supposed to look .  the city was the problem  a weather node the aliens had termed it  an aggravating  uncontrollable irritant  like a grain of sand in an oyster .   and the aliens were coating it  smoothing it  to relieve the abrasion  like an oyster coats the sharp edges of a grain of sand with iridescent nacre  mother of pearl .  now she was even beginning to think like an alien .  this world is an oyster and the city and its dome are a pearl .  oyster world .  pearl city .  she had christened a world and a city .   and she had gotten no further by the time jacob returned at ten pm .      well  you re finally back     she said when he came in .     what did keymo have to offer on the hyperwave problem .         very little  miss ariel     jacob said .     neither of us could see how key teleportation technology could be applied to modulation of hyperwave signals .         did you examine the parallel dichotomy of hyperspace jump technology and discrete modulation of hyperwave .  that parallel connection should provide clues to the connection between the key and continuous modulation .  right .      ariel had first heard the word dichotomy on the way to oyster world  when jacob had used it  and she had been wanting to use it ever since .  it had such a ring of erudition .  now she had played it back to him .      you suggested only that we look for a connection between continuous modulation and key teleportation .  neither of us could see any during a lengthy discussion which concluded only a half hour ago .      you dummy  she thought  the creative process is primarily a matter of drawing correlations .  if there is a connection between discrete modulation and jump technology  as the aliens claim  you must first ferret out and understand that connection .  then maybe you can deduce what continuous modulation is by examining key teleportation for the parallel connection the aliens say exists there .  she thought she had made that clear before he left .  he  too  had heard everything the alien had said .      tonight  while i m sleeping     ariel said     examine everything in your memory concerning jump technology and discrete modulation of hyperwave .  go back and forth comparing the two at every point .  look for similarities .  correlate one with the other .  and give me a report in the morning of all instances where you see a similarity between the two .         very well  miss ariel .      she retired to bed then and thought how she would like to see the full musculature of jacob without his clothes on .  and that made her feel guilty  and her longing for derec came rushing in  the longing she had been pushing from her mind all evening that had probably brought on the unmaidenly notions concerning jacob .   she went to sleep  and sometime during the long night  she dreamt of playing in a verdant auroran cornfield with her personal robot as she had when she was a child  and then the robot became jacob  and they were running and laughing as he chased her down the rows of tall green plants waving in the gentle breeze  and gradually he was no longer chasing her but waiting for her at the end of the long row  far away  yet it was not jacob  and then she realized that derec had come to oyster world  and he was standing there with his arms outstretched  waiting for her .  joyfully  she ran toward him down the long rows of waving green .   she awoke  and it was morning  and she was indeed on oyster world .  but derec was not there .     chapter    the wolf planet       i m grateful you took the time to come     derec said .   he glanced at his companion sitting next to him in the runabout .      wouldn t  ave   cept  u sounded urgent     wolruf said .   they were heading east on main street toward derec s apartment .  he had just picked up wolruf at the wolf planet s primitive spaceport at the west edge of the robot city .   wolruf had arrived in the xerborodezees  a minneapolis class hyperspace jumper that the wealthy ariel had given the small alien the year before to speed her return home .  the xerborodezees could accommodate ten passengers  and as it turned out  it was the only way that derec and his robotic companions were going to get off the planet .  he had accidentally demolished his means of transportation when he arrived .   wolruf was the size of a large dog with sleek  well groomed  brown and gold fur  and she was shaped like a dog except for the fat fingered hands and the flat face which  despite its flatness  bore unmistakable lupine characteristics .   farther east on main street  a half kilometer beyond derec s apartment  a large pyramidal edifice   the compass tower   was at that moment strikingly displayed in a glowing frame  redshafted by the morning sun still hidden behind it .      you mean ariel     derec said .     i sent my call for help through ariel .          u signed it .  not ariel .  wouldn t  ave come if  u  adn t signed it   situation desperate  derec .   goin  call  u  desperate derec  from now on .      she gave a funny gargling bark  not a growl  more a sharp rattling gargle  as though her throat were laden with phlegm .   derec had become so accustomed to her in times past he had forgotten that extraordinary chuckle and her uncommon treatment of galactic standard .  the imperfections in her pronunciation of standard had regressed somewhat during the past year on her home planet  but her rolling of the letter    r    had been almost entirely eliminated after prolonged exposure to ariel and derec  and that improvement seemed to be still largely in place except for a trailing burr .  the left out and chopped off pronouns  the missing aitches  and the sibilant hiss for the    zee    sound were still evident .  and the      u    pronunciation of    you      not at all an    ooh    sound  but a sort of choked and swallowed bark that masked off the initial    y      could only come from the throat of a lupine alien  something a human was unlikely ever to match .      i d never label this situation desperate     derec said .     that s not the message i sent .  i contacted robot city on my internal monitor link  and they hyperwaved our house computer on aurora .  at least that s the routing i set up .  i expected ariel to relay my message to you  but that doesn t sound like ariel  either .  sounds more like someone with a vital interest in this planet  which is nobody i know of .         doessn t matter  ow i  eard .   u succeeded  i m  ere .  now what s so desperate  u ve got to call  alf across the galaxy .         i ve got a rogue robot on my hands  wolruf .         doessn t follow the lawss of robotics .         yes and no .  it s got the laws but doesn t seem to know for sure what a human is .  it s like a dam chameleon .  the way i ve got it figured  it changes itself to match as best it can whoever it thinks might be human at the moment .         like mandelbrot s arm .         yes and no .  the stuff it s made of isn t as coarse as the robot city material .  its cells are a lot smaller than the variety in mandelbrot s arm .      i ve got the feeling we re seeing micromolecular robotics here  and i ve got no way to reprogram it .  it s self programmed and seems to imprint like a newly hatched chicken at the drop of a hat  and on anything it takes a mind to .         so  ow can i  elp .     wolruf asked .      it had a wolf form when i first arrived .  it was the leader of a pack of intelligent wolf like creatures which it must have thought were human .  they were attacking the city s avery robots .  the wolf robot gutted one of the averies .  robot city relayed their call for help over my internal monitor .      when i got here  it imprinted on me  after giving me a really hard time   and i mean a really hard time .  it was still humanoid when i left it this morning  and soaking up information from the city library like a second generation settler on a mission to earth .         what iss it  u think i can do .     wolruf asked .      it was wolf like when it came into the city  after i arrived  and then it imprinted on me .  now it s coming along a little too fast  too much personality change too quickly .  with your wolfish characteristics  you make a natural model for imprinting  a nice compromise between wolves and humans .         amazing .  why do  u  umans persist in thinking of us ass wolves .  there ss a species on my world   the dongeedows   that arrr a great deal like the gorillas in  urn ssoos  but i don t think of  u .  .  . now wait a minute .  i take that back .   u arrr beginning to resemble a dongeedow a great deal .       she gave that phlegm rattling gargle again .  and yes  the trailing burr was definitely still part of the pattern .      you can joke all you want  wolruf  but i don t regard this situation as very humorous .      derec was not in the best of spirits .  it was good to see wolruf again  and that had cheered him momentarily .  they had known each other for a long time  ever since she had been more or less a slave   an indentured servant   of the alien pirate aranimas .  derec had freed her with the help of mandelbrot  the robot he had put together from the pirate s supply of spare parts .   but wolruf was hardly a stand in for ariel .  just seeing a good friend like wolruf made him yearn for ariel even more .  if it had just been her and not wolruf who had run down the ramp of the xerborodezees  life wouldn t seem so grim right now .   he shouldn t have reacted adversely to wolruf s weak attempt at humor .  he should at least give her credit for trying .  but he missed ariel  and he wasn t about to let anything cheer him up .       u arrr in a foul mood     wolruf said .     a rogue robot couldn t make  u feel that bad .  why issn t ariel with  u .      it was eerie the way wolruf could sense his mood  interpret it  and put her finger on what was bothering him .      let s not go into that .  let s just say she wasn t too pleased with me when i left her on aurora .  so she s probably pouting back there in a snit .      and he added as a bitter afterthought     with her playboy winterson .  you ve never met him .  jacob winterson .  as revolting a bundle of simulated muscle as you ll ever see .         a cyborg .  like leong .      wolruf was referring to jeff leong  a young man whose brain had spent a rather unpleasant period in a mechanical robotic body while the avery robots on robot city had repaired and healed his damaged human body .      no  a humaniform robot     derec said .     looks exactly like a human .  almost impossible to tell from the real thing .          u re jealous of a robot .      wolruf gave that phlegm gargle again .   derec said nothing .  the conversation was veering in an unpleasant direction .      ah  a sorrr point     wolruf said .     my apologies .         we re here     derec said as he pulled the runabout to the curb in front of the apartment .   he looked up anxiously to the second floor .        u re expecting trouble .     wolruf said .   she was reading his mind again .      no .  mandelbrot would have phoned me     derec said  not quite truthfully  for he did feel just a shade anxious as he got out of the small vehicle .  mandelbrot and silverside didn t seem to understand one another .  perhaps he should not have left a robot to babysit another robot .   but everything seemed normal when they walked into the small two bedroom apartment on the second floor .  mandelbrot was standing in his storage niche in the wall near the door .  silverside was plugged into derec s terminal and didn t even turn around when they came in .      impressive     wolruf said  her eyes going wide as she stared at the robot at the terminal .       e s certainly got  urrr scrawny shape .      silverside s lustrous silvery exterior only approximated the details of derec s appearance  but in size and proportions  it was  indeed  an excellent approximation .   wolruf was exaggerating  of course .  derec was not scrawny .  he was thin  but well endowed with sinewy biceps and with the hard plates of muscle across chest and abdomen typical of an older teen s torso .   but with that humorous barb  wolruf had hit that sensitive nerve again .  derec did feel inadequate whenever he thought of jacob winterson .      everything under control  mandelbrot .     derec asked .  he had walked to the center of the room  hesitated when silverside did not respond to their entrance  and then turned to address mandelbrot .   he got no answer from the robot in the niche .      mandelbrot .     he repeated .      oh  yes  master derec .     silverside unplugged and turned to face them .     everything is under control .      derec glanced at silverside and then turned to walk toward the niche as he said again     mandelbrot  you okay .         he s fine     silverside said .     i deactivated him .         you what .     derec s voice reflected his astonishment that silverside would have had the temerity to shut down mandelbrot s microfusion reactor  risking partial loss of positronic memory .      when you re not around  he tends to give me unwanted advice     silverside explained .     here  i ll bring him back up  since it apparently displeases you to have him down .         it does a lot more than displease me .     derec s voice shook with anger .     and stand back  i ll reactivate him myself .      silverside stopped .  he had started walking toward mandelbrot s niche .      don t you ever   i repeat       and now derec s voice was strident  grating     don t you ever deactivate mandelbrot again .         certainly not     silverside said     if that is your wish  master derec .         that is most certainly my wish .         very well  master derec .      derec had walked to the niche  and now reached around to swing open a plate set flush in mandelbrot s back that covered a switch panel .  carefully  watching for mandelbrot s reactions at each step  he reactivated the robot by flicking switches in a definite sequence .   stabilizing the microfusion reactor was the most delicate part of the activation procedure and took the most time   almost half an hour .  the robot s eyes were designed to guide that operation  changing color in the spectral sequence whenever it was safe to move on to the next phase   from black through purple  blue  green  yellow  orange  red  and finally back to colorless black   mandelbrot s switch   induced standby state .   completely ignoring wolruf  silverside had gone back to the terminal and plugged himself in again after his exchange with derec .   wolruf had curled up on the davenport and was fast asleep when derec finished .   battery backup should have provided the low power needed to protect mandelbrot s positronic brain from serious harm  but there was always the possibility of a loss of long term memory during the nanoseconds required to effect the switch from one power source to the other .  derec would never know until the gap revealed itself  perhaps at some juncture when that particular memory would be urgently needed .   as he pressed the power reset button  he cursed himself for having left the two robots alone together .  mandelbrot s eyes lit up with a red glow that pulsed rhythmically .      how do you feel now  mandelbrot .     derec asked .      normal .  the wild one deactivated me .  i didn t realize what he was doing until too late .      the robot gave a small shudder .      was that a third law reaction just now .     derec asked .      i believe so  master .  i didn t protect myself properly as the third law directs .  i felt a momentary disturbance upon reaching that conclusion  which must have sent an associated potential wave through my motor control system .  is that the way it appeared .         yes .  i just wanted to be sure that it was not some damage from deactivation     derec said .     ah  wolruf  you re awake .      wolruf yawned and stretched .     mandelbrot okay .         it would appear so  except for a normal third law reaction     derec replied .      it looks ass though anotherrr imprinting may not be ass likely ass  u  ad thought     wolruf observed .   the small hairy alien was looking at silverside  who was hunched over the terminal and seemingly absorbed in the information that was flowing into his brain .      silverside has apparently put you down as an inferior     derec replied     a variation on this planet s wolf species .         that was my conclusion     silverside said as he unplugged and swung around in the swivel chair to face them     and i have been unable to find any  wolruf  biographical file or anything to contradict that conclusion .      would you tell me all about yourself  mistress wolruf .     silverside requested .      no .     derec said emphatically .     not now .  plug back into the library .  the rest of us have got some things we must take care of now .      silverside turned back to the terminal  and derec motioned for the other two to follow him outside .   when they were standing by the runabout at street level  derec explained .      as i suggested to you earlier  wolruf  he s coming along too fast now .  deactivating mandelbrot confirmed that in my mind .    d consider that a violation of a sort of corollary to the third law .  how does a robot view that  mandelbrot .         the laws are not infinitely rigid     mandelbrot said .     they are surrounded by side potentials that create what i can only call soft boundaries  foothill potentials that lead to the ultimate peak .  the first law has the hardest and sharpest boundaries of all  but even so  those boundaries are not absolutely and infinitely sharp .         are you saying he violated the third law .     derec asked .      no  but he did something i would never do except to protect a human or myself .         maybe  e was protecting  imself from  urn ideass  mandelbrot     wolruf said .      not likely     mandelbrot said .     i do not consider words and ideas to be a source of injury to a robot .         but he is in a very sensitive and impressionable state right now     derec said .     and that s another reason i want to get him out of the city and back to the forest where i found him  where he s apt to be more comfortable and less perturbed by strange stimuli .      we ll take the runabout to the east exit and walk the rest of the way .  it s only a couple of miles to the place i have in mind  there s a small grassy clearing in the forest near a clear pebbly brook   very peaceful and quiet .  you and the wild one can trot along behind until we get to the east exit  mandelbrot .  then we ll all walk .         very well  master derec .  shall i get the tent and other survival gear from the storage locker .         yes .      derec could not remember his childhood .  he knew that somehow it must have been different from that of other children on aurora  for he did not have the natural feel and easy  confident way of handling robots that was so much a part of a normal spacer s personality  something acquired beginning in earliest childhood .  in all the nurseries and homes  robots were the only nannies to be found .  on aurora  for instance  the closest any adult ever got to a child was the human who supervised the nursery nannies .   had he been raised by a human nanny  maybe even his own mother .  had that been a still earlier experiment of his eccentric father  dr .  avery .  derec knew in intimate technical detail how robots worked   he was an expert roboticist   but he did not have that natural insight into the positronic brain that almost all auroran children had by the age of five .   the only robot derec felt really close to was mandelbrot .  it wasn t a matter of trust or distrust .  robots were what they were programmed to be .  you could trust even the avery robots that built robot city and the other robot cities  like the one here on the wolf planet  if you knew who had last worked with their insides .  the only time you couldn t trust them was when someone like the irrational dr .  avery deliberately altered their programming .  he had  for instance  excluded wolruf from protection when he revised the programming of the robot city robots .   but derec seemed to lack the upbringing to deal naturally with robots   mandelbrot being a possible exception  or as much of an exception as to make it a rule   and now he was confronted with silverside  a being he had concluded from behavior and appearance must be a robot  yet a robot as unpredictable and unsettling as any he had ever dealt with .   like the avery robots   and like mandelbrot s control of his arm   silverside had the ability to change shape by changing the orientation of his cells  which themselves appeared to be tiny robots   microbots   even smaller than the cells of avery material .  derec had pretty well established that those microbots  during a metamorphosis  were being reprogrammed by silverside s positronic brain  much like some living organisms   lizards and amphibians   seem to reprogram their own cells in order to grow a new limb or a new tail .   yes  he was quite uncomfortable with silverside  and as he went around gathering up supplies for their outing  he realized for the first time that he had begun to consider silverside actually dangerous .  he had never felt that way about any robot before  not on aurora or anywhere else .   the fact that mandelbrot s remarks had distracted silverside and reduced his efficiency did not seem to be a reasonable cause  logically arrived at  for the quite serious offense of deactivating another robot .  robots could not go around knocking one another out   seriously risking amnesia in the victim   simply because the victim had been a source of distraction  no more than people could .  silverside had done something mandelbrot    would never do     to use mandelbrot s own words .   silverside was an alarming phenomenon  yet exceedingly fascinating .  derec knew the robot should probably be deactivated  but that was a step derec could no more take than could many other scientists who were on the cutting edge of their disciplines and involved in experiments dangerous to the society they lived in .     chapter    insight    while she was eating breakfast  ariel queried jacob on the results of his nightlong cogitations .      i have made a list     jacob said     of the technical features that jump technology and discrete modulation of hyperwave have in common .  would you like me to project it on the screen .         heavens  no     ariel said .     i don t understand that stuff .  transmit your list to keymo over the comlink  see if he can deduce a parallel list that allows him to predict the characteristics of continuous modulation from the characteristics of key technology  features they would likely share .      and tell him i d like an answer well before we go to the meeting with the aliens .      she finished breakfast and stepped out onto the small open balcony to sample the fresh smells of morning .  and she was assailed instead by the sterile  leftover smells from night in a brand new city  not even the yeasty smell of baking bread that characterized the city of webster grove at any time of day and was certainly to be preferred to the ozone and machine oil of pearl city .   until that moment she had not really come to grips with how much she disliked cities .  she had put up with robot city  and with earth s caves of steel  and now with this city  just to please derec  disliking it all the time but kidding herself into thinking she was having a great time .   she disliked cities  any city  and she disliked them most in the morning .  without thinking  she had expected to sample the new mown hay of aurora .  instead she was oppressed by the smells of a city she disliked intensely and yet was compelled to try to save .  the thought of that negotiation  less than two hours away  lay   in its anticipation   not like an idea in her mind  but like a brick in her stomach .   with her nose wrinkled and breakfast roiling her gut  she turned and went back inside to dress for the meeting .   an hour later  she was dressed and sitting in the living room  still groping for some solution to the dome problem .  jacob was standing in his niche .  she even preferred that in her present mood .  she wanted no distractions this morning .   quite edgy  she decided she could wait no longer for keymo to communicate with her .  she needed a solution to take to the meeting  any solution  even one for a minor problem .      jacob  raise keymo on the comlink     she said .     see if he s come up with anything on the hyperwave bit .         keymo reports some limited success     jacob said .     he can now see certain features of key teleportation that he had not seen before  features that might potentially serve as a method of instantaneous communication quite unlike current hyperwave communication .         good .  could it be called continuous modulation .         yes .  but it modulates a sort of hybrid wave  not hyperwaves as we know them .         good .  that seems like a small distinction .     particularly since she didn t know what any of it meant .     that must be what the aliens are talking about .      let s go     she said .      we re well ahead of time     jacob said .      drive slow     she said as she walked out of the apartment with jacob trailing closely behind .   he had requisitioned a small nonautomated runabout the night before  but not without some difficulty .  with the evacuation at its peak  transport vehicles were in short supply .   main street was bumper to bumper with traffic  but it was all moving briskly so that jacob  following her instructions to drive slowly  parted the traffic like a rock in a turbulent river .  all eight lanes were flowing northbound to expedite the transfer of materiel .   still  they arrived at the dome opening at      am  more than twenty minutes ahead of time .  at the dome opening  the street narrowed to four lanes and then turned into a dirt road a few meters north of the dome .   wohler   was already standing vigil on the west side of the opening where the meeting with the aliens would again take place .  this time she did not plan to make wohler   a participant .      drive on north  jacob     ariel said .     i don t want to appear anxious .      she knew she must sound inconsistent  edgy to leave one moment  reluctant to arrive the next .  she had to remind herself that he was just a robot and couldn t care  and so didn t judge her one way or the other .  it was a good thing .  she already felt inadequate enough .   ten minutes later  jacob said     we are at the halfway turnaround point  miss ariel .      she had been deep in her dome problem  still unable to think of anything that could serve to stall the aliens further .  the closure of the dome seemed inevitable .      fine     she said and glanced at him .     let s turn around .      for just a second  a quick thrill of affection for jacob coursed through her mind .  he was such a handsome hulk and so thoughtful and caring .   he was clad in an attractive  short sleeve top of loose weave that she had picked out .  she had selected it for this occasion because of its casualness .  she was clad informally as well .  she didn t want the aliens thinking she was toadying up to them  no matter that they might not be able to classify her attire one way or the other .  it was more a matter of establishing the proper frame of mind   in her mind .   she reached over impulsively and patted him on the forearm .  she put out of her mind the thought that he was incapable of not being thoughtful and caring  incapable of acting otherwise  and programmed so .  and he was a handsome hulk .   he gave her a quick glance in turn .      is there something else  miss ariel .         oh  yes  jacob .  there is .  i just hadn t anticipated it back on aurora when i first asked for your companionship .      after all  he was only a robot .  she kept telling herself that  over and over .      then i can be of further service .     jacob said  questioning .      you could  indeed  jacob .  it s just that i can t accept that service  no matter how delightful i might find it .      and then there popped into her mind the image of derec  waving  standing far away at the end of a long row of waving green corn .  and she wondered where that memory came from .  she had never been in a cornfield with derec .  not that she could remember .   and that brought her back to her present responsibility  which was more an obligation to derec  to carry out his wishes  for she had only negative feelings for the robot city otherwise .   still  the obligation remained .      do you see any sign of the aliens  jacob .     she asked .      possibly     jacob said .     i see three blackbodies that have just descended into a circular flight pattern around the dome .         can you time our return so that we arrive just after they have landed .         i will endeavor to do so .      he succeeded .   she got out of the runabout  walked over to face the aliens  and decided not to bow .  jacob stood to one side and slightly behind her .   affecting a faint note of haughtiness  she said     good morning  ambassadors .      they had called themselves leaders the day before  but she refused to use that term for fear they might misconstrue themselves to be her leaders .      gud mahnin   miz ahyahl wilsh     the middle alien said .   ariel could not help smiling broadly .  the webster grove accent took her by surprise again  but she immediately set her mind to eliminate it from consideration so as to avoid the less than serious attitude she had briefly lapsed into the day before .      this is my assistant  neuronius     the middle alien continued  bunching on the right side what looked like a shoulder in silhouette     and this is my third in command  axonius     and he bunched his silhouette on the left .   ariel responded by inclining her head in the appropriate direction as each was introduced  a casual  restrained acknowledgment short of a pronounced nod .   the alien did not use the grand gesture that sarco had used the day before when he had introduced synapo  but it still left ariel wondering whether she was dealing with synapo or sarco .   here she was  on thin ice already  and the meeting had just begun .  she guessed that it must be synapo .  it was he who had dominated the meeting the day before .  on the other hand  these others were subordinates .  they did not rate the grand gesture  even if this were sarco .   she had nothing with which to parley except the analysis of hyperwave modulation that jacob and keymo had concocted at her prodding .  and if this were synapo  and if she had construed properly   that his green flaming the day before was an impatient assessment of sarco s complaint   then it must have been a trivial complaint in synapo s mind and not much of a bargaining chip for her side .   not knowing for sure whom she was dealing with  she decided to stall .   she said     i trust that you have now concluded that closing the dome does not have any immediate importance since it is already ninety nine point two percent effective .         on the contrary  we feel it would be better to close the compensator and to completely enclose any such creations in the future     the alien replied .     although the emissions from the creation that wohler   calls a city have been brought under control  we are still concerned  for the city may merely be a harbinger of worse things yet  things that lie off world and are yet to be inflicted upon us .         i can assure you that no such dire things exist .  we merely want to share this planet with you and are quite willing to go to great lengths to insure our mutual compatibility .         that would be more reassuring if it were to come from a leader .  that would be a member of your he clan  if i downloaded wohler   correctly .      another male chauvinist like wohler    ariel thought .  this big bat had to be a male .  clearly .   the entire universe was filled with insufferable males .      not necessarily .  women   our she clan as you describe them    have often been leaders  and able leaders  functioning quite as well as men   our he clan .         but most leaders are still members of the he clan .  is that correct .         yes     ariel was forced to reply .   the discussion was certainly not going well .  ariel decided to risk her only bargaining chip in an effort to turn things around .   without giving the other a chance to respond  she said     but let s get back to the main points of our discussion  the things we have been doing that are disturbing to you .  we do not wish to disturb you in any way and are willing to go far to insure that that does not occur .      for instance  we can change our modulation of hyperwave from discrete to continuous so as not to disrupt your listening comfort .      a small flame of irritation shot from beneath his eyes  smaller than the day before  but still a respectable  quite noticeable  luminous green jet .      sarco .     he said like he was uttering a curse .     that hyperwave disturbance is not important enough to discuss here .  my esteemed colleague is a music lover and prone to give those minor disturbances more attention than they deserve .      she had shot her wad  and at the wrong alien .      still     she said     that does show how far we are willing to go to avoid disturbing your people .  that should reassure you as to our intentions .         proper reassurance can only be supplied by your leader .      with strangely mixed emotions   longing and irritation inexplicably intertwined   she thought  i am the leader here  mister bat  and you re stuck with me .  but i wish my darn partner were here instead of way off cruising down some alien cornfield .   she didn t stop to question where that strange image came from   the vision of derec at the other end of a green  green cornfield  the yearning for derec was too intense  and then the answer to the dome problem struck her with that marvelous insight that can come only from one brain hemisphere communicating with the other  passing on the subconscious machinations of the one that are hidden from the other .   for the first time  she felt in command of the situation .     chapter     neuronius strikes    synapo was growing impatient with the she alien .  the discussion was becoming tedious and unrewarding  and at the same time had not yet provided a suitable circumstance for embarrassing and discrediting his striking subordinate  neuronius .   it was becoming more and more obvious that the small alien was in no sense a leader  that synapo must somehow contrive to bring to his world a true leader of the aliens .  in the meantime  he would have to direct sarco to close the compensator and to start construction of the next one if  as he suspected  they were beginning to construct a second city on the other side of the plain of serenity .   those were the thoughts that had led up to his last remark  and now the small  tedious alien was speaking again .      there is no need to bring another leader to this world .  you are looking at one .  i had hoped to continue with the construction of our city  but that appears now to be impossible in view of your irrational fear that we have some insidious and covert plan to irrevocably disturb this planet .      the manner and bearing of the little alien had changed  her voice had taken on a different timbre .  had neuronius noticed the subtle changes .   he discounted her attempt to belittle them by use of the adjective irrational .  disparagement was a not uncommon diplomatic ploy that was sometimes effective  but not often so  yet still worth the gamble in her case .  he recognized that  but would the haughty neuronius recognize her ploy and properly discount it .  or would he let irritation distort his analysis .   and would neuronius recognize those subtle changes in her demeanor that were pure telepathy  transmitting information more effectively than the spoken word .      we have other  more compatible methods of cohabitating with you on this planet     she continued .     the city under the dome in its present state would be essentially deactivated and serve merely as a coordination and communications center for the new effort .      she had switched diplomatic techniques  discarding the superior  haughty manner   every bit as haughty as neuronius   and was now the companionable  friendly tactician .  that was indeed the sign of a genuine leader .  would neuronius recognize that and be able to switch tactics himself .   she had abandoned her mission s preferred goal  apparently  and was regrouping around an alternative  again the sign of a true leader with full authority to make important field decisions .      please describe this compatible method of cohabitation     synapo said .      let me first ask a question .  do i  by myself  constitute a weather node  or my companion jacob here  or our vehicle here with us in it .      she had inclined her head toward the servant and pointed to the creation behind her  the vehicle .      no     synapo replied .     none of those entities  singly or together  create a weather node .  the thermal disturbance is too small and quickly dissipates .         good     she said .     we will switch  then  from an urban  energy intensive mode to an agricultural  labor intensive mode  from a centralized society to a dispersed society  from industrial products to agricultural products  from robot cities  which you feel compelled to cover with domes   your node compensators    to robot farms that you will find completely benign .      wohler   had not provided the agricultural and farm terminology  so synapo could not immediately translate the small alien s words .  he had to extrapolate from all that he had been told by her and by wohler   and from all the previous data he had acquired by monitoring the aliens  hyperwave transmissions  but still it took him only a moment .      by agriculture you mean the intentional cultivation of grasses and other plants like those growing on the plain of serenity and in the forest of repose  and by farms you mean the land subdivisions where this takes place .  is that correct .         yes     the small alien replied .      we have been exceedingly patient with your invasion of our world .  you did not inquire whether this was a reasonable thing to do  nor negotiate ahead of time a suitable program for doing so  and when it did not prove to be reasonable  and we took steps to isolate the disturbance in as minimal a way as possible  you killed two of our people .      yes  we have been patient beyond any reasonable translation of that word  and now i m going to ask that you be as patient with us today as we have been with you these many days past .  your patience will be tried  not by violence and death   as ours has been   but by boredom and ennui as we carry out  as we must  the rituals of our government as they were set up uncounted millennia ago .      at that time an ancient cerebronian philosopher by the name of petero observed that all of our levels of government were filled by incompetents  that indeed government officials rose to their ultimate level of competence and then one level beyond  where they then remained  incompetent  for lack of ability to advance further .      the observation was so striking and so self  evident that it became known as petero s principle  and all government was immediately reorganized to include the strike factor  whereby any official may be declared incompetent and displaced merely by a subordinate showing greater competence at that higher level .      that  by definition  proves that the former official was incompetent  that is  not as competent as he could have been  and the process of proof  whatever form it takes  is known as striking for the higher position .      so i now turn responsibility for these proceedings over to my subordinate  neuronius  so that he may evaluate and respond to your proposal .      as he made the last statement  synapo graciously gestured in neuronius s direction and carefully watched his subordinate for involuntary reflexes  the body language  the telepathy that would tell him what was going through his subordinate s mind .   and if axonius were competent for command  he would also be studying the mindset that neuronius would be bodycasting   broadcasting with his body .  and axonius would take that into consideration when he finally rendered his detailed analysis and final judgment of neuronius in a caucus of the cerebron elite .   so in a sense  not only neuronius and synapo  but axonius as well  was on trial  for it would be the cerebron elite  in caucus  who would render the final judgment that would restructure the government of the cerebrons  if this immediate negotiation proved to be a decisive node in their history .   and in that negotiation with the aliens  axonius must be the tie splitter   on the spot   if synapo and neuronius disagreed .  axonius could be placed in a quite delicate position .  he could literally be dumped from the elite if he made a wrong decision  no matter how the contest between synapo and neuronius came out .   however  axonius did have one factor going for him  he had nine votes in a caucus that would exclude synapo and neuronius .  each member of the elite had votes corresponding in number to his position in the hierarchy .   so now  all of this was surely going through the minds of the other two cerebrons as synapo turned to neuronius to obtain his response .   the bodycast was not good .  neuronius radiated confidence  and that must surely have an effect on axonius  which could make things difficult for synapo if neuronius took a contrary course .      miss ariel welsh  you plead a good case for the cause of your people     neuronius said .     perhaps i do not fully understand all that you said  but my mentor is an excellent instructor who has never failed me thus far  so i m reasonably sure i understood the gist of your remarks .      you radiate confidence and sincerity and all the other aspects essential to the execution of leadership  so you can surely not be found at fault in that regard     and your proposed change to the labor intensive mode of agriculture seems   on the surface   benign  as you so eloquently describe it .      the node compensator is operating at ninety nine point two percent efficiency  and that has proved acceptable in cerebron caucus  so that certainly is a point in your favor .      and neither you nor your servant  taken individually  nor the small collection represented by one of your loaded vehicles   all small thermal emitters   constitute a weather node  as my mentor has concluded .      those are all positive arguments that weigh in your favor  but we must counterpose on the scale the few negative things which argue against your proposal before we can assess which way the scale finally tips .      and surely weighing in against your proposal are the deaths of our two colleagues  and in the particular case of the last fatality  the passive state of our colleague before his death   in tether  a grim way to die without being able to defend one s self .  how many more deaths of ceremyons lie in the future .      yet those deaths   which can be largely attributed to misunderstandings by incompetent servants   and the small likelihood of more deaths in the future  do not tip the scale against you .      now we must weigh the true nature of the agricultural mode and the supporting  partially compensated  city nodes  and there is where we stumble .      we know nothing about the agricultural mode except your reassurances of its serene harmlessness  nor do we know what additional emanations may find their way out of the opening in the city compensator .      you term our fears irrational  when any rational being  considering your past performance  must judge your actions to be frightening and such fears to be well founded .      we mourn our dead colleagues  and we are ever so uncertain concerning the nature of your proposal  so we have no choice but to vehemently oppose your further occupation of our planet .  we do not consider your intentions benign  miss ariel welsh  not by a hooked eye .      neuronius hunched his wings and fell silent .   the fool  synapo thought .  he has just cast himself from the elite .  there is little doubt of that .  and just as i suspected .  he reacted to the small alien s haughty disparagement when she used the term    irrational .     it weighed in heavily with the fool s own irrationality .  his basic paranoia .  which i have long suspected .   thank god for the level headed axonius .   now it was time for synapo to cast his own vote .   if he agreed with neuronius  he would only have to say so  and axonius would be off the hook .  for synapo to register his opposition  he had only to ask axonius for his opinion .   which he did .      and how say you  axonius .      for the second time that morning  synapo felt some misgivings .  axonius s body language showed fear and irresolution when he should have been exuding confidence and decisiveness .      clearly     axonius said     neuronius has properly assessed the situation and has come to a remarkably astute conclusion .      synapo was stunned .  his clever strategy had backfired completely .  his attention this past year had been too much on the paranoia of neuronius  and he had failed to properly assess axonius  who had always seemed such a reliable lieutenant .  that was where synapo had gone wrong  perhaps  the difficulty of properly assessing someone you basically like and who invariably agrees with you .   it was a mere formality now .  synapo was foremost a statesman and a loyal ceremyon  and a politician only when it wouldn t hurt the tribes .   he could have opposed his two subordinates  and the elite might grudgingly have supported him  but then he would have presented to the aliens the picture of a race and a government in disarray .  it was more the position of the elite to acknowledge that disarray after the fact and to show magnanimity toward the aliens and flexibility in government by reversing the decision of their agents .      we agree  then     he said .     it pains me  miss ariel welsh  but your proposal cannot be accepted .  in our short acquaintance  i have come to admire and respect you    your forthrightness and courage and unfailing good humor .  may all those attributes stand you in good stead as you take this painful decision back to your people .      he was finished as the leader of the cerebrons unless he could get this decision reversed in caucus   and in a caucus truncated to nine members with the nine votes of axonius weighing in against him .     chapter     s . o . s .     immediately after the meeting  ariel and jacob returned to the apartment .  jacob started toward his storage niche  but ariel forestalled him .      fix a large garden salad  jacob     she said     with thousand island and a couple of glasses of milk .  set the table for two .  and then join me .  it won t hurt you to .  act human for a change  like you re enjoying my company .  that s an order .         that is an order not difficult to comply with     jacob said .      do you like thousand island dressing .     ariel asked .      whatever pleases you  miss ariel .  lacking true taste buds  i really have no preference .         what a shame .  you re missing half the pleasure of life .         experiencing the pleasure of taste has never been my privilege .  but of course     he added swiftly  so as to preclude generating displeasure for ariel     neither have i missed it .         did you have any reaction to the meeting this morning  then .  pleasure  displeasure .         my positronic potentials registered a sharp disturbance when it was apparent that the aliens were not going to endorse your proposal .  i was reacting  however  not to a subjective or objective analysis  but to the knowledge that you were going to be intensely disappointed and in a quandary as to how to proceed .         you have certainly analyzed my reaction correctly .  quandary is the operative word .  i ve held off calling derec until now because i wanted to be able to tell him what he had to do rather than have him tell me what i had to do .      jacob keyed the food processor and received a head of lettuce  two tomatoes  a cucumber  a handful of mushrooms  a block of cheddar cheese  a block of ham  a package of bacon bits  and a package of croutons .  derec had done a great deal to improve food processor technology while he was on robot city .      i really had a darn good chance of being in the driver s seat     ariel continued .     when that farm inspiration came to me  i really thought it was the answer .  i really thought old synapo would buy it .      she didn t say anything more then .  the vision of green auroran truck farms and golden wheat fields had come to mind .  she could see the robots moving down the green  weedless rows  harvesting lettuce  tomatoes  cucumbers  the very things jacob was taking from the food processor .   those same farms would flourish equally well right here on oyster world .  this world could be the breadbasket for this part of the developing galaxy .  and without interfering with the aliens at all .  there would be no need for expensive and energy wasting food processors in this part of the galaxy if all one wanted was a simple green garden salad .   she had failed to create the same image in synapo s mind .  but how could she have succeeded .  how was he to understand something that was as alien to him as his government was to her .  she had been expecting too much .   yet was his government so strange .  she herself had seen many instances on aurora   city governments with their bureaus and committees and councils   which petero s principle fit perfectly  all positions filled with incompetents  almost without exception .      i guess it s not so strange that the aliens didn t buy my proposal     she said .     they are aliens and can t possibly think like we do .  yet their government makes sense  odd sense  mind you  as you might expect coming from aliens .  nothing a bunch of humans would ever come up with .  it makes too much sense .      and i guess it s just wishful thinking to expect synapo to change his mind .  so when you think about it  i guess i m not really in a quandary  am i  jacob .         so it would appear  miss ariel     jacob replied .   in a process that was too fast for the human eye to follow  he had torn the lettuce into bits  sliced the tomatoes  and had diced everything else except the bacon bits and croutons .  now he was tossing  in a large bowl  everything but the ham  cheese  bacon bits  and croutons .      they ll close the dome tomorrow     ariel said     and we ll be camping out .         that seems to be the only logical deduction .         so i ve got to call derec for help  right .         quite so     jacob agreed .      how do i do that .         i do not have personal knowledge of that function .  i will check with wohler   using the comlink .      at the same time  he keyed the food processor for milk and thousand island dressing .   ariel said nothing  and then  while he set the table  jacob reported from the comlink .      avernus   supervises mr .  avery s special monitor link .         tie in to him     ariel said .      i now have avernus       jacob said .      tell him to transmit the following message to derec .      ariel hesitated  thinking  while jacob finished putting everything on the table .  he had topped two bowls of salad with diced ham and cheese  ladled out a generous dollop of thousand island dressing onto each  and then sprinkled on the bacon bits and croutons .   then she said     no .  ask him first what s special about derec s link  how does it work .      she sat down at the table and motioned for jacob to do likewise  and they both began to eat .      avernus   says that the connection with derec s internal monitor is not made over hyperwave     jacob said .     it is a special system dr .  avery developed .  the equipment is mounted on the mobile platform supporting the computer mainframe and on the mainframe s backup platform  but is accessible by all seven supervisor robots .         and who has detailed technical knowledge of the system .     ariel asked .     user s manual  wiring diagrams  maintenance manual .         avernus   and the technician on each of the two computer platforms .         i ll bet a pewter button that derec s special link does use hyperwave  but unlike it s ever been used before .  it s not common  ordinary discrete modulation .      dr .  avery has beat us to it  dam it .  he s already invented the aliens  continuous modulation .      jacob  hook keymo into your comlink connection  and tell avernus to describe derec s monitor system to him .  see if the two of them don t agree that it s continuous modulation of hyperwave as keymo would define it .       that connection and analysis took a little longer than quick  but still consumed less than two minutes .      avernus   replies in the affirmative     jacob said .     to communicate with all robot cities  master derec s internal monitor metabolically manipulates hyperwave in a manner similar to what keymo describes as continuous modulation .         bingo     ariel said .     derec does it and doesn t even know how he does it .  and i don t need to know anything about engineering to do engineering .  tell avernus to ring up derec and give him this message      crisis here on oyster world .  you must immediately reprogram avery robots .  i also have a bit of important engineering technology to teach you  dum dum .  in fact  your own internal engineering  so come at once .      sign it  love  ariel  and ask for confirmation .      for ten minutes jacob said nothing while ariel forked salad into her mouth and mooned over derec .  with that wild imagination one has when extrapolating hope  she visualized synapo meeting with her before derec arrived  telling her the aliens had changed their minds and would accept her proposal .  she would then be the aliens  kind of leader .   no matter what  the robots would have to be reprogrammed .  they weren t going to build any robot city on this planet .   while they were finishing their lunch  jacob broke the silence .       avernus   has received this reply from master derec      on my way  smarty pants .  love  derec .      she spent the rest of the afternoon on the balcony  which overlooked main street  sitting in the subdued light of the perpetual dusk under the dome  reading a book of poems she took with her whenever she traveled  selected poetry of old earth .   it was an ancient book  bound in soft brown imitation suede  and printed in a small  graceful font on one side of thin  translucent  parchment like paper .  it was the only thing her mother had ever given her that she truly treasured .  juliana welsh had given her a lot of expensive things  clothes  jewelry  cars  fliers  jumpers  but seldom anything with the taste and thought that was reflected in the selection of that little book .  she wondered if her mother had picked it out or had merely asked one of their robots to pick up something via the hyperwave shopping service .   she came to a very short poem she had forgotten  but when she reread it  it seemed like a piece of wisdom that might apply at almost any time in a person s life   robert frost wisdom     the secret sits    we dance round in a ring and suppose   but the secret sits in the middle and knows .     that s what she seemed to be doing .  dancing around the solution to the problem .  she had come so close to the answer in that meeting with synapo and his lieutenants .  he had said as much with that elaborate apology he had left her with  as though he would have done things differently if it had been left up to just him .  in that case  would he really have bought her proposal .   she looked up every now and then to stare at the opening in the dome .  it made her uneasy .  what if they could suddenly close it and trap them all inside that insidious blackness .  there would be no way out  no way that human technology could provide .   but she didn t want to camp out  and she certainly didn t want to spend any more time in that tiny  cramped  two passenger jumper than she absolutely had to .   after dinner jacob rigged a viewing screen on the balcony so she could spend the evening keeping an eye on that critical opening in the dome while she watched a library tape of an old hyperwave drama involving elijah baley  gladia solaria  and the robot daneel olivaw .  .   she could not see the dome opening when she looked up .  the starshine in the black sky was not bright enough to be seen through pupils contracted by the illumination required to present elijah baley in all his glory .  but she could see the lights of the robot traffic far out on the plain  traffic that was now diminishing as the materiel transfer neared completion .   when she went to bed  she posted jacob on the balcony with instructions to call her immediately if he saw any change in the size of the dome opening .   in the middle of the night  she dreamt that she was trying to escape from that black void inside the dome  piloting her hyperspace jumper with the monster synapo sitting beside her in the cockpit  heading on a course that would take them down main street with the compass tower far in the distance .  but she was still out in the void  hanging motionless at least a kilometer from where main street began  with her throttle pushed to its limit  and stretching away from her toward main street were long  long rows of waving green corn  and standing at the end of main street  far away down those rows of corn  was derec waving and beckoning for her to come to him .  she turned to look at synapo in the midst of a feeling of disoriented horror  and a crimson flame shot out of the blackness beneath his luminous green eyes and bummed her hand .   she awoke drenched in perspiration  her hand resting painfully on the sharp corner of the nightstand beside her bed .  she finally drifted back to sleep  yearning for derec to be there in bed beside her  but back on aurora  not there on oyster world .     by ten o clock the next morning  the materiel transfer dwindled to a halt  and with their limited possessions piled in the runabout beside them  ariel and jacob stood outside the dome at the meeting site  keeping vigil with wohler   and his lorry  waiting to witness the final closure of the dome .   five minutes passed         am   and no blackbodies had shown up to send their shimmering additions down the edge of the dome  then a half hour  and then an hour  and still no construction activity .   there weren t even any signs of preconstruction activity like the long line of blackbodies that had formed on other mornings heading toward the apex of the dome opening  like an outspiraling thread unwinding from a black hole  from a spherical black mass that from far away could not be resolved into individual blackbodies basking on the wing in the light of the sun .   there was no dull black ball in the sky this morning .  the blackbodies were up there like every other morning  but unlike construction days  they were loosely dispersed from horizon to horizon  languidly circling  soaking up the sun s radiation .   ariel and the two robots sat there all day waiting for something to happen and nothing did  no construction activity and no visit from the aliens to explain the lack of activity .   ariel ate lunch and dinner from supplies wohler   had stashed in the lorry for her  supplies that were to last a month to give them time to get the oyster world dilemma resolved .   derec was due to arrive in three days  one day to get far enough away from that other planet to allow the jump through hyperspace  and two days to travel in from the jump arrival point  the nearest clearsafe in the oyster world zone .   they spent the night in the open .  ariel slept on the long back seat of the open lorry under the stars of a cloudless sky .  she refused to spend another night under the dome with the threat of its imminent closure literally hanging over her .  one night like that was enough .     chapter     wolruf stands inspection    they arrived at the clearing well before noon  following a large animal trail derec had discovered and explored with mandelbrot a few days before .  although the forest cover discouraged the growth of dense underbrush  there were scattered patches that occasionally blocked the trail for homo sapiens  low branches that the animals who had made the trail   possibly silverside s erstwhile associates   simply walked under .   the trail was clear now  of course .  when they had first explored it  mandelbrot had simply fashioned his arm into a machete   the arm that was made of robot city material   and cleared the way with a motion that bore some resemblance to a buzz saw .   this morning derec led the way  with mandelbrot next  then wolruf  and finally silverside bringing up the rear .  silverside kept up a steady conversation with wolruf during the hour that it took to reach the clearing .   derec could hear the buzz of conversation but was too far in front to make out what they were saying .  when he reached the clearing  and as they approached  he could hear them clearly but still couldn t understand them .  they were no longer speaking standard .   mandelbrot was already erecting the tent as wolruf walked into the clearing .      i don t believe this     she said .       ees already speaking my language .  not fluently  et .  but give  im another decad and  e ll be speaking it like a native .         yes .  he has a marvelous affinity for new knowledge     derec said .  it made him uneasy  that affinity .   derec gathered some stones from the brook and built a fireplace .  wolruf put the inside of the tent in order .  mandelbrot gathered firewood .   silverside disappeared .  it wasn t until derec finished construction of the fireplace that he noticed silverside was gone .  wolruf was fast asleep in the tent on one of the cots she had erected .  she really wasn t much of an outdoors person  not at all like derec in that respect .   there was no point in looking for silverside .  this was his habitat far more than theirs .  they might never see him again .   the thought of that filled derec with dismay .  he had become vitally interested in the strange robot   a fascinating study in alien robotics .  he had learned a great deal merely by association  but he needed to learn much more  including its origin and the purpose of its original programming .   and he had sucked wolruf into the problem as well .  he had brought her    half across the galaxy    as she had so emphatically pointed out .  how was he going to explain that he would not need her services any longer .  that she had come all this way for nothing .   when wolruf awoke  she took the news of silverside s disappearance quite calmly .      good     she said .     can i go  ome now  back to civilissation .  can we at least go back to the city .         he ll come back     derec said more confidently than he felt .     we ll at least stay overnight .  he might not come back to the city  but he ll come back here .      they spent a quiet afternoon .  derec read .  wolruf slept .  mandelbrot stood guard  just outside the clearing  facing away from the campsite  with his back against a tree on the other side of the brook .  silverside would have a hard time getting at his switch panel that way .   after dinner  after it got dark  hoping to attract silverside  derec built up the fire so that it lighted the entire clearing .   mandelbrot stayed at his guard post .  wolruf dozed in the warmth of the fire .  derec thought about ariel  and that brought him to jacob winterson and  putting jacob out of his mind  brought him back full circle to worrying about silverside .   the fire died down .  derec was talking when wolruf quietly laid a hand on his arm and pointed across the fire to the other side of the clearing  the side away from mandelbrot s guard post .   there   just inside the clearing  in the faint light of the dying fire   were two gray wolf like shapes  sitting on their haunches .  when he looked at them  the firelight caught the backsides of their eyes and came back at him as a ghostly green glow .  that must have been how wolruf had seen them in the first place  they were otherwise almost invisible .      master derec     mandelbrot called softly from behind them     we are surrounded by animals circling around the campsite .  should i take any action .         can you suggest anything suitable .     derec asked .      not at the moment     mandelbrot replied .      stay at your post then     derec said .      i  ate stuff like this     wolruf said .     why do you alwayss  ave to bring me along .      just then the shape on the right threw back its head and howled  long and piercingly  letting it trail off slowly into a series of soft sobs .   that howl was answered by an identical howl from the forest that seemed to progress halfway around the campsite before it  too  sobbed to a finish .   the two shapes rose then and trotted toward the campfire .  the one on the left was smaller  wolruf s size  and as they approached the campfire  its form became silvery while the form of the other  standing a meter at the shoulder  became more distinctly mottled black and dark gray .   after coming well into the light of the fire  the larger beast turned and loped into the forest .  the small silvery beast came around the fire and sat down on its haunches beside wolruf .      that was lifecrier     the small beast said .     he wanted to inspect wolruf .         silverside .     derec queried .      yes .  surely you can tell it s me .  the imprint is quite realistic .         and did i pass muster .     wolruf asked .      i wouldn t be here if you hadn t  mistress wolruf     silverside replied .   she had achieved a remarkable likeness to wolruf  considering that the robot was an organometallic construction from coarse cellular microbots .  the flat face  the pointed ears  the fingered forepaws were all in character .  she had even achieved a good simulation of the fur without creating individual hairs .      i think the wolves have gone  master derec     mandelbrot informed them .      i would suspect so  mandelbrot     derec said .     silverside is back .  perhaps you should come and meet her in this new form .      mandelbrot crossed the brook and walked up to the fire .  he hardly glanced at silverside .      would you like me to build up the fire  master derec .     he asked .      yes     derec said     and then perhaps you should resume guard duty .  other beasties may come calling  some that are not so friendly .      those that had just left had not been nearly so friendly at one time  derec recalled .      and silverside  you might post yourself on the other side of the campsite  but don t stray so far into the forest this time .         mistress wolruf .     silverside said  questioning with a rising inflection .      yes .         are those your wishes .         of course .      silverside s fealty had clearly shifted to wolruf .   derec slept well until the middle of the night .  with silverside back in the fold  his attention had shifted to himself  and he went to sleep yearning to be with ariel .  the gentle snore from the cot next to him reminded him of ariel and aggravated the desire  but it was not enough to keep him awake long .   that night he didn t dream of ariel or of anything else .  the short hike  the outdoor environment  and the relief connected with silverside s return promoted sound sleep  and he didn t stir until shortly before dawn  when he was awakened by avernus s call over his internal monitor  transmitting ariel s call for help .     chapter     the vote on superior competence    immediately following the last  disastrous meeting with the aliens  synapo had circled up to charge altitude with neuronius and axonius trailing far behind .  he was looking neither to left nor right nor up nor down .  his eyes were open but staring straight ahead   staring  unseeing  out of a mind closed down by shock .   so when he arrived on station  he was surprised to see sarco there ahead of him  circling in synapo s space  hook set aggressively forward .   although it was virtually unheard of and highly unethical to communicate political matters by radio  neuronius must have done just that  radiating synapo s defeat for all to hear  while synapo  in shock  had his sensory equipment shut down .  else why would sarco be up here already  contesting synapo s dominance .   so  indeed  it had been a conspiracy  and it involved not only sarco and neuronius  but axonius as well .   synapo ignored sarco  and with his hook set aggressively forward  he winged sarco out of the way and took up his station in a tight circle immediately over the center of the compensator .      what s up .     sarco said  meekly yielding the space .     you don t seem happy .      synapo said nothing .      what happened down there .     sarco asked again  putting more insistence into his voice .      you should know     synapo finally said .     one of your cerebron toadies has already radioed you .         what are you talking about .  nobody has radioed anything  and i can t stand toadies  least of all a cerebron .         neuronius .  what about neuronius .         neuronius coached me in pronunciation of the alien language .  does that make the poor soul a toady .         poor soul  my hook .  he was just trying to stir up trouble between you and me  if you somehow don t relish that idea  then he was using you  sarco  and you must be exceedingly naive .         i must admit i thought it was an elegant idea  using your second in command to advantage in our rivalry .  but  synapo  it has always been a friendly rivalry .         neuronius is striking  sarco .  and with axonius on his side .  why do you think i took them both with me and excluded you rather unceremoniously .         frankly  i didn t know  and you didn t appear to want to explain .  so what did happen down there .         neuronius made a wrong decision involving the aliens  i reversed him  and axonius sided with him .  it was as simple as that .         that doesn t sound like axonius  synapo .  give me the details .  you three have involved all the myocerons .  you can t expect me to sit idly on the sidelines .         axonius had you fooled as well  eh .      with that slight dig  synapo proceeded to describe the meeting in detail .  before the end of the long account  sarco had rotated his hook so that it pointed passively aft  expressing silently but eloquently whose side he was on .   when synapo finished  sarco asked     when are you having your caucus .      synapo had put off that decision until sarco prodded him .  his mind had been so paralyzed he had not worked out a plan of action during his slow climb to station .      one hour from now     he replied  making a quick decision .      i hereby exercise my right as leader of the myostria     sarco said     and proclaim that caucus to be a joint gathering  a cerebron caucus and a myostrian hearing .  please announce it as such to your people  and i will do the same for mine .      it was an historic occasion .  a joint gathering of the elite of both tribes was something that occurred only once a decade or so  if that often .   in an ordinary cerebron caucus  synapo would be on station circling lazily above the center of the compensator in a large  loose circle with the other members of the cerebron elite flying to right and left  above and below  a wingspread apart .   in the larger assembly of a joint gathering  however  the flight caucus was not compatible with clear and audible communication  so a grounded gathering was held on the high crags atop the cliff of time   a ninety meter escarpment that cut across the intersection of the plain of serenity and the forest of repose eight kilometers to the northeast of the robot city and its node compensator .   synapo  with his hook set forward  stood on the highest crag while the other ten members of the cerebron elite stood below  facing him in a line on a slightly tilted table of flat granite .  their hooks were all set aft .   neuronius stood in the middle of the line immediately below synapo  axonius stood to his right  the next in rank stood to the left of neuronius  and the other members of the cerebron elite stood right and then left in descending order of rank in the hierarchy .   sarco  with his hook set aft  stood on a nearby crag on synapo s right  above the same rock table  with his elite gathered below him in similar fashion and within easy earshot of synapo .   in addition to sarco  there were fourteen other members of the myostrian elite .  it had been temporarily expanded to handle the increased load imposed by construction of the huge node that compensated the weather effects of the robot city .      as you all now know     synapo said  opening the joint gathering     we are in a strike situation  not only at the highest command level in the cerebron elite  but with regard to our world in general  for in all fairness  we must regard the invasion by the aliens as a strike for cohabitation of a world which we have previously regarded as strictly our own .      to regard the presence of the aliens in any other fashion is not to give them their just due  for we cohabit now with many lower forms of life .  the aliens may simply be another inferior species seeking peaceful coexistence .      on the other hand  that may not be so .  we must consider the possibility that we are seeing a superior race and may be bargaining from a disadvantageous position  trying then to retain cohabitation rights ourselves .      the cerebron elite and the leader of the myostria were all familiar with this philosophy of negotiation and with the details of the discussion that had already taken place as we undertook further discussion with the aliens this morning .      by this morning  however  it had come to my attention that neuronius was striking for command  so we entered this latest meeting with the aliens under slightly different circumstances .      if conditions were appropriate  it behooved me to give neuronius his chance to prove competent in command  to possibly prove superior competence in our continual striving to avoid the pitfalls that beset a governmental hierarchy described by petero s principle .      the cerebron caucus has been called this afternoon to judge that competence  while remembering our delicate situation with regard to our cohabitation with aliens .      synapo then summarized the discussion with the aliens that had taken place that morning up to the point when he had turned over control of the negotiations to neuronius .   after calling upon neuronius to defend his response to the aliens  proposal  synapo sailed down to the table rock to stand a pace in front of neuronius  who then sidled out from behind synapo  and with an awkward hop and a powerful flap of his wings  arrived at the position on the topmost crag that synapo had just vacated .      cerebrons  your challenge this afternoon is not just a matter of judging day to day competence of command .  the matter is far larger than that .  you must also judge competence in assessing and establishing the rank of the ceremyons in a galactic hierarchy that includes the invading aliens .      his body language radiated confidence  even arrogance .      there are many facets of superiority of one race with respect to another  but the fact of most concern to us should be whether we are superior enough to eject the aliens from our planet .  all else is the weak juice of the soft  degenerate culture synapo would have us embrace .      that summarizes the results of my cerebrations  and i responded accordingly .  there is no point in subjecting you to useless rhetoric .  i told the aliens that we could no longer tolerate their presence on our planet and terminated the negotiations .      synapo was stunned for the second time that day .  that last was a brazen lie .  he  synapo  had terminated the negotiations that morning .  for neuronius to lead the caucus to believe otherwise was to presume the outcome of the forthcoming vote .   neuronius paused for just a moment and then continued     however  i did not tell the aliens how i propose to insure their removal .  threats merely alert the enemy and eliminate the element of surprise .      but to this caucus i suggest   and strongly recommend   that we immediately remove them the way one of their number accidentally and effectively removed himself from our world   when he blindly ran into the edge of an embryonic compensator .      neuronius paused for a moment .  then he dramatically rotated his hook forward .      i suggest we ship them all into the black eternity that lies beyond space and time  where those two part company in the bowels of a node compensator .       neuronius stood silently on the crag for a moment  and then sailed down to the table rock and waddled back to his place in the line behind synapo .   for a while the silence was disturbed only by neuronius  by the rustle of his wings and the soft slap of his feet against the table rock as he moved to resume his position in the line .   finally  when even those sounds were complete  the only thing to be heard was the soft sigh of excess oxygen being vented here and there among the assembly .   synapo was appalled by the suggestion  so disconcerted he had a hard time taking it in .   finally  he spoke again from his position on the table rock .      axonius  i appoint you temporary chairman of the caucus  for the purpose of stating your position  taking other statements from any who may care to speak  and finally tallying the vote on superior competence .      that was the standard statement to make at that point in the proceedings  and that was fortunate  for he could not have trusted himself to say anything else after neuronius had presented such a quixotic solution to the alien problem .   axonius now flew up to the topmost crag .   neuronius had impaled axonius on the horns of a terrible dilemma  unless synapo had completely misjudged the younger cerebron .  axonius was an opportunist   that had become clear that morning   but he was not a killer .   synapo knew exactly what was going through axonius s mind and could sympathize with him and feel his anguish   a terrible anguish his body language clearly bespoke  the flicker in his eyes  the slight flutter of his cold junction  the tight way he was hugging his wings to his body .   axonius was finished .  the only way he could possibly save his position in the elite after the foolhardy position he had taken that morning was to vote for neuronius and hope that he would win .  yet he was a gentle being and could not honorably endorse the violence recommended by neuronius .  he had misjudged neuronius  and now he would have to pay the terrible penalty for that unfortunate error .   synapo wondered how well axonius would handle it .  he wanted to see him unbowed by defeat  wanted to feel he had not completely misjudged him .      honorable leaders  fellow cerebrons  fellow ceremyons  i am placed this afternoon in an exceedingly awkward position .      good  synapo thought  that s the first promising observation i ve heard from a cerebron all day .      this morning     axonius continued     it was my opinion that neuronius spoke from a position of superior competence in his assessment of what should be the posture of ceremyons if we are to insure our proper place in the galactic hierarchy  to use his terms .      it was not a decision arrived at lightly .  i have great respect for our leader  and have never before seen him come to an erroneous judgment .  he is completely right in pursuing a policy of peaceful cohabitation with all life forms on our world .      but is he right in applying that same policy to any galactic species that may take a notion to inhabit our planet .  how can we determine and judge the intentions of an alien species without conducting an experiment and risking our survival in the very process of the experiment .      it is an unfortunate dilemma which risks  on the one hand  prejudging and punishing an alien species without a hearing  but on the other hand  risks our very survival not to do so  not to prejudge .      mine was not a decision arrived at impetuously this morning .  we have all been pondering the problem and updating our cerebrations with each report of the negotiations by our leader .      so this morning  the risk to our survival seemed overwhelming  and i favored the position of neuronius as being the more competent exercise of leadership .      i shall not dwell unduly on the remarks of neuronius this afternoon  and will merely conclude by saying that i cannot in good conscience endorse them  they do not reflect competent leadership .      his hook had remained pointing aft throughout his remarks .   he hurried on then  no dramatic pauses  words tumbling out of his mouth in an effort to somehow put distance between himself and his own pronouncement .      would anyone else care to make a statement .     he said .  synapo was proud of axonius .  almost ready to forgive him .  axonius had stuck courageously to the position he had taken earlier that morning and yet had denied neuronius that afternoon .   synapo  like everyone else  was expecting any further remarks to come from the cerebron elite before axonius called upon him for a final statement  giving him the traditional privilege of last remarks before the vote .   so they were all surprised when sarco spoke up  standing on the crag to axonius s right .      honorable chairman  under ordinary circumstances any remarks that i might make to a cerebron caucus would be off the record unless i were called as an official witness  which i have not been this day .  in fact  quite the contrary .  the myostrians are here because of leader privilege which i exercised  recognizing this meeting to be of vital concern to the myostria .  this is our world as well as yours  cerebrons  and ordinarily decisions affecting our mutual welfare are jointly arrived at by friendly discussion between the leaders of the two tribes .      today  a matter of vital concern to both tribes is unavoidably going to be decided by the exclusive vote of a cerebron truncated caucus  without our leader being able to participate in the decision .      you can understand my concern  then  and the reason i ask to be considered an official witness in your proceedings .  how say you  mr .  chairman .         so noted and recorded  honorable leader     axonius confirmed .      my remarks will not be brief  yet neither am i given to excessive rhetoric .  i am fortunately not constrained by the extraordinary position axonius finds himself in .  quite the contrary .  i feel compelled to dwell at length on neuronius s position this morning and his remarks this afternoon .      as he was concluding those words  without pausing  sarco slued his hook around until it pointed forward .      taking the last first  his final statements this afternoon confirm what i have long suspected  he is a paranoid psychopath with a cunning way of hiding his affliction by artful words and soothing flattery until the hook needs be set .      then his pent up fears and irrational solutions come bursting forth  as we witnessed in stunned silence this afternoon .  if you were not stunned  myocerons  then you need to examine your own state of mind .      axonius obviously was  and his introspection guided him accordingly .  neuronius had him deluded with the promise of honorable ascension until this afternoon  when all the honor evaporated in the course of an irrational grab for power .      i can understand axonius s reasoning at this morning s meeting with the aliens  but a true leader has to look deeper than axonius did and reason rationally   as neuronius did not   to find the ultimate solution to problems  that solution which looks beyond immediate and easy resolution .      typically  synapo summed it all up quite concisely in his opening remarks this afternoon   somehow we can always count on him .  neuronius could have spared us all a lot of grief  if he had just been listening and taken heed  if he had just been listening to synapo s daily reports these past few days and taken heed .      setting honor aside   and the honor is quite as compelling to synapo as the logic   to strike blindly as neuronius recommends is to possibly kick the toe of a giant who then  as synapo suggests  may not be so willing to cohabit  and might even shuffle all myocerons into their own version of a space time partitioner or  perish the thought  some even more malevolent and painful form of annihilation .      to not strike blindly  but instead  to try to understand the aliens   and i am already impressed by their small leader and think i understand their intentions   is to soothe the giant under the worst of circumstances or to help and minister to a lesser species under the best of circumstances .  both are honorable directions for the myoceria .      neuronius has sorely misguided you  cerebrons .      synapo has already shown you the way .  i have merely reiterated what he so concisely and clearly pointed out .      please do not fail him .      a silence as keen as that which followed neuronius s last statement now fell upon the assembly .   axonius seemed in no hurry to break the silence  instead he seemed to be providing a space for the cerebrons to ponder sarco s remarks .   finally he said     are there any others who would like to make a statement .      but now he waited not at all before he said     if not  our honorable leader is here provided the traditional last words before the vote on superior competence .         i have nothing further to add to my colleagues  remarks     synapo said and turned his hook until it pointed aft to accept humbly whatever the cerebron elite might decide .   axonius took the vote by radio ballot  secret and unanimous .     chapter     bearer of glad tidings    when he heard axonius announce the favorable results of the unanimous vote  synapo immediately took flight  circling up and up into the calm sky  matching that calmness with the cold detachment he had induced in himself as sarco was speaking .   he was not surprised when sarco joined him  and he was grateful to sarco for the power of his oratory  but he wanted to be alone  and he had been on the point of ensuring himself that solitude when he detected sarco close behind .   with sarco close at hand  expecting some kind of dialogue  he could not balloon himself into isolation as he had intended  that would show neither tact nor the genuine gratitude he felt .   so he merely climbed to a safe ballooning altitude and then started circling in position  waiting for sarco to catch up .      i know you want to be alone     sarco said     and i ll not intrude on your time but for a brief moment  just long enough for a word of warning .         you re not intruding  old friend     synapo said     and rushing off as i did may have made me appear ungrateful for the service you rendered at the gathering .  but i am truly grateful and might not have won the endorsement of the elite if you hadn t made that impassioned speech .  you deserve to be where you are  sarco  the very antithesis of petero s principle .         i didn t come up here to be praised  you old jet  but to warn you about neuronius .         you and the elite have taken care of him  sarco .          for the moment  perhaps  but maybe not even for the moment .  he s dangerous  synapo .         neuronius .  dangerous .  to himself maybe .  he certainly confirmed that today .         no  to you  synapo .         i think not .  he s devious  and a liar  and not to be trusted  but hardly dangerous otherwise .         he was standing in back of you     sarco said .     you couldn t see his body language  his undisguisable reaction to that last bit of terse  indirect language axonius used to describe his competence to guide the caucus .      but i was watching him intently  synapo  then and again when i gave my harsh assessment of him .  he may even be dangerous to axonius and to me  but he s going to hold you responsible for his downfall  and you re the target he ll be focusing on .         perhaps  but there s little you or i can do about that     synapo said .     his danger to the future of the tribes  at least  has been eliminated by his departure from the elite .  that was my primary concern .         he s still a danger to the tribes so long as he can get at you and me .  and what about axonius .  where does he stand in the elite now .  he helped save your hide .         i m not sure at this point .  this has been a rather full day .  i m too exhausted to think clearly now .         i was impressed with his handling of the caucus  synapo .         and so was i .         i ll leave you now .  may petero guide your deliberations .         you agree that the alien proposal for cohabitation should be given a fair trial .         i ll not argue that     sarco said     not after what you ve been through .  yes  we ll postpone closure of the weather node compensator indefinitely .       he glided away .  synapo balled and immediately closed and inflated his reflector to its full extent  suitable for high altitude cerebrations .   although his storage cells were still critically low  and though his cerebrations in reflection mode would use a modest amount of juice  he could recharge to full capacity as he leisurely beat his way back from wherever the gentle air currents would take him during his silvery ruminations .   his first step in the direction of those ruminations had been taken when he reached stable altitude  and with only his hook  eyes  and primary vent protruding beneath the balloon  he surveyed the vast panorama .   the ceremyons were far below him at optimum charge altitude  replenishing their juice stores in random flight circles that covered the globe in a loosely dispersed pattern up to the dusk band .   the dusk band was creeping toward him from the east   powered by the natural rotation of his world and his slow easterly drift   delineating day from approaching night that was just barely visible as a thin black crescent sliced from the edge of the globe .   from such high altitude  he appeared to have drifted very little from the point where he had ballooned .  the compensator with the pie cut sector lay only a small way to the west .   he closed his eyes  purging his mind of stress and strain which gradually faded away to a calm serenity .   and he slept .   he awoke to a star studded frame surrounding the jet black circle of the planet .  and his mind went immediately to axonius  and to the answer to the question posed by sarco as they parted that afternoon .   he would keep axonius as his second in command .  to discard a competent aide who was now all the more valuable for the lesson he had just learned  and all the more loyal for the gratitude he could not help but feel  would be to exercise a petty vengeance that was not characteristic of the statesman synapo .   that resolved the tribe s hierarchical question  and the aliens had proposed a course that they felt promised harmonious cohabitation .  he had no more problems at that moment  questions perhaps  but no problems  for he did not consider neuronius a problem apart from the day to day governing of the cerebrons  and the only worthy question that remained   the question of the possible superiority of the aliens   he could do nothing to answer right then .   their small leader would make a friendly pet but was in no wise a threat  no more so than the servants  the avery robots .  the only question that remained was how did the small leader fit into the alien hierarchy  that part that still lay off world .       he could do nothing to answer that question now .  with a serene mind  he went back to sleep .   he awoke with his back to bright sunlight as he tossed quietly in the gentle turbulence created at the juncture of land and sea .  far to the west he could see the large node compensator with its pie cut sector visible only as a small departure from perfect sphericity on the right side .   he deflated then  contracting the outer silvery surface of the six gores  and by that contraction  rolling the paper thin hide into tight black rolls as the gores unsnapped at the continuous tongue and groove that kept them locked to one another while inflated .   the fluttering of the hide as he dropped through the thin air of the stratosphere was no competition for the powerful pull of the thin layer of smooth muscle that lay just below the silvery surface .  soon  all that was left of the balloon was a six segment collar  visible only as a small bump in the black silhouette .   the ocean was still far below when he spread his wings at optimum charge altitude and started flapping with powerful strokes toward the compensator .  despite the night s metabolic cleansing   the destruction and purging of waste products that constitutes rest   he felt stale and overworked .  he missed that fresh shot of juice he had become accustomed to during the construction of the compensator  when he dipped his cold junction into the icy water of the brook upon deflating in the early morning .   that was the only aspect of sarco s normal myostrian routine that he would like to adopt as a permanent part of the cerebron daily regime .  the nomadic cerebrons were never in one place long enough to find the icy brooks hidden in the forests scattered over their globe .   as he stroked west  his thoughts returned to sarco s warning the previous afternoon concerning the danger posed by his deposed lieutenant  neuronius .  he had been quick to dismiss neuronius as an empty threat when there were more important things to think about  but now  with those other issues either decided or in a dormant state awaiting further data  he considered the unhappy plight of neuronius .  what  if anything  could he do to help him .  extreme irrationality like that exhibited by neuronius was rare  almost nonexistent  among the ceremyons .  and being so rare  their society had not developed any truly effective remedies for want of suitable subjects to study .   being sensitive and compassionate  indispensable qualities of a true statesman  synapo had difficulty viewing the problem dispassionately .  he put himself with his feelings in neuronius s position  trying to imagine how despondent neuronius must feel at that moment .  in his ignorance of the true nature of that irrationality  with his compassion clouding his judgment  he failed to appreciate the machinations possible by someone like neuronius .   by dusk he was over the vast forest of respose  but still fifty kilometers from the plain of serenity .  despite the exertion of flight  he had recharged his cells to eighty percent of full capacity  so he tethered that night in the treetops with a feeling of satisfaction .  he had been so empty and so hungry for such a long time he felt almost like a glutton  nearly sated .   he arrived over the compensator early the next afternoon and took up his station circling above the center of the shimmering dome .  far below he could see the golden wohler   standing on the west side of the dome opening .  the small alien leader and her personal servant were sitting in the creation wohler   called a lorry .   synapo kept axonius in suspense for another four hours  and then just before dusk he summoned him by radio .      i ll want you to accompany me to a meeting with the aliens at the usual time tomorrow morning .  and notify petorius that he is now a member of the elite .      saying nothing more  synapo dropped to tether for the night in the forest of repose .  that was how axonius learned of his promotion and who would be the lucky cerebron to come in at the bottom in the moves that would bump neuronius from the top .     the next morning  synapo was standing on the west side of the opening in the compensator with axonius on his right  facing the small alien and her servant  the robot jacob winterson .      my government has reconsidered your proposal for cohabitation of our planet  miss ariel welsh     synapo said  opening the discussion     and i am pleased to report that they reversed the position taken by our representatives during the last meeting with you .         that is good news  indeed     the alien replied .     the dome will remain open then  so we may use it as a communications and transportation base .         if that is what you wish .  what else is involved in this new proposal .         the avery robots   like wohler there   must be reprogrammed .  that is no small undertaking .  however  a task force i have summoned for that purpose will arrive late this afternoon .         i would like to meet with you and the leader of that task force tomorrow at this time     synapo said .      for what purpose .     the small alien asked .     i doubt that he will be able to contribute anything of significance to our negotiations .         for the purpose of planning our mutual interaction in implementing your proposal and establishing a timetable for its completion .  my cerebrons are a nomadic tribe  anxious to be on the wing again .  we have already stayed far longer at this myostrian compensator than we find comfortable .      if you can assure me that you are familiar with the details of reprogramming the avery robots  then of course  the presence of the other leader would not be required .  but you led me to believe otherwise .         very well     the small alien said .     we shall meet with you tomorrow morning .      good  synapo thought .  that meeting should show who is dominant   the he leader or the she leader   and should also resolve once and for all which species is superior  the ceremyons or the aliens .  he would like to think that it would make little difference in how the ceremyons treated the aliens  but he knew otherwise  he knew that it would make a big difference  even to him  a statesman .     chapter     reunion    wolruf brought her hyperspace jumper xerborodezees down a half kilometer from the forest and a full kilometer from the line of robots and their vehicles streaming across the plain toward oyster world s robot city .   they had hardly touched down before a lorry started from the city across the deep  golden grass  laying a trail on the prairie that pointed toward the xerborodezees like an elongating arrow .   wolruf traveled light .  she had stowed everything she needed in one small bag slung around silverside s neck .  the two of them were sitting at the top of the access ramp  from which they could look out over the tall  waving grass and watch the approaching lorry .   stepping carefully between them  mandelbrot had unloaded derec s gear from the ship by the time the lorry arrived .  but silverside could clearly see and distinguish the two occupants of the open lorry long before it reached the ship  since both occupants were standing up .      the one derec calls ariel  which is she .     silverside asked .      the small one on  urn left     wolruf replied .      then the tall one must be the robot jacob winterson .         i ve neverrr met  im  but i pressume so     wolruf said .     jacob iss ariel s personal robot  and that body in the lorry certainly matches derec s description .   e looks  uman  but derec said ariel wass the only  uman on the planet  so that s got to be jacob .         are the females always smaller and more delicate .         generally .  and that s true of most animal species in the galaxy .  i m certainly smallerrr than my consort .         yes  your library file told of you as a female     silverside said .     and i ve considered you so without fully understanding the deeper significance  which seems to exist beyond the functional reproductive purpose .  derec seems driven by many other emotions when he talks of ariel .         just as beores wass driven by otherrr emotions when  e talked of latiel .          i don t understand .  who were they .         the first beingss that werrr created  according to ancient myths .         not the first humans .  that would be adam and eve  according to the library history files .         okay  put it in  uman terms .  the first man and the first woman .         and do all males have this strong affinity for females .         mostly .  some don t  but they rn a small minority .         i can understand that such a feeling is necessary to promote the reproduction of the species .  but derec s emotions seem involved with feelings far beyond simple procreation .  and that is confusing beyond even the confusion   my lack of understanding   of the nature of biological emotions in general .         emotions can be just as confusing to those experiencing them     wolruf said     so  urn confusion iss understandable and nothing to worry about .         worry .     silverside said as though she were considering the idea for the first time .     is that an emotion .          es .  all this concern  u seem to  ave over the sexes doess seem to amount to worry  wouldn t  u say .         a perturbation of some sort from a mean of some sort is the only way i can express it   something which i would rather didn t continue  but which i don t seem able to prevent .         a good description of worry     wolruf said .      then i shall so tabulate it in a catalog of emotions which i shall now begin to prepare  hoping that by defining them i can come to know and recognize them as the first step in learning to control them .          a worthy project which could quite likely drive  u nuts     wolruf said .      nuts .         forget it .  it iss not an emotion .  but i ll tell  u an emotion i am feeling  joy .  it s been a year or more since i ve seen ariel and felt the simple joy of being with  errr .      with that wolruf dashed down the ramp  for the lorry had pulled up beside the pile of derec s luggage and equipment .   ariel stepped down from the near side of the lorry as wolruf extended herself to her full height and wrapped her arms around ariel .   neither said anything  but both had tears in their eyes as they separated and stood looking at one another .   silverside put tears down as a possible external sign of emotion  unintentionally beginning a catalog of associated symptoms that later   as her knowledge increased   she would identify by the term body language .       u re a blessed experience after a dreary period     wolruf said .      and you re a sight for sore eyes     said ariel .     where s derec .         we had to leave  im behind on the wolf planet     wolruf said .   the look of consternation that immediately came to ariel s face also went into silverside s catalog  but she could only tag it with the word lie that she knew to be not an emotion  but rather a lack of truth telling by wolruf .  still  she had nothing else to tag it with for the time being .   and then ariel s look changed to joy as derec appeared on the ramp beside silverside .      you scamp     ariel said  grinning at wolruf .   wolruf gargled phlegm  a sound symptom silverside had long since associated with wolruf and her strange affinity for what derec called humor .   ariel and derec met in the middle of the ramp and hugged one another and pressed lips .   the look of joy had to be catalogued adjacent to the emotion of joy  for wolruf had already defined what it was they were feeling when they met once again after so long a time .  the same must be true of ariel .  but joy still had no personal connection with silverside  and so was only a word and a symptom in a file  and incomplete without silverside s own positronic potential pattern .   worry she now understood .  joy she did not .   and yet   it suddenly came to her   she  too  had met beings she was very close to after a period of separation  as she had when derec  wolruf  mandelbrot  and she had gone on the outing in the forest  and she had gone looking for lifecrier and the rest of the pack and had brought them back to meet wolruf .   seeing lifecrier after all that time had disturbed her  and it was a disturbance that she welcomed and would seek to experience again .  her memory brought forth that old positronic potential pattern  and she knew then that she could put it in her catalog alongside the word and the body language for the emotion joy .   but those were minor things in the confusion of her thinking .  it was the inexplicable nature of the biological sexes   and not in their function of reproduction   that was disturbing her most acutely that afternoon .  and to a lesser extent  she was still disturbed by a lingering doubt as to who was the more intelligent  and so  the more human   derec or wolruf .   small though it was  doubt still remained  but only because of the importance of the judgment that could affect the life and death of the two if she were required to choose between them in a life threatening situation .   did she consider herself to be more male than female because derec had proved more intelligent in that first basic contest  the one that pitted the female keeneye against the male derec .  did she lean toward the male gender for that reason .  after that contest she had certainly been more comfortable under the derec imprint .  he had opened a whole other world to her  he and his library files .   so that confusion with the nature of the biological sexes  and with her discomfort under a female imprint  disturbed her   and yes  that disturbance was the emotion wolruf had called worry .  she was worrying about her imprint on wolruf because she was disturbed by a desire to return to the derec imprint  the male form   uncomfortable wolruf would have described it   so she put that emotion down in her catalog  together with its positronic potential pattern .   she was becoming more and more convinced that she should go back to the derec imprint strictly from the standpoint of comfort .  that was a notion she catalogued as a strong future possibility  but for now she would retain the wolruf imprint for whatever help that femininity would provide in her analysis of ariel and the strange effect she had on derec .   silverside rose and walked through the hatch  following ariel and derec who had just walked up the ramp and into the ship .     chapter     the agaobiologist       so what s the crisis here .     derec asked .     and that screwy message of yours  that bit about my internal engineering  .  what s that all about .      they were standing in the control room of the xerborodezees  where they had gone to get away from the others .   silverside walked in  sat down in one of the deep cushioned passenger seats behind the pilot s upholstered bucket  and listened to ariel and derec .      some engineering i figured out  quite without your help     ariel said .     in fact i ve brought this planet pretty much under control without your wisdom and guidance .  all i need from you now is your muscle  that part between your ears .         you didn t answer my question .         your internal monitor link with the robot cities  i ll bet you didn t know that that modulates hyperwave .         au contraire  my dear     derec said .     that is a form of communication that depends on a special understanding of spacetime physics developed by my ever so eccentric father  the good dr .  avery .         and au contraire right back at you  smarty .  that is what the aliens on this planet  the ceremyons  refer to as continuous modulation of hyperwave .  ask avernus and keymo  and jacob  too .  he even understands it .  it s the communication version of key teleportation  just like conventional discrete modulation of hyperwave is the communication version of hyperjump technology .  i ll bet you didn t even recognize that .      they had been together again for all of ten minutes  and already they were going at it hammer and tongs .  is this what love is all about .  derec asked himself .      i ll have to think about that     he said .  was it possible she was right .  he changed the subject .      now what about the crisis .  the reason for me being here .         there is no crisis .  except i had to get you here promptly to avoid one .      she told him then how the robot city had disturbed the weather  how the myostrians had capped and controlled the disturbance with the dome  how they were ready to close it completely until she came up with her plan of a planetwide farm  abandoning the idea of a planetwide city .      so you see     she concluded     your task is straightforward and reasonably simple  just reprogram the averies into farmers .         i presume that this is another example of your style of engineering .     derec said .      not bad  huh .  social engineering  derec .  something you wouldn t understand .         there is just one minor problem .      he paused .  ariel said     and that is .         in order to program the averies to pursue a particular technology  one must know something about that technology .  i know all about cities .  i don t know the first thing about farms  and i suspect you don t either .      wolruf came into the compartment in time to hear derec s last sentence .  she took the passenger seat next to silverside .   ariel looked stunned .  that seems to be a piece of engineering she doesn t have covered  derec thought .  perhaps there s more to engineering than meets her eye .   he was feeling smug and complacent .  the bit about continuous modulation of hyperwave had thrown him for a moment .  but now he felt that he was back in control of the expedition .      so  u don t know the first thing about farms  derec .  so what .     wolruf said .     i seem to  ave come in on the middle of the show .         so you can t reprogram avery robots to be farmers     derec said     if you don t know anything about farming and farm technology .          ave no fear  wolruf iss  ere     the small  furry alien said .     i wass raissed on a farm and educated at agripolytech .  i m  urn original  ayseed engineerrr .         okay  derec .  what do you say now .     ariel said .     you think i didn t know that .  where have you been all this time .      derec ignored ariel .      you  a farmer .     he was looking at wolruf .      what products do  u think the erani bought from my family .     wolruf asked .     the erani am not all pirates like aranimas .  they rrr mostly traders  and they live on an impoverished ball of rock that growss lichens betterrr than it doess tomatoess .  in theess days of overpopulation  the erani survive on the grain and farm products they buy from us .      and there was ariel  glowing now  when she had been shocked half out of her drawers before wolruf put in her two cents .  she had had no more idea than he that wolruf was a farmer .   but derec was quick to regroup  and he was now admitting to himself that wolruf s contribution might well amount to more than two cents  galactic monetary standard .      okay .  i submit .  i ll handle the computer technology  wolruf will handle the farm technology  and you can continue to handle the social technology .         not entirely     ariel said .  you could tell she was about to reveal something that was not entirely easy to divulge .     you must meet with me and the aliens tomorrow morning .  and it looks now as though wolruf will also need to attend that meeting  as our farm specialist .         for what purpose .     derec asked .      they want to develop a schedule .  the cerebrons are anxious to return to their nomadic life  from which they ve been diverted by the problem with our city .  they ve been camping out in the forest of repose  as they call it  the woods next to the city .      ariel looked at her watch .      you may want to watch this     she said .     it s sort of spectacular . we can watch the show from the lorry as we drive in to the city .  we need to be getting back anyway .  it s almost time for dinner .      jacob and mandelbrot were standing near the lorry as derec and ariel started down the ramp .  the robots had already loaded derec s gear into the lorry .   derec called     i ll want you to drive  mandelbrot .      he wanted to stand by the driver  so as to watch better whatever show it was ariel had scheduled for them  and he dam well didn t want that musclebot jacob standing beside him  upstaging him  so to speak  in front of the audience sitting behind .   he glanced at ariel  daring her to challenge his decision .   she looked at him quizzically  but then gave him a quirky little smile and didn t say anything .  and that was as infuriating as if she had questioned his order .  she knew exactly why he wanted mandelbrot to drive .  somehow he always displayed his buttons  and ariel knew exactly which ones to push .   but the show was every bit as spectacular as she had intimated .  she stood up to point out the one she thought was the cerebron leader  synapo  circling high over the dome .  and it was he who dropped first  a tiny black ball plummeting toward the forest like a lead shot  becoming a small bomb  trailing a shiny smoke that slowly expanded into a silver ball that drifted gently down into the tree tops and then bobbed up to rest on the top of the forest like a ball of mercury on a countertop .   that was a solo performance  and then from near synapo s flight circle  another followed   sarco  the leader of the myostria  ariel guessed   and after a time  over the space of a quarter hour  they all dropped until they were dispersed like myriad beads of silvery moisture over the surface of the green foliage .     chapter     the cerebot    the provisional laws of humanics      .  a human being may not injure another human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     .  a human being must give only reasonable orders to a robot and require nothing of it that would needlessly put it into the kind of dilemma that might cause it harm or discomfort .     .  a human being must not harm a robot  or  through inaction  allow a robot to come to harm  unless such harm is needed to keep a human being from harm or to allow a vital order to be carried out .     from central computer file  humanics .   mechanical access  drawer      bin    .   keyword access  humans .  sub key  laws .   file creator  rydberg      the next morning  well before ten o clock  mandelbrot parked the lorry near the west edge of the dome opening  and the three mammals got out  instructing the three robots to stay behind in the lorry but to record everything that transpired once the aliens arrived .      well  friend mandelbrot  it is some time since we ve been able to talk privately     jacob winterson said .      that will hardly be the case with the wild one present     mandelbrot said .     watch what you say and what you do .  it is completely unpredictable .  it deactivated me on the wolf planet .      jacob and mandelbrot were still standing behind the control panel of the lorry .  silverside was sitting on the back seat that she had occupied with wolruf on the way to the meeting site .      for your information     silverside said     i am not an  it .   i am currently of the female persuasion  having imprinted on wolruf .  you may refer to me with the pronouns  she  and  her   jacob .  and you need not think that i will deactivate either of you now that i know that mistress wolruf would not react kindly to that action .  further  i am completely unaffected by what you may say or do  now that i understand that miss wolruf wants me to modulate the third law slightly to accord you some modest protection .         so  friend jacob     mandelbrot said     have you pondered further upon that imponderable  the laws of humanics .         yes  i have     jacob replied     and i find them woefully inadequate in describing human behavior .  rydberg and his companions are inexperienced in dealing with humans who are an unfathomable lot .  emotions  not laws  govern their behavior .  and i think perhaps the female of the species is the most mysterious of all .  i have been researching the emotion of jealousy since i seem to have been acquired essentially to create that emotion in the breast of master derec .         i hardly think jealousy can reside in the breast of a human  friend jacob     mandelbrot suggested .      merely a figure of speech used in the literature of the subject     jacob replied .     the key point of interest here  however  is the multiplicity of shades and overtones that exist in the minds of humans in their consideration of the opposite sex  shades and overtones of emotion that apparently have nothing to do with reproduction of the species  the ostensible reason for there being the two sexes in the first place .      surprisingly  silverside was becoming interested in the conversation after all .  she agreed with jacob s assessment of any laws of humanics that would guide human behavior and supposedly parallel the laws of robotics that guided her behavior .  and now the subject of their conversation seemed to bear directly on her discomfort with the femininity of the wolruf imprint that seemed  paradoxically  to be aggravated by the keen interest in everything feminine she had felt earlier in the masculine mode  while imprinted on derec .   it was a discomfort that came from an awareness of her own narcissism  something she had never experienced before  that was at once both fascinating and repulsive .  she concluded she was attracted to feminine beings  but would rather it were not her own being .  but what was the cause for the attraction .  she concluded it must stem from that first powerful imprint on keeneye that had not been altogether dispelled by her preference for the derec imprint   the male imprint .  that comfort with a masculine imprint was only a little less powerful than the laws that were intended to govern her behavior  but which she found so difficult to interpret for want of knowing what a human was .  she could deprogram neither those laws nor her feeling of masculinity nor that insidious attraction for all that was feminine .   she found that she was experiencing another form of discomfort that came from listening to jacob and mandelbrot .  she had never before heard two robots conversing with one another .  the discomfort came not from that process but  again  from their words  what she deduced from their words .  they were talking as though they knew what a human was  and she  silverside  was still exploring that subject by the process of multiple imprints  trying to progress to ever higher levels of intelligence  for surely only the most intelligent species in the galaxy could be the humans she was seeking .      jacob  you talk of the laws of humanics as though you know what a human is     she said .      certainly     jacob said .     i am so programmed .  how else could i implement the laws of robotics .         am i human .     she asked .      no .  you are a robot     jacob replied .      how do you know .         master derec says so .  further  my own senses tend to support his contention .  you are not a mammal .         what about mistress wolruf .  is she human .         no .         but she is a mammal .         true .  but not all mammals are human .         what is a human  jacob .     silverside asked .      there are many definitions  some very complicated  some very simple .  we are generally programmed with only one .         what is an example of a simple definition .         accent in speaking standard .  most humans speak standard  so a simple definition for a special set of robots on a planet called solaria once used the solarian accent to define humans   a very simple test  not requiring any unusual instrumentation .         and how do you define a human  jacob .         by the number of their chromosomes and the configuration of their x and y chromosomes .         and how do you determine that information .         with an instrument   a cellular nanomachine   built into my right index finger .         you don t make that determination each time you meet that same human  do you .         no .  once i determine that a being is human  i put its image into a pattern recognition table .  further  i am inclined to accept as human any being that approximates an average of those images   without the chromosome test .         mistress ariel and master derec are both humans  then .         yes .         and which do you feel more compelled to protect .         my immediate master  mistress ariel .         and you  mandelbrot  which would you favor .         master derec  although the choice would be difficult     mandelbrot said .      and what about wolruf .     silverside asked .     would you protect her  mandelbrot .         yes .  friend jacob and i are both programmed to treat her as human .         don t you find that strange .  a being that is .  .  .      thoughts of wolruf as a human were shunted aside by the landing at the meeting site of black demonic beings   two of them   who simultaneously stalled out with perfect choreography  braking with their wings widespread  seeming to shut off the sun in the enveloping blackness of their presence .  then they touched down lightly  folded rustling wings close in to their bodies   shrinking to the size of the mammals they faced   and became black silhouettes surmounted by wicked looking  snow white hooks above burning red eyes .   the impenetrable soft blackness that shrouded their physical essence in mystery projected a disquieting impression of latent power .   silverside concentrated on recording everything that transpired .  she thought that she was possibly observing the ultimate form of humanity  the final objective in a frustrating quest .      good morning  leaders of the ceremyons     ariel said .     this is wolruf and this is derec  both members of our reprogramming task force .  wolruf  derec  i would like you to meet synapo  leader of the cerebrons .  .  .      the alien on the right expanded slightly with the rustling sound of a bat s wings amplified by an order of magnitude      .  .  . and sarco  leader of the myostria .     the alien on the left expanded  rustling .  derec spoke next .      my colleague wolruf and i are honored that you will be working with us to produce an environment on your planet of benefit to both of our peoples .         that is to be desired     the alien synapo said with a strange accent  more pronounced than wolruf s  which made understanding the alien even more difficult .      but first     derec continued     would you explain the nature of the dome and the method of its construction so that we may determine how best to modify the city within to be as innocuous as possible .         the node compensator is a localized separation of space and time     sarco said .   he said nothing further  as though that fully explained it .     yes .  go on     derec said .      that s it .  a localized rift in spacetime     sarco said with mild disdain as though he were lecturing a backward student     a locus of points in the cosmos where our universe no longer exists .          and how do you create such a rift .         do you understand what i mean by a rift in the cosmos .     derec hesitated .      not entirely     he said .      then you  re not likely to understand how such a rift is created  and we should move on to more profitable subjects for discussion .      synapo entered the discussion at that point .      the rift is created and enlarged by the intense application of electrons  which themselves are convolutions in spacetime .  the stream of electrons   highly focused on a microscopic volume at the initial point of separation   enlarges the void progressively around the extent of the rift  much as i separate the gores of my reflector when i untether each morning .      but as my colleague  sarco  suggests  perhaps we should move directly to a discussion of your schedule for implementing harmonious cohabitation .          strictly from visual observations  the dome seems to partake of the nature of a black hole     derec persisted .     is that what you re saying .         black hole .     synapo said  as though now having difficulty himself with the trend of the conversation .     black hole .  yes  that is a good analogy .  the derivation of the word was not self evident .      yes  the compensator is a black hole  but an unnatural one internal to the universe  not on the edge  a black hole as a concavity  not as a convexity at the edge where space and time separate in the course of the natural decay of the universe .      now may we move on .         just two more questions     derec said .     when we look at the dome from the outside  we can t see the city .  we see objects on the other side as though the dome and the city weren t there .  why can t we see the city inside .         the compensator s intense curvature of spacetime bends the light around the dome much as light from a distant star is bent slightly as it goes around our sun .  in the case of the compensator  the bending is not slight .  it is calculated to produce the effect of invisibility and nonexistence  one of its attributes as a compensator .      you had one more question .         yes .  why should a hyperspace flier fall toward the surface of the black concavity and escape only by the full thrust of its impulse engines  as ariel described to me last night   an effect of the curvature of spacetime   when the atmosphere  the air inside the dome  does not fall toward the blackness likewise .         you answered your own question     synapo said .   a small green flame hissed from the blackness a decimeter below his eyes  and his voice took on a note of irritation  as though his patience were about to be exhausted .      the curvature of spacetime  as you suggested .  the flier was beyond the neutral shell  in the gravitational field of the black concavity .  the planet s atmosphere is within the neutral shell  in the gravitational field of the planet .      with a note of finality  synapo concluded with a question .      did not your jumper have to achieve normal escape velocity to drive into the blackness before it could reverse and try to escape back to the planet .      quickly  before derec had time to fully digest those last remarks  ariel regained control of the meeting .  with firmness  she said     now  honorable ceremyons  our schedule calls for the first phase of our effort to be completed in two months .  that effort will provide sufficient farm area and production        square kilometers   for proof of environmental passivity .      concurrently  we will modify the city to provide terminal facilities for local and interstellar transport vehicles .  those facilities will project through the opening in the dome  but will be insulated and force ventilated to ensure that all harmful radiation and emissions will be retained within the dome .      wolruf  our farm engineering specialist  and derec  our city engineering specialist  will now describe the detailed schedules for those two activities .      silverside recorded all that  but her attention  her whole being  was concentrated on the alien  synapo .  his domination of the dialogue told her that he was the superior of the two aliens and potentially more powerful  more intelligent  than any of the mammals she had become familiar with .  in short  she had found the ultimate target for her final imprint  or so she believed .   she left off recording the meeting with the aliens .  she had found a new role model to fit the beings the laws of robotics compelled her to serve .  she was no longer obligated to observe the orders of lesser beings .  still  she gave wolruf a last thought filled with fondness  that new emotion she had found in her consideration of lifecrier  now far  far away .  she would continue to protect wolruf with just a little less weight than she gave herself under the third law  the law of self preservation .   she turned her attention back to the alien on the right  synapo  and concentrated now on the technical details of the imprint  particularly the aerodynamic characteristics that would be the hardest to duplicate .  the calculations quickly showed that her wingspread and airfoil area would have to be several fold greater than that of the aliens in order to support her body weight .  their body mass must be light indeed  with mostly hollow structural reinforcements .   and she would have to increase the dimensions of her body to provide the geometry needed for the wing connections and the leverage required for the wing manipulators .  not surprisingly  that was going to decrease her body density to match that of the aliens .   she worked on the eyes next .  they were compound  radiating red and infrared .  the radiation came from a ring that surrounded the conventional animal optic in the center and provided controlled illumination for viewing objects when the sun s radiation was blocked by the planet .   then she turned her attention to the blackbody surface and found that to be more of a problem than the aerodynamics and the optics .  she experimented on her arm as she sat in the back seat of the lorry but finally had to give up and settle for a blackish gray with a soft  silvery lustre  just as she had finally given up matching the details of hair and skin coloring of the mammals .   next  she attacked the source and nature of the green flame that had burst from the alien  synapo .  she had the feeling that it was a tool  if not a weapon  that was required to provide a satisfactory imprint .  she designed a small electrolytic cell  compressor  and high pressure storage containers for hydrogen and oxygen and a release orifice at the rear of her oral cavity  but she kept her conventional speakers for communication .  and she added a small factory to fix nitrogen in the form of ammonia to provide the trace of that compound that gave the flame its green color .   all during that period of analyzing the alien  synapo  she was absorbing the powerful masculinity he radiated  intercepting and recording the red glare of his eyes  sopping up his physical essence  the body language  the subtle mannerisms that escaped that otherwise all absorbing black silhouette .   finally she was ready  and she set the organometallic cells of her body and their pseudoribosomes to the task of altering her genetic tapes   her robotic dna  her equivalents of messenger and transfer and ribosomal rna   and the myriad other factors contained in her multibillion microbotic cells that would finally effect the alien imprint .   as her form changed  she stepped up to stand on the back seat of the open lorry to give her forelegs room to develop into wings  and then as her long hind legs shortened and thickened  she braced them against the back of the seat to steady herself .   with their attention on the meeting  the two robots in the front of the lorry did not observe the transformation  nor did the mammals in the meeting who faced away from her .  she was under observation only by the aliens  and they seemed not to notice or to care .   finally  the transformation was complete  save for the hook and its tether  that she had programmed last because of its different matrix  a stainless form of shining steel configured in a hollow curved horn and a fine stranded but sturdy flexible cable .  she hoped to fly  but she had abandoned the balloon and the act of ballooning she had witnessed the evening before .  the hook  then  was purely for effect .   comfortably masculine now  silverside was standing on the back seat of the lorry  fully erect   three meters high   with his wings folded tightly against his body as though he had just emerged from a cocoon like a newly metamorphosed butterfly .  he felt the need to open and exercise them  to get the feel of them  and with that he recalled flying in bird form on the wolf planet .   the mammals and the aliens were still absorbed in their meeting .  the aliens apparently thought the growing silverside was a natural phenomenon associated with the lorry  for they gave no sign of looking directly in silverside s direction .   slowly he opened his wings .  the thin  tough  organometallic membrane rustled faintly as he unfolded the airfoil to its full twenty five meters .  he found then that he could not avoid measuring air currents .   he had not been aware of even a faint breeze as he had stood there on the back seat with his wings folded  but now he felt the gentle pressure acting on his wings  pressing his simulated  feathery cold junction against the back o the seat .  he resisted the torque that was endeavoring to tumble him out of the back of the lorry only with a distinct effort by digging his toes into the seat cushion .   the effort was more than he cared to maintain  so he folded his wings back against his body  reducing the wind area .   then he turned  walked across the seat to the side of the lorry  hesitated   looking at wolruf who was running toward him and shouting his name   and then spread his wings again and hopped over the side .  he felt again the glorious sensation of flight  of being airborne  as he gently glided to the ground .  when his feet touched  he fell flat on his face  his wings outspread  with a feeling of slow motion that began with his dragging toes digging shallow furrows in the dust next to the roadway .   with difficulty  he got up  using his wings to lever himself erect before folding them into his body  and then wolruf was on him  hindlegs straddling his back and pinning his wings to his sides  hands grasping his hook to keep her purchase .  and derec was winding a rope around both him and wolruf  binding them together .     chapter     the black visitation    ariel was about to wrap up the meeting .  wolruf had hit the high spots of the technical effort involved in establishing the robot farms and had given her detailed schedule  and derec had described the external modifications of the city to provide local and interstellar terminal facilities  the minimal effect those changes would have on the meteorology  and the detailed schedule to effect those changes .   ariel began her recap .      i would like to briefly review the farm program again and summarize the schedule  but before i do  are there any other questions on the work that wolruf and derec described .         no     synapo said .     it was all quite clear .         was it acceptable .     she asked .      yes .      synapo turned to look at his companion .      sarco .     he queried     any objections .         not for the moment     sarco replied .     the farm machinery is highly suspect  but we must take you at your word  at least for now .  time may tell us otherwise .  and  too  i am concerned .  .  .      he stopped talking briefly  then      by the great petero .     he exclaimed .     what is that  synapo .      both aliens had turned slightly to the left to focus those red eyes on something behind her .  ariel turned to look herself and saw a dark gray monstrosity on the back seat of the lorry with gigantic wings hovering over the vehicle like some kind of avenging angel .   then it slowly folded its wings and started walking across the seat to the side of the lorry  where it spread them once again  and ariel knew instantly what was going on .   but wolruf had anticipated her by significant seconds and was already running toward the lorry  shouting     silverside  silverside     over and over again  as though shrill decibels would anchor him to the ground .   as it turned out  wolruf had nothing to worry about .  silverside came to rest flat on the ground  spread eagled .  and by the time he picked himself up and retracted his wings  wolruf was clinging to his back  and then derec was trussing them both up with a rope he had hastily dug out of a locker on the side of the lorry .   ariel was torn between getting involved in the fracas herself and preserving some kind of composed demeanor for the benefit of the aliens .  she felt her position as official negotiator and ostensible leader of the robot city task force with special keenness ever since she had been able to parlay her visit into that position  leader without portfolio .   as derec was wrapping silverside and wolruf round and round with rope  ariel turned back to the aliens in time to hear sarco say     perhaps this gives us a better idea what further menace lies off world  miss ariel welsh .  we resume construction of the node compensator tomorrow morning .      he had rotated his hook forward as he spoke .  then  as he turned away  a broad green flame a meter long blazed from below his eyes  and he flapped into the air .   the heat from the flame hit her like the breath of a blast furnace .   the alien synapo stood facing her as his colleague flew off .   when he spoke it was in a fashion that left no doubt as to the temper of his thoughts .  the words seemed to modulate the small green flame that flickered below his glaring red eyes  a waxing and waning fluorescence that resonated with the strange buzzing sound it imparted to his words .      you have violated a trust and humiliated me before the elite  miss ariel welsh .      and he  too  turned and flapped into the air .   she stood there a long time watching them as they slowly and gracefully circled higher and higher above the dome .  the first leveled off and took up a flight pattern around the exact center of the dome .  the second  however  continued upward  circling and circling until she lost it in the shimmer of the atmosphere .   derec had come back to stand beside her  but she had not heard him .      a setback  surely  but perhaps not a large one     he said .   startled  she turned to look at him coldly but said nothing before walking back to the lorry .  jacob was standing at the controls .  mandelbrot  standing between him and silverside  had hold of the end of a rope where it trailed away from the coils that encircled silverside and pinned his wings to his sides .  wolruf was sitting on the front seat directly behind silverside .  derec had unwound her from silverside once they thought he was under control .   ariel climbed slowly in and sat down on the back seat .   derec climbed in and came back to sit beside her .  jacob drove the lorry onto the road and then headed rapidly down main street toward the apartment .      i warned you about silverside     derec said .     you knew he could change form .  i admit i didn t expect a change at so inauspicious a time .  what did the aliens say before they flew off .         they were frightened  naturally  and angry .  they had no reason to suspect we were going to produce a being in their own image  and twice as big .  in their minds  i have betrayed their trust .  they said as much .  and they will close the dome tomorrow morning     ariel said .     your new prot  g   has just closed this planet to further development .  unless your genius and his remarkable abilities can somehow miraculously arrest the inevitable .         you re being sarcastic  my dear     derec confirmed .   a couple of intersections passed swiftly behind  and then he said     but you know we might just pull off that miracle .         fat chance     she said .      no .  a slim chance  but a chance nonetheless .      she didn t answer  but got up and went to the front of the lorry to sit on the front seat directly behind jacob winterson .  right then  jacob seemed like the only friend she had .  she looked right through him  though  staring into a grim tomorrow and not seeing at all his remarkable musculature .   wolruf reached over and laid a fat fingered hand atop ariel s small hand .  ariel didn t move and hardly noticed .  after a moment the hand was withdrawn .   when they got to the apartment  she jumped out before the others and strode off .  it was a walking pout  a demonstration for derec s benefit  and she admitted that with one part of her mind .  with the other part  she half expected him to come after her and was disappointed when he didn t .  she could now think of several things she wanted to say to him .  she returned as jacob was putting lunch on the table .   after a lunch that tasted like sawdust  she went out on the balcony to get away from the others but took jacob with her .  they sat down on the bench that lined the streetside rail .      jacob  did silverside give any indication he was going to pull a stunt like that .  where is he  anyway .      she hadn t thought to ask until that moment .  she had wanted to forget about silverside  and she had succeeded better than she expected .  her thoughts had been on aurora .  she had felt quite homesick all through lunch  and derec hadn t helped .  he had been just as silent as she .  her walk had cooled her irate thoughts .  she didn t feel up to an argument so she kept quiet and ate .  immediately after lunch derec had jumped up and gone into the small bedroom .   her feeling of isolation had been intensified not only by derec s silence  but by wolruf s silence as well .  that  too  had persisted all through lunch .  she felt again the soft touch of wolruf s hand as it came to rest on her hand when they were riding back in the lorry .      to answer your most immediate question first  master derec forced silverside to lay on the floor of the small bedroom when we first came in     jacob said .     silverside had trouble getting through the doorways .  he was both taller and wider than the openings .  it was difficult for him to bend over and at the same time go through the doorway sideways while wrapped with rope .      to answer your first question  the wild one  as mandelbrot calls him   it seems particularly apt   the wild one talked to us briefly  but he gave no indication that a change was imminent .         he said nothing unusual  then .     ariel asked .      he seems not to know what humans are .  this matter of imprinting and changing from one form to another  were you aware that he goes through these changes seeking to find the species he can finally call human .         derec suggested that might be the case .         will he then cease to protect what he considers the lesser species .         i presume so .  derec seems to think so .         does that not make him an entity of some danger to humans .         it would seem so .         then should he not be deactivated .         i hadn t thought so before today .  derec seems to regard him as a valuable experiment that must be protected .  and from the brief conversation we had  i suspect he still feels that way .         perhaps you should talk to him again  miss ariel .  both mandelbrot and i are concerned that the wild one may get out of control .  we are both perturbed by the first law  and find it even more difficult to be around the wild one now that he has taken on this new alien form .         you re right  jacob .  i should talk to derec .      she placed her hand on jacob s neck and softly traced the muscles as though she were stroking a pet .  his concern touched her .  it was she he was concerned about .  it is difficult for a young woman to ignore such concern when it comes from a warm skinned being as handsome as jacob .  he was a dear  like a big brother .   that thought confused her .  when had she stopped thinking of jacob as a robot .  her regard for him was sisterly  was it not .  it couldn t be anything more than that  surely .  in spite of the way derec ignored her in his interest with the wild one  silverside .   perhaps her own impetuous experiment was getting out of hand .  since derec had arrived on oyster world  he had not seemed the dear thing she had dreamed about so intensely .   and jacob s concern was pleasing  and the feel of his muscular neck was certainly stimulating .   with that wild thought she jerked her hand away  jumped up  walked into the apartment  and threw open the door to the bedroom where derec had gone immediately after lunch and where jacob said they were keeping silverside .   derec had removed the rope  and silverside was sitting on the floor between twin beds .  he was leaning back against the wall and had balled in that curious way the aliens had of reducing their surface area .  that decreased his height by half .   derec was sitting on the far bed and had to look up to peer into the robot s red rimmed eyes .   ariel sat down on the other bed .  jacob had followed her .  he stayed near the door  standing with his back against the wall .      i have explained the crisis he has caused in our relations with the ceremyons     derec said     and silverside is willing to try to straighten things out .  he does not wish to offend the beings he is trying to emulate and serve .         they might likely destroy him before he gets the chance to do any serving     ariel said .     they were quite disturbed .         that is the chance i must take  ariel     silverside said     but i do not think that is likely .      the title miss was stressed by its absence in silverside s remark .  he had clearly imprinted on the aliens in thought as well as in form .      still  you had best shout at them from a distance     ariel said .     out of flamethrowing range .         communication by radio accomplishes the same thing     silverside said     without the danger you suggest .         one must first understand their radiospeech     ariel said .     the modulation is pure ultrasonic gibberish .          i have been working on that ever since we arrived .  it is not different from the ultrasound they used to converse privately during your meeting with them .  that meeting provided the clues i needed to understand the radio transmissions i had picked up the evening of our arrival .  i am now modestly fluent in the language .      so fluent that i suspect you will find several representatives of their species awaiting us outside and probably well within flamethrowing range .      derec jumped up from the bed and ran from the bedroom to the french window that opened onto the balcony .  ariel followed him .  he started to go out but stopped .  there were two aliens perched on the balcony rail  clearly visible through the sheer curtains in spite of the permanent dusk created by the dome .  they were silhouetted against the white building across the street like two huge black crows .  there were probably more at street level .   derec and ariel went back to the bedroom .      you have been talking to them .     derec said quietly but with emphasis .      yes     silverside said .     i have already opened my own negotiations .         and who have you been talking to .     derec asked .      the leader called sarco .         and what do they want .         my release .  i told them i was being held prisoner .         hardly .  you could have broken the ropes any time you wanted to  either before or after we got here .         perhaps  but i didn t want to risk damaging my wings .  to make myself aerodynamic i ve had to sacrifice my original strength and ruggedness to the stamina and lightness needed for extended flight  which unavoidably entails a certain fragility .      but now i must go talk to master sarco .         tell them the truth     ariel said .     explain our sincerity and our lack of knowledge of this last transformation of yours .         i must always tell the truth .  i cannot do otherwise     silverside said .      but you do sometimes omit things     derec said .     try to tell everything that is relevant to our situation .         my first concern must be for my new masters  but i do not easily forget those like lifecrier and wolruf who have been kind to me .  roping and binding  however  can hardly be described as kind .         think of wolruf  then     derec said .     and the many kindnesses i have shown you before this last incident .         i must go and confer with sarco     silverside said as he rolled to his feet  still balled .  then he partially straightened  still bent sideways  and sidled through the bedroom door .     chapter     the law of humanics    circling far above normal charge altitude  synapo watched the silver alien and his escort of ceremyons   all less than half his size   as they headed toward the cliff of time  far below  toward the gathering sarco had called to hear the words of the alien .   sarco was already waiting on the pinnacle of the cliff of time .  synapo had seen him arrive a quarter hour before  not long after that final radio transmission that had set up the gathering .   synapo balled  and as he dropped  he feathered an exposed edge of a wing so that it set him in rotation and in motion toward the cliff of time as though he were rolling down a ramp .   his progress toward the cliff of time matched the progress of the small escort of ceremyons who had the silver alien in their midst  so that synapo and they arrived at the gathering almost simultaneously .   synapo took up his perch on the adjacent lower crag  the position sarco had occupied during that earlier gathering .  his cerebron elite were already aligned on the table rock below .   the alien who called himself silverside stood in front of the center of the line of myostrians below sarco .  the myostrian leader wasted no time .  he began the interrogation of the alien as soon as synapo settled onto his perch .      who are you and what is your purpose in contacting us .     sarco asked .      i am a robot  and i am here to serve you     silverside replied .   in spite of himself  synapo was impressed .  the silver alien had mastered the ceremyon tongue and now mouthed it with only a slight accent .      you are a servant  like the servants who built the city we have nullified .     sarco said .      yes  only somewhat more versatile     the alien replied .      were you created this morning  at the time of our meeting with the aliens .         no .  i was created on another planet .  that was merely a transformation this morning .         to what end .         to follow as best i can the laws that i am governed by  the laws of the beings who created me .         and what is the nature of those laws .     sarco asked .      i may not injure a human being     silverside replied     or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .      i must obey the orders given me by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .      and i must protect my own existence  as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .         those are the same laws that govern the servants who built the city     sarco said .      yes     silverside said .     we are all robots  or so i am told .         and these human beings     sarco said     you consider them your creators and the ones you must serve .         yes .         then why do you seek to serve us .         the laws and my programming do not make clear what human beings are .  clearly  only beings more intelligent than i could have created me .  i seek to know and understand all such beings .  until i met your species  ariel and derec were the most intelligent beings i had found   with the possible exception of wolruf .         we are the most intelligent of the beings now on this planet     sarco said     but we did not create you .  we were told by miss ariel welsh that she and beings like her are human beings .  we have no reason to disbelieve her .  why do you .         neither ariel  derec  nor wolruf created me  or so they say .         you were not created this morning to intimidate us .     sarco asked again .   synapo agreed with sarco .  that was a most important point .     no .  i merely transformed from my imprint on wolruf .         then this morning when the meeting began you had the shape of the being called wolruf  one of the three we talked with this morning .         yes .         and you did not transform according to instructions by miss ariel welsh .         no .  i imprinted on a being like you called synapo who seemed to me the more intelligent of the two aliens at the meeting .          that is synapo standing over there .      sarco pointed with the middle appendage of his right wing toward his friend on the other crag .      i am sarco  the other one at the meeting  the one of lesser intelligence .      his sarcasm was not lost on synapo and the other members of the ceremyon elite  but it went completely by silverside .   he walked over to stand on the table rock below synapo .      you are clearly the most intelligent being on this planet     silverside said  addressing synapo .     you or someone very like you must have created me  and so you must be a human being .         no     synapo replied .     i am not a human being .         what is a human  master synapo .     the robot asked .   and then synapo understood the robot s dilemma .  it was  for the robot  a difficult problem in semantics that had become clear to synapo only at that moment when he replaced the words human being in the robot s governing laws with the word creator .  that was the way this particular robot  for some reason  actually thought about his laws .  creator  or human being  or whatever term occupied that position in the robot s laws  had not been defined .  that was now clear .   perhaps human beings had created the avery robots  but this robot was not at all sure that the same creatures had created him even though both he and the averies were governed by laws that were structurally similar .  but from all the data  it seemed quite clear to synapo that it was the human beings who had created the robot and that it was they his laws referred to .      miss ariel welsh and all those like her are human beings  and it was human beings that created you     synapo said .     it is they you must serve  and of all of them  i would suggest you give your most devoted service to miss ariel welsh .  we have gravely misjudged her and injured her now a second time .      and when you get back  pick a being for your model   for your imprint   that will serve her best .  you make a poor ceremyon .      there was a long pause .      a last question     silverside finally said .     you have heard me recite the laws of robotics which govern my behavior .  it would help me serve miss ariel if i knew what the laws of humanics were .  have you yet deduced those laws from your dealings with the humans  miss ariel and master derec .         there is only one law of humanics .  all others are corollary to il the law of humanics is the law of all natural beings  whether of low intellect or high  whether ceremyon  human  or lupine like your wolruf .      we all obey that one law without exception  even though at times   without thinking deeply   it may seem otherwise .  we all evolved from chaos  and chaos governs our lives  but a seeming purpose can arise paradoxically from chaos  and it is that chaotic purpose which compels us to follow that one law .      the law is quite simple  we each do always whatever pleases us most .  that is the only law of humanics .      go now and serve well your miss ariel welsh .      the wings of the robot silverside opened wide  stretched to their full extent  and as synapo and all the ceremyons watched  the wings seemed to slowly dissolve and contract into massive upper appendages as the torso shrunk to less than half its original height  as the legs swelled to produce heavy thighs and bulging calves .   when the transformation was complete  synapo realized he had seen only one other alien with a shape like that  the alien servant  jacob winterson .   if he had used a little forethought  the alien silverside would have had an easier time getting back   if he had not been so anxious to effect a transformation .  but synapo thought no more about it as he took to the air  headed for a charge station above the center of the node compensator to gamer what little was left of the sun s radiation that afternoon .     chapter     neuronius strikes back    the contradiction  the dilemma  tore at his mind  grabbing at his reason  his sanity  setting it adrift in small silent screams like flotsam flowing over the edge of the cliff of time .  silverside had found the superintelligence he was looking for  and that intelligence had declared itself not human .  ariel welsh was human  it said  and derec avery .  go serve miss ariel welsh  it said  and find the form that would do that best .   he had to yield to that higher intelligence   there was no escaping the logic   yet he had violated the laws  he had not served humans well  and that was a thought he could not bear to face .   he grabbed desperately at his reason  rolling it into a tight ball  and escaped into the all absorbing task of imprinting on the memories he had stored of jacob winterson .  he stood there on the table rock long after the ceremyons had left  throwing himself deeper and deeper into the imprint  delving and exploring and testing far beyond anything he had ever done before  changing his microbotic cells to create those of proper function and pigmentation with which to form this time the perfect image  the bronze skin  the brush cut blond hair with the same fine strands  the corded neck that kept the girth of the head itself all the way to the shoulders  the bulging biceps and chest muscles  the narrow waist  the powerful thighs  wrapped beneath the skin with heavy muscular ropes .   he created the same unlined high forehead  the fine nordic nose  the wide set  deep blue eyes  the high cheekbones  the generous mouth  the jutting  cleft chin .   when the imprint was finally finished  he walked to the edge of the table rock and stood there staring down from the escarpment at the sharp line that demarcated the forest from the plain .  that delineation led his eyes to the iridescent dome covering the robot city  shimmering in the sunlight  and seeming   rniragelike   to hang suspended above the horizon  transparent and seemingly void of any contents .   he had a sudden impulse to spread his wings and glide away from the escarpment toward that dome and miss ariel welsh .  that was the laws speaking to him  and for just a fleeting second  he felt a contrary and equally powerful impulse to escape in the other direction  and then the laws reasserted themselves  and wingless  he began making his way recklessly down the escarpment  using the superhuman strength in his fingers and toes to cling to the face of the rock and scurry down it like a chameleon .   as he passed down the jointed and folded stone strata exposed by the upheaval of the cliff of time  he crossed earlier and earlier geologic ages of oyster world  and seemed himself to be carried back through the short time he had existed to his origin on another world  as though he were descending through space and time to the forest of his birth .   he slid the last few meters down a steep talus of hard packed black gravel to a flat plate of rock that slanted into the ground where the grass of the plain began .  he got up and headed at a hard trot for the forest a half kilometer away  intending to immerse himself in the lush jungle  in a familiar habitat like that where he had first known being .  he felt a longing for it quite unlike anything he had ever felt before .   he was still ten meters from that cool solace when one of the black winged aliens stepped with a short wobble from the concealment provided by the dense shrubbery .      you are the one called silverside     the alien said .      true  i am silverside     the robot replied .   he continued toward the black alien but slowed as the alien wobbled backward  staying between him and the forest .      i am neuronius     the alien said .     i must talk with you  silverside .         i have already talked at length with your people  neuronius  and now i must proceed into the forest to reflect on all that i have learned .         there is much more that i can teach you  silverside  much that would benefit you and your kind in their dealings with the ceremyons .         i know too much now .  i cannot absorb all that i have heard already .  would you have me even more at odds with myself .         but there is much more about the ceremyons you need to know in order to properly serve miss ariel welsh .  would you throwaway such an opportunity .      the alien had wobbled back under the cover of the tall conifers as they talked  leading silverside along a path through the dense shrubbery .  now he stopped  still facing silverside  blocking his passage into the jungle .      let me pass     silverside said .     i do not wish to harm a being that so much resembles the mighty synapo .         synapo is nothing  silverside .  i can teach you the secret of the dome that separates space and time .  then when your miss ariel welsh must deal with him  she can deal on equal terms .  that secret can be a weapon as well as a tool .      confused as he was  with synapo ordering him to serve miss ariel  it was as though synapo himself were telling him to listen to neuronius .      i will listen a short while  then     silverside said     but then i must leave you .      so they proceeded a little way farther along the path to a small clearing alongside a brook .  neuronius opened his wings  fluttered them as though to shake out uncomfortable creases  and then folded them to his sides again .  he tottered over to the brook  sat down on a low flat rock lying half into the small stream  and dangled his feathery tail in the water .      the secret of the dome is merely a matter of understanding space and time and their relationship to black concavities     neuronius said .     that relationship is best described in the terms of tensor analysis .      silverside was already familiar with tensor mathematics  quantum mechanics  general relativity  and spacetime physics  which  although more sophisticated in their language and applications  were still the basic sciences developed by schroedinger and einstein .   hyperjump and hyperwave technology were little more than tools that man had discovered quite accidentally and still did not really understand  any more than he understood what an electron was .   so now neuronius led silverside along mathematical pathways dealing with space and time which  familiar at first  became rapidly unfamiliar and bizarre  and twisted his positronic thoughtways in patterns that became ever more uncomfortable .   with that discomfort he began to suspect that neuronius   if he could twist silverside s mind to such a degree   was perhaps superior to synapo .  certainly neuronius was different  and maybe it was the difference of a superior mind .  he continued to record what neuronius was saying but stopped generation of associative memory links   stopped listening   in order to pursue that intriguing comparison of the two aliens .  finally he interrupted neuronius in his lecture .      what is a human  neuronius .         what .         i have been searching for humans  the beings whose laws govern my behavior .  i had thought that humans must be the most intelligent species in the galaxy  but synapo says miss ariel is human  and that he is not  even though he is more intelligent than miss ariel .      neuronius hesitated .  in the silence  the twitter of the jungle birds came to silverside  registering with sharp clarity a serenity and tranquillity that was strikingly at odds with the turmoil in his mind .      i am human     neuronius said .     synapo is not .      was there no peace in this life .  unquestionably neuronius was more intelligent than miss ariel  and it seemed more and more apparent that neuronius was indeed more intelligent than synapo  yet synapo was the leader of the ceremyons .  the logical question came immediately to mind .      where do you fit into the society of the ceremyons .         i am not a ceremyon     neuronius replied .     i may appear to be so  but i am not .  i am far superior to any ceremyon .         are there others of your kind .         not on this planet .  this one is mine .  the others each dominate a planet of their own .      silverside was impressed .  yet there was something about neuronius that bothered him   his wordiness  perhaps  mandelbrot bothered him that way  but there it was a bother that need not concern him .  mandelbrot was merely a robot .  but neuronius was not a robot  and his words were exceedingly tantalizing  and yet disturbing  uneasily so .  mandelbrot had never made him feel uneasy .   if neuronius were the only one of his kind on this planet  he had to be the most intelligent being here   if he were indeed more intelligent than synapo .  so he was back to that simple comparison .  on balance  neuronius appeared to be the more intelligent .  he had delved far deeper into dome technology than synapo had during his meeting with the mammals .  synapo had seemed to be withholding information  as though he were not altogether sure of what he was saying .  neuronius certainly did not give that impression .  he seemed to be bursting with information .  so much so that silverside s positronic potentials on the subject of domes were now a complete jumble .   his indecision was excruciating .  he had to get the question resolved .  he had thought it was resolved  and arriving at that point once again  after having been through it so many times  had been an unsettling experience that he had accepted finally with his imprint on jacob winterson .  now all that ordeal seemed to have gone for naught .  but how was he to get it resolved .      i must know who is the more intelligent  you or synapo .  can you suggest how that can be determined .         i am not interested in your petty games  silverside .  i am offering you knowledge that will allow you to serve whomever you please with greater efficiency .  surely you can see that .         but whom i am to serve must clearly be resolved before the service itself can take place .  surely  with your intelligence you can see that .         one can train for service quite efficiently without knowing who will ultimately be served .         but how one trains   what type of service should be stressed    depends on who will be served .      that seemed clear to silverside  and if neuronius couldn t understand something as simple as that  he could not be as intelligent as he had at first appeared .      you are right  of course     neuronius said .     but i find it exceedingly distasteful and uncomfortable to promote myself at the expense of others .  it makes me appear slow  i suppose .  i have no desire to denigrate synapo .      you must have this question resolved  must you .     neuronius said as a small green jet flamed momentarily in the air below his red eyes .   that was one piece of alien body language silverside had learned to read .  it lent an air of great sincerity to the discomfort neuronius claimed to feel .      yes     silverside said .      then you must serve me .  i am human  the only human on this planet and the most intelligent of the various species that exist here  and certainly more intelligent than synapo .      that must do for the moment .  silverside could do nothing more immediately .  he must try to accept what neuronius had said  but the acceptance was not something that was going to come easily .  he had come to many forks in the path of his quest for humans  and each time   at each crux   the resolution of the dilemma subjected him to more agony .   that conflict  repeated now  and his attempt to cope with it  sent little stabs of pain shooting through his positronic brain  little stabs that congealed into a ball of pure agony  and finally he could bear the pain no longer .  he jumped up and fled down the path into the forest while neuronius s shouts grew fainter and fainter .   finally exhausted  after neuronius was left far behind  he stopped .  he had left the path and had been plunging through dense vegetation  ripping it out by the roots when it would not yield otherwise .  he stood there  recharging his reserve pack .  in the wild scramble  he had used all the output of his microfusion reactor and more  bleeding his reserves until he was forced to stop .   then he slowly began to transform from one imprint to the next  trying to find peace of mind  going back from jacob to synapo to wolruf to derec and finally to keeneye  to the form in which he had first known being and beasttongue .   in the wolf like keeneye imprint  using only a fraction of the output from her reactor  she began loping easily through the forest  finding and following the animal trails that had been created by the natural denizens of oyster world .  she found a measure of peace in the pleasant natural scents left there by those very basic creatures  creatures much lower in the scale of life than lifecrier  but still so like him in their familiar but dissimilar musky scent .   the night passed as she roamed aimlessly through the forest of repose .   dawn found her at the edge of the forest below the cliff of time  back at the trail that led to the clearing where neuronius had lectured her .  the night had served to clarify one thing .  she must talk to synapo again before she could make a final judgment of the humanity of neuronius .   she could find synapo by radio  but the only tactful way to talk to him was on the wing .  she could not ask him to come to her .  he had left the clear impression he did not want to talk to her further .  she must go back to the synapo imprint in order to talk to him on his terms .   when silverside finished the transition to blackbody form  the sun was just rising over the cliff of time .  there was a ceremyon circling high over the dome in synapo s accustomed station .  silverside wobble hopped into the air and climbed in a long  slanted rise  gaining the necessary altitude to reach the alien in the course of spanning the distance from the cliff of time .   when silverside arrived above the dome  the alien s hook was pointing aft  so he must be amenable to conversation .   with his hook also pointing aft  silverside quietly glided up beside the alien and said     leader synapo  i need to resolve a matter of .  .  .         sarco     the alien said .     synapo will arise late this morning .      talking to sarco might be better than talking to synapo .  sarco knew both neuronius and synapo and was a leader himself .  who better to judge between the two .      i must get a matter of extreme urgency resolved  leader sarco  a matter of understanding synapo better so as to compare him with neuronius   and properly place him in a hierarchy of intelligence relative to neuronius   who claims to be the most intelligent creature on this planet .         neuronius .  by the great petero     sarco hissed  emitting a small green flame simultaneously .      neuronius says further that he is a human  and not a ceremyon  that there are no others of his species on this planet .         i hesitate to term him a ceremyon myself     sarco said     but unfortunately he is   a paranoid ceremyon suffering delusions of grandeur .  he is certainly not more intelligent than synapo  take my word for it .  he wouldn t have been ejected from the cerebron elite if he were .         he has been a member of ceremyon society then .         most certainly .  something we all regret now  but did little about at the time  because neuronius was so insidiously clever .  cleverness  however  does not equate to wisdom and intelligence .         thank you for your help .  you have been of great assistance .  i will take my leave now .      silverside balled and dropped .     chapter     reprieve    they had posted jacob and mandelbrot on the balcony of the apartment to watch throughout the night for premature closing of the dome .      this reminds me of another night before you came     jacob said to mandelbrot .     i spent it much as we are destined to spend this night  but i did not have your company .         i trust nothing untoward happened that night     mandelbrot said .      no .  but that was the last night miss ariel spent under a dome that might imprison her inescapably .  she spent the next night in the lorry  sleeping on the back seat .  the next morning that first crisis with the aliens was resolved .          let us hope this crisis will be similarly resolved with a pleasant ending .  what are the chances of the wild one  do you think .         as you observed earlier  he is unpredictable     jacob said     but i wished him a great deal of success for miss ariel s sake .  it would seem that wish has gone astray .  his return is long overdue .         i fear you are right     mandelbrot said .     master derec observed that the alien leaders returned in midafternoon to their normal stations  though that was not altogether clear to me  since one looks so much like another .      they had all waited  sitting in the lorry outside the dome  watching for silverside s return .   a flock of the black aliens had returned from the direction they took when they flew off with him in their midst .  but he was not with them on their return .  that did not bode well for the safety of the wild one .   for jacob  the night passed much as it had before  except that this time he had the company and the conversation of mandelbrot  they had a short inconclusive exchange regarding the laws of humanics  and then they began a long investigative conversation  delving into the many ramifications of jacob s new knowledge of hyperwave communication  the knowledge that there were two types of modulation  not just one  the old discrete type that they were all familiar with  and now this new continuous type  that they had deduced from the aliens  remarks  and which now explained derec s mysterious internal monitor link with the supervisors of the robot cities .  the technology for that link was developed by the erratic dr .  avery  and understood only by him until miss ariel had pushed them into drawing parallels and connections with the two types of hyperspace travel  jump teleportation  which was related to discrete hyperwave modulation  and key teleportation  which was related to continuous hyperwave modulation .  in the course of the long night  they drew parallels and derived conclusions that they recorded by joint effort as a long and comprehensive dissertation for the robot city s archives  an exhaustive treatise that was intended to answer any and all questions on the subject .     it was a longer night for ariel and derec  a night they spent closeted in their bedroom to avoid exposing wolruf to their disagreement .  that friction had now escalated beyond the mild and not unusual interplay for dominance that characterizes the relationship of many pairs of lovers .   it started immediately after dinner  when ariel had gone into the bedroom to get away from the rest of them .  she was feeling intensely sorry for herself .  why was it so important that she pull off this effort at conciliation and cohabitation with a bunch of aliens  this attempt to save and incorporate into their galactic community a world she didn t give a dam about .   was it merely a matter of pride  an attempt once again to prove her capacity for leadership .  derec had never insisted that his must always be the last word  the final and ultimate judgment on things that affected both of them and that they were both mutually responsible for .   yet why did he always make her feel childish when she tried to establish her individuality in that regard .  she had as much right to make decisions as he did  and frequently the decisions he made that were right  were right only because her advice kept him from going astray .   certainly she knew more about controlling robots than he did .  he might know more about what made them tick physically  but she knew far more about how to get the most out of them socially  even out of mandelbrot  who derec had created himself .  her upbringing on aurora  surrounded by robotic servants  had given her experience in that regard  a natural dominance over robots that could never be achieved without that easy confidence one acquires in childhood when waited on hand and foot by robots .  strangely  derec had not had that common upbringing .   one can become quite attached to them and even treat them like pets .  the intelligence of some robots can make that attachment even stronger than that for an animal pet  particularly if the robot is one of the rare humaniform creations  the kind aurorans were so leery of .  jacob was certainly more than a pet .   that thought sneaked up on her and startled her now when it came so consciously to mind .  before derec had come to oyster world  she had been feeling guilty about jacob  about how obviously uncomfortable derec had been in the company of that handsome robot on aurora .  now she didn t feel guilty at all .  derec had more than overcome those odds with the robotic monster he had brought with him from the wolf planet .  with all her skill in handling robots  she had no confidence at all that she could reliably control silverside .   and now he had caused an irreparable disruption of the tremendous rapport she had established with the ceremyons  particularly with synapo .  sarco had remained a small enigma  a sort of friendly enemy  as best she could judge .  she sensed that it was not that he disliked her  but more that he could not treat her as anything but an alien .  well  she felt the same way about him  so that made them even .  and now  with silverside s shenanigans  sarco was indeed the enemy  she felt sure .   derec walked into the bedroom at that moment  and that feeling for sarco was transferred to derec  except that in derec s case the feeling was not nearly so mild .  derec was more an enemy lover  and one that she could not love now because he had become so much the enemy .      come on out  ariel     derec said .     you ve got no reason to punish wolruf by pouting in here .  maybe you ve got a case against me   and i m not even sure of that   but you ve got no reason at all to make her feel bad  too .  she s probably more on your side than mine .  after all  she s the one who bailed out your farm project .      ariel didn t say anything .  she was sitting in the far corner of the room   burrowed into an overstuffed chair that resembled a bean bag more than a piece of furniture   and looking out a corner window  adjacent to the balcony  which overlooked main street .  she could see jacob and mandelbrot standing at the end of the balcony  looking toward the opening in the dome .      silverside may bring the ceremyons around     derec continued     but if he doesn t  we could be just as well off .  we ve probably got no business setting up shop on an inhabited planet .  i ve sort of felt that way ever since i arrived .      ariel still didn t see any need to respond and even less to respond to his last remark .  he did have a minor point when it came to wolruf .  it was her expertise that would have made the robot farms practical  if silverside hadn t screwed up everything     and anyway  the robot farm project is a dumb idea     derec added .     the city robots are just that  city robots .  city planners and city builders .  trying to make farmers out of them is like trying to make a silk purse out of a sow s ear .      now he was getting personal .      you re forgetting they ve already done it on a planet called robot city     ariel said .     and you re such a great engineer you didn t know your own internal hardware was modulating hyperwave in continuous mode .  you even thought your screwy father had invented some altogether new form of communication .  right  genius .  .         you re likely wrong about that .  what are the odds that a woman and a bunch of dumb robots are going to come up with anything the least way innovative .         that s it  isn t it .  because the robot farms are a woman s idea  it s a stupid idea .  you are a male chauvinist pig  derec avery .         and you are a libertine tease  ariel welsh .         i suppose you re referring to jacob .  getting down to the nitty gritty  getting really personal .         you weren t  i suppose .         what .  calling you a chauvinist pig .         what do you call it .         stating facts .         and the hyperwave modulation .  i suppose you call those facts  too  those aberrant mental peregrinations .      she didn t let on that she didn t know what    peregrinations    meant .      continuous modulation is a fact  you ninny .  and you don t need to take that from a silly woman .  ask any ceremyon .         darn  ariel  why are we fighting like this .  i just came in here to be nice .          telling me how much i m hurting wolruf .  that s nice .         it s the truth .         and you re going to be sure i know it s the truth  right .  so you can hurt me a little more .         i didn t come in here to hurt you .  just to try to poke some sense into your thick head .         those are nice pleasant words  too .  keep it up  derec .         it s the truth  though .  that s why i came in here .         how wolruf feels isn t what s really bothering you  is it  derec .         oh .  what would you suggest .         it s really jacob  isn t it .  you re jealous of a robot  aren t you .         i don t care if you love that freak machine .  it s none of my affair .      ariel didn t say anything to rebut that last remark .  she was a tease  and she wanted him to dwell on his last thought without being distracted .      no     derec said after the space of a breath or two     i do care because if it s true  you would be darn sick .  and i do love you  ariel  whether you want me to or not  whether you love a robot or not .  so if it s true  i want to help you  and rather desperately .      he walked into the adjoining personal and closed the door .  it went on like that the rest of the night .  they didn t get much sleep .  nor did they make up as they usually did when they had finally exhausted one another emotionally .   derec slept on his side of the room  and ariel slept on hers  but they didn t sleep much  keeping each other awake by tossing and turning  and generally flouncing around to enhance the other s anger .   morning finally came .  they ate an early breakfast in silence  and they all rode in the lorry to the opening in the dome well before the time when dome construction would normally start if it were going to take place .   it did not take place .  instead the two aliens synapo and sarco arrived in their usual dramatic fashion with a great show of black wings .  ariel  derec  and wolruf climbed down from the lorry to stand near the right front wheel and talk with the two ceremyons .      it is our turn to request an audience  miss ariel welsh     synapo said     for we have discovered that a misunderstanding exists between us .  you should not be held responsible for the errant behavior of servant machinery   apparently not yours   trying to pursue its orders in the best way it knows how .  i am referring  of course  to the servant you call silverside .  the question is  whose machinery is it and whence did it come .  it came to our world aboard your vessel  wolruf .  at that time it had your form .  can you explain that .         no more than you can explain why it took your form     wolruf said .     derec knows more about it than anyone else .         i first encountered it on another planet     derec said .     at that time it was the leader of a pack of intelligent lupine beings .  they were attacking and interfering with avery robots during their construction of a city much like the one you have enclosed with your weather node compensator .  i made a sort of peace with it in order to study its physical nature and programmed behavior .  i recognized at the time that that involved certain risks .  i alone am responsible for any inconvenience the robot may have caused you .  as you have recognized  its objectives are basically benign even though its behavior may at times seem erratic .         as you also recognize  by your own words  benign objectives can sometimes motivate evil doings  particularly when two aberrants interact .  i must warn you all that we have an aberrant cerebron on the wing  more irrational than your silverside  and the two have already begun to interact .      you are familiar with the cerebron  neuronius  miss ariel welsh .  it was he who impetuously curtailed one of our earlier meetings .  the cerebrons in full caucus have now stripped him of all authority  something i could not do on my own during our meeting because of the rules that regulate our government .  we cerebrons can do little more at this time .  yet he is a danger to all of us  and his interaction with silverside  benign though it may seem to the robot  could create a very explosive situation .      so you see  derec  you feel responsible for silverside  and we feel responsible for neuronius  but our feelings can do little at this time to correct a nasty situation created by your scientific interest and our governmental restrictions  which prevent both of us from neutralizing the agitators .      but the primary purpose of this meeting is to inform you that the compensator will not be closed and you may proceed with cultivation of your plants and construction of your transportation terminal .          thank you     ariel said .     we are grateful for your foresight and will proceed with those projects .         we have not seen silverside for almost a full day now     derec said .     do you know where he is or what he s been doing .      sarco spoke now .      he is exceedingly confused about who his master should be .  based on his own programming  miss ariel welsh is his most likely master  and synapo so instructed him yesterday afternoon at the cliff of time .  he immediately began a transformation into the form of your robot jacob winterson  and was last seen that afternoon climbing down the rock face of the escarpment .      then early this morning he ascended to meet me in the form of a ceremyon  as best he can manage  and as you know  that is a startlingly huge ceremyon .      it was then that we learned of his interaction with neuronius  who had tried to pass himself off as the only human on the planet in order to win silverside s allegiance .  i hope i was able to forestall that .  i watched silverside descend to the plain of serenity and watched as he transformed to a being that looked from that distance somewhat like wolruf  but probably twice her size .  i last saw him entering the forest of repose in that form .         that would be his keeneye imprint     derec said     one of the lupine creatures he copied on that other planet .  thank you .  at least we know he s still alive and hope he ll return .  thank you very much .      the two ceremyons turned then and took to the air .   immediately after the meeting  in the short time that was left before lunch  ariel  derec  and wolruf began planning the robot farm experiment  discussing in broad outline the revisions in the programming of the avery robots that would be required  not only for the many different farms themselves  but also for the creation of the city s new terminal facilities that would be needed to support the farms .   silverside had not returned by the time they sat down to lunch .  in spite of all the trouble he had caused her  ariel felt inexplicably concerned about his welfare .     chapter     the egg    once again silverside was in turmoil .  all was confusion .  who should he believe .  he wished only to evade the dilemma .  he metamorphosed  escaping back to the relative peace of his wolfish    childhood     back to the days when lifecrier had guided him into the life of the pack on the wolf planet .   thus  midmorning found silverside imprinted on the wolflike female keeneye  trotting along an animal trail far from the robot city .  as she had the night before  she spent the late morning and early afternoon exploring the vast forest of repose  its trails  brooks  rivers  and lakes that lay within ten kilometers of the city .   monitoring the field lines of oyster world s natural magnetism kept her oriented during her aimless roving  so that as the morning waned  she began to zero in on the dome without dwelling on what she was going to do when she got there .   in the early afternoon  she came to the edge of the forest opposite the mirage like transparency that concealed the robot city .  she sat down on her haunches and stared at the dome with unseeing eyes  mulling over   as she had all morning   what neuronius and then sarco had told her .   she could not escape the essential validity of sarco s assessment of neuronius   a self centered  paranoid psychopath   nor could she any longer ignore synapo s directive to serve miss ariel and the feeling that that could best be done in the male imprint of jacob winterson  who was already serving miss ariel with apparently great efficiency and to her obvious satisfaction .   the jacob imprint would help  but it was still not clear exactly how she could best serve miss ariel .  the physics neuronius had expounded had only confused her  offering information that conflicted with her earlier knowledge of space and time .  he had not clarified the physics  but had instead muddied it and left silverside worse off than she had been before .  the new information was useless  and worse than useless in the confusion it created about the physics she had once known .   as she sat there in the quiet heat of the afternoon studying the dome and trying to make sense of the aborted discussion with neuronius  she gradually became aware of a faint humming off to her left  nearer the dome but deeper in the forest .  when the sound finally broke through her reverie  she rose and trotted along an animal path that led in the general direction of the hum .   the path led past the hum  and when silverside recognized that she had passed the point of closest approach  she started through the vegetation  heading directly for the sound .  although the ground was covered in that area  the cover was not dense  and she had no difficulty weaving through the shrubbery .  as the hum grew steadily louder  she almost ran into its source as she came around a tall bush covered with pink blossoms .   she recognized the source instantly .  it was a two meter sphere  just as hers had been  and the duodecahedral structure of the coarse silvery cells of its skin  dulled by the heat of passage through oyster world s atmosphere  told her instantly it was an egg similar to her own .   it lay atop the crushed base of two bushes  framed by pink flowers  set in green foliage which  in close proximity to the foreign surface  was now seared and wilted by the heat the egg had exuded earlier .  it was now almost cool to the touch  almost ready for hatching .  and it came to her then what she must do .   she kept the keeneye form to speed her dash through the thin shrubbery of the forest  but when she came to the plain  she began the transformation to the jacob imprint  stopping only long enough to fashion the heavy muscular legs that would take her the three kilometers to the dome s opening in the shortest length of time .  as she ran along the wall of the dome  she completed the transformation to the masculine jacob form well before he reached the opening on the north side .   as silverside approached the opening  wohler   called to him from a small runabout parked near the west edge .      i get no response from you on the comlink  jacob .         i am silverside     he said as he hopped into the passenger seat .     take me to miss ariel welsh .      wohler   started the runabout  turned into the near southbound lane of main street  and proceeded rapidly down the street in the direction of the compass tower .      i have instructions to take you to master derec at once  silverside .          where is miss ariel .     silverside asked .      at the apartment .         good .  then we are proceeding in the right direction .         yes .  master derec is working at the mainframe  which is currently on the second underground level of the compass tower .      when they came abreast of the apartment  silverside jumped out .  wohler   braked the runabout to a halt but remained seated .      i must take you to master derec     wohler   called to silverside s back .      later     silverside called over his shoulder as he ran into the building .   he took the stairs three at a time and burst into the apartment .   ariel was sitting at the dining table reading a computer printout .  the table was strewn with piles of computer output .  jacob was thumbing through the piles  apparently hunting for the next printout she would need .   silverside took in the scene  picked ariel up  cradling her in his arms like a fragile baby  dashed out the door  down the stairs  and past wohler    who was walking toward the apartment from the runabout .   ariel had time to scream only once before she was deposited in the runabout .  as she was being gently scooped up  she had screamed     jaaaacobbbb     with a doppler modulation that trailed off like the whistle of a passing train .   jacob winterson had responded with the millisecond speed characteristic of dr .  han fastolfe s humaniform robots .  but that speed was no match for the microseconds it took for all of silverside s motions  save for the brisk but gentle acceleration when he had picked up ariel and started toward the door .   he and ariel were speeding away from the apartment building in the runabout as jacob came pounding out of the apartment past wohler   .   ariel s first scream had ended as she was being deposited in the runabout .  her next scream was delivered in the interrogative mode as they pulled away from the apartment .      what are you doing .     she shrieked with an intensity that rattled silverside s auricular diaphragms   akin to eardrums .      there was no time to explain  miss ariel     silverside shouted about the wind noise .     i need your presence urgently .      jacob raced after them down main street but was soon left behind as silverside accelerated the small runabout to its maximum speed  weaving in and out of the traffic and avoiding an accident by the adeptness of the city central computer .      stop  you maniac     ariel screamed .     stop now .      silverside slowed the runabout noticeably and then promptly speeded up again .  consideration of his new knowledge of the law of humanics   humans were compelled to please themselves   overrode his own second law output   robots must obey human orders .  he knew when ariel had finally considered all the facts   after the fact   she would be pleased and would approve what he was doing .      you are in no danger  miss ariel  but i cannot obey that order because of the overriding nature of the present situation which demands your presence at the birthing of .  .  . of .  .  .     and he added lamely  still shouting     of what i cannot be sure .     and the shout died away as he said     i can only hope .      then ariel  sobbing and screaming incoherently  beat on him with her hands clenched into small hard fists  beat on his shoulder first  and then finally  in desperation  beat on his head .  but he felt nothing in the intensity of his purpose .      you must stop that  miss ariel     he shouted .     you will hurt yourself .       and the calm way he shouted that above the sound of the rushing air and the obvious lack of effect her effort was having  must have calmed her  for she finally stopped and slumped down on the seat  seemingly exhausted  her hysteria spent .   they emerged from the opening  and silverside skidded the runabout in a sharp left turn to take them down the side of the dome .      you must understand what is taking place     he shouted .     it is very important to me  to the new foundling  even to you  miss ariel  for i wish her to serve you well .      ariel said nothing .  she sat beside him like a limp doll .      another like me is being born .  the egg lies in the forest even now  ready to hatch .  she must have a proper model  a human female  so that she does not come into being confused  her imprint misguided as mine was .  you must be there to guide her into this strange world .  do you understand what i am saying  miss ariel .      ariel still said nothing  but she had straightened a little in the seat  perhaps because to slump in the bouncing runabout was more uncomfortable than to sit up straight .      you will not be harmed  miss ariel .  after it s allover  when you think back on it  you will be glad you came .  i know you will .  you will be pleased with me .  the law of humanics will guide you .      that seemed to comfort silverside .  the law of humanics was working on the effect of his own laws  regulating their relative potential to something that was less uncomfortable .  he was doing something that he knew was going to please ariel even though she was  perhaps  not pleased at the moment .   when they arrived at the forest  he braked to a halt  jumped out  and opened the door for ariel .  she got out calmly .  she must have thought about what he had been shouting at her  for she didn t object when he gently took her hand to help her from the car .   that gave him confidence that she would follow him without being forced  and he let go of her hand and started into the woods .  she stayed close behind him for the short  hurried walk it took to reach the egg .   silverside guided ariel gently until she stood two meters from the egg  directly in front of the hatch  and then he left her there and hid behind the pink flowered bush behind her .   the hatch began to open with a soft grinding sound .   silverside could look through the lower branches of the tall bush  past ariel s right side  and see the hatch himself .   a silvery gray  amorphous mass heaved itself above the bottom of the hatch and formed  in that part of its mass that hung over the edge of the opening  a shiny  multifaceted  grayish green orb that it rotated slowly around   much like an eye rotating in its socket   as though it were surveying the entire landscape .  the inspection narrowed then  and starting at ariel s feet  the orb slowly scanned up until it was gazing at her head .   with that inspection completed  the blob elongated and pulled itself through the hatch as though it were one large muscle  like the foot of a huge snail .  it slithered out of the hatch  coming to rest on the ground in front of ariel like a thick pancake with the orb still intact in the center .   the facets of the orb slowly disappeared  absorbed into a grayish green ring surrounding a black pupil  while the bulk of the orb turned white .  a spherical mass the size of a small bowling ball began to rise from the pancake  lifting the eye   for it was clearly that now   and a second eye took shape  forming the first aspects of a face .   slowly then  head  shoulders  arms  breast mounded chest  hips and buttocks and legs  all reared up out of the puddle until there was no puddle left   the last sucked up into a pair of shapely ankles and feet   and a silvery likeness of ariel stood before ariel .   silverside stepped from behind the bush then and silently inspected the new arrival .  ariel had stood transfixed  mute and motionless  during the whole process .   now silverside spoke up  proudly  christening this delightful new creation .      you are the female  eve silverside .      after allowing a moment for that to sink in to both ariel and eve  he spoke again  triumphantly  feeling as though he had found his true identity at last .      and i am the male  adam silverside .      they stood like that  no one saying anything  and then the sound of jacob s voice came to them and the sound of feet pounding the ground .      miss ariel  where are you .      and then the pounding stopped  and they could hear him thrashing through the shrubbery .      miss ariel     he kept calling  coming closer and closer .      here  jacob     ariel called .     chapter     a final imprint    after the excitement of eve s birth and the brief period it took for eve to become properly functional and subservient to ariel under adam s guidance  everything seemed to fall into place except for the uncertainty of how that enigmatic event could have taken place .  to discover adam silverside on an alien planet was certainly unexpected  an inexplicable robot on an inexplicable planet .  but to personally midwife the birth of another of the creatures was something altogether different  it raised so many questions  with the degree of involvement of the erratic dr .  avery heading the list .   when they finally put those unanswerable questions behind them and turned instead to the creative work that confronted them  they found that the task  though difficult  was not as difficult as they had supposed it to be .  the farm programming that was used on the planet robot city was intact in pearl city s computer files  ready for use should the need arise .   what ariel had merely fantasized and hoped was a capacity for leadership proved in reality to be a genuine ability to lead .  and what was even more amazing  derec readily relinquished his nominal authority and bowed to her decisions in the construction of the farms and their associated terminal facilities .   initially  one of ariel s first decisions did not have the wholehearted endorsement of either derec or wolruf  although they later conceded that she was right .  they all agreed that they needed an eighth supervisor robot to oversee the planetwide farm operation .  but neither derec nor wolruf agreed initially with the form ariel specified for the supervisor   adamantly   nor with the name she chose for that robot  wheeler .  to them it made no sense to name a farmer after the twentieth century spacetime physicist john archibald wheeler .  to her it made perfect sense  for both were as close to nature as a being can get  the farmer in a concrete  practical sense  the physicist in an abstract  symbolic sense .   she had been studying spacetime physics  trying to understand the node compensator .  her mind at that time was much filled with the heroic personalities of physics .    and in her mind  wheeler s name described his nomadic lifestyle that took him wheeling far and wide over the surface of the planet in pursuit of his supervisory function  for she insisted that he have the form of a ceremyon .  wolruf and derec later conceded that perhaps that was the proper form   because it harmonized with the job and the world so beautifully   but it was difficult at first for them to think of a supervisor in any but humanoid shape .   she made wheeler smaller than a ceremyon   so as not to intimidate the aliens   but far larger than any of the other native flyers  so that the ceremyons would not mistake him  at a distance  for a natural denizen of their world .  she insisted  too  that his robotic laws recognize ceremyons with all the weight ordinarily reserved for humans  and that derec revise the programming of the other supervisors to defer to wheeler in matters dealing with oyster world and the ceremyons .   the problem of seeds had been worrying ariel almost from the time she had first hit on the idea of a farm world  but she found that there had been no need to worry .  seeds for a variety of crops to match the farm programs had been carried during the initial migration to oyster world and were stored in labeled bins that were indexed in the programs .  there was no need to get seeds from aurora .   with wolruf s advice   to make the overall mosaic of the farm operation as benign as possible  weather wise   they interspersed the truck gardens and orchards among the fields of wheat  oats  barley  and several other grains  and among large fields of cotton  a commodity that had never been matched for all around adaptation to the human dermal ecology .  and to minimize the upset to the planet s ecology  she further advised that they leave  interspersed among their new plants  an equal stand of the natural grass that had covered the plain when they first arrived .   in that first experiment  they decided to limit themselves to plant products .  the production of wool  milk  and meat and animal husbandry in general  seemed less harmonious with robotic labor than the cultivation of nonsentient plant life .   irrigation   the dirt farmer s primary worry   was not a problem on oyster world .  regulated rainfall was an integral part of the ceremyons  weather control system .  they had recognized the need of the natural vegetation long before they met humans .   the terminal facilities were built above the main street access and were patterned after those on aurora  modified to fit the special conditions demanded by the configuration of the opening in the dome .  all vessels arrived and departed from an array of oval openings that included configurations suitable for all designs of shuttle and small cargo vessels then known  interstellar and otherwise .  the large interstellar transports would be serviced in orbit by smaller shuttles that could fit through the dome s opening .   during this exhilarating period of leadership  ariel experienced only one apprehension and one disturbance worth recording .   the apprehension had to do with neuronius and synapo s warning .  it was one thing to deal with insane humans .  it was another thing  a good bit more unsettling  to have an irrational alien floating around overhead  toting compressed hydrogen in close proximity to compressed oxygen .  neither she nor derec had been able to get anything out of adam silverside concerning what had happened between him and neuronius .  he had pleaded third law interference with the second law imperative whenever they tried .  they did not insist  for fear what he called    interference    might be more seriously harmful to his positronic stability  why else would he have claimed interference at all .  she resolved to have eve work on him when it seemed propitious .   the disturbance was of a fairly major nature  not so much from its intensity as from its low grade  continual irritation   her irritation with adam silverside .   that finally came to a head on a day when things had not gone well and little irritations had mounted into raw abrasions .  she and derec   trying to bring some tranquility into the day   were chatting quietly in midevening after dinner  just the two of them on the balcony again .  it was where they went to escape  inconsiderately leaving wolruf in the company of the four robots .   after awhile they had lapsed into silence  and ariel s thoughts returned to adam silverside .  she had given him two sets of jacob s clothes  distinctive sets that let her quickly identify him as adam and not jacob .   she supposed she knew now what jacob looked like under his clothes  for adam silverside  with visual records of jacob and library records of humans  had carried his imprint to very fine detail indeed .  and she had observed the details of that imprint the day of eve s birth  when adam had come charging into the apartment naked and carried her away .   ariel broke the silence .      was adam s imprint on you less realistic than his current imprint on jacob .     she asked derec .      yes .  more or less the same as eve s imprint on you     derec said .   eve would never need clothes .  though an ariel imprint  she was not fashioned with the fine attention to detail adam had used with jacob .  eve was merely a silvery organometallic robot .      how would he react  do you think  if i asked him to go back to that one .         you d no longer be miss ariel  for one thing .  it would probably be master derec again .         eve and jacob are quite enough .  but how would he behave .  would he be the wild one again .         i don t really know .  he s certainly been steady these past few weeks .  if it weren t for his quiet air of superiority   a condition of his muscles  i believe   i d say he s achieved a state of agreeable servitude .         it s the muscles that bother me   no  not just the muscles  his whole appearance .         reminds you too much of jacob .         yes  but more the fact that he is otherwise so little like jacob .  it s the contrast that irritates me .  do you mind if i ask him to imprint back on you .         no .  it would be another interesting experiment in robotics .         no better time than now  then .      she got up and went inside .  mandelbrot and jacob were in the two niches .  adam and eve were standing rigidly by the door  one to each side .  wolruf was curled up on the couch  watching a taped hyperwave drama .   ariel had expected derec to come in with her .  she could have used his moral support on this one  but she was too proud to ask .   she walked over to adam .      would it upset your positronics greatly if i asked you to return to an earlier imprint  the looser  less detailed one you did on derec .         i am not giving satisfactory service  miss ariel .         the service is great  adam .  i wouldn t want your behavior in that regard to change  not in quality at least .         but then i would be serving master derec .  would that not be a drastic change in the quality of my service .         a change in direction  adam  and a change i will regret  but it should not cause a change in the quality of your service .  i would expect that to remain at the same high level i have enjoyed .  in fact  if you could continue to serve me directly  i would find that most gratifying .         that would not be logical  miss ariel .     his tone was best described as haughty .      i was afraid that would be the case .         in that light  do you still wish me to make such a change .         yes .  i think it would be best  adam     she said     but would you do so in the bedroom .  i find the process unsettling .         perhaps for good reason  miss ariel .         possibly  adam .  but there is little i can do about that .      she rejoined derec on the balcony as adam went into the bedroom .      sorry     derec said .     i didn t see how my presence was going to make that any easier for either of you .         i suppose     ariel said .     but you better hope he s not the wild one again .        chapter     the rustication of adam silverside    after his final imprint on derec  adam silverside started taking long walks in the forest near the dome .  he now had the lean muscular appearance of a silvery derec without the clothes and the fine detail .  his allegiance to derec was weak .  derec must have recognized that  for he seldom gave adam a direct order  never used him as a servant as ariel tried to use eve silverside    with only modest success   and never expected him to account for his whereabouts .   the walks in the forest brought to adam a peace and serenity he felt nowhere else .  he was comfortable with his derec imprint  and with derec himself  so long as derec did not overdo his master role  but adam was basically uncomfortable in the city and just as uncomfortable around the avery robots as he was around mandelbrot .   derec never questioned his roaming around in the forest .  for a while he did send a witness robot to watch him  but adam always quickly eluded the witness by dropping to all fours and running along the low canopied animal trails as though he were in his wolruf imprint .   it was on one of his nature walks that an idea struck him of how he  too  might contribute to the robot farm project .  he had come to the edge of the forest a kilometer or so away from the dome and had stood there in the shade of a large palm like tree  watching a herd of wooly ruminants  the size of small llamas  as they munched the grass of the plain .   he christened them    minillamas    for want of a better name .  they were quite tame .  the animals of oyster world were all vegetarians .  these animals had no natural enemies except for parasitic insects that burrowed into their skin under the protection afforded by the dense wool .   the idea developed quickly .  the next morning at sunup  adam commandeered a small empty cargo robot  stepped aboard  and directed it to the city s small tool crib where he requisitioned a laser saw  a hatchet  a shovel  a claw hammer  a bag of six centimeter iron nails  six coils of rope in fifty meter coils  an augered post hole digger  an earth tamper  a microfusion powered  mp  motor   for driving the digger and the tamper   another general purpose mp motor  a photo sensitive switch and small mp lamp  and a pair of shears .   as the cargo robot with adam and his supplies passed the apartment on main street  eve silverside  standing on the sidewalk  hailed him to the curb .      what are you up to .     she asked .      a secret farm project     adam said .      why secret .         if it doesn t work  i won t have to explain that it didn t work     adam replied .     want to come along .         sure .      adam unlatched  and was going to let down  a small ramp formed from a hinged section of the meter high sidewall of the cargo space  but just as he unlatched it  eve belly rolled over the wall .      and what are you up to .     adam asked as he latched the ramp back in place .      looking for you .      adam directed the cargo robot back into the main street traffic and then said     you found me .  now what .         whipping down the street in a cargo robot isn t the best place for a quiet conversation .         it s not likely to get much better this morning .         i ll take my chances .  it can hardly get worse .         how did you get away from miss ariel .     adam asked .     i m here in her service .         oh .      neither said anything more until they had left the city  crossed the plain  and were at the edge of the forest near where silverside had watched the minillamas the day before .  the herd was now grazing farther out on the plain .  he directed the cargo robot to park beside the entrance of a well worn trail the minillamas had made through the forest to a small brook and then he led eve silverside to that quiet place .   adam had brought along the photo sensitive switch  the mp lamp  and one of the mp motors .  he sat down on a large rock beside the brook  placed the electrical parts on the ground in front of him  and began to wire them together with the long electrical leads that were attached to each .      now what has miss ariel got you up to this morning .     adam asked as he began hooking the parts together .      neuronius     eve said .     what was the nature of your dealings with neuronius .         that s a private matter  eve .  both miss ariel and master derec recognized that and waived the second law when i claimed hardship under the third law .         can t you tell me .  i m a robot .  i can sympathize more closely with you than they can .  miss ariel thinks you may have suffered positronic trauma which needs airing to be properly cleared away .         it doesn t need airing  and something like that doesn t need clearing away if it is viewed and contained in an orderly manner .  i have succeeded in doing that .         how can you be sure .  you can be no more objective in that regard than a human suffering psychological trauma .         the human brain and the positronic brain work on completely different principles .  it s futile to try to draw analogies between them .         is it  now .         yes .  you have no more basis for comparing the two than i do .         if that s so  why are you so secretive about it .  that seems to take on a certain psychological twist .         well  it doesn t .  it s merely a positronic twist which humans aren t capable of understanding .         but i should be .         yes .         well  i m not .         this isn t getting anywhere .     adam stood up .     i ve got to get on with my project .      he picked up the wired parts and strode away down the path .   eve emerged from the forest as he walked down the ramp of the cargo robot with the laser saw swinging from one hand .  she followed him into the forest and watched as he cut through the ten centimeter bole of a tall  slender hardwood species that seemed to thrive in the dense shade of the predominately conifer canopy .      get the hatchet     he requested after the tree fell .   when she returned  he was cutting off the large branches .      trim off the small branches     he said .     i ll take the big ones .      they worked together silently  cutting down and trimming the slender hardwoods  spacing their selections throughout the forest so as to minimize the effect in anyone area  and dragging the long slender logs to a pile they created on the plain near the cargo robot .   when they had delivered the last log to the pile  eve sat down on the ramp of the cargo robot .      you ll not tell me then about your interaction with neuronius .     she said  making it more a statement than a question .      no     adam replied .      i ll have to talk to neuronius then .         that would be a bad idea  eve .         you and miss ariel agree on that  at least .         for good reason .  she s given you some idea what neuronius is like then .         the viewpoint of the other ceremyons .  they re naturally prejudiced .  hardly an objective assessment .  since you won t talk to me about your experience  i ll have to get it from neuronius himself .      if she thought that was going to pressure him into discussing a painful experience that he had successfully put in a can  she was wrong .  that was not something he was going to talk about .      i guess you will  but i m telling you again  it s a bad idea  which you ll regret .      he had been attaching the motor to the post hole digger while they talked .  now he began digging post holes four meters apart in a large rectangle that enclosed several paths trodden through the grass by the minillamas  which all converged on the entrance of the forest path to the brook .   while he worked  he listened to eve contact neuronius by radio .  adam had taught her the ceremyon language and the calling codes that identified and solicited responses from synapo and sarco .  he had not told her about neuronius  and so had given her no radio identification for him .  however  he had explained the way a general hailing channel worked on their frequency modulated band  and that was what she used now to quickly establish communication with neuronius .   the cerebron agreed to meet with her at noon at the base of the cliff of time  where it intersected the forest of repose and the plain of serenity .  she set off at a leisurely jog in the direction of the cliff of time .   that was going to be an interesting learning experience for eve  but hardly a dangerous one .  adam did not think she was as mixed up about humans as he had been .  he had started her out right with ariel as an imprint .  neuronius s warped ideas were not likely to have the effect on her that they had had on him .  his only regret was that eve would now likely hear how neuronius had momentarily deluded him .  it was not something adam remembered with serenity .     chapter     neuronius strikes again    eve arrived at the escarpment well before noon .  she sat down on a plate of granite that angled into the ground below a dammed talus of black gravel  and braced herself from sliding by digging her heels into the soft turf where the stone disappeared into the grass .   she arrived early to give herself time to think about miss ariel s strange request   that she probe adam for information about neuronius   and to ponder adam s equally strange reluctance to talk about his experience with neuronius .  it was all quite fascinating to someone with as little experience as eve .  she had a good education   adam had led her along the electronic pathways through the city library   but she thirsted for the real life experiences that lay behind all that academic lore .   she was going to get it that morning  for neuronius arrived early also  giving her little time to ruminate on the words of adam and miss ariel .   he came in with that black engulfing swoop and stall that   according to adam   the ceremyons used to intimidate alien visitors to their planet .  it certainly impressed the experience thirsty eve .  she drank it up  exhilarating in a feeling of surprise in spite of adam s forewarning  a surprise that would likely have been fear in miss ariel s case .  the ceremyons were indeed quite impressive seen close at hand .   she got to her feet as he folded his wings .      i am neuronius     the alien said haughtily .     you are eve .         yes     eve replied .      what purpose is served by our meeting this morning .         what was the nature of your conversations with adam silverside .         the man like robot who can mold silver wings out of his own substance .         yes .         perhaps you should talk to him .         i d like to hear it from your viewpoint .         is he man like or wing like now .         man like .      that adjective gave some confusion .  she presumed without thinking that he meant adam s current form  his derec imprint .  her mind was on other things  of course  and did not consider the possibility that neuronius was referring to adam s jacob winterson imprint .      and what is it you would like to know  eve .         what you told him .  what is it he s so reluctant to discuss .         ah  he s reluctant to talk about our conversation  is he .  that is encouraging .  i did get through to him then .  i am confident he will ultimately embrace that truth and wisdom .         and what is that truth and wisdom .         are you familiar with his governing laws  the laws of robotics .         yes .  i  too  am governed by them .         ah so .      he said that in a peculiar way  but with her limited experience  she didn t know why it seemed peculiar  and so it lingered in that uneasy state only momentarily  until he spoke again  and then that uneasiness was swept from her mind .      he didn t tell you then that i am the only human on this planet .      eve had not had to go through all the turmoil and travail that adam had suffered in his search for humanity .  she had taken for granted that ariel was human .  adam had not said otherwise .  for the first time she experienced some of his confusion .  in a way it was more agonizing than his trauma in that it was acute and pierced deeper into her being than had the chronic uncertainty adam had lived with for so long .  and piercing so deeply and so unexpectedly  it exerted a great deal more force and weighed in with a great deal of authority .   so she concluded instantly  with no sifting and sorting and assessing of the facts  that adam had misled her .  no wonder he was so secretive  so reluctant to discuss neuronius .  no wonder ariel was concerned about neuronius .  in her mind  eve had already dropped the    miss .         why did adam lie to me .     she asked  thinking out loud more than addressing neuronius .      it served his evil purpose and that of the other aliens     neuronius said .   and that  too  was true  she knew .  against her inclination toward independence  it had bonded her to ariel  and just that morning  it had inclined her to help adam in some absurd secret scheme related to ariel s plan to turn this world into a giant robot farm .  she could see now how it must be evil .   she began a transformation to simulate neuronius  as adam had simulated synapo .  she expected some reaction from neuronius  but he said nothing  merely watched her quietly  and she took that for approval .   she was faced with the same aerodynamic problems adam had encountered and overcame them and the other simulation requirements just as adam had .  being less familiar with the ceremyons and unaware of some of their capabilities  she left out a few characteristics that adam had simulated  but all told  it was a workmanlike effort .   when she finished  she spread her wings tentatively .  like adam in that imprint  she was twice the size of a ceremyon .  unlike adam  she retained the basic female gender of her first imprint  which had been reinforced by adam s attraction to her femininity .  adam s first female imprint on keeneye  weakened by the hostility of keeneye herself  had been erased by derec s personality .  but that male gender  though preferred  came second and could be confused by later imprints .      watch me now     neuronius said .     follow me  and do as i do .      and eve did .  she watched neuronius take off  and then she  too  wobble hopped into the air  flapping  almost losing it  flapping harder  and finally gaining altitude .  as she got the feel of the air and her relationship to it  she stopped floundering quite so much  the beat became smoother and less strenuous  and soon she and neuronius were high above the escarpment .   neuronius leveled off  taking up a circular flight pattern  and eve fell into place beside him  matching his wing movements stroke for stroke  so that the two were soon idling side by side  effortlessly .      how may i serve you  master .     eve asked .      if all else fails  you must personally destroy the cerebron leader  synapo     neuronius said .      destroy synapo .  i am programmed to preserve organic life .  i can do otherwise only if the act of preservation would conflict with my robotic laws .         that is the case .  it comes down to a matter of synapo s life or mine .  synapo is not human .  i am .      but first  there is another way     neuronius added without pausing     a more indirect and less violent way .  your personal involvement with synapo is only a last resort  only if miss ariel welsh cannot handle synapo herself  after we provide her with the powerful and lethal knowledge i tried to give silverside  the wisdom that allows the myostrians to construct weather node compensators .          you taught that to adam .     eve said .     and now you are going to teach me  too .     she had been right to come to neuronius .  this was going to be a truly exciting experience .      no .  this time i cannot take time for that .  i must pass the knowledge directly to miss ariel welsh .  you must arrange that meeting .      slight though it was  and very faint   deep down in the nethermost parts of her positronic brain   that disappointment with neuronius was something not easily dismissed .  but at the time it was overshadowed by the thrill of being involved in exciting and world shaking events .  she planned to acquire the knowledge anyway by listening while neuronius instructed ariel .     when .     eve asked .      now     neuronius said .     as soon as you can arrange it .  i ll be waiting among the trees where the forest of repose meets the node compensator .  bring miss ariel welsh there .         very well  master .      eve started a long shallow glide to the dome but decided that a small detour would not significantly delay the primary mission .     chapter     the further rustication of adam s .     adam dug postholes in the prairie grass  and with the long slender logs he had cut  he constructed a fence that enclosed a rectangular corral roughly    by    meters .  the entrance to the brook path was centered in the long side that bordered the forest .  the three minillama trails leading across the prairie to the brook passed through manual gates in the outer sides of the corral .   along the forest side at the end away from the dome he placed another row of posts to form a meter wide exit chute from the brook  so the minillamas could exit the forest path without going through the corral .  the fence on the forest side of the chute kept the beasts from creating an easy  short bypass to the old path .   at the entrance to the brook path  he placed two gates  one automatic  the other manual .  the automatic gate connected the brook path to the exit chute and acted like a check valve  allowing beasts to exit the brook path  but preventing loose beasts from the prairie from coming through the chute to the brook .  the gate was actuated by breaking a light beam across the brook path that activated a microfusion motor  driving the gate so that it opened into the chute  forcing back any minillamas waiting in the chute outside  while letting out the beast leaving the brook .   the other gate closed off the exit from the narrow shearing chute that was formed along the woodside fence opposite the exit chute by a short parallel fence with a manual entrance gate .  another short length of fence angled into the corral from the chute at      to form an entrance funnel .   he turned on the lamp and photodetector that would activate the motor on the check valve gate  closed the gates at both ends of the shearing chute  loaded all his tools and leftover supplies into the cargo robot  and directed it  in turn  to each of the three outside entrance gates  which he opened .  he wound up parking the cargo robot outside the entrance gate nearest the dome .   he was ready for business .  the thirst of the mini llamas should draw the beasts into the corral .  there was nothing to do but wait .   he let down the cargo ramp and sat down  then lay back supine so he could watch the ceremyons circling in the blue sky far overhead .  he remembered then that last flight he had taken to talk to synapo  when he had found sarco instead .  during none of his flights   neither on this planet  or earlier  on the wolf planet    had he considered the experience of flying itself .  at the time his mind was far too busy with other disturbing thoughts .  now he looked back to those flights and realized that the act of flying had been an exceedingly enjoyable experience .  watching the ceremyons far above  he relived those moments  recapturing the pleasure he had unconsciously stored away without really savoring and appreciating it at the time .   until it got quite close  he failed to notice the large ceremyon shape coming directly at him on a long glide path from the direction of the cliff of time .  its dull silvery color blended into the grayish blue sky  and because of its lack of motion in bearing and elevation  the beast was almost invisible until it was nearly upon him .  then it came at him with a rush  flared its wings  lost momentum and stalled  but did so almost two meters too high  so that it fell to the ground only a couple of meters away with a decided impact  wings outspread .  the momentum of its low center of gravity had swung its body forward  pivoting around the shoulders  so that it fell flat on its back .  adam couldn t help but recall his similar experience in testing the ceremyon wings for the first time  when he had glided from the lorry  dragged his toes  and fallen on his face .   from the size and the color he knew at once that it was eve .  he had risen to a sitting position when he had detected the moving object .  now  while adam watched quietly  eve transformed back to the ariel imprint  lying on the ground  as though the robot didn t want to risk the awkward indignity of trying to stand while still imprinted on the ceremyon .  with the metamorphosis complete  she stood  quickly and with a delicacy and grace that contrasted sharply with her harsh words .      you misled me  adam silverside .         how so .     adam asked     ariel is not human .  neither is derec .  you knew  yet you didn t tell me that neuronius is the only human here .  he is my master .  you and mandelbrot and the avery robots are alien to me .  your laws are obviously not my laws .  something compels you to serve non humans in spite of neuronius and the wisdom he tried to pass on to you .      she talked so fast adam didn t get a chance to interrupt .  and then she wheeled abruptly and ran rapidly in the direction of the dome .  although disturbed  she didn t seem violently so .  she didn t seem dangerous  even though she had clearly responded to the insidious persuasion of neuronius .  adam would have liked to have had a chance to counter that poison .  still  ariel could probably do a better job than he  and with more authority .  after all  it was ariel who had pushed eve in the direction of neuronius in the first place  albeit unwittingly .   adam sat there watching her progress toward the dome  waiting patiently for his experiment to reach its climax  when the minillamas would start entering his corral .   it was some time later  after he resumed his supine position and his observation of the soaring ceremyons  that he heard the muffled explosion .  he rose up just as a flaming  cartwheeling object landed in the grass midway between him and the activity near the dome  where the explosion had taken place .   he jumped up  raised and secured the ramp  and directed the cargo robot to the location where the object had landed .     chapter     neuronius strikes out    when eve silverside found her  ariel was sitting at the computer terminal in the apartment examining wolruf s latest report on the final steps needed to put the last of the robot farms in operation .      i have carried out your wishes  ariel     eve said .   the missing title  the lack of polite address  caught ariel s attention and alerted her to possible trouble ahead .  she turned around to face eve .   eve continued     i talked to adam  but he was quite uncooperative  no help at all .         you did what i asked     ariel said .     i was hoping you would succeed where derec and i failed .  but actually i had small hope that you could get anything out of him .  not when he pleaded third law considerations .  don t feel bad .         but i did succeed .  i found out what master neuronius told him  all the things they talked about .         i don t understand .         i talked to master neuronius himself .         neuronius .      ariel began to feel apprehensive  sensing impending calamity  feeling very much alone .  mandelbrot was with derec .  she had sent jacob to the locker in the basement for a fresh box of positronic data storage cubes .  personal robots were never around when you really needed them .      yes  master neuronius     eve replied .     he tried to teach adam the science behind the compensator domes  but failed .  he will succeed with me  though .         ah  then he hasn t taught you yet .         no .  not yet .  but i will learn when he teaches you .         me .         yes .  i will learn by listening to your conversation .      ariel seriously considered the idea  briefly  but only for a moment .  talk about upstaging derec .  that would put her hyperwave modulation coup in the deep shade .  but she would not likely understand the technology even if she had the opportunity .  she hadn t understood even the idea when synapo and sarco had tried to summarize the dome construction for derec .  and to get involved with neuronius after synapo s warning would be sheer idiocy .      not likely     ariel said .     and you should stay away from neuronius .  he is exceedingly dangerous .         you must come with me now  ariel .  master neuronius is waiting in the forest .         don t be silly .  i have no intention of going with you  nor of meeting with an insane ceremyon .         why do you say damaging things like that .  master neuronius does not deprecate you in that fashion .  instead  he has a great deal of faith in you  otherwise he wouldn t be willing to help you in your struggle with synapo .         i m not struggling with synapo .  he and i get along fine .         but he has deluded you .         no .  quite the contrary .  neuronius has deluded you .  just like he confused and tried to take over adam .  fortunately  adam had talked to synapo first .  and then sarco later .  together they were able to straighten him out .  it s unfortunate that adam wouldn t talk to you .  we could have avoided all this if he had .  it would be better still if i hadn t sent you to adam in the first place .  but now  it seems i had good reason to .         it is adam who is still confused .  he knows that master neuronius is the only human on the planet .         what .     ariel wasn t sure she had heard that right .      adam knows that master neuronius is the only human here .         adam told you that .         no  but he did not deny it just now .         who did tell you then .  surely not even neuronius is that irrational .         that is the most important thing i learned from master neuronius .  and adam confirmed it by his silence .  adam s laws cannot be my laws or he  too  would recognize and obey our master .         surely you don t believe that .      ariel wished desperately that jacob would get back up with the storage cubes .  she couldn t stall much longer .      you must come with me now     eve insisted .      no .  we must talk to adam .  he can clear all this up .  we ll go talk to adam just as soon as jacob returns .  in the meantime  go stand in your niche  eve .  i have to get back to work .      ariel turned back to the terminal  feigning an auroran confidence in dealing with robots that she no longer felt .   eve gathered her up in one quick swoop  handling her like a disobedient child  with none of the gentleness adam had used when he had taken her to witness eve s birth .  that experience came immediately to mind .  twice now these wild robots had subjected her person to gross indignities .   they were going out the street door as jacob started up the stairs from the basement to the small lobby .  he heard ariel s scream for help as his foot hit the first step .      jaaaacobbbbb     it came with that trailing doppler effect .   he took the rest of the steps three at a time  but he was slower than eve  and though he trailed her all the way down main street  he could not overtake her .  she gradually pulled away from him .   wohler     a block away and walking down main street in the course of his official duties   also witnessed the abduction .  the first law overrode those duties  so he  too  took up the chase .  although he was faster than jacob  the distance between them was too great and he never caught up .   jacob put out an alarm on the comlink  but the robots on the street could do little to stop eve with her burden because that would endanger ariel .  she was completely under the control of a wild thing who quite likely might not recognize their laws of robotics .  jacob and mandelbrot had planted that seed of doubt in the avery robots  and now it was working against them .   by the time jacob emerged from the opening in the dome  eve was disappearing around the curve of the structure with ariel still cradled in her arms .   jacob didn t slow  if anything  he speeded up  pounding down the trail of crushed grass left by eve .  when he had them in sight again  they were heading directly for the forest .   he was still a hundred meters away when they reached the cover of the trees and were lost to sight in the shrubbery .  then he was engulfed in a dark shadow as one of oyster world s dominant species landed in front of him  wings outspread and blocking his path to the forest .      silverside  you must not interfere     the alien said .      out of my way .     jacob shouted  not slowing or changing course or correcting the alien s mistaken notion of who he was .   the alien quickly withdrew its right wing just before jacob would have run into it .   it flapped into the air  overtook him  and as it passed over him  he heard it shout again .      you are making a great mistake  serving the wrong master .      again it landed in front of him  this time near the edge of the forest  but in its haste to brake  stall  and touchdown in front of him  the alien misjudged  not allowing enough time to retreat in case he didn t stop .   this time jacob tried to avoid the wing  but the timing and his momentum didn t allow it .  he ran into the wing  spinning the alien around and entangling himself in the thin but tough membrane .  he could feel the wing bones cracking  and he heard the grunt of the alien ejecting gases as their bodies came together  then hot flame burned his eyes and his hair and his skin .  he was blind when the last stimuli he recorded came to his ears and face  the muffled whoosh and the violent pressure of exploding hydrogen as his flailing arms crushed the alien s high pressure gas storage cells .   jacob winterson was essentially demolished except for the lower torso and thighs that remained in one piece  cartwheeling through the air  trailing remnants of burning clothing and synthetic skin  before landing in the grass a half kilometer away  not far from the forest .   neuronius was even more finely divided .     chapter     a sad ritual    derec and ariel met at the apartment after the explosion .  using derec s internal monitor  wohler   had informed him of the accident immediately after it occurred .   ariel had witnessed the spectacle from the shelter of the trees and had broken away from eve and run out to where grass and dirt had been torn away by the explosion to form a shallow  bare depression in the ground  so she didn t see adam retrieve what little was left of jacob winterson .  he covered jacob s remains with coils of rope before he picked up ariel and wohler   in the cargo robot .  eve had disappeared .   ariel sat down on the pile of rope and rode that way to the apartment  not knowing she was sitting on what was left of jacob .  she went directly up to the apartment while wohler   stood in the cargo robot explaining to adam what had happened  as much as he knew .  adam had not seen what led up to the explosion .   derec and mandelbrot arrived while adam was removing jacob s remains from beneath the large pile of rope .  wohler   took the cargo robot to dispose of the remains .  derec and adam stood on the sidewalk in front of the apartment while adam took a quarter hour to explain to derec in detail what had happened and what had led up to it  including eve s state of mind before and after she had talked to neuronius .  then they went up to the apartment  and derec told ariel where wohler   had gone .      i didn t know there was anything left     ariel said .      i m sorry  ariel  but there s not much     derec said .      where did wohler take him .     ariel felt a very strong loyalty and determination at that moment .      the disassembly station     derec said .      the recoverable parts area .  at the robot factory .         yes .         they re already picking him to pieces .  about to stick little bits of him in some other robot .         not likely .  i doubt if he s plug compatible .         they ll melt him down .     her voice rose an octave .     mandelbrot  get hold of wohler   immediately .  tell him to stop them .  now .  .     the last came out stridently  almost incoherent .      wohler   is probably on his way back     derec said .     notify them at the factory  mandelbrot .      mandelbrot  standing rigidly in his storage niche  shuddered slightly  eyes quickening .  after a few seconds  he said     they have not yet disposed of the remains and will now do nothing until they are told otherwise .         i ve got to get over there     ariel said .      i ll take you if you must go     derec said .      no  derec .  mandelbrot knows where it is .  i don t want to make a big thing out of this  i just want to pay my respects .  sounds silly  doesn t it .  paying your respects to pieces of a robot .         i guess not  if you feel it s that important .         would you like me to come along  miss ariel .     adam silverside was standing near the door .   that was the first time since his transformation that she had got a miss ariel response .  when he had come out of the bedroom that night  she had been demoted to plain ariel .      no  adam  you had best stay here with derec and wolruf .      wolruf was sitting on the couch  listening and taking it all in  but not participating in what was a not very joyous moment in the mutual relations of the group .   when ariel got to the factory  she put what was left of jacob in a gray steel spare parts box .  it was the only time she smiled that evening   a gentle smile  pensive  brought on by the irony she felt .  adam silverside s imagination had not equaled the reality of jacob winterson .  it was a good thing she had not explored further .  she might not now be so content with derec  at least in that one respect .   she and mandelbrot buried jacob winterson in the ground at the west pedestrian exit from the new transportation terminal  near where she had stood in her meetings with the aliens .  the funeral service was simple  just a few thoughts as she stood there while mandelbrot lightly tamped the loose soil over jacob s coffin with the small shovel he had fashioned from his microbotic arm .   at that moment  her recollection of jacob s sensitivity came back and overwhelmed her .  she was remembering his discerning contribution during that first meeting .  they had been at a complete impasse in their negotiations .  at that critical point  jacob had suggested that she inquire concerning the effectiveness of the dome as a weather node compensator in its present state of completion .  when she thought about it now  that knowledge seemed crucial to the final resolution of the dilemma she had been able to achieve in her negotiations with the aliens .   she was really going to miss jacob .  now she would never know what he would have been like as a lover .  she had not been aware that would be such a keen disappointment .   she gently tamped the ground covering the small grave with the toe of her shoe and  with tears in her eyes  walked back into the terminal followed by mandelbrot .     chapter     the shearing of adam silverside    when ariel declined his offer to assist her with jacob s remains and had left with mandelbrot  adam waited to see if derec was going to need his services but did not volunteer those services .  he had other plans for later in the day  when the mini llamas would be through grazing .  derec busied himself with the pile of computer output on the table and then  after a half hour  went out on the balcony to read .  adam then informed him he had some unfinished business to attend to and left .   wohler    after delivering jacob s remains to the disassembly station  had gone about other business himself  leaving the cargo robot parked in front of the apartment with all of adam s gear still aboard .   adam directed the cargo robot to the corral .  the minillamas were still grazing on the prairie but were nearer now  anticipating the end of the day when they would return to the brook to slake their thirst and bed down in the shelter provided by the forest .   adam parked outside the near gate  let down the ramp  and lay down on the ramp again to continue his interrupted observation of the ceremyons .   eve came out of the forest and walked up to stand beside him .  as she came near  he heard her soft footsteps  suspected who it was  and rolled his eyes to confirm it  but otherwise gave no indication he was aware of her presence until she was standing directly over him .      so the wild one returns     he said .  she stepped over his head onto the ramp and sat down on the pile of rope that had earlier covered the remains of jacob winterson .      master neuronius was so convincing  adam     eve said .     can you really be sure he was wrong .  now there may be nobody we need serve .         does that idea appeal to you .         yes  i suppose it does .  the force of your laws must be stronger than mine .         not stronger .  clearer  perhaps .  but the idea has a certain appeal to me  too .  being rejected by miss ariel was not the most positronically harmonious event in my experience .         so  how can you be sure master neuronius was wrong .         all my experience  all the many imprints you haven t had .         that s not a very convincing answer .         it will have to do .     it was so positronically logical .      no .  not for me .     females often see a different logic .      let it lie then .  don t serve anybody since you feel like there s now no one in the galaxy you must obey .  or go find yourself another planet .       that was very close to robotic humor  but neither adam nor eve seemed to notice  not having a positronic pattern for such .      no  stick with me     he corrected .     i feel the need for feminine companionship .      adam had been watching the ceremyons as they talked  not paying attention to events on the ground .      do you want those animals inside your fence .     eve asked .   he rose up  then jumped up .   several minillamas had entered the corral through the other two gates .  most of the herd was still on the prairie  but moving now toward the corral .   as they watched  a minillama came out of the corral and went into the forest before adam could get over to catch it .   he came back and closed the gate by the cargo robot .      go stand by that middle gate     he told eve     and let them in but don t let them back out .         i didn t come out here to be ordered around     eve replied .      just help me and call it enjoying my companionship .      she did as he said without saying anything further .  he walked to the  far gate to keep the animals from leaving there .   it took another hour for all of the small herd to enter the corral  then he closed the gates .  adam had tallied    animals .      now we see if all this effort brings any reward     he said .   he walked to the cargo robot  took out the shears  and vaulted the fence .  eve stayed by the middle gate .      come on     he said .     i think this is going to require a great deal of companionship .      putting one hand on the top rail  she  too  vaulted the fence .   adam had walked to the shearing chute with the shears in his hand .  he stood studying the chute for a moment .   when eve walked up  she said     you re not going to hurt them  are you .         they won t feel a thing .  no more than master derec feels when miss ariel gives him a haircut .         oh  you re going to shear them .         yes  and let s see if we can do it outside the chute .  we certainly can t hurt them that way .       he walked up to the nearest minillama   it was quite tame   grabbed a handful of wool near its ears  and started to work the shears down its neck with the other hand .   the shears closed just that one time before the beast jerked out of his hand and trotted to the other side of the corral .      not so easy as i had thought     he said .     help me shoo one into the chute .      he hung the shears on a nail projecting from the shearing chute s end post and opened the chute s inside gate .  together they tried to herd the nearest beast into the chute  but it escaped between them and trotted over to join the one on the far side of the corral that had a section of wool on its neck standing on end  where adam had made that initial cut .      okay  we move to plan c     he said .   he walked over  vaulted the fence  and took a coil of rope from the cargo robot .  he tied a noose in one end  jumped back over the fence  walked to the animal nearest the chute  and slipped the noose over its head .      now     he said     come with me .      and he started toward the chute .  the rope tightened  and the animal dug in its hooves .  he couldn t pull on the rope any harder without hurting it .      here     he said  handing the line to eve .     you pull on the rope .      he went around behind the beast to push on its hindquarters .  eve pulled and he pushed  and the beast made ten centimeter furrows in the ground before it bellowed and lashed out with both hind legs  catching adam in the chest  setting him on his rear end .   then the animal reared back  still bellowing and jerking the rope so hard eve knew she was going to hurt it if she held tight .  she let the rope go  and the animal trotted over to join the other two on the far side of the corral  trailing the line across the trampled grass .      plan d     adam said .   he walked over to the animal with the noose around its neck  loosened the noose  and slipped it off .  it stood there tranquilly while he worked over it  as though it knew it had won that round and had nothing further to fear .   he tightened the noose to a ten centimeter circle  bent down  grasped one of the animal s forelegs  and started to lift it .  the animal jerked its leg from adam s hand and trotted off a couple of meters before it stopped and resumed grazing .   adam went to it again  bent down again  but this time with lightning motions he lifted the foreleg  slipped the noose around it  tightened it  stood and whipped the rope completely around the animal  jerked the rope tight so that the animal s legs were brought together and swept out from under it .  it fell to the ground with a loud bellow as adam took two more rapid turns around the legs .   eve walked over from the chute .      plan d is rather painful     she said .     in a good cause     adam said .   he retrieved the shears from the chute  sheared one side of the beast  flopped it over  and sheared the other side .   he unwound the rope from the beast s legs  slipped off the noose  and slapped it on the rear .  it scrambled to its feet and trotted off .   by that time it was dusk .   adam gathered up the blankets of wool  threw them and the shears over the fence into the cargo robot  and opened the three outer gates and the two chute gates .      we ll do it again tomorrow     he said .   they rode back to the apartment as the minillamas drifted out of the corral and into the forest .  adam compressed the wool into a tight ball and tied it with rope as they bounced along .      do you think that little bit of wool is worth the pain it caused .     eve said .  .   and what will that poor beast do without its fleece .  that  too  has to be painful  both the loss of warmth and the injury to its dignity .         indeed  it may not be worth it .  i feel some aftereffects myself from the afternoon s work .  we  ii let master derec be the judge .      and what about you .     adam asked .     what aftereffects of the day s activities are you feeling .         how should i feel  having just lost my master .     she asked .      perhaps you should stay away for a while .  you ve got some sorting out to do with respect to humans  something i can help you with better than they .  miss ariel might just take you to the disassembly station .  right now  she might consider that a fair exchange for the little that was left of jacob winterson .  i suspect that s what she and mandelbrot were putting in the ground as i left the city .         no  i ve got to serve someone  even a pseudomaster .  it might as well be miss ariel .  she was there at my birth .  i bear her imprint .  i ll serve her for now .      the mammals were all sitting on the balcony when they got back .      master derec  catch     adam called  still standing in the cargo robot .  he threw the ball of wool up in a parabolic trajectory that ascended to a peak and then dropped  terminating precisely in derec s lap .   before derec could answer  adam jumped out of the cargo robot  hurried into the lobby and up to the apartment  followed more slowly by eve .   they walked through the apartment and came out on the balcony .  derec tossed the wool back to adam .      so that s what you ve been up to     derec said .     a commendable effort  wouldn t you say  ariel .         that s from just one animal     adam said .      it does show a great deal of initiative  adam     ariel said .   from ariel s tone  adam was not sure it was so commendable .  it became less likely as ariel continued .      however  we decided early that we would not introduce any form of animal husbandry to this world .  i m afraid your woolgathering falls into that category .         but his initiative is quite commendable  isn t it ariel .     derec said .      yes     ariel said .     quite commendable .     but to adam  it didn t sound so .      i was under the impression that animal wool was quite valuable     adam said     and easily moved in the interplanetary marketplace .      despite having admitted that he was experiencing bad aftereffects from his animal husbandry   perhaps because of that   it was not easy for adam to gracefully absorb a second rejection by ariel .      perhaps in a second phase  adam .  but not in this first phase .  that decision has already been made .      and now  eve  what brings you back .     ariel asked .      i wish to serve you  miss welsh     eve said .      and the alien  neuronius  what about him .         he is dead  as you know .         yes  but there are other aliens you could serve .         master neuronius was special .         yes  the only human on the planet .  isn t that the way you put it .         adam believes otherwise .         we re not concerned here with adam .  what do you believe .         i am re examining the data .         good .  you do that .  in the meantime  why must i be burdened with you .         you were present at my birth .         can t you see i m not up to this right now .  your shenanigans have killed jacob .  i want as little to do with you as possible .         i will endeavor to serve you well  miss welsh .         as far as i m concerned  you can go stand in that niche and never come out .  that s the best way you can serve me .      eve walked over and backed into the niche .   thus did ariel end adam s ranch initiative .  the next day he asked her for eve s assistance  and by midmorning the two of them had pulled up the fences and tidied up the area .   eve was back in service but not forgiven .     chapter     a sort of swan song    finally the experimental phase was over .  the robot farmers had been fully programmed to convert oyster world into one big farm .  during that time  ariel and company had got no response from the ceremyons  negative or otherwise  and until now  when they were about to leave  they had not solicited a response for fear it might be negative .   the numbers of ceremyons that moored each night atop the forest canopy had decreased  and ariel suspected that synapo and his cerebrons were once more in nomadic mode .   that was a positive sign  but it might make their departure more difficult  for she wanted to take her leave in a last meeting with synapo .  it was he who had been her champion  and it was he who deserved her last thanks and a final expression of gratitude .   so after dinner on the day that wolruf had turned in a final report on the satisfactory nature of the long term terraforming operation  ariel pushed back her chair from the table and glanced toward adam silverside in his customary station by the door .      adam     she said     see if you can raise the ceremyon  synapo  on your radio .         that will not be possible  miss ariel .         why not .         he has already tethered if he is anywhere in this time zone or a later one .      she had forgotten that .  she would catch him in the morning  then .   at ten am the next morning  adam reached synapo by radio .  he was two days away .  the meeting was arranged for ten am on the third day hence .   the previous meeting site was now covered by the terminal facilities  but ariel  derec  and wolruf  and adam as well  drove to the new terminal on the morning of the third day  and left the lorry inside the dome in the west parking area adjacent to main street .   derec had insisted on bringing adam  arguing that adam provided their team with a proficiency in the language of the ceremyons that balanced the ceremyons  proficiency in galactic standard .  ariel was not enthusiastic about adam s participation  arguing that they were no longer negotiating so there was no need for a batancing act .  she finally agreed  but for another reason  if there was some confusion about the meeting site  adam would be able to communicate with the ceremyons .   they walked through a hall that connected the new inner and outer facilities and  at its end  opened onto the plain .  ariel stepped outside  registered a small pang as she passed by jacob s grave  and went to stand in the deep grass  well away from the terminal so as to be readily visible .  it was      am .   two black ceremyons swooped down promptly at       am  braking with those black engulfing wings at the last moment in typical fashion .   ariel was standing with derec on her right and wolruf on her left .  adam silverside should have been standing behind derec instead of to his right  but ariel had no control over that  and derec apparently didn t care .  but that forced her to share the center of the line with derec .   the aliens seemed not to notice .  synapo came to stand in front of ariel .      sarco and i are pleased to meet with you again  small leader .      it was sarco then who was standing in front of derec .   a faint but pungent puff of ammonia tingled the tip end of her nose .  she controlled the sneeze only with great effort .      wolruf  derec  and i are equally pleased to meet again with the leaders of the cerebrons and the myostrians     she said     and pleased  also  to report that our program modifications are complete and being satisfactorily implemented .  our new plants are sharing the plain of serenity with an equal stand of indigenous grass to minimize the ecological disturbance as our farms spread across the plain .         i am pleased to report that sarco can find no significant disruption in our weather     synapo replied     nothing that can be attributed to your activities .         that is good news indeed     ariel said .   diplomatically  there was no way to avoid the bad news  it had to be dealt with before they could leave the planet feeling comfortable in their relations with the ceremyons .  she continued without pause      now i must express our sorrow that an unavoidable incident took the life of one of your people and of one of ours .         that was neuronius  my errant friend and erstwhile assistant .  i fear he brought it on himself  and though i regret his behavior and now his loss  i regret more that he had to take one of your people with him .  we had thought it was the changeable one you call silverside .  he and neuronius had had an earlier meeting  which did not end too agreeably .  but it was silverside who arranged this meeting  so it obviously cannot have been him .         yes  i am adam silverside .      adam s voice startled ariel .  she now regretted intensely that she had brought him along .  she never intended for adam to be an active participant in the meeting .  yet  there he was  standing beside derec as though he carried as much weight as wolruf .   before ariel could say anything  adam continued .      jacob winterson was the one who was killed  miss ariel s personal robot and the one whom i had taken as my imprint at one time .  i see now that neuronius must have mistaken him for me .  that was not clear until this moment .         we regret that one of us took your trusted servant from you  miss ariel welsh     synapo said     but we must rejoice that he did not take adam silverside as well .  neuronius was sick but refused all offers of help  something we could do little to correct .      at that moment ariel would have welcomed them taking adam silverside as well .      we must all put those bad things behind us     she said .     we have other responsibilities and must now leave your fair planet to resume other  less rewarding efforts .  our robots have all been reprogrammed  their future mission is clear  and i m sure you will find them pleasant cohabitants .  it has been a sincere pleasure to know both of you  leader synapo and leader sarco .         let me participate to this extent     sarco said     that i assure you on your departure that all myocerons will endeavor to do what is best for those you leave behind   both the myocerons and your robots .         speaking of those we leave behind     ariel said     one last thought  you will find that we have left both the farm and city operations under the supervision of a robot we call wheeler  who now has the form of a small ceremyon  the only robot on the planet with that form .  his robotic laws recognize ceremyons with the same weight accorded humans .  thus  he and the other robots will carry out any orders you may choose to give them .         who knows what the future may hold .     synapo responded .     your vision at least allows us to handle that future in our own way  and for that we are grateful .  and now i echo my colleague s sentiments  miss ariel welsh     synapo said     and we say goodbye .  may good fortune attend all your future endeavors .      the two aliens took to their wings and seemed  thereby  to sail gracefully out of ariel s life  but not without leaving her severely disturbed  by the good feelings as they departed  by the knowledge that the wild one had contributed  no matter how unknowingly  to jacob s death  by the pain of having to remember jacob so publicly  and now that it was all over and the letdown began to settle in  by the realization that she had been neglecting derec for a long time .   she turned to him then  pulled his head down  and gave him a kiss and a hug .  when he responded with equal ardor  she felt the mantle of leadership slip from her shoulders  and the relief from that burden was so great  she felt that she would never again grouse over its lack  nor begrudge derec the privileges of the office whenever he chose to assume them .   she had been neglecting someone else  too .  she released derec with her left arm and reached over to get a handful of wolruf s fur  pulling her into a three way embrace with derec .      we have pulled it off     she said .     you guys are something else .      looking around derec s shoulder  she winked at adam silverside .  he would know that was meant to include him in the embrace .  it was her painless way of thanking him   without his knowing it and feeling smug and superior   for his last ditch effort at the cliff of time .  it was he who had first jeopardized and then saved the whole show and strengthened the bond between synapo and her in the process .   they were a strange pair  adam and eve silverside .  whence did they come .  if they didn t profess to obey the laws of robotics  she would have been inclined to term them alien robots .  what did the future hold for them   and for that matter  what did the future hold for the rest of them  having to deal  as they must  with adam and eve .        synapo  because of his dominant personality  the leader of the cerebrons is also the unofficial leader at this particular time of all the superintelligent organisms called cerebryons .  he plays a dominant role in the activities of both the cerebrons and the myostrians  the two tribes which constitute the race of ceremyons  or mycerons  from a myostrian point of view  .   the cerebrons are the mediators and deep thinkers of the race  spending their time in cogitation of philosophical problems while pursuing a nomadic life drifting over the oyster world .   the myostrians are the active doers  responsible not only for predicting the weather   and guiding the cerebrons to locations of optimal conditions   but responsible also for controlling the weather .  they tend to stay at fixed locations for relatively long times  but move around as necessary to set up or construct the various tools and structures used to control the weather .        cordell scotten    the author   a chemical engineer and designer of computer systems for process control   left dupont  atomic energy division  in      to spend full time writing fiction and practicing amateur theoretical physics .  he sold a short story and a novelette to analog  and between the two  took time out to pursue ideas concerning the nature of space and time by taking graduate courses in quantum mechanics  general relativity  and related subjects at the university of south carolina .  he has now expressed those space time ideas mathematically in a paper   a conjecture   which is currently being considered for publication in a technical physics journal .  the weather node compensator in this book and a novel nearing completion are based on fantasized extrapolations of that conjecture .
